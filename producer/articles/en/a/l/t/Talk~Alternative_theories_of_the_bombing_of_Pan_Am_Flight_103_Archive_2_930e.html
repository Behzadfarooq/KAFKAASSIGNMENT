<li>Here <i>iDAG</i> maps out the last 24 hours in the life of Bernt Carlsson.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>BERNT CARLSSON IN A SECRET MEETING WITH "PRESSURISER" FROM THE DIAMOND CARTEL</i></p>
<p>The memorial service in the Folkets Hus in Stockholm on January 11, 1989 for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernt_Carlsson_0429.html" title="Bernt Carlsson">Bernt Carlsson</a> gathered most of our Heads of Government, representatives of the Namibia independence movement <a href="../../../s/w/a/SWAPO_b7bb.html" title="SWAPO">SWAPO</a> and Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the UN Secretary General. When he died in the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_91ad.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am bombing</a>, Bernt Carlsson was less than 24 hours away from the fulfilment of his dreams - the signing of the Namibia agreement in New York which would finally pave the way to a free and independent <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namibia.html" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>. This was supposed to be the climax of his career with the UN, a career that began in December 1986 when he was appointed Commissioner for Namibia.</p>
<p>Bernt Carlsson had great support from SWAPO but much less so from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> because of that country's substantial economic interests in Namibia: an interest in <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> but above all in <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamonds</a>. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar in his speech at the memorial ceremony on a cold day in January last year described the last 24 hours in the life of Bernt Carlsson:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Bernt Carlsson was returning to New York following an official visit to Brussels where he had spoken to a Committee within the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_a87a.html" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> about the Namibia agreement," Pérez de Cuéllar began. "He stopped briefly in London to honour a long-standing invitation by a non-governmental organization with interests in Namibia."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pérez de Cuéllar was wrong. True, Bernt Carlsson's trip to Brussels had been planned almost six months earlier. But his decision to return to New York via London was only made on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. The meeting in London was definitely not a long-standing invitation by Namibia sympathisers.</p>
<p><i>A DIAMOND GIANT</i></p>
<p>This was about a secret meeting with a "pressuriser" from <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Beers_3b1c.html" title="De Beers">De Beers</a>, the giant diamond company. This company in turn owns Consolidated Diamond Mines (CDM), the world's largest producer of diamonds which have been produced for more than 60 years in Namibia. It goes without saying that Bernt Carlsson in his capacity of Commissioner for Namibia had contacts with representatives of a great number of countries and political organizations as part of his job.</p>
<p><i>FORCED TO TRAVEL</i></p>
<p>But why a secret meeting with the diamond cartel in London? A meeting which to all intents and purposes he did not want to have but was forced to. On around December 8 or 9, Carlsson receives a telephone call from the "pressuriser" at his United Nations office in New York. The telephone call is from London. We do not know what the telephone call was about. However, Bernt Carlsson is unsure. He does not know whether to act or not. As if going might put him in a compromising position. On the morning of December 16, the day on which the travel arrangements are changed, Bernt Carlsson meets up with an old friend who has come to see him. He is Weine Karlsson, head of department at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm_University_9e9c.html" title="Stockholm University">Stockholm University</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In the early morning we sat talking in Bernt's office," he explains. "But after only a few minutes he became uneasy and asked me to go and wait in another room of the office. He had something urgent to deal with. It is possible that it had something to do with the trip. He said that 'important business needs to be done'. He was away for about half an hour."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>POLISHED GANGSTERS</i></p>
<p>Weine Karlsson continues his story:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"We all know that Bernt was very unobtrusive. Shy almost. Only, now and again he exploded. As when suddenly he said to me, 'You've got no idea what polished gangsters (<a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_ad90.html" title="South African">South Africans</a>) we are dealing with here'."</dd>
</dl>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">December 19</a>, Bernt leaves New York for Brussels to make his speech in the European Parliament the next day. The visit was arranged by David Lowe, now with the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_International_2aa7.html" title="Socialist International">Socialist International</a>. Right up to this interview, he has felt 'guilt-ridden' and convinced that it was he who 'enticed' Carlsson to go to Europe and therefore is 'indirectly responsible for his death on the plane'. But when Lowe learns about the secret meeting in London, he is calm again.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He made his speech on December 20, before the Development Committee in Brussels," Lowe says. "After the meeting we went to a restaurant for lunch and discussions with some other friends. Our discussions continued until about 3pm." David Lowe continues: "It was at this point that Bernt suddenly said that he had to check out as he had to meet 'some friends' in London. I thought to myself, Good Lord, he has all this going on in New York. He will be even more tired than he is already. I remember thinking he was mad and why not go directly to New York for the signing of the agreement? I gathered he would catch a flight from Brussels to London at about 5pm that evening."</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, Bernt Carlsson had 'lied' to his friend David Lowe. He stayed in Brussels that afternoon and only arrived in London the day after - on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>.</p>
<p><i>MYSTERIOUS PRESSURISER</i></p>
<p>When we telephoned his old colleagues at the Namibia office, not one of them wished to talk about the meeting with the mysterious 'pressuriser' from the diamond cartel:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"All I know is that Bernt Carlsson was travelling to London to meet representatives of an NGO (in this case organizations friendly towards Namibia)," says Malthi Ranin who was his secretary at the time.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>iDAG</i> has a copy of a private memorandum which says something completely different. This is a memorandum to Bernt Carlsson from his own office: "Mr Timothy says he will be waiting for you as soon as you get through the tunnel. Your meeting will finish in time for your next arrangement at 2pm. He will also provide a car to take you round."</p>
<p>'Mr Timothy'? His full name is <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankole_Timothy_40ff.html" title="Bankole Timothy">Bankole Timothy</a>. Not much known about him. Just another name working for the diamond cartel. But one who does know something about him is Randolph Vigne, secretary of the Namibia support committee:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Bankole Timothy worked for the PR department at De Beers for 15 to 20 years. I understand they pensioned him off but called him back when the independence of Namibia suddenly started accelerating. They probably felt they needed someone like him with contacts." Vigne continues:</dd>
<dd>"I don't think he works for them any more. I believe he had a temporary assignment which is now completed."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Was Bernt Carlsson that temporary assignment?</p>
<p><i>AGGRESSIVE DISCUSSIONS</i></p>
<p><i>iDAG</i> managed to track down Bankole Timothy. But the telephone conversation was brief. And aggressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Could you tell me what you and Bernt Carlsson talked about when you met in London on December 21, 1988?"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>He replied: "I am sorry. I am very, very sorry but I have nothing to say about it."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>You do not want.....(we are interrupted).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Do not disturb me any more. I am going out. I don't know how you got my number. I'm going out and you start asking questions about....."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>INTERRUPTED</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You met Bernt Carlsson on the morning of December 21 and.....(we are interrupted)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Don't disturb me anymore. What are you on about? (screams) I don't know who you are. And you want to interview me on the phone. I have no comments to make!"</dd>
</dl>
<p>At about 5.30pm on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> the telephone rings in the home of Pentti Väänäänen, then Secretary General of the Socialist International, and an old friend of Bernt:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It was Bernt calling from the airport just before he boarded <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_91ad.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am 103</a>," he says. "We exchanged Christmas greetings and talked a little about the Namibia agreement."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Did he tell you who he had seen in London?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"No".</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How would you describe his frame of mind?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"If you want me to tell you in just a few words, he sounded nervous," he replied.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>THE CLIMAX OF HIS LIFE</i></p>
<p>Nervous? Why? Bernt Carlsson was close to the climax of his life with the Namibia agreement the next day. He should have been happy and optimistic. But why nervous?</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Beware Christmas parcel bombs!</span></h3>
<p>The second <i>iDAG</i> article about <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernt_Carlsson_0429.html" title="Bernt Carlsson">Bernt Carlsson</a> was published on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>:</p>
<p><b>Kassaskåpet var tomt</b> (<i>THE SAFE WAS EMPTY</i>)</p>
<p><i>WHO BROKE THE SEAL TO BERNT CARLSSON'S APARTMENT?</i></p>
<p>When Bernt Carlsson's <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safe.html" title="Safe">safe</a> was opened six days after the Pan Am explosion, those present had a minor shock: the safe was empty! Despite the fact that the office had been sealed already on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, and his private apartment the day after, by the UN's own security staff. The opening was witnessed by, among others, Bernt Carlsson's girl friend <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanya_Popovic_923a.html" title="Sanya Popovic">Sanya Popovic</a>, his sister Inger Carlsson-Musser and Embassy Counsellor Stefan Noréen of the Swedish Delegation at the UN. In the days immediately before Bernt Carlsson made the trip to his secret meeting in London, which we wrote about yesterday, he was very uneasy. According to Sanya Popovic:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"December was like clouded in a nightmare. He became increasingly nervous. He said that if I received a parcel I was not to open it under any circumstances. This was on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>. He said that people usually start getting parcels at this time, it being Christmas. But unless I knew who sent it, I was not to open it."</dd>
</dl>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a> - the day after the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockerbie_bombing.html" title="Lockerbie bombing">Pan Am bombing</a> - Bernt Carlsson's apartment was sealed off.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The lock was changed," says Sanya Popovic. "I was given one key, and the UN security department had another. I was told that sealing off everything could take a long time pending the analysis. I therefore ensured that all windows were properly locked, all lights switched off, etc. A few days later, however, a friend and I passed by the apartment in a taxi. The apartment is easy to recognize from the outside: front view, third floor and five windows. My friend pointed out that the lights were on. So I got out and walked back. I found that some lights were switched on but there was no-one there." Sanya Popovic continues: "If there was anything of interest in the apartment, someone else got to it first."</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the evening of the disaster, the Swedish foreign minister, Sten Andersson, telephoned Bernt Carlsson's sister Inger Carlsson-Musser, who had lived in the US for almost 20 years, to give his commiserations. On December 28, 1988 Inger Carlsson-Musser travelled to New York to go through Bernt Carlsson's belongings in his UN office. This was the office which had been sealed off since the day of the accident. She asked Sanya Popovic and the Embassy Counsellor Stefan Noréen to help.</p>
<ul>
<li>We understand that his safe was empty. What can you say about that?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Yes, it was empty," says Sanya Popovic. "And this was very unlike Bernt who was very security-conscious and kept all his documents under lock and key. But above all the office was sealed off. No-one should have been able to get in."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>REFUSAL TO COMMENT</i></p>
<p>Embassy Counsellor Stefan Noréen:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I was assisting Inger Carlsson-Musser in taking charge of her brother's personal belongings in the office. Nothing else happened there."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Can you confirm that the safe was empty when it was opened?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I refuse to comment," Noréen replied.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is it true or not?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I refuse to comment. I was there. But I do not want to talk about what exactly happened. If anyone should comment surely they should be Bernt Carlsson's family."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>iDAG</i> tried to contact Inger Carlsson-Musser, but without success. We would have asked her about the empty safe. Also, to explain information from foreign investigative journalists who claimed that foreign minister, Sten Andersson, had asked her to keep an eye out for a specific document which was supposed to be held in the safe.</p>
<p><i>THE WANTED DOCUMENT</i></p>
<p>We have not obtained any comments from Sten Andersson either. We did, however, speak to his private secretary, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Schori_9ceb.html" title="Pierre Schori">Pierre Schori</a>, who used to be a close friend of Bernt Carlsson.</p>
<ul>
<li>During a secret meeting in London, Bernt Carlsson met a person called Bankole Timothy. Do you know him?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"No, I know of no-one of that name."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>He represents the diamond cartel.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The diamond cartel," queries Pierre Schori, almost laughing. "I know nothing about that."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We know that Sten Andersson telephoned Bernt's sister Inger Carlsson-Musser in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Naturally."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We are informed by foreign journalists that Sten Andersson was looking for some documents which Bernt's sister Inger was supposed to be able to help in finding, and which were kept in Bernt's safe.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"This is nonsense, as far as I'm concerned. What's this all about?"</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We understand that the safe was empty when it was opened.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I know nothing about that. I don't understand a word. All I can say is that it is nonsense to claim that Sten Andersson should have done this or that."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Sten Andersson is difficult to get hold of. Perhaps we should ask him?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I know this is all nonsense. I think you're on the wrong track," Schori replied.</dd>

<p>On December 22, the day after the Pan Am bombing, it was announced by CDM, wholly-owned by <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Beers_3b1c.html" title="De Beers">De Beers</a>, that $36m is being invested in new diamond production in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namibia.html" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>. This will be done in Auchas, 45km from <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oranjemund.html" title="Oranjemund">Oranjemund</a>. It is estimated that the annual yield of diamonds over a ten-year period will amount to roughly the equivalent of 50 million Swedish Krona (SEK).</p>
<p>The announcement is mentioned in a 'country report' about Namibia which was issued last year [1989] and published by the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economist_Intelligence_Unit_95ed.html" title="Economist Intelligence Unit">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>. The report says, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html" title="List of Latin phrases"><i>inter alia</i></a>: "The company made their announcement on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, which was also the date that the Namibia agreement was signed. This is brushed aside as pure coincidence by De Beers representatives in London."</p>
<p><i>CRITICISM BY CARLSSON</i></p>
<p>Bernt Carlsson, as the intended UN Commissioner for Namibia, rarely spoke about the enormous diamond assets in the country and the multi-national companies exploiting the finds. There is, however, one exception. He was interviewed for a British TV documentary entitled <i>The disappearing diamonds</i> by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada_Television_60a4.html" title="Granada Television">Granada</a> which was broadcast early in December 1988. In the program, Bernt Carlsson speaks about the ruthless exploitation taking place in the diamond business:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The business has tried to pick the raisin from the cake. This means that they have been after the large diamonds instead of calm but constant development. The way they are doing it will endanger the survival of the mines."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>HUNGRY FOR PROFIT</i></p>
<p>Carlsson continues:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"One would expect from a worldwide organization like De Beers to behave in a socially and financially responsible manner. However, as far as Namibia is concerned, they have only been interested in the maximum profit without regard to social, economic-political or even legal considerations."</dd>
</dl>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">March 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> De Beers announced yet another diamond find in Namibia. This time it is a mine in Elizabeth Bay from which over the next ten years SEK300m-worth of diamonds are expected to be dug up. this particular find appears to delight the mysterious <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankole_Timothy_40ff.html" title="Bankole Timothy">Bankole Timothy</a> and, unusually, he himself issues the press release to the surprised public.</p>

<p>This is the third and final part of Sweden's <i>iDAG</i> newspaper reportage by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan-Olof_Bengtsson_5b0f.html" title="Jan-Olof Bengtsson">Jan-Olof Bengtsson</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">March 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>.</p>
<p><b>Han tog Svaren på Frågorna med Sig</b></p>
<p><i>HE TOOK THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WITH HIM</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I cannot say that I can explain why Bernt changed his travel arrangements. Bernt took the only explanation with him.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Her name is Meta Johansson, and she is a close friend of Bernt Carlsson for many years. A close friend who was always there but out of the limelight and away from all the scrutiny. <i>iDAG</i> spoke to her.</p>
<p>Bernt Carlsson in his many years as an international worker for solidarity experienced a great deal of misery, a lot of drama and many weird and wonderful cases. But he carried on regardless and worked for what he believed in. In a discreet, almost shy, manner. Always determinedly and in a very competent way.</p>
<p><i>WITNESS TO MURDER</i></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">April 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Bernt Carlsson who was Secretary-General of the Socialist International (SI) at the time, was an eye witness to the fatal shooting of the moderate Palestinian <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issam_Sartawi_5928.html" title="Issam Sartawi">Issam Sartawi</a> in the lobby of Hotel Montochero in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albufeira.html" title="Albufeira">Albufeira</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. The terrorist, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Nidal_1481.html" title="Abu Nidal">Abu Nidal</a>, claimed responsibility for the killing. Because of his job as SI Secretary-General, his apartment in London at the time was subject to a number of break-ins while he was overseas.</p>
<p>These are some examples of the security measures taken by Bernt:</p>
<ul>
<li>When they opened Bernt's safe in his New York office, it was found to be empty.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Yes, so I heard," replies Meta Johansson.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Isn't that strange?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Yes, clearly this is very strange. But I do not know the rules of the game in cases such as this."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>NO THEORY</i></p>
<p>She continues:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I have helped his family go through all the papers and documents which we found in his apartment in the US. Neither the family nor I have found any papers linked to the accident."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any theory as to why the safe was empty?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I have no theory. Nor do I know who had access to the safe. Bernt's sister Inger does not know either."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Do you know anything about what Sten Andersson spoke to the sister, Inger Carlsson-Musser, about?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"No, as I was not there, I cannot know what he asked her to do. And I was not present when the safe was opened. So I'm sure you will understand that I cannot comment on this."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>SPECULATIONS</i></p>
<p>Meta Johansson continues:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"If I may say so without being misunderstood, I have had so many speculations in my head that I doubt if there can be any more. Some more constructive than others."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Bernt was very security-conscious, isn't that right?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Yes, very much so. But being security-conscious also meant that he carried important documents with him in his hand luggage. There were documents that he would want to take personal care of."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>But the safe was completely empty. Also of 'unimportant documents'?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"That is true."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>SECRET MEETING</i></p>
<ul>
<li>What do you know about Bankole Timothy, the person Bernt Carlsson met in secret in London?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I am very sorry, but I cannot help you with any information about that meeting."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Why is the subject so sensitive?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I don't think it's sensitive. I just feel the people involved with the matter should speak."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We understand that Bernt was not particularly interested in meeting this person. That he was afraid he might be discredited as a neutral UN official?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Obviously, with the kind of work Bernt was engaged in he would meet many people. And of course some people are more interesting to meet than others. But you are forced to. With Bernt, whatever he considered important to his work, he would go and do. Even if not every time he would jump with joy and shout hooray and think this was the best thing in the world. He was extremely dutiful."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Do you know anything about the position of Bankole Timothy?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I know who he is and what he is doing."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How would you describe it?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"No, I do not want to."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How would you explain why Bernt changed his travel arrangements at the 11th hour? His intermediate landing in London and this meeting before he returned to New York?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"I cannot say that I can explain the change in travel arrangements. Bernt took the only explanation with him. You can speak to a lot of people. But only a few are likely to know why Bernt changed his mind."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>MANY QUESTIONS</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>iDAG</i> does not wish to claim with these articles that Bernt Carlsson was the target of the bomb which blasted Pan Am 103 from the air and in which he was one of the 259 victims. We have no basis to make such a claim.</li>
<li>We have only wanted to point out what seems to be a number of curious circumstances and that maybe no-one will ever have the full answers to the questions.</li>
<li>What forced Bernt Carlsson to fly to the secret meeting in London and which was against his will?</li>
<li>Why does Bankole Timothy refuse to say what the meeting was about, but gets aggressive when he is asked?</li>
<li>Why was Bernt Carlsson's safe in New York empty when it was opened on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">December 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>?</li>
<li>The questions are many, but the answers are few.</li>
