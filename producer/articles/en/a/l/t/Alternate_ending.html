<p>In movies, alternate endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> release. These alternate endings are a special type of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deleted_scene.html" title="Deleted scene">deleted scene</a>. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The following are examples of known alternate endings to movies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2/8/_/28_Days_Later_cb93.html" title="28 Days Later">28 Days Later</a>: Several darker alternate endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of he film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Darkness_2eda.html" title="Army of Darkness">Army of Darkness</a>: In an alternate ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he accidentally drinks too much and wakes up in the future. In the new time it's a post-apocalyptic wasteland of a world and he screams "I slept too long!"</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Astronaut%27s_Wife_4119.html" title="The Astronaut's Wife">The Astronaut's Wife</a>: When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Butterfly_Effect_20ea.html" title="The Butterfly Effect">The Butterfly Effect</a>: Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbilical_cord.html" title="Umbilical cord">umbilical cord</a> and dies, <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stillborn.html" title="Stillborn">stillborn</a>. This is much darker than the true ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks..html" title="Clerks.">Clerks.</a>: Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Hard_with_a_Vengeance_088e.html" title="Die Hard with a Vengeance">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a>: In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. His career is in ruins and he is keen to take it out on Gruber whom he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/_/t/Dodgeball%7E_A_True_Underdog_Story_1eea.html" title="Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</a>: The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Destination_bfac.html" title="Final Destination">Final Destination</a>: Alex is killed when he grabs the downed telephone line to save Clear, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Clear is pregnant with Alex's baby.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Destination_3_d327.html" title="Final Destination 3">Final Destination 3</a>: The movie ends with the second train bearing down on the main character, instead of it being a vision.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Blood_254b.html" title="First Blood">First Blood</a>: In an alternate ending, Rambo doesn't want to be arrested so when he is speaking with Col. Samuel Trautman, he asks him to shoot him. The Colonel does so and leaves.</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/_/k/I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_edc1.html" title="I Know What You Did Last Summer">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>: In the alternate ending, Julie recieves an invite to a pool party and read an email that reads "I still Know". This scene was used in the trailer for <a href="../../../i/_/s/I_Still_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_6310.html" title="I Still Know What You Did Last Summer">I Still Know What You Did Last Summer</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_%281986_film%29_4c0d.html" title="Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)">Little Shop of Horrors</a>: In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be reshot so that their deaths were removed.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanic_%281997_film%29.html" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a>: Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.</li>

<p>In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2/4/_/24_%28TV_series%29_afb7.html" title="24 (TV series)">24 (TV series)</a>: To keep the ending to Season 1 a suprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Terry's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Terry live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Wing_c0d5.html" title="Green Wing">Green Wing</a>: In the final <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Wing_Special_5d02.html" title="Green Wing Special">Special</a>, Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_the_City_edf3.html" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a>: In the series finale three endings were shot, each with Carrie choosing a different man.</li>
