<p>I just put an NPOV template in the bottom section which seems pro-Republican and anti-Democrat.<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquad51_5223.html" title="User:Squad51">Squad51</a> 18:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just moved the template to the whole article; another sections seems to imply that it damages the economy, which I would tend to disagree with. This article is also too technical and needs some cleanup.<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquad51_5223.html" title="User:Squad51">Squad51</a> 18:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you specifically state what you think the problem is? On the section you just NPOVed.... the AMT hits medium to high income individuals and families with large income tax deductions. Because state income taxes are deductible from federal income taxes, the AMT has a tendency to hit individuals in high tax states, such as California, New York, New Jersey, etc... As it turns out, these states tend to be on the coast and generally vote for democrats. Maybe its a bit cynical, but Republicans, who are normally concerned with high taxes, have been less concerned with the AMT. Mgunn 18:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the harm from the AMT... Any tax causes distortion of economic activity, and economic theory says the harm increases with the square of the tax rate. Any non-Pigouvian tax is automatically harmful. The general policy question is whether the government spending is worth more the harm caused by the tax. That said the AMT has some structure that is considered less harmful than the standard tax system (it has fewer deductions) and some features that are considered more harmful (poor treatment of savings, rates might be excessively high). -- Mgunn 18:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So it seems the NPOV tag has been removed, but I'm certainly not satisfied, and I'm not sure why it's been removed. It's worth noting, for example, that criticisms abound, but nowhere in the article is a defense of the AMT presented -- and certainly this isn't because defenses of the policy don't exist. I'm putting the template back. Pstinchcombe 21:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the NPOV tag, I feel the article is nonbiased, perhaps the next time you put it back on, you should justify why, you feel its NPOV, the only defense of the policy is lost money to the government. --208.54.14.27 01:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Just a reader here ....</p>
<p>You write "The burden of computing AMT and the disallowance of deductions for state and local income taxes magnify criticisms of the AMT." and then only expand on the disallowance of deductions, not the burden of computing the AMT.</p>
<p>What's the cost in lost productivity, increased cost of prepared returns, trees wasted as paper? My own experience suggests it adds about 1/3 more pages and at least that much cost to my prepared returns.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

More and more individual taxpayers are falling into what is be called the "AMT" trap. For many taxpayers, the common question is, "How do I avoid AMT". So how do you avoid AMT, simple have less tax preference deductions on your Schedule A. The biggest tax preference item on your Scedule A is state income taxes and real estate taxes. In any given year, if your Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI) is greater than your Regular Taxable Income, you may want to push your last real estate tax payment and state estimated taxes into the upcoming year. If the upcoming year is projected to have more income than the current year you should do it since there would be no tax benefit in the current anyway.</p>

The following appears to be a collection of subordinate clauses and prepositional phrases: "For example, if an asset (stock or bond) holder would pay less taxes than they would lose in value if they were to hold a losing stock until you can balance the sale of the money losing stock with the sale of a money making stock during the same tax year. " I am unable to identify the subject and predicate here. "A verb, Senator Kennedy... We need a verb." - Gary Trudeau</p>

<p>134.173.152.125 just removed "Repealing the AMT would be decrease revenue more than repealing income tax itself." <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36988-2004Mar6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36988-2004Mar6.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> with a edit comment that, "mis-cites source, absurd conclusion." The Washington Post writes, "By 2008, it would cost the Treasury considerably less to repeal the ordinary income tax system than the alternative minimum tax, according to the Tax Policy Center, jointly run by the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute."

<dd>I was confused because of the wording. I read "income tax itself" as equaling non-AMT tax plus AMT tax, since AMT is a part of the total income tax revenue. With that interpretation of the wording, it doesn't make sense that repealing AMT (a part of income tax) would cost more than repealing the entire income tax system. I support the re-inclusion of the text so long as it is reworded to avoid ambiguity. Perhaps it could say something like "Repealing the AMT would decrease revenue more than repealing the ordinary (non-AMT) income tax system." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.173.152.125_7bc1.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.173.152.125">134.173.152.125</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/4/User_talk%7E134.173.152.125.html" title="User talk:134.173.152.125">talk</a>) 21:01, 2 April 2007 (UTC).</small>
