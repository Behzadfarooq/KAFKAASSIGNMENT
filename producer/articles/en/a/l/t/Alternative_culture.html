<p>The concept of alternative culture is rooted in the development of new views of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> during the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. This development, in conjunction with the emergence of the <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Boy_%28youth_culture%29_0417.html" title="Teddy Boy (youth culture)">teddy boy</a> and the release of the US films <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wild_One_09c1.html" title="The Wild One">The Wild One</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>) and <i><a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Without_a_Cause_0adf.html" title="Rebel Without a Cause">Rebel Without a Cause</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>), saw adolescents in North America and Western Europe collectively express a form of rebellion against the values of their parents and authority in general. The reasons for this rejection of traditional social codes and attitudes were usually personal, but were at the same time easier to define when asserted as part of a group.</p>
<p>The current understanding of alternative culture came about in the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, when strands of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_culture.html" title="Youth culture">youth culture</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_culture.html" title="Counter culture">counter culture</a>, and various aspects of <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_culture.html" title="Underground culture">underground culture</a> came together. It was also the start of a large <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_bias.html" title="Media bias">bias in the media</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, since the concept has usually referred to the lifestyles and activities of Caucasian males in occidental countries, usually just the US and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. The high-profile exceptions to this have been <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_culture.html" title="Hip hop culture">hip hop culture</a> and the <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot_grrrl.html" title="Riot grrrl">riot grrrl</a> movement. The recreational use of time by both non-Caucasians and females has been reported upon, but usually with disdain<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_culture.html" title="Edit section: The development and social dynamics of an alternative culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The development and social dynamics of an alternative culture</span></h2>
<p>Despite all their cultural differences, all alternative cultures follow a similar process of origination, development, and decline. Alternative cultures also share several common values.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A subculture is usually formed by young <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> people in a small region or a single city<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> in response to a generally felt lack of proper fulfilment by the options available to that particular social group. This disenchantment is in reference to a wide range of things, from acceptable codes of public behaviour to the likelihood of decent long-term employment. The result is a rapid evolution of an externally displayed attitude and an accompanying visual style (regarding art, dress, et cetera) and soundtrack. The factors that necessitate the creation of a subculture often forge the elements that make it unique and give it some form of cultural legacy in retrospect. For example, the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> movement of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> is remembered, although not exclusively, for its championing of the concept of "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_love.html" title="Free love">free love</a>", which was a fairly successful attempt to break away from the perceived social frigidity of the previous two decades. Hip hop culture allowed poor African-Americans to express themselves creatively when they had minimal access to musical instruments and very little chance of having their work displayed in art galleries. It meant that the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turntablism.html" title="Turntablism">turntable</a>, normally only used to play music produced by others, was used as an "instrument" in its own right and that public areas became substitute canvasses for a style of art known as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_style.html" title="Wild style">wild style</a>.</p>
<p>During the point that these subcultures enjoy their "peak", they are simultaneously the subject of much negative attention from the media. This is often due to objections to the subcultures' disregard for the legality of their activities, the physical appearance of their members, their anti-establishment and/or anti-consumerist values and their frequent indulgences in sex and drug use. (Not all these points apply to all subcultures, a good example being the fact that members of the "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_edge.html" title="Straight edge">straight edge</a>" <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a> scene were completely <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teetotal.html" title="Teetotal">teetotal</a>). However, it is this publicity which often drew more young people into each subculture, usually, but not always, because they were attracted by its apparent dissident nature.</p>
<p>There is often a period that is considered to be "pure" in terms of what defined each subculture in various ways. This is the point between the complete development of its unique characteristics - where it has an ideology, a style of dress, a new genre of music to call its own, et cetera - and the point where publicity has caused a large influx of new members into the community and various business interests have begun to co-opt its unique aspects. The <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge.html" title="Grunge">grunge</a> subculture (although according to its original members<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, it was not a culture as such, but rather a fan base for <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_rock.html" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a>) is a particularly interesting case, as its conception was to some extent deliberately self-conscious<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> of the factors that could skew its original intents. Grunge was a regional off-shoot of <a href="../../../d/i/y/DIY_culture_a2d7.html" title="DIY culture">DIY culture</a>, which focused more on its members being cynical "<a href="../../../s/l/a/Slacker.html" title="Slacker">slackers</a>": an outlook publicly exemplified best by the band <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur_Jr_a21d.html" title="Dinosaur Jr">Dinosaur Jr</a> - and, as the popular phrase was at the time, over-educated and under-paid. (A phrase which was, incidentally, lifted from <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Coupland_43b8.html" title="Douglas Coupland">Douglas Coupland</a>’s novel <i><a href="../../../t/a/l/Generation_X%7E_Tales_for_an_Accelerated_Culture_d717.html" title="Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture">Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>)). Although these were all myths that originated from the media, of which participants in the grunge scene treated with some suspicion. Still, in the wake of the massive success of the album <i><a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevermind.html" title="Nevermind">Nevermind</a></i> (also 1991) by <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>, the media and the marketing industry popularised and mass-marketed "grunge" clothes, music and such. However, the nature of the culture meant it resisted glamorisation and it was soon abandoned by the media, leaving the scene to wither as a result.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_culture.html" title="Edit section: The current state of alternative culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The current state of alternative culture</span></h2>
<p>Alternative culture has stalled somewhat since the mid 1990s.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The major factors behind this can be largely attributed to the prevalence of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogenization.html" title="Homogenization">homogenised</a> "top-down" culture, which is where young people tend to have taken to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumerism.html" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a> as a source of identity and recreational facilities. This runs counter to alternative cultures' tradition of innovation, geographical diversity and communal self-sufficiency. It has become regular practise to attribute this to the members of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Y_bc53.html" title="Generation Y">Generation Y</a> - (people born roughly between the mid <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and late 1990s) - having grown up with different values than those before them. For rather than a subculture being perceived as something that could be contributed to, it has become accepted by people of this generation that being part of an "alternative culture" is something which requires little beyond personal styling. On the other hand, people of this generation have, in some ways, broader tastes than their elders and thus they incorporate various elements that they like from a range of subcultures, while never claiming to be a member of any, or if they do, then they often lack the occasional narrow-minded preferences of the group's original members.</p>
<p>Due to subcultures of this nature being in a constant change, they often splinter off into niche groups. They often develop an "<a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_skool.html" title="Old skool">old skool</a>" crowd who tend to resist "polluting" elements and carry on as before until inevitably evolving themselves. Take the UK's <a href="../../../r/a/v/Rave_party.html" title="Rave party">rave</a> scene, which suffered very badly from tough legislation aimed at it in the mid 1990s, leading to its discrete continuance on a smaller scale, before manifesting itself again on the large scale in the form of the <a href="../../../t/e/k/Teknival.html" title="Teknival">teknival</a>, which retains many of the principles of the original <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_house_party.html" title="Acid house party">acid house</a> culture.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not alternative culture is truly alternative (and many claim that it is not), many subcultures that have been considered alternative were created as a response to perceived negative qualities in society. However, many subcultures have become heavily associated with products rather than ideals; for example, hippies stated a belief in the shedding of material possessions, but the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen.html" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> '<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_Type_2_686f.html" title="Volkswagen Type 2">Type 2</a>' van is inseparably associated with them.</p>

<p>South Africa has a long tradition of alternative culture. From the creole fusion experience of the 17th and 18th centuries, to recent experiments in alternative living. A cross-over fusion between white punks and black ethnics in the eighties produced an innovative local culture articulated by magazines such as Vula, music such as eVoid and Via Afrika, and clubs such as The Indaba Project and The Base. Alternative "<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaners.html" title="Afrikaners">Afrikaners</a>" existed in juxtaposition to the dominant mainstream polices of racial oppression, alongside anti-apartheid resistance to war by students and groups such as the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_Conscription_Campaign_aa61.html" title="End Conscription Campaign">End Conscription Campaign</a>.
