<p>Turtledove looks interesting (+wishlist), but it's not Alternate History, it's common SF placed in the future, while Alternate History may or may not be placed in the past. A key element of Alternate History is that only a small thing happens which changes everything. An alien invasion is not a small thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Very little of Turtledove's writing is set in the future. And AH does not depend on a "small thing" happening. It depends on a change on something historical happening. The size is inconsequential. An alien invasion occuring in 1941 <i>is</i> alternate history unless you have some proof that it did, in fact, happen.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Why must it be a small thing? "The Man In The High Castle" is premised on the Axis powers winning WWII, not a small thing but undeniably an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history_fiction.html" title="Alternate history fiction">Alternate history</a> novel</i> -- <a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">GWO</a></p>
<hr />
<p>"Undeniably"? Please.</p>
<p>For practical reasons: What other qualifier is there? Any SF story is Alternate History, I'd even say <i>any</i> story is alternate history.</p>
<p>The thing must only be small at the very beginning. There are several points in the history that could have changed the war's outcome. Just kill Hitler at age 25, as Yulsman did.</p>
<hr />
<p>Most SF stories take place in the future -alternate history have to involve a change in the known story we call history. Some may be set in the present or future but they must involve a change in the past. I agree that the "World war" books combine alternate history and standard scifi. Turtledove's Civil War books are better examples. -rmhermen</p>
<hr />
<p>There are lots of SF stories requiring change in <i>our</i> past, because they were written decades ago. Have they transmogrified into Alternate History?</p>
<p>The key feature of AH is IMHO that any random piece of trivia would modify our world. What if Helium would not be found in Kansas, but in Sachsen? Lots of Zeppelins in the air. What if some unknown Austrian artist died at age 25? No WWII. What if aliens invade the earth? An invaded earth.</p>
<p>Turtledove's WWII series looks interesting and has something AHish about it, it's only not a prime example, TMITHC is, and the Civil War series probably too.</p>
<hr />
<p>I cannot find details about J. C. Squire's collection. Someone? --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Now that I think of it, Darcy doesn't qualify. The stories are about crime and magic, not about alternate history. --Yooden</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not true. The Darcy stories are set in a world in which <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_I_of_England_89e8.html" title="Richard I of England">Richard I of England</a> lived to an old age, settled down, became an enlightened monarch, and led to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> turning into the Western Empire. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 22:33, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>All SF is not alternate history. Alternate history is based on known ahistorical events that took place in the past. Any number of SF stories put their change in the future.</p>
<p>The size of the event is irrelevant. Consider Harry Harrison's "Eden" novels. There the event is the lack of a 100 km diameter asteroid slamming into the Earth 65 million years ago. It doesn't get much bigger than that.</p>
<p>There's a decent discussion of what is/is not AH at <a href="http://www.uchronia.net/intro.html" class="external free" title="http://www.uchronia.net/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uchronia.net/intro.html</a> --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The asteroid was (not) long ago. Is the movie <i>Armageddon</i> alternate history?</p>
<p><i>Fatherland</i> is not the best AH book, but it may be the most archetypical.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the other hand -is all alternate history sci fi? All that I have read was classed as such but why would it need to be. ---rmhermen</p>
<p>No, Fatherland, for example, is mainstream fiction. Len Deighton's XPD is another example of mainstream alternate history. Also, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Musil_73c2.html" title="Robert Musil">Robert Musil</a>'s Viennese epic, Man Without Qualities, plays with alternate outcomes and historical actualities. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<hr />
<p>It should be important whether AH is SF. SF is often categorized wrong.</p>
<p>Fatherland is no SF because of what? No time machine? Success?</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></p>
<p>Success, mainly, but it is mainstream principally because it deals with the alternate nature of history without implying any major technological differences, and was marketed as a mainstream novel. Certainly there was an acute shortage of time-machines...<a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<p>The thing about <i>Fatherland</i>, as I see it, is that it's a detective/thriller novel. It has a detective/thriller plot, it is constructed as a detective/thriller novel, it has no SF elements in it. Apart from the setting, of course, but the fact that it's set in an alternate history is not in any way the point of the novel - it's a detective/thriller novel that just happens to have an unusual setting, more like (insert name of detective novel set in <i>historical</i> ancient Japan) than like (insert example of novel where the fact that it's an alternate history is the whole point). --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_A_a8ca.html" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a></p>

<hr />
<p>Nobody yet seems to have mentioned the source of "Jonbar Hinge".</p>
<p>It's from Jack Williamson's story "The Legion of Time", which first appeared in "Astounding" in 1938, and has since been published in book form. The alternatives are the good civilisation of Jonbar or the bad one of Gyronchi, and the pivotal event is whether a child called John Barr picks up an old magnet, or a pebble .</p>
<p>Paul Magnussen</p>
<hr />
<p>AS far as I am concerned, I would be sad to see a decision ending the question of whether early Science Fiction that does not portray the existing present is or is not alternate history. I think the question itself is one of those "fun to argue about but never settle" issues that should be mentioned as such in the article on alternate history, and should not be settled. Separate lists of alternate history fiction could be maintained to satisfy the purists.</p>

<dd><b>Alternate History</b> is the term commonly used by the people who actually use it. Google search for <b>alternate-history-novel</b> gives 14,800 hits. <b>alternative-history-novel</b> gives only 889 hits. The former is used 1564% more often than the latter. Clearly the latter is not the accepted term. Even within wikipedia <b>alternate history</b> is used more often in things like category names: see <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternate_history_characters_e743.html" title="Category:Alternate history characters">category:alternate history characters</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternate_history_films_7fe0.html" title="Category:Alternate history films">category:alternate history films</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternate_history_games_4e94.html" title="Category:Alternate history games">category:alternate history games</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternate_history_novels_0d72.html" title="Category:Alternate history novels">category:alternate history novels</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternate_history_writers_b2d2.html" title="Category:Alternate history writers">category:alternate history writers</a> etc. etc. Most of the articles linking to <b>alternative history</b> actually say "alternate history"in the text; "alternative" is only in the link. When such a discrepancy exists between common usage and what you believe the correct usage should be, it is likely that your analysis of the terminology used is at fault rather than the common usage being incorrect. Please see the American Heritage dictionary under "alternate"—the usage here of "alternate" is adj. 3 "Serving or used in place of another; substitute:<i>an alternate plan.</i>" But whatever the reasoning behind what the correct term is, it is not Wikipedia's job to change overwhelming common usage; see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>.

<dd>Actually, it is both a matter of taste and grammer. Grammar because, yes, grammatically, it should be alternative. Taste, because through common (and long) usage, the incorrect (grammatically) form of alternate history is accepted as a marketing tool and the name of the genre which <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon">Chameleon</a> disagrees with. More people will recognize the term alternate history than alternative history and the question then comes down to: is the purpose of Wikipedia to be correct in a manner which diminishes its usefulness or incorrect in a manner which allows people to find what they are looking for. You can find many books with the phrase "Alternate History" on the spine (as you would find "science fiction," "mystery," "fiction," etc.) but you won't find any with the more grammatically correct "alternative history." - <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">shsilver</a></dd>

<dd>Using the correct term doesn't make anything less useful to anyone in any way: anybody searching for the term "Alternate Fiction" will be redirected to the article. Don't make out that people will be wondering around deprived of information because we have good grammar. On the other hand, opting for the incorrect term has the negative effect of a) making Wikipedia look stupid and b) condoning the error. It is much the same as not correcting spelling mistakes in articles.</dd>

<p>Actually I don't think <i>alternate</i> is "wrong" here in modern usage. The term is used as a synonym for <i>alternative</i> in modern English in a variety of contexts. Correctness is dictated by usage, after all: many of the words you currently use would have been "incorrect" in that usage a mere 300 years ago, but the meaning has shifted. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 11:13, Apr 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, the 2000 <i>American Heritage</i> dictionary lists this as a correct usage as well: "alternate, n., 3.

<p>If this article is about alternate history fiction in particular, rather than about the concept of alternate history/virtual history, does 'For Want of a Nail' really belong there?

<p>No, it would not. There's no POD in 1984. No specific POD, no AH. --Jrittenh 7 July 2005 08:30 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Presumably, any history that is the same as the real world up until a certain general time period, after which history is different, has had at least one POD (even if the specific POD isn't known, that doesn't mean there wasn't one).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A good example is the Eugenics Wars in Star Trek. When first written, it was a speculation concerning the future. Since Trek cannon still upholds that the Eugenics wars occured in the 1990's, would this not make the Star Trek series take place in a future based on an alternative history of our own world? (Of course, this isn't the best example, as the ST universe has several points of divergence going back to before the appearence of life on Earth, making the whole Trekkiverse an alternative timeline almost from the get-go.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That being said, what if a story set in the future when it was written, which has since come to pass, were to spawn a sequel after this point, specifying the events of the first story as the POD? If both stories are to be taken as part of the same cannon, and if the sequel specified the first story as the POD, making the sequel itself an outcome of an alternative history, would not the first story have to be taken as the very alternative history upon which the sequel were based? --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvun_a92b.html" title="User:Corvun">Corvun</a> 06:45, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting idea. OK, in 1956, you write a story about how John Kennedy is elected in 1960 and gets into a war with the Soviet Union over them putting missiles in Cuba. Result of the war is that Cuba and the USSR is nuked to pieces. The actual story didn't deal with the details of all this, but is a cautionary anti-nuclear war story set in a part of Europe just returning towards civilization around 2010 after a long period of savagery.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It was not a far stretch in 1956 to imagine JFK (a) getting elected in 1960 and (b) being a Cold Warrior that got into a war with the Soviets. (Cuba as a source of conflict would have been a far harder call, but let's say this person got to be a reeeealy good guesser. Reeeealy reaaaaly good. And if you put it far away in place and time you don't have to have a lot of the details; the people in Eastern Germany, say, wouldn't have them. And the story (and its sequels) wouldn't need a lot of the details to still be effective.</dd>

<dd>But (and this is a BIG but) you'd have to be a good enough futurist to call something like this on the nose. Heinlein fails - you see any 'Roads Must Roll' around? I can't imagine very many things being pulled out that would fit this sort of thing. Not impossible, but waaaaaaay hard. --Jrittenh 00:49, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What POD is there in Star Trek? This is news to me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Depends on when you place the Eugenics wars. If you assume they're still in the 90's then the Pod is genetic supermen who should not be there. If (as many do) you decide the Eugenics are actually WWIII then no Pod. Plus of cause there are a few matters where the timeline obviously diverges from ours (expanded voyager program).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As For 1984 the POD is obvious (though at the time this was set in the "far" future) at some point (probably the late 1940's) the East and West get into a fight (I'm guessing Berlin), in the process the USSR takes over western Europe and an isolated UK forms common cause with the USA maybe even becoming a state (and taking along the colonies) this creates Oceania, in the havoc caused by the war the conditions are about the same as those of Russia in 1917. An English Socialist party stages a coup, it spreads to America and eventually is perverted by BB into the world we meet in the book. Tobias1 15:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Um, no. I enjoy a lot of stuff like this (movies like Sliding Doors, etc) and APH is probably a good title for such things. Strict AH involves some kind of a change in 'public' history, but 'personal' could become AH in this manner: say that John F Kennedy was crippled by his combat experience in WW2, and ended up in a wheelchair, and lost all interest in politics. The story starts with a older Kennedy, say, around 1970, tsking about public affairs as he's reading the paper, and we'll say further that he's enough of an invalid that he's never married, and has muddled along as the administrator of some charity organization. The story goes on to have him meet old friends, and maybe a politician that he knew well in our time-line, but here is just a benefactor to the charity. The story hints of his restlessness, and desire to *do* something, and closes with him dying of a stroke in his sleep.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sad, but...here, you have a public figure going off on the what-ifs in his life, in a quiet enough way that it's really quite personal.--Jrittenh 7 July 2005 08:25 (UTC)

<dd>There is an extremely good example of this "alternate personal history" that actually does involve JFK. It's a short story called "The Winterberry" by Nicholas Dichario. In this future, JFK survived his assassination, but in a severely brain-damaged state, and his family, for the sake of the country, covered up his survival. However, the future history remains entirely unchanged; there's a strong hint that JFK would have been better off dead than in the mentally-retarded state he is in during the story. --<a href="../../../l/2E/_/User%7EL._6c28.html" title="User:L.">L.</a> 22:05, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a working (but retired) historian, I have professional problems with the "Great Man" theory of history. On the other hand, as a lifelong SF fan with a particular soft spot for alternate history, I have to say it's (at least) much more interesting when the individual to whom something different happens -- to create a POD -- is one of the movers and shakers, like JFK or FDR or Genghis Khan or whomever.<br /></dd>
<dd>A purely personal alternate history, especially when it involves a purely fictional person (as in <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>), is purely pointless. This is because part of the fun of reading alternate history, at least to me, is evaluating the cause-and-effect of the author's chosen POD. Is it reasonable and believable? For this reason, I don't have much use for many of Turtledove's novels. In <i>Guns of the South</i>, he posits transporting AK-47s back in time, which is not the sort of subtle POD that might actually happen in our version of the real world. Likewise, having aliens invade in the middle of WWII smacks of <i>deus ex machina</i> to me. (Harry's earlier works with a Byzantine setting were much better in this regard.) --<a href="../../../m/k/s/User%7EMksmith_2490.html" title="User:Mksmith">Michael K.

<p><a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> seems intent that future histories (i.e. science fiction) becomes alternate history when the time in which it is set has passed.

Looking at definitions used by <a href="http://www.uchronia.net" class="external text" title="http://www.uchronia.net" rel="nofollow">Uchronia</a> and the <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidewise_Award_for_Alternate_History_3b22.html" title="Sidewise Award for Alternate History">Sidewise Award for Alternate History</a>, this is not alternate history (see discussion above, "becoming alternate history"). <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 13:46, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Don't be facetious, I meant alternatehistory.com... A well written story set in a future which has passed and has not happened does become a honourary alternate history. 1984 is a main example of this, its a popular discussion topic of exactly what the alternate timeline behind 1984 is. They were not alternate history at the time they were written but they are now. - Josquius</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not facetious at all. If the goal is to be accurate, please be accurate. If somebody doesn't know about alternatehistory.com and followed your link... Anyway, by your definition, other classics of alternate history include <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Bleak House</i>, and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> since the time in which they are set is passed. Being alternate history is as much a matter of intent as anything else. <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 17:32, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If ' <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Bleak House</i>, and <i>The Scarlet Letter'</i> were written about what the writer thought the future would be like then yes they would be. I am only familiar with Jane Eyre there and I'm pretty certain its a Victorian love story, not a future history. -Josquius</p>
<dl>
<dd>But by your argument, it has talen place in our past and didn't really happen, therefore it is alternate history, even if not on an earth shaking scale (see above, the discussion on personal alternate history). Sure, it wasn't intended as alternate history, but to look at it from now, it would be if your definition fit. Some sources which agtree that your definition for AH is incorrect include Karen Hellekson, author of <i>The Alternate History: Refiguring Historical Time</i>, <a href="http://www.uchronia.net" class="external text" title="http://www.uchronia.net" rel="nofollow">Uchronia</a>, Andy Duncan, who wrote the article on alternate history for <i>The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction</i>, and the rules for the <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidewise_Award_for_Alternate_History_3b22.html" title="Sidewise Award for Alternate History">Sidewise Award for Alternate History</a>.<a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 18:33, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>...no that's not my argument at all... Every book except science fiction is alternate history by your definition there as books set in the present when wrote were obviously published in the past. I can see how you could regard my original edit as incorrect however my new revision is totally correct. You are obviously a semi-decent computer user with being on wikipedia and claim to be a expert on what alternate history is yet you hadn't heard of ah.com... Most strange. -Josquius</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, I've heard of alternatehistory.com, not ah.com (which is a healthcare company), which has nothing to do with my most recent argument, which cited several sources in support of my argument. By your definition, all SF would eventually be considered alternate history, which is not the case. Interestingly, I was discussing your assertion with a couple of the judges of the Sidewise Award over the weekend and they both found it, well, ridiculous.<a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 18:25, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To your sources: uchronia says ‘You might argue that excluding all such retroactive alternate histories from this bibliography is "limiting", in which case you'd be exactly right. A limit must be drawn or else this bibliography would have the impossible goal of including a significant fraction of the books and stories that have ever been published, and potentially the majority of all science fiction.’. It says here that retroactive alternate history does exist. It is simply choosing not to list them. It is not denying their existence. This source backs up my argument not yours, in fact it goes beyond mine in saying every outdated sci-fi is alternate history.</p>

<p>Well what is the sidewise definition then? They do not include it on their main site. I do not think too highly of some minor Internet award though which is what they seem to be (though forgive me if I am wrong on that). How many times must I say THAT IS NOT MY DEFINITION. That is your fictitious warping of my definition. The likes of (original) Flash Gordon where its just a case of ‘ohh it’s the 1980s and we fly around in space ships fighting aliens’ are not honorary alternate history. They are atrociously bad alien space bat alternate histories though in my opinion they lack the honour to be honorary alternate history (though some will disagree with me here). The likes of 1984 however where the world is perfectly plausible had things gone differently (i.e. the technology is all proven to be possible) are honorary alternate history. You hang around at that alternate history newsgroup. Surely you have encountered the conversations about it and other honorary alternate histories that appear? It is not just ah.com that agrees with me, many at that newsgroup seem to too despite your warping of my definition. - <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a></p>

<dd>Hey, you got the tildes to work. Congratulations. Actually, that is your definition, just taken to its logical (or illogical, your choice) extremes.

<p>I have been unable to post on the discussion page for a day or two. It keeps coming up with the preview screen when I click on save. What I wrote last was: Of course judges of some award would not class them as being alternate history as awards by their nature usually go to new books. They won't suddenly out of the blue give it to something written a few decades ago. I remember a book I read last year called ‘Total War:2006’. The version I read was a reprint and one of the many comments they take from reviews was that the book was a good example of what might have been if things had gone differently in the late 90s. The book was originally written in the mid 90s and post 11/9 it was re-released as a story of what might have been. This also applies to other books set in a future that wasn’t. They are still published despite what they depict not having happened.</p>

<p>I understand the idea of claiming things that are 'fictional history' that has passed as 'alternate history', but here's my viewpoint.</p>
<p>FWIW, I'm one of the Sidewise judges that shsilver was going on about, and among those worthies, I seem to be the toughest grader and the toughest on definitions. So here's the story:</p>
<p>"Fictional History" is what you'd call 1984, any of the Clancy books, things like Heinlein's historical setup of stories and novels that follow a similar timeline, and political novels like Seven Days in May.</p>
<p>"Alternate History" requires a simple Point of Divergence. Not a complex one. Not "well, what if this and this and this changed." Like, what if Marilyn Monroe was President, and Jackie Kennedy was the head of the Soviet Union and the Pope was openly gay, and....</p>
<p>That's not AH, that's some kind of weird fantasy. Period. --Jrittenh 6 July 2005 19:17 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not claiming these books are alternate history. I am just stating the fact that they are commonly regarded as honourary alternate history. Go and check out places where alternate history is discussed by fans of the genre (alternatehistory.com being the biggest place) you will find that many wrong future histories always pop up. Those bad PODs you mentioned. They would make a alternate history. A very bad one. But it would still be a alternate history. Just as all of that pulp sci fi nonsense of the 1930s is classed in the same genre as A.C. Clarke and other respected writers bad alternate history does exist. Something that springs to mind here is The Two Georges which just has a vague 'ugh well...The American Revolution sort of didn't happen' POD. There is no way that agreement between the two Georges could have happened. For the purposes of fiction though it did. I can not find the original poll from the old ah.com forum, it is just not worth my time however there was one created a week or two ago which shows that fans do agree with me on this. <a href="http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=17295" class="external free" title="http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=17295" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=17295</a> -Josquius</p>

I went to that poll, and thought that 20-odd people on that board agreeing on anything doth not decree that the moon is made of green cheese. I don't care how well something is written, AH is dependant on a POD. I read very POD-based true AH all the time that is utter crap.</p>
<p>The only things that a lot of people consider AH that is iffy in my book is where the POD is caused by time travellers and the like. ISLAND IN THE SEA OF TIME and THE GUNS OF THE SOUTH are the best-written of that sort. They make me itch, but I'll deal with a few like that as 'honorary' because it's a manufactured by time travel POD. --Jrittenh 05:17, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This leads to readers encountering stories which read <i>as though</i> they were alternate history, but which are not. An example would be <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Who_Sold_the_Moon_cc01.html" title="The Man Who Sold the Moon">The Man Who Sold the Moon</a>. Written in the 1940's, it posits that the first moon launch is run by a private organization rather than a govenment agency in the 1960's. New readers encountering the book may well presume that this is alternative history since it is clearly a counter-factual depiction of the first moon lauch, now almost 40 years in the past. however, <i>when written</i> the first moon launch was nearly 30 years in the <i>future</i>. Thus, <i>The Man Who Sold the Moon</i> is <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">Science fiction</a>, not alternative history.

<p>If someone notices that the sentence about "secret history" has been removed from the first paragraph, don't panic. It has merely been moved to its logical place under "Boundaries of Alternative History" (a new subhead in the article's T of C). I also added some stuff about cross-time stories, since it is really impossible to separate them from alternative history (essentially they are alternate history tales that include a framing that allows the exploration of multiple alternate histories in a single novel).--Nov. 27, 2005</p>

<p>Reading the section "Elements of Alternate History", the <i>Battle of Dorking</i> fits those qualifiers.

<dd>It has been discussed before. Works don't become alternate history simply because they are set in the past. There is the matter of intent.

<p>Someone said the new material dilutes AH and cites the example of Battle of Dorking. But the whole point of the paragraph added about what-if's such as Dorking was to draw a distinction between them and AH. At the same time, there IS the grey area which turns on whether the historical changes are treated as having occurred prior to the time the author is writing.--Nov. 29</p>

<p>Everyone is putting their favorites books into this list, which is fun for all (and alerted me to some works I'd never heard of), but I think it would be best to divide them into at least four categories: conventional (self-contained) AH, time-splitting AH, cross-time AH, and magical pseudo-AH. (Some works would probably end up on at least two lists!) Also, the lists within each category should be alphabetized by author's last name. If people persist in adding works of secret history, mythical history, cautionary tales, etc., well let's just make separate categories for them and clearly label them as not AH or as borderline AH. -- 10 February 2006</p>

<p>The section on alternate history and fantasy just keeps growing and growing. Obviously, this is a subgenre that lots of wikipedians enjoy and feel passionate about. I'm wondering however if this shouldn't be turned into a separate article since alternate history with magic is really a kind of grey area. It should certainly be mentioned in this article but perhaps the full treatment should be spun off. As a fan of alternate history with or without magic both, I don't feel strongly about this. I'm just throwing it out as a possibility, especially since this section will probably continue to grow.--03 April 2006<br /></p>

<p>I removed for the second time in recent months a reference to an Everettian "wave function collapse". There is no wave function collapse in MWT; instead the universe splits so that Schrodinger's cat both lives and dies--in separate universes. "Wave function collapse" is what is presumed to occur in the older Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>However, the author of the disputed paragraph has a valid point about some universes being possible and others not, although this is an issue of literary framing (and possibly of philosophy) rather than of quantum mechnics. I clarified the phrasing on this point and will later move it to the subsection on Points of Departure, with examples.--10 April 2006 <small>—The preceding comment is by 64.12.116.65 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.65.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.65">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.65_02eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.65">contribs</a>) Revision as of 19:31, 10 April 2006: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Please sign your posts!</a></i></small></p>

<dd>Incidentially, your claims about "possible" universes do not seem proper to me. In a fictional multiverse, we can meaningfully state that a universe is not possible -- the author can say so. But to claim that Victoria Woodhull's election is not possible? How would we know? The most we can say is that it is implausible, which is an eminently arguable point, and not a criterion for distinguishing an alternate history from works of another genre. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 23:16, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course the election of Woodhull would have been possible PROVIDED THAT a prior point of departure (for instance, a virus wiping out two thirds of all men in the United States) had produced huge changes in American society and culture. Without such major POD changes I still maintain her election would have been utterly impossible. American voters of the post-Civil War era (when the franchise was only available to men and the viewpoint of the average American on religious and sexual matters was such that Jerry Falwell would be regarded as daringly liberated by comparison) would simply not have voted for a woman candidate who advocated free love. To suggest that anything is possible under any historical circumstance is to deny the lawful nature of history (and of physical reality). Of course the portrayal of bizarre happenings AS IF they were possible is perfectly valid for literary purposes, and the fine short story about Woodhull's Presidency can be said to obey the "higher principle" of satiric license.--dking 31 May 2006</dd>

<dd>Bizarre things happen all the time, but the election of Woodhull in the 1870s would have been something far beyond "bizarre." Nevertheless, I conceded above that yes, it could have happened in a parallel universe, provided that a point of departure at a prior moment had created the conditions for transforming the beyond-bizarre into the merely bizarre (or, if the POD was a virus killing the majority of U.S. men) transforming the beyond-bizarre into the commonplace. The key concept here is that of an adequate POD. The author of the short story did not provide an adequate POD because she was writing satire, which does not require it.--dking 1 June 2006</dd>

<dd>A distinction has to be made between alternate history that deals with things that are possible given a certain POD, and things that are simply impossible (as in certain satires as well as the fantasy-based alternate history novels). "Possibility" is an important dialectical category in philosophy and indeed in all rational thought and implies "impossibility." "Plausibility" is a different concept with a fundamentally different meaning from possibility. The recognition of the distinction between possible and impossible events in alternate history is owed to those military historians and other scholars who use alternate history in the classical sense as a means of illuminating real history through the study of possible outcomes different from those that actually occurred. I have nowhere suggested that "impossible" events (events for which an adequate historical POD has not been suggested or that posit a reality that violates the basic physical laws of our universe) are not part of the alternative history genre, but they are a different category of the genre. I am merely applying to alternate history the same distinctions that are commonly made in science fiction between "hard" and "soft" science fiction and between science fiction proper and science fantasy, all of which are regarded as honorable categories within one and the same genre.--dking 1 June 2006</dd>

<p>I can't see why mediating is needed any longer. Just present both viewpoints, "some students of AH argue X, others argue Y...."

Fair enough on the phrasing of it, the terms are a little loaded. It certainly is promiment enough though that it's worth a mention, certainly more so then some of the other links, how about something along the lines of "a large web-based alternate history discussion board"? The vandal hasn't stopped, as of 2200 EST it has been changed again.</p>
<p>Alternatehistory.com has by nearly an order of magnitude the most active alternate history discussion forum on the net (I have no idea what the phrasing was after this deletion war, but I wrote an original phrasing specifically about being the largest AH *discussion board* on the net). It has approximately 1100 posts per day as of last month, generally 600-700 members who have posted within the last month, and an archive of nearly 700,000 posts. The second and third largest forums that I'm aware of were the newsgroup soc.history.what-if and othertimelines.com. I haven't checked the latest google stats but SHWI was averaging something like 120-150 posts per day in 2005 (and, unfortunately, continuously declining on a year-to-year basis). A quick glance at the Google stats indicates that SHWI has roughly the same number of archived posts, since its creation in 1992 (alternatehistory.com dates from late 2000). I don't know othertimelines.com's daily activity level (though it is nowhere near alternatehistory.com's) but it has about 125,000 posts total in its archive. - Ian M, board admin Ian M 02:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree with the notion alternatehistory.com is "the most active alternate history discussion forum". Yeah, theres quite a bit of traffic. However, most of the activity goes on in two chat rooms where AH is rarely ever discussed. Also, the most active members rarely ever post in the alt hist areas.</p>
<p>Not sure who this anonymous naysayer is, but it's no accident they don't post figures. Alternatehistory.com has 50% posts in chat, which leaves 550 posts per day in the purely on-topic forums. soc.history.what-if averaged 120 posts per day in 2005, including off-topic posting and trolls (which occur with regularity on the unmoderated newsgroup): <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/browse_frm/thread/778af20335f71409/89d5e25ccf4f000a?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=42#89d5e25ccf4f000a" class="external free" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/browse_frm/thread/778af20335f71409/89d5e25ccf4f000a?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=42#89d5e25ccf4f000a" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/browse_frm/thread/778af20335f71409/89d5e25ccf4f000a?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=42#89d5e25ccf4f000a</a> Hard to figure the activity level of othertimelines.com as it recently dropped a lot due to severe hacker attacks. The phpBB post count claims 80,000 archived posts in the mostly on-topic forums, but it's clear that this number of posts aren't actually visible. Anyway, that site isn't nearly as active either. Ian Montgomerie 07:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Saying Alternatehistory.com is "the most active alternate history discussion forum" is like saying MTV is the greatest music video channel on cable TV! Ah.com has heavy traffic. Certainly more than Unwritten History or Alternia from any vantage point. It doesnt change the fact that at least every other post has almost nothing to do with alternate history. Contrast that with othertimelines.com where most all posts are relevant to the stated purpose of the board. Nah, "most active" is too vague a term</p>
<p>It is the largest, and has more on-topic posts verifiable than any other group. Fadethebutcher 21:44, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Othertimelines has essentially died due to hacker/spamming activities. The community however still exists, in a very active undisclosed website. Although OTL still has the largest collection of esaily accesable AH TLs on the internet.</p>
<p>I've been posting a link to the active Othertimelines discussion board, and while its in there when I go to edit, it doesn't show up on the page, is the link section locked or something? If so I'd appreciate whoever has the power in inserting the link onto the page. Nevermind its working now, probably just some trouble with my machine.217.84.184.73 23:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>An edit summary comment by recent editor says he or she is not sure PK Dick qualifies as a major writer. For the record, the prestigious Library of America is coming out with a Philip K. Dick volume next spring (I presume Man in a High Castle will be one of the novels included). Although I personally think the LOA's first choice of a science-fiction writer to honor should have been the incomparable Jack Vance, the LOA volume will certainly consolidate Dick's well deserved reputation as an important figure in mainstream as well as genre literature.--14 Sept 2006</p>

<p>Here's a vivid example I've never seen mentioned: that the fall of the USSR depended in large part on the untimely deaths of two men: Yuri Andropov being one. He was not planned to be a caretaker leader, his death after 11 months in office was truly unexpected. The plan was for him to be the hard-line Soviet leader for a good 20 years.</p>
<p>The other was Pope John Paul Ist, dead after--what?--10 days. Murdered? Maybe. Untimely, either way.</p>
<p>So then, imagine: no Polish Pope in the Vatican to defend Soldarity and Walesa against an Andropov-led Kremlin. No Gorbachev in the Kremlin to promulgate Glasnost and Perestroika.</p>
<p>A tremendously different recent history, due to the unexpected deaths of two men.</p>

The only place where anyone suggested changing the main article was jc37's comment at the beginning of this subsection of the talk page, but no one else chimed in to support this proposal so there was certainly no consensus, and both Anþony and I seem to be against it.

<p>Please re-read the nomination, the discussion, and the closure. The main thing is that the category name should match the article name in most cases. And this case doesn't seem to be an exception to that.</p>
<p>We've already had a CfD on this, and my post was here unresponded to for well over a week. However, I am a strong proponent of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_can_change_4d99.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus can change">Consensus can change</a>, so I have <i>no problem</i> with the idea of starting a new discussion on this. The main thing I ask is that before this page is moved again, that a new CfD is started for the related category <i>first</i>, and then we can use that discussion as a model for determining consensus for the name for this page as well.</p>
<p>As for my own opinion, just a thought, but unless there is a concern that readers may be confused between <i>alternative</i> and <i>alternate</i>, perhaps "(fiction)" should be entirely dropped?</p>
<p>One last thing: I would like to commend you (plural). As far as I can tell so far, this has been a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>, and thought-filled discussion, with no <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">outbursts</a> or other disruption.

<dd>You say "please re-read the nomination", but if you're referring to the discussion at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_categories_for_discussion_Archive_November_2006_6a98.html#Category:Wikipedians_who_enjoy_alt-history" title="Wikipedia:User categories for discussion/Archive/November 2006">Wikipedia:User_categories_for_discussion/Archive/November_2006#Category:Wikipedians_who_enjoy_alt-history</a>, I see no one there suggesting that "Alternate history (fiction)" should be changed to "Alternate history fiction", only a discussion of whether "Category:Wikipedians who enjoy alt-history" should be changed to "Category:Wikipedians who enjoy alternate history (fiction)" or "Category:Wikipedians who enjoy alternate history fiction". For example, when Mike Selinger says "I think you can ditch the parenthetical", it's clear to me he's referring to the paranthetical in your suggested title of "Category:Wikipedians who enjoy alternate history (fiction)", not the parenthetical in the main article. He even says "let's not be too enamored of page titles", meaning that the category's title does not need to precisely duplicate the article title. Similarly, Erielhonan says "If rename happens, I support Mike Selinker's proposal to elide the parentheses (thereby making the category title <i>Category:Wikipedians who read alternate history fiction</i>)", so again, that is clearly only referring to "eliding the parentheses" from the category title, not the main article. Nowhere in the discussion does anyone suggest changing the main article title, unless you count Mike Selinger's summary of the "result of the debate" at the top, where he suggests "testing" a rename of the main article and says that <i>if</i> that is accepted then the category name can be changed too. No one there or here has said that they support this change to the main article title, though, so I see nothing resembling a consensus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your suggestion, I think it'd probably be OK to drop the (fiction) from the main article title, although I'm not sure that people are actually 100% consistent about exclusively using "alternate history" for fiction and "counterfactual history" for academic speculation about what-if questions, so if people do sometimes use "alternate history" in a non-fictional context that'd be a case for keeping it. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 23:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the article and category have to match in this regard. The category is "Wikipedians who enjoy <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history_%28fiction%29.html" title="Alternate history (fiction)">alternate history</a> fiction". Fiction is being used there as a generic term with the name of the genre as an adjective. You could easily rewrite it to say "Wikipedians who enjoy alternate history <i>books</i>", but clearly we shouldn't call this article alternate history books.</dd>

<dd>jc37 is also right to point out that the historiography subject is <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_history.html" title="Alternative history">alternat<b>ive</b> history</a>, while the literary genre is <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history.html" title="Alternate history">alternat<b>e</b> history</a>.

<dd>Thanks. The page name is now correct at last. The whole (fiction) thing stems from when both articles used Alternative in the title due to the misunderstanding way up on this talk page. (The literary genre is definitely much more commonly called Alternate history rather than Alternative.) Anyway, the policy you may have been referring to is that a page title should have a parenthetical in it only if the non-parenthetical version is already taken (by a different main article or a dab page). —<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 00:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Spinrad wasn't able to stretch his one idea in Iron Dream to make a succesful novel out of it. It is boringly repetitive--probably the main reason it's so hard to find. A much better AH ad Hitlerum is where a present-day protagonist goes back in time to Vienna in the 1920s and convinces that city's Jewish art dealers and art critics to boost Adolf's career (beyond its real merits) so that he makes a living as an artist and never goes into politics.

<p>The basic concept of a "point of divergence" is already discussed in both the introduction and "introducing the paratime patrol", and the extra section titled "point of divergence" doesn't really add anything beyond discussing two examples in great detail (one of which was not even originally intended as alternate history, just future history which later became alternate history due to the failure of predictions like the Eugenics War). This seems pretty random, I'd be in favor of eliminating this section altogether, since the article is already quite long.

<dd>Or, maybe the stuff about the many-worlds interpretation and whether all possible histories exist should be moved from the "introducing the paratime patrol" section into this section, where they'd be a little less of a digression? <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 11:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My take is that it belongs in the article as much as any of the other interactive links. If it were being used as a citation rather than for further information, I would agree that it doesn't meet standards, but it isn't being referenced as RS, so your bot is wrong to reference that. There is no reference to discussion groups in EL, which your bot claims it violates, so that is not true, It isn't SPAM, so your bot is wrong there as well. Of the four policies your bot references, the only one which <i>might</i> be applicable is NOT, but, as I commented, if it applies to this link, it should apply to all of the interactive links listed on the page.</dd>
<dd>What it <i>does</i> do is provide a pointer to a forum for further discussion of the topic which people who are interested enough in the topic to look it up might want to follow up on. <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 21:29, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
