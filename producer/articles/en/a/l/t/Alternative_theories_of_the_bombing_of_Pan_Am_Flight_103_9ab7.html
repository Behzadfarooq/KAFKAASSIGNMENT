<p>In Britain, the Conservative administrations under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a> refused even to countenance the idea of an independent public inquiry into PA 103. The Labour party in opposition had promised such an inquiry, but in government since May 1997 and having brought the case to trial, prime minister <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> appeared to believe there was no need for any further inquiry. Labour <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">MP</a>, Russell Brown, whose Dumfries constituency includes the town of Lockerbie, formally called for a public inquiry in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. But foreign secretary, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Straw_%28politician%29_822f.html" title="Jack Straw (politician)">Jack Straw</a>, in a written statement to parliament on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, said the government had "decided not to initiate any further form of review on Lockerbie."</p>
<p>However, the case would be reopened if the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Criminal_Cases_Review_Commission_6aaf.html" title="Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission">Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission</a> (SCCRC) were to review the case and decide to refer it back to the High Court for a fresh appeal. Lawyers for Megrahi therefore applied to the SCCRC on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> asking that the case be reviewed. Just over two years later, something seemed to be happening:</p>

Megrahi's transfer from Greenock jail in Scotland would undoubtedly infuriate some of the US victims' families, as well as those who believe Megrahi is innocent and demand that he should have a fresh appeal.<a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/48724.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/48724.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>

"I won't let it go," he added.<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=2175742005" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=2175742005" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>

The purpose of the meeting in Greenock Prison was to ask Megrahi whether he would still press for the SCCRC to continue its review of his case if rumours of his repatriation proved to be correct.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Megrahi was happy for me to make it known that he is determined to pursue a review of the case, no matter what might evolve concerning his future detention," said Dr Swire. He added: "It is very important to the members of UKF103 campaign group that there be a full review of the entire Lockerbie scenario through an appropriately empowered and independent inquiry, but absence of a further review of the court case would also damage our search for truth and justice."</dd>
<dd>Dr Swire said even if Megrahi did not continue with his appeal bid, the campaign group would press the SCCRC to complete its review of the case, as interested parties.<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=2260252005" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=2260252005" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>

<li>In March 2006, Dr Swire met Iain McKie – the father of policewoman <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_McKie_9124.html" title="Shirley McKie">Shirley McKie</a>, who was wrongly accused by <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Criminal_Record_Office_27ba.html" title="Scottish Criminal Record Office">Scottish Criminal Record Office</a> (SCRO) fingerprint experts of leaving her thumb print at a murder scene in 1997. Mr McKie is lobbying for a judicial inquiry to be held into his daughter's case, which allegedly has links with the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_bombing_trial_b026.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial">Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial</a>. Dr Swire and Mr McKie are keen for such an inquiry to investigate not only these links but also a number of other questions such as the role of Harry Bell, the former head of the SCRO and a key person in the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investigation_into_the_bombing_of_Pan_Am_Flight_103_0ffa.html" title="Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103">investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103</a>.

However, defence lawyers and others, including PA 103 relatives, expressed concerns about the timing of this appeal against sentence, and were keen for any appeal against conviction (that the SCCRC might decide upon) to be heard at the same time. Addressing these concerns, a court spokesman said:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"There might be a referral from the commission [SCCRC], but there might not be."<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=674022006" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=674022006" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

The three-month delay thus allows time to settle both the venue issue and whether the SCCRC is to grant Megrahi a second appeal against conviction.<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=850342006" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=850342006" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>

<p>The Lord Advocate then lists the various pieces of evidence found to prove that the investigators interest in Libya was "as a result of the evidence which was discovered and not as a result of any political interference in the investigation" He reiterated "There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there was political interference. The investigation was evidence led." The list of evidence includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord Boyd regarding the Toshiba radio cassette fragment:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“evidence was obtained from Toshiba [by <a href="../../../d/e/r/DERA_6137.html" title="DERA">DERA</a>'s <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Feraday_2c78.html" title="Alan Feraday">Alan Feraday</a>] which showed that during October 1988 20,000 black Toshiba RT-SF 16 radio cassettes, the type used in the Pan Am bomb, were shipped to Libya. Of the total world-wide sales of that model 76% were sold to the General Electric Company's subsidiary in Libya whose chairman was Said Rashid.[information added]”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lord Boyd regarding the timer fragment:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“In June 1990, with the assistance ultimately of the CIA and FBI, Alan Feraday of the Explosives Laboratory was able to identify the fragment as identical to circuitry from an MST-13 timer. It was already known to the CIA from an example seized in Togo in 1986 and photographed by them in Senegal in 1988. That took investigators to the firm of MEBO in Zurich. It was discovered that these timers had been manufactured to the order of two Libyans Ezzadin Hinshin, at the time director of the Central Security Organisation of the Libyan External Security Organisation and Said Rashid, then head of the Operations Administration of the ESO.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lord Boyd regarding the clothing material:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“In September 1989 Tony Gauci, the shopkeeper, was interviewed by Scottish police officers. He convincingly identified a range of clothing which he had sold to a man sometime before Christmas 1988. Among the items he remembered selling were two pairs of Yorkie trousers, two pairs of striped pyjamas, a tweed jacket, a blue babygro, two slalom shirts collar size 16 and a half, two cardigans, one brown and one blue and an umbrella. He described the man, and subsequently identified him as Megrahi. More importantly at the time he was in no doubt that he was a Libyan.”</p>

<p>Warning against over-reliance upon forensic science to secure convictions, Britain's foremost criminal lawyer, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Mansfield_611a.html" title="Michael Mansfield">Michael Mansfield</a> <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Counsel_3fe5.html" title="Queen's Counsel">QC</a>, in the BBC Frontline Scotland TV program <i>Silence over Lockerbie</i>, broadcast on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, said he wanted to make just one point:</p>

<dd>"Forensic science is not immutable. They're not written in tablets of stone, and the biggest mistake that anyone can make—public, expert or anyone else alike—is to believe that forensic science is somehow beyond reproach: it is not! The biggest miscarriages of justice in the United Kingdom, many of them emanate from cases in which forensic science has been shown to be wrong. And the moment a forensic scientist or anyone else says: 'I am sure this marries up with that' I get worried."</dd>

<p>Various news media also investigated the bombing and the various theories that were put forward to explain it.

<p>Within days of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> bombing, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockerbie.html" title="Lockerbie">Lockerbie</a> was awash with rumors: heroin and money had been found, and the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> had arrived in the town. None of these rumours was ever officially confirmed.</p>
<p>Two teenagers claimed to have found travellers cheques worth $547,000 and an envelope upon which that figure had been marked. Several polythene bags containing white powder were found, according to Edinburgh's <i>Radio Forth</i> reporter David Johnstone (<i>Johnstone</i> 1989). No evidence of these finds was presented in court.</p>
<p>Another rumour was that a mountain-rescue leader walking east of Tundergarth was approached by a police officer and told he could proceed no further into a particular field where he could see a large red or orange tarpaulin. Other witnesses allegedly confirmed they had seen it too, and that there was a white helicopter hovering overhead with a marksman waving away anyone who came close to the tent. One witness told journalist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Foot_ac53.html" title="Paul Foot">Paul Foot</a> that underneath the tarpaulin was a container, which was too large to be the flight recorder (<i>Ashton and Ferguson</i> 2001).</p>
<p>Whatever the tarpaulin was covering, most of the apparent intelligence activity in Lockerbie seems to have surrounded PA 103 victim Major Charles McKee or, more particularly, the contents of his suitcase. McKee was believed to be the leader of a Special Forces team that was about to attempt the rescue of American hostages held by <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> in the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. His heavily censored public file, available through the U.S. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_920f.html" title="Freedom of Information Act">Freedom of Information Act</a>, reveals that he was a career spy, highly thought of and that he undertook dangerous missions. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/timetrails/lockerbie/lock920427.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/timetrails/lockerbie/lock920427.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>American intelligence sources told journalists that McKee's suitcase contained details of his latest assignment, including the layout of buildings where the hostages were believed to be located. The suitcase was found by a dog-handler a few days before Christmas on Carruthers Farm, near Waterbeck. Two Americans, who said they worked for Pan Am, quickly came to remove it. They brought the suitcase back to the same spot later, minus much of its contents. On Christmas Eve, a group of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> police officers were asked to accompany the two Americans to <i>find</i> the suitcase. Before they arrived at the site the officers, realizing they were being duped and were expected to log it in as if for the first time, made their excuses and left. Two <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Police_c1b3.html" title="British Transport Police">British Transport Police</a> dog-handlers allegedly <i>found</i> the case for the Americans later on that day (<i>John Ashton and Ian Ferguson</i> 2001).</p>
<p>No evidence has emerged to support these allegations but, since so many journalists were told about them, it is widely assumed there is some truth in them. Lawyers for the two accused Libyans were concerned that if, as the stories indicated, the CIA was in fact removing evidence from the hills around Lockerbie, the integrity of the chain of evidence, crucial to a fair trial, may have been disturbed. Such concerns led to claims that the CIA not only removed evidence but planted it, too, in order to pin the blame for the PA 103 attack on Libya. In 2005, a retired senior Scottish police chief gave defence lawyers a signed statement, which confirmed the claims made in 2003 by a former CIA agent that his CIA bosses actually <i>wrote the script</i> to incriminate Libya. <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1855852005" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1855852005" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>

<p>A number of journalists considered that the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iranian</a> revenge motive (retaliation for the shooting down of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_Air_Flight_655_6aeb.html" title="Iran Air Flight 655">Iran Air Airbus</a> by <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Vincennes_%28CG-49%29_736c.html" title="USS Vincennes (CG-49)">USS <i>Vincennes</i></a>) was prematurely dismissed by investigators. They drew attention to a comment by former British prime minister <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in her 1993 memoirs, where she seemed to discount the Libya revenge motive (for <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_El_Dorado_Canyon_a04f.html" title="Operation El Dorado Canyon">the 1986 bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi</a> by the United States air force):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It turned out to be a more decisive blow against Libyan-sponsored terrorism than I could ever have imagined. ...There were revenge killings of British hostages organized by Libya, which I bitterly regretted. But the much-vaunted Libyan counter attack did not and could not take place... There was a marked decline in Libyan-sponsored terrorism in succeeding years" (<i>Thatcher</i> 1993, pp448-9).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many months after the bombing, the prime suspects were the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine_-_General_Command_1f88.html" title="Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command</a> (<a href="../../../p/f/l/PFLP-GC_3e05.html" title="PFLP-GC">PFLP-GC</a>), a Damascus-based rejectionist group led by former Syrian army captain <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Jibril_020b.html" title="Ahmed Jibril">Ahmed Jibril</a>.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

<div class="thumbcaption">Ahmed Jibril</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a February 1986 press conference, Jibril warned:"There will be no safety for any traveler on an Israeli or U.S. airliner" (<i>Cox and Foster</i> 1991, p28). Secret intercepts are believed to have recorded the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (<i>Pasdaran</i>) in Baalbeck, Lebanon making contact with the PFLP-GC immediately after the downing of the Airbus. Jibril is understood to have received $11 million from Iran (although a banking audit trail to confirm the payment has never been presented). The CIA allegedly intercepted a telephone call made two days after PA 103 by the Interior minister in Tehran to the Iranian embassy in Beirut, instructing the embassy to hand over the funds to Jibril and congratulating them on a successful operation.</p>
<p>A verifiable fact is that Jibril's right hand man, Hafez Dalkamoni, set up a PFLP-GC cell which was active in the Frankfurt and Neuss areas of West Germany in October 1988, two months before PA 103. During what Germany's internal security service, the <i>Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz</i> (BfV), called <i>Operation Herbstlaub</i> (Operation <i>autumn leaves</i>), the BfV kept cell members under strict surveillance. The plotters prepared a number of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improvised_explosive_device.html" title="Improvised explosive device">improvised explosive devices</a> (IEDs) hidden inside household electronic equipment. They discussed a planned operation in coded calls to Cyprus and Damascus: <i>oranges and apples</i> stood for detonating devices; <i>medicine and pasta</i> for <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semtex.html" title="Semtex">Semtex</a> explosive; and, <i>auntie</i> for the bomb carrier. One operative had been recorded as saying: "auntie should get off, but should leave the suitcase on the bus" (<i>Duffy and Emerson</i> 1990). The PFLP-GC cell had an experienced bomb-maker a Jordanian, Marwan Khreesat, to assist them. Khreesat made at least one IED inside a single-speaker <a href="../../../t/o/s/Toshiba.html" title="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> Bombeat 453 radio cassette recorder, similar to the twin speaker model RT-SF 16 Bombeat that was used to blow up PA 103. However, unlike the Lockerbie bomb with its sophisticated timer, Khreesat's IEDs contained a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barometric.html" title="Barometric">barometric</a> pressure device that triggers a simple timer with a range of up to 45 minutes before detonation.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to the PFLP-GC cell, its bomb-maker Khreesat was a Jordanian intelligence service (GID) agent and reported on the cell's activities to the GID, who relayed the information to Western intelligence and to the BfV. The Jordanians encouraged Khreesat to make the bombs but instructed him to ensure they were ineffective and would not explode. (A German police technician would however be killed, in April 1989, when trying to disarm one of Khreesat's IEDs). Through Khreesat and the GID, the Germans learned that the cell was surveying a number of targets, including Iberia Flight 888 from Madrid to Tel Aviv <i>via</i> Barcelona, chosen because the bomb-courier could disembark without baggage at Barcelona leaving the barometric trigger to activate the IED on the next leg of the journey. The date chosen, Khreesat reportedly told his handlers, was <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. He also told them that two members of the cell had been to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt_airport.html" title="Frankfurt airport">Frankfurt airport</a> to pick up Pan Am timetables.</p>
<p>Acting upon this intelligence, the German secret police moved in to arrest the PFLP-GC cell on October 26, raiding 14 apartments and arresting 17 men, fearing that to keep them under surveillance much longer was to risk losing control of the situation. Two cell members are known to have escaped arrest including Abu Elias, a resident of Sweden who, according to <i>Prime Time Live</i> (<i>ABC News</i> November 1989), was an expert in bombs sent to Germany to check on Khreesat's devices because of suspicions raised by Ahmed Jibril. Four IEDs were recovered but Khreesat revealed later that a fifth device had been taken away by Dalkamoni before the raid, and was never recovered. The link to PA 103 was further strengthened when Khreesat told investigators that, before joining the cell in Germany, he had bought five Toshiba Bombeat cassette radios from a smugglers' village in Syria close to the border with Lebanon, and made practice IEDs out of them in Jibril's training camp 20km (12 miles) away. The bombs were inspected by Abu Elias, who declared them to be good work. What became of these devices is not known.</p>
<p>Some journalists and PA 103 relatives believe that it is too stark a coincidence for a Toshiba cassette radio IED to have downed PA 103 just eight weeks after the arrest of the PFLP-GC cell in Frankfurt. Indeed, Scottish police actually wrote up an arrest warrant for Marwan Khreesat in the spring of 1989 but were persuaded by the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> not to issue it because of his value as an intelligence source. In the following spring, the late <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Hussein_of_Jordan_6a15.html" title="King Hussein of Jordan">King Hussein of Jordan</a> arranged for Khreesat to be interviewed by FBI agent, Edward Marshman, and the former head of the FBI's forensic lab, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Thurman_468c.html" title="Thomas Thurman">Thomas Thurman</a>, to whom he described in detail the bombs he had built. Some investigators and journalists have even speculated that Libyan and Iranian-paid agents may have worked on the bombing together; or, that one group handed the job over to a second group upon the arrest of the PFLP-GC cell members. The former CIA head of counter-terrorism, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Cannistraro_7c5c.html" title="Vincent Cannistraro">Vincent Cannistraro</a>, who previously worked on the PA 103 investigation, told reporters he believed the PFLP-GC planned the attack at the behest of the Iranian government, then sub-contracted it to Libyan intelligence after October 1988 because the arrests in Germany meant the PFLP-GC was unable to complete the operation.</p>
<p>Other theorists believe that whoever paid for the bombing arranged two parallel operations intended to ensure that at least one would succeed; or, that Jibril's cell in Germany was a red herring designed to attract the attention of the intelligence services, while the real bombers worked quietly elsewhere.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the bombing trial, lawyers for <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megrahi.html" title="Megrahi">Megrahi</a> argued that the PA 103 bomb could have started its journey at <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heathrow.html" title="Heathrow">Heathrow</a>, rather than at <a href="../../../l/u/q/Luqa_Airport_39a6.html" title="Luqa Airport">Luqa Airport</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a>.

The Iran Air terminal in Heathrow was adjacent to the Pan Am terminal, and the two airlines shared tarmac space. The lawyers invoked the 1990 Scottish Fatal Accident Inquiry and the evidence it heard that the baggage container AVE 4041, into which the bomb suitcase had been loaded, was left unsupervised at Heathrow for about forty minutes that afternoon.</p>

Abu Nidal in the early 1980s</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Nidal_1481.html" title="Abu Nidal">Abu Nidal</a> was widely regarded as the most ruthless international terrorist until that mantle was assumed by <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>. Nidal (<i>aka</i> Sabri al-Banna) was reported to have died in a shoot-out in Baghdad on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. A former senior member of his group, Atef Abu Bakr, told journalists that shortly before his death Abu Nidal had confided to Bakr that he had orchestrated the PA 103 bombing on behalf of Libya's <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muammar_al-Gaddafi_489b.html" title="Muammar al-Gaddafi">Colonel Gaddafi</a>.</p>
<p>After settling in Tripoli in 1985, Nidal and Gaddafi allegedly became close, Gaddafi sharing what <i>The Sunday Times</i> called "Abu Nidal's dangerous combination of an inferiority complex mixed with the belief that he was a man of destiny."<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-393455_1,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-393455_1,00.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p>According to Atef Abu Bakr, Gaddafi asked Nidal to coordinate with the head of Libyan intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, an attack on the U.S. in retaliation for the 1986 bombing of Benghazi and Tripoli. Nidal then organized the hijacking of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_73_4bf2.html" title="Pan Am Flight 73">Pan Am Flight 73</a> in Karachi on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">September 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> killing 22 passengers and wounding dozens of others. In August 1987, Abu Nidal allegedly tried again, this time using an unwitting bomb mule to carry a device on board a flight from Belgrade (airline unknown), but the bomb failed to explode. For PA 103, Senussi allegedly told Nidal to supply the bomb, and Libyan intelligence would arrange for it to be put on a flight. No evidence has been produced in support of this theory.</p>

<p>A theory for which no evidence has been produced suggests that the U.S. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (<a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>) had set up a protected drug route from Europe to the United States—allegedly called <i>Operation Corea</i>—which allowed Syrian drug dealers, led by Monzer al-Kassar (who was involved with <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_North_0de2.html" title="Oliver North">Oliver North</a> in the Iran-Contra scandal) to ship heroin to the U.S. using Pan Am flights, in exchange for intelligence on Palestinian groups based in Syria.</p>
<p>The CIA allegedly protected the suitcases containing the drugs and made sure they were not searched. On the day of the bombing, as the theory goes, terrorists exchanged suitcases: one with drugs for one with a bomb.</p>
<p>Another version of this theory is that the CIA knew in advance this exchange would take place but let it happen anyway, because the protected drugs route was a rogue operation, and the American intelligence officers on PA 103 – Matthew Gannon and Maj. Charles McKee – had found out about it, and were on their way to Washington to tell their superiors.</p>
<p>The former version of the protected-suitcase theory was suggested in October 1989 by <a href="../../../y/u/v/Yuval_Aviv_0a78.html" title="Yuval Aviv">Yuval Aviv</a>, the owner of Interfor Inc, a private investigation company based on Madison Avenue, New York. Aviv was a former <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> officer who led the "<a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Wrath_of_God_24a8.html" title="Operation Wrath of God">wrath of god</a>" team that assassinated a number of Palestinians who were believed to have been responsible for a massacre in 1972, when 11 Israeli Olympic athletes were killed by the Black September Palestinian group in Munich (see <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_massacre.html" title="Munich massacre">Munich massacre</a>). Aviv sold his story to Canadian journalist <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Jonas_d8d7.html" title="George Jonas">George Jonas</a>, who published it in 1984 as <i>Vengeance</i>, later made into a movie entitled <i>The Sword of Gideon</i> and in 2005 used as the basis for <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s movie <i><a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_%28film%29.html" title="Munich (film)">Munich</a></i>.</p>
<p>After PA 103, Aviv was employed by Pan Am as their lead investigator for the bombing. He submitted a report (the <i>Interfor</i> report) in October 1989, blaming the bombing on a CIA-protected drugs route (<i>Barrons</i> <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>). This scenario provided Pan Am with a credible defense against claims for compensation by relatives of victims, since, if the U.S. government had helped the bomb bypass Pan Am's security, the airline could hardly have been held liable. The Interfor report alleged <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html" title="List of Latin phrases"><i>inter alia</i></a> that Khalid Jafaar, a Lebanese-American passenger with links to <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, had unwittingly brought the bomb on board thinking he was carrying drugs on behalf of Syrian drug dealers he supposedly worked for.

Aviv was never interviewed by either the Scottish police or the FBI in connection with PA 103.</p>
<p>In 1990 the protected-suitcase theory was given a new lease of life by Lester Coleman in his book <i>Trail of the Octopus</i>. <a href="http://www.copi.com/octopus/temp/default.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.copi.com/octopus/temp/default.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.

Coleman claimed to have seen Khalid Jafaar in the DEA office in Nicosia, Cyprus once again implying that Jafaar was a drugs mule, but this time for the DEA instead of Syrian drug dealers. Despite no evidence being advanced to support Coleman's claims, the theory gained some credence when British journalist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Foot_ac53.html" title="Paul Foot">Paul Foot</a> wrote a glowing review of Coleman's book for the London Review of Books. <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/media/lockrbie.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/media/lockrbie.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> But on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>—four months before his death—Foot reverted to the orthodox Iran/PFLP-GC theory in an article he wrote for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> entitled "Lockerbie's dirty secret."<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Lockerbie/Story/0,2763,1182524,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Lockerbie/Story/0,2763,1182524,00.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></p>

<p>According to conspiracy theorist and self-styled private investigator <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Vialls_ecf0.html" title="Joe Vialls">Joe Vialls</a>, who died in July 2005, the bomb on PA 103 was triggered not by a sophisticated timing device but by the technique of <b>radio detonation</b>.<a href="http://www.vialls.com/archives/trigger1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vialls.com/archives/trigger1.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></p>

Explosion occurs shortly after <i>Maid of the Seas</i> passes Dean Cross navigational radio beacon</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Vialls theory relies on the fact that each <a href="../../../v/o/r/VOR_1567.html" title="VOR">navigational beacon</a> has its own unique <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_frequency.html" title="Radio frequency">radio frequency</a>, which is usually in the range 108.0 to 117.95 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megahertz.html" title="Megahertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) <a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_High_Frequency_84ad.html" title="Very High Frequency">VHF</a>. The Dean Cross beacon, shown at the bottom left of the map, marked the start of PA 103's final track on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. <i>Maid of the Seas</i> would then have been flying at about 500 <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_per_hour.html" title="Miles per hour">mph</a> between Dean Cross beacon and where it crashed on the town of <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockerbie.html" title="Lockerbie">Lockerbie</a>, an overall distance of thirty two miles representing a point-to-point flight time of barely four minutes. As PA 103 passed overhead the Dean Cross beacon, a light would have flashed on in the cockpit alerting the pilots to change frequency in order to obtain permission for the Atlantic crossing from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanwick_Oceanic_Control_3294.html" title="Shanwick Oceanic Control">Shanwick Oceanic Control</a> at <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prestwick.html" title="Prestwick">Prestwick</a>, Scotland. Using standard reaction times, according to Vialls, it would have taken between three and five minutes for the crew to be ready to communicate on the new frequency. In its PA 103 report, the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Accident_Investigation_Branch_a7a1.html" title="Air Accident Investigation Branch">Air Accident Investigation Branch</a> (AAIB) stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"At 18.58 hrs the aircraft established two-way radio contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control on frequency 123.95 MHz. At 19.02:44 hrs the clearance delivery officer at Shanwick transmitted to the aircraft its oceanic route clearance. The aircraft did not acknowledge this message and made no subsequent transmission." The AAIB report continued: "The cockpit voice recorder tape was listened to for its full duration and there was no indication of anything abnormal with the aircraft, or unusual crew behaviour. The tape record ended, at 19.02:50 hrs ± 1 second, with a sudden loud sound on the cockpit area microphone channel followed almost immediately by the cessation of recording whilst the crew were copying their transatlantic clearance from Shanwick ATC."<a href="http://www.aaib.gov.uk/sites/aaib/cms_resources/dft_avsafety_pdf_503158.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaib.gov.uk/sites/aaib/cms_resources/dft_avsafety_pdf_503158.pdf" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Vialls radio detonation theory can work in one of two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A command radio signal is simply sent to the target from the ground (or from another aircraft); or,</li>
<li>The command radio signal is generated within the target itself at a specific time based on known frequencies and flight routing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vialls cited the following example of how the Israelis used the technique of radio detonation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the late 1980s, Israeli intelligence managed to slip a new cellular phone to a <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> leader. The phone had already been booby-trapped with Semtex explosive and a radio trigger. By carefully listening to the telephone frequencies, the Israelis were able to monitor the times when the Hamas leader actually had the cellular phone pressed to his ear. As soon as they were sure they had the right man, an Israeli pilot in an F15 Eagle sent a coded radio "squawk" to the cellular phone, which blew the Hamas leader's head off. Either of the two radio triggering techniques could have achieved the same result with this cellular phone bomb.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The inside of a Boeing 747 is like a "Faraday cage" which would ensure that secondary emissions—from the captain's radio message to Shanwick Oceanic Control, for example—would be sufficient to activate the radio trigger of the bomb. Thus the PA 103 bomb could have been triggered by an internally-generated command radio signal transmitted to or received from Shanwick. However, Vialls believed that the extent of the damage caused to the aircraft meant that the bomb was probably positioned close to the fuselage, rather than—as the prosecution maintained at the trial—being wrapped in clothing, packed in a suitcase and loaded inside a baggage container. <a href="http://www.vialls.com/archives/bombs3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vialls.com/archives/bombs3.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>The location of the bomb and its type have also been called into question by explosives engineer, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Parkes_8765.html" title="John H. Parkes">John H. Parkes</a>, who shortly after the crash was present at the scene. Parkes was not called as a witness at the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_bombing_trial_b026.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial">trial</a> but has recently commented:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Every munitions or explosives device has its own characteristic signature. The signature I saw was not consistent with the device they maintained was used."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Parkes believes that there might have been a cargo of munitions in the hold of the aircraft, and these could have been detonated by specific radio frequencies.<a href="http://premium.news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=1187632006" class="external autonumber" title="http://premium.news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=1187632006" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>
<p>The radio detonation theory would probably rule out Libya from responsibility for the PA 103 bombing (although the Swiss firm <a href="../../../m/e/b/Mebo.html" title="Mebo">Mebo</a> – which was proven at the trial to have supplied sophisticated timing devices to Libya – actually fitted briefcases with the electronic equipment required to radio-detonate <a href="../../../i/e/d/IED_de84.html" title="IED">IEDs</a>). Similarly, Syria and Iran – the other "usual suspects" and/or their sponsored terrorist groups – would have been unlikely to have had either the expertise or the technology to carry out a radio detonation. This leaves Israel, which originally developed the technique, and whose intelligence service, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a>, Vialls himself blamed for the PA 103 bombing. But Israel had no plausible motive for sabotaging PA 103. However, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid South Africa</a> is alleged to have had such a motive, and this is examined below in the South-West Africa (Namibia) theory.</p>

Carlsson was met at the airport by <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankole_Timothy_40ff.html" title="Bankole Timothy">Bankole Timothy</a> of De Beers and taken by car to London. After the meeting with De Beers, Carlsson was brought back to Heathrow Airport, arriving at about 17:30. Carlsson's already checked-in suitcase would have remained at Heathrow airport for about seven hours, thus providing South African airside-authorized personnel with ample opportunity to substitute it for the bomb suitcase.

<p>That SAA were involved in unlawfully switching baggage that day was confirmed by a Pan Am security officer, Michael Jones, at the Lockerbie fatal accident inquiry (FAI) in October <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>. Jones told the FAI a breach of aviation rules had been committed because the suitcase of South African passenger, Miss Nicola Hall, had been put on the earlier Pan Am 101 flight (with Pik Botha's delegation) whereas Miss Hall was booked–and died–on PA 103.</p>
<p><b>Making a link between theories</b></p>
<p>The theory of <b>radio detonation</b> can be linked to this theory because the South African government of the time had been accused by Soviet accident investigators of employing a decoy navigational radio beacon to cause the 1986 <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambican_Tupolev_Tu-134_air_disaster_3de0.html" title="Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 air disaster">Tupolev Tu-134 air crash</a>, in which <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samora_Machel_f6db.html" title="Samora Machel">Samora Machel</a> (then president of neighbouring <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambique.html" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>) was killed.<a href="http://www.news24.com/Content_Display/TRC_Report/2chap6a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news24.com/Content_Display/TRC_Report/2chap6a.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></p>
<p>It has been suggested the SA military intelligence operatives would have installed the bomb on PA 103 once it was confirmed that their target, Bernt Carlsson, was to join the flight at Heathrow. As per the theory of <b>radio detonation</b>, the bomb would have been set to detonate when PA 103 was prompted by the Dean Cross navigational beacon to re-tune to 123.95 MHz, Shanwick Oceanic Control's unique radio frequency.</p>
<p><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p>Within a week of the death of Bernt Carlsson on flight PA 103, his office safe at the United Nations had allegedly been broken into. And his apartment, which had been sealed by the UN's security staff, had also apparently been burgled. Furthermore, neither his girl-friend, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanya_Popovic_923a.html" title="Sanya Popovic">Sanya Popovic</a>, nor his sister, Inger Carlsson-Musser, was able to identify 'one single shred of anything in his checked luggage at the property store in Lockerbie'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"His bag was sitting at Heathrow, in the baggage area, from early that day. There is quite an important question about it, as neither I nor his sister was able to identify the bag. Just didn't seem like his (it was apparently immediately underneath the one containing the bomb, and quite considerably shattered). Not to mention the size was totally off (much too small)," says Sanya Popovic.</dd>
<dd>"I was quite surprised to find that despite our reactions to that bag, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crown_1431.html" title="The Crown">the Crown</a> chose to say there was a definitive identification. Which there certainly wasn't," declared Sanya Popovic.</dd>

<p><b>Substitute administrator</b></p>
<p>Because of the death of UN Commissioner Carlsson the day before signature of the Namibia independence agreement, and the likely time it would take the UN to appoint a replacement for him, the South African government proposed its administrator-general, Louis Pienaar, should continue to administer South-West Africa (Namibia) in the run-up to that territory's first universal franchise election to be held in November 1989. Carlsson's role in designing the initial independence constitution of Namibia as well as administering the territory in the run-up to the elections was thus denied.</p>
<p>The main opposition party, <a href="../../../s/w/a/SWAPO_b7bb.html" title="SWAPO">SWAPO</a>, swept to power with 57% of the vote – but short of the two-thirds necessary for SWAPO to be able to change the constitution that South Africa imposed on Namibia.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that apartheid South Africa – at the time a regional superpower armed with <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction_4208.html" title="South Africa and weapons of mass destruction">nuclear weapons</a> and with technologically-advanced aerospace companies such as <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentron.html" title="Kentron">Kentron</a> and highly-qualified individuals such as the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry_Four_1b1d.html" title="Coventry Four">Coventry Four</a> – would have had the expertise to design an explosive device capable of bringing down an aircraft. Moreover, its so-called <i>dirty tricks division</i> (Directorate of Military Intelligence) – with links to western intelligence – would have been fully aware of the arrest of the PFLP-GC Frankfurt cell; the "Helsinki warning"; and, the motives of both Libya and Iran for revenge against the United States.</p>

<p>None of the seven alternative theories can be proved without either a further criminal investigation or a fully-documented admission to the crime. Because <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdelbaset_Ali_Mohmed_Al_Megrahi_1784.html" title="Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi">Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</a> was found guilty at the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_bombing_trial_b026.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial">Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial</a>, Libya continues to be held responsible for the Lockerbie bombing, and has paid <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">$</a>2.16 billion in compensation to the families of the 270 victims. However, as a result of a 3-year investigation by the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Criminal_Cases_Review_Commission_6aaf.html" title="Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission">Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission</a>, Megrahi could be granted a second appeal against his conviction during 2007, in which case <b>alternative theories of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103</b> could be considered by criminal investigation authorities.</p>
