<p>Regarding the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersexual.html" title="Intersexual">intersexual</a> article: thank you for your lengthy critique; please feel free to edit boldly to bring the article up to scratch. There is no single author for any Wikipedia article; we rely on peer review and editing to continually revise each article, driving out mediocrity and errors. The theory is that as articles get better, they engage the attention of progressively better qualified editors, who correct their flaws until (we hope) excellence is achieved. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 09:47, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alteripse, and welcome again to wikipedia.</p>
<p>No worries about the GH formatting, it's nice to see the article grow so much!</p>
<p>There are a few pages that explain Wikipedia formatting (e.g <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page</a>), but here are a few basics (if you haven't picked them up already).</p>
<dl>
<dd>==Heading== will make a heading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a [[link]]. Will make a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link.html" title="Link">link</a> like that.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>'''Bold''' and ''italic''. -&gt; <b>Bold</b> and <i>italic</i></dd>

<p>Hi Alteripse, thanks for your comment in the "doctors' mess". Would you consider joining the Wikipedia doctors clicque? Please add your name to the <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_WikiDoc_0c2a.html#List_of_members_.28in_formation.29" title="User:Jfdwolff/WikiDoc">list of members</a>!<br />
Concerning my nice metabolic diagrams: I usually look up a few textbook or online sources and draw them in the OpenOffice.org vector diagram program. Do you have any special requests? I'll gladly draw an image for an existing article (I can always recycle them whenever I need to give a talk!) Just don't ask me to do <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coagulation.html" title="Coagulation">coagulation</a>—there's so many different diagrams around that I would be a bit out of my depth... <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a><br />

I think it's what makes Wikipedia great. If you've got good content for <a href="../../../h/g/h/HGH_quackery_5c79.html" title="HGH quackery">HGH quackery</a>, by all means, add it.

<p>Hi, I just saw your answers to my comments. I think we basically will end up agreeing on most things (especially the weird vocabulary), but until later tonight I will not have time to answer your comments. I have wanted to revisit some of these articles myself. I spent lots of time a year ago working on some of them and then seeing them gradually twisted out of shape by edits by other people. -- Things can get quite political. You cannot change people's beliefs directly, but you can change people's understanding of what the facts are. More later. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a></p>
<p>I have put a kind of outline on a "sandbox" page at <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_Sex_discussion_7ca7.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran/Sex discussion">User:Patrick0Moran/Sex_discussion</a>, not necessarily with the intent of using any of it directly, but in the hope that the proper outline of sex and related topics can be elucidated.

<p>Thank you for your comments and corrections on my talk page. I like the Sex article as it now stands. Having that fundamental document in good order will make it easier to straighten out kinks in related areas. (I am always amazed at the absolutist statements people who are not in the laboratory can make on the basis of what they have heard and believed or have simply assumed. For instance, I have read statements to the effect that "most spiders are too small to bite humans" many times. A few days ago I collected an immature (2 mm.) web weaver (Cyclosa conica) by the simple expedient of swiping my hand through the central part of her web where she was hidden in a little "rope" made of her collection of recent kills. I couldn't see her until I had disturbed her enough to make her leave her lair. But she could sense me clearly enough to bite me twice, once on each of the two most easily available fingers. Of course the perforations were too small to be visible to the naked eye, so it may be that I just *felt* that I had been bitten.) Anyway, I am sure that I make my share of absolutist statements. Thanks for knocking the rough edges off. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 17:16, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand exactly -- the RD is a tough place to be, tougher for the scientists among us (IMO), and the material they were looking to manufacture is indeed harmful. The only objection I had to your comment is that it would merely confuse the user -- straightforwardly telling them it was a dangerous chemical that was far more complicated than "altered calcium" would have been more direct. But the alchemy quip was "too good to not say", and I recognize that. I'm tired these days for non-Wiki reasons, and so some things strike a nerve unintentionally -- it happened that your comment made me grumpy because I had no idea how to respond to them, and I had hoped that the question could be left unanswered, but then I felt "forced" to respond when I saw your remark and thought it would just tick the questioner off. All ended very well, and I fully understand and respect your reasons for your actions -- not a big deal to me at all. Thank you for your compliments -- I must say, I am impressed by your work here, and very glad of your intelligence and reason when dealing with some of this site's less reasonable contributors. My best wishes to you, and please, keep the humor aloft at the reference desk -- I need a good laugh now and then.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 16:20, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>good! I knew we'd find something! except I'm a bit worried we may not be very far apart. For the fourth offense, or a repeat reincarnation the proposal states: " threshold 1 counter-productive edits (that is no warning), block 96 hours". doesn't that basically show the troublemakers the door pretty quickly? and it then means that we can put our collective hands on our collective hearts and say "justice was done" and was seen to be done. That nameless snot at the doctor page is an admin. I think they do need some limits put on them.

<p>Your statement on <a href="../../../f/l/u/User_talk%7EFlurdy_e0fd.html" title="User talk:Flurdy">User talk:Flurdy</a> that "Any user can delete any page" is incorrect.

<dd>Thanks for the <b>ovation</b>. The drawing took me about 2 hours to make, mainly because my computer crashed 3 times.

<p>Can I offer a bit of friendly advice? When someone acts patronisingly, ignore them. I don't think he was actually trying to upset you, he's just not as good as you as putting his point across and so inadvertently (I believe) managed to insult you.</p>
<p>When I find myself getting worked up I type my replies into a word processor instead of the edit box. That way I can sleep on it. Everything looks better after a nights sleep.

<dd>Further, I suggest removing the para from the talk page.

<p>I am a little surprised to hear from both of you asking me to back off. I very carefully made no insults or personal attacks when asking him for a discussion, and tried to be friendly even in the second response, yet there was nothing in his replies but ad hominem invective and strawman arguments. I finally got exasperated. I haven't run into pollinator before. I gather you two don't consider him worth chiding from prior experience? I would withdraw the comparison with mnh, but I don't think I can delete an edit message. My last response seems temperate and evidence-based compared with some of the flame wars around here, but in the interest of not offending people I will remove it. Do you both solemnly swear you refrain from responding when some fool implies he knows what kind of stereotyped person you are because you requested a discussion? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">Alteripse</a> 16:05, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I solemnly swear I try to, frequently imperfectly I must admit. (It hurts, because I can do <i>really good</i> scathing abuse if I care enough to.) I occasionally put myself in danger of breaking a molar gritting my teeth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not so much danger of offending people, but that I suspect it wouldn't help dealing with this type of person at all. I have no experience of this particular example, but in general the not quite rational are best dealt with as black boxes, ignoring the words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if they really do turn out to be NMH types - insistently, self-righteously obnoxious - rationality from their debate opponents makes it blindingly obvious to onlookers and, if it comes to that, the Arbitration Committee. 'Cos some people just can't be convinced that walking into the whirling blades is a bad idea. I have no idea if this particular example is like that, I think (and hope) not since he accepts the compromise in this case. Maybe he will learn by example.

<dd>It was not my intention to tell you to back off in the sense you seem to imply. (I don't consider it you fault or anything) It's just that I could see he was getting to you. In answer to your question- Yes I have run across pollinator before, although only on one occasion. I wouldn't go as far as saying that I don't consider him worth chiding, but I do feel that you were the most likely to reaspond favourably to my suggestion. I do solemnly swear to try my best not to allow people to wind me up, but if I fail to keep my cool I expect you, David, or anyone else I respect to remind me on my talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 16:24, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I am the one who was changing spelling (Paediatric). I actually made the change in a couple of places only to see what the reaction was and was about put a comment on the talk page asking what the policy was (then I remembered my GI exam tomorrow...). So thanks for the note and I totally agree. Are we supposed to just make redirect pages for the alternate spelling? I am also a little confused about the category hierarchy. I added <a href="../../../n/e/o/Category%7ENeonatology_6553.html" title="Category:Neonatology">Category:Neonatology</a> under peds and was waiting to see what would happen.</p>
