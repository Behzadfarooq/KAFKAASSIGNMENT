<dd>I personally have never heard or seen the term "alter-globalization" used in English (though, having googled it, it does produce some hits - 615) and have only seen "altermondialisation" used once or twice, as a consciously foreign term. I don't like the term "alter-globalization" myself - the French sounds better, but no one has thought of a decent English equivalent. The most common English equivalents, I would say, are expressions such as "ethical globalization", "social democratic globalization", "global justice" - of course, none means quite the same thing as "altermondialisation". - 7 Oct 2004</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this article should NOT be merged with "Anti-Globalization", because the proponents of Alter-globalization try to distinguish their agenda from pure anti-globalizaiton. Instead BOTH should be merged in some form with "Globalization".</p>
<p><br />
I understand a merge would defeat the purpose of the word, as it is an alternative to the simplistic characterisation of "anti-globalism" after the Seattle events. However, if you were to expand this topic under its current name, you would find out almost all anti-globalists are alter-globalists in one way or another. Also, the question which group belongs where will be the subject of debate. I think a merge is best, but the anti-globalism article should thenemphasise many activist do not like the term, because in their view they are advocating a different kind of globalism. The nature of this alternative globalisation should also be made clear.</p>
<p>I think such a solution would lead to an objective article, which does justice to the movement and is easily accessible for anyone.</p>

<p>I agree and support this as a seperate but related page. Alter-globalism is quiet distinct in that it puts forward distinct and real alternatives to the dominant discourse. In response tp the last statement, pure anti-globalists reject internationalism, for example some trade union advocates, while alter globals want a reform of the global system, but maintain an internationalist ethos.</p>
<p>JR 20 July 2005</p>
<p><br />
Anti-globalization and Alter-globalization seems like 2 separate idea. The former is against globalization itself while the latter accepts globalization. Hence, I'm against merging but should be mentioned on each page's "see also". <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 18:34, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I made the following changes for the stated reasons:</p>
<p>1) Changed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term is a positive distinction from the more widely-used and negative word '<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a>'.</dd>
</dl>
<p>to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term is considered distinct from the more widely-used word '<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a>', which is thought to be pejorative by members of the movement.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Calling one term "positive" and another "negative" because some people don't like it is POV. The new version keeps the content, without POV issues.</p>
<p>2) Changed "demands" to the more neutral "advocates" in the first sentence.</p>
<p>3) Changed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It mainly opposes the way international institutions (such as the <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_1c1a.html" title="WTO">WTO</a>, the <a href="../../../i/m/f/IMF_5a61.html" title="IMF">IMF</a>, and the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>) work towards First World economic interests.</dd>
</dl>
<p>to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The movement mainly opposes the way it believes that international institutions (such as the <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_1c1a.html" title="WTO">WTO</a>, the <a href="../../../i/m/f/IMF_5a61.html" title="IMF">IMF</a>, and the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>) work towards First World economic interests.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The word "belief", notwithstanding NPOV policy, is as POV as the previous sentence. Why? Because a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">belief</a> is a type of personal opinion, comparable to <a href="../../../d/o/x/Doxa.html" title="Doxa">doxa</a>, hence false, as opposed to reason. Wouldn't "allegedly work" be more NPOV? There are many reasons to substain (<a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stiglitz_b30e.html" title="Joseph Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a> for one) that the IMF and the WTO work for First World economic interests, even if this formulation is not sufficient, as it is stained by an artificial opposition between 1st and 2nd World vs Third World (which bypass the internal class struggle in each country and the global class struggle, which is not assimilable to an opposition between poor countries and rich countries; i.e. they are very wealthy people in poor countries, and very poor people in rich countries). <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clarifies that the AG movement, not "neoliberal globalization" is in opposition to WTO/IMF/etc. Also, the original passage insinuates a controversial point as fact, that is, that WTO et al work only toward 1st world interests.</p>
<p>4) Deleted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>French members of the movement preferred the term "alter-mondialization", which is more positive and constructive, and more revealing of its principled stances, than the simple opposition suggested by the "anti-globalization" label.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought about rewriting it, but the difference between the terms is already spelled out in the first paragraph The "positive and constructive" stuff is pure POV. Rewrote the following sentence to stand alone without its precursor. Changed "true" to "different", POV.</p>
<p>5) Deleted "and shed light on" in the first sentence of the second to last paragraph. Redundant for "report on", and somewhat hagiographic.</p>

<p>The first few paragraphs had some repetition which occurred during the merging of two ex-articles. It may need some refactoring. Cheers. – <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> 13:31, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Clean-up tag because the article repeats itself several times. It could be much more shorter and precise. Beside, it certainly shouldn't be merged with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a>, since, as the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Justice_Movement_084b.html" title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a>, it is an alternative term which aims at not being classified by the dominant ideology as proponents of national sovereignty. It is not true that most "anti-globalization" are "alter-globalization", if (and only if) one includes in the anti-globalization category nationalist parties opposed to globalization and to international law. However, I do wonder if this article couldn't be merged with the Global Justice Movement, which seems to be the English version of an alternate expression to the "anti-globalization" tag which has been put on opponents to neoliberalism. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 19:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to give you a view from France:</p>
<p>"altermondialisme" is the union of diverse movements (associations, NGOs, political parties, etc) such as ecologist movements, anarchist movements, some marxist movements, etc, that contest the liberal globalization. It is similar to what you call in english "global justice movement".</p>
<p>"antimondialisme" is all the movements that are against globalization. And those movements doesn't create an union. In France, the far right nationalists is quite anti-globalist but they don't belong to the "alter-globalist" movement. In the same way, the french political party "Force Ouvrière" (a radical marxist party) is clearly anti-globalist but take it's distance from the "alter-globalist" movement.</p>
<p>It's important not to confuse those terms. Some anti-"alter-globalists" confuse the terms, they try to create an union between far-right nationalists and "alter-globalist" which doesn't exist.

<p>I have never heard the words "alter-globalization" or "altermondialism" used in English. I would expect that if it is used at all, it is used either as a self-conscious Gallicism or an explicit French loanword (with French pronunciation).</p>
<p>What do people think of the idea of moving this to "altermondialisme", treating it as a French word, and not attempting any sort of "innovative" anglicism? --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 03:14, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
