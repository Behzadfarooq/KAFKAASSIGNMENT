<p>The article just needs separating into sections logically (perhaps by different types of alternation as specified in the article, eg phonological, grammatical, etc).

<p>The processes described in this page are normally known as <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allophony.html" title="Allophony">allophony</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allomorph.html" title="Allomorph">allomorphy</a>, which are well described elsewhere; the pages that formerly linked here did so erroneously; aside from being currently incorrect all over, the very existence of the page lacks merit. I think time spent to fix it up would be wasted. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 17:39, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Allophony and allomorphy are not the same thing as alternations, though. Alternations are descriptive facts about data from which theoretical arguments for allophony and allomorphy can be made. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 19:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And yet, the things described on this page are allophony and allomorphy. Except that they're described poorly and with many errors here, and much better on the pages <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allophone.html" title="Allophone">Allophone</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allomorph.html" title="Allomorph">Allomorph</a>. I'm not sure you even <i>could</i> break out a separate page for "alternation" by itself; for instance, you can't really say that aspirated and unaspirated 't' are "in alternation" in the words "top" and "stop" until you first identify them as allophonic variants of a phonemic /t/. I think that the idea of "alternation" should just be discussed on the other two pages, possibly with a stub here. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 08:08, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, "top" and "stop" don't show an alternation particularly well, but the example I gave below of "wait" and "waiting" does. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 09:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>the s/z pluralization is far more common than the -en pluralization. There are two ways of analyzing this type of difference, depending on the specific case.

<dd>But that was the point! It could have been stated more clearly, but the intention was to say that although <i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i> before a vowel, this is not an automatic alternation, precisely because it <i>doesn't</i> happen in the phrase <i>sofa application</i>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 08:23, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Assume I know nothing, you'll not be too wrong. &#160;:-) But isn't the 'a' in "<i>sO</i>fa" different to the standalone "a"? Being preceeded by the f changes it slightly. At the least, it changes what sounds right. This may be a stupid question, but why can't it be automatic in the case "an apple" while not being automatic in the case of "sofa apple"? Also, how does that fit with English tending not to have the pronunciation of words impacted by neighbouring words, at least not when compared to a language like French?</dd>
<dd>To restate the question, why does our ability to say "sofa apple" mean that we are not forced by the phonology to say "an apple". Assuming you agree that we can't say "a apple", what is that if not automatic alternation?</dd>
<dd>I'm not trying to be difficult. I fear that I may nonetheless be being difficult. If so, sorry. Just try to help me here. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 10:12, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The /f/ in <i>sofa</i> doesn't change the fact that you have the vowel /ə/ before another vowel in the phrase "sofa application", and yet no /n/ gets inserted between them. The point is that English phonology does not have a general rule inserting /n/ every time a word ending in /ə/ precedes another word starting with a vowel; only the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indefinite_article.html" title="Indefinite article">indefinite article</a> <i>a</i> does that. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 10:48, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So it's not 'automatic alternation' unless it always applies to a given combination of letters? What if it applied to some words, but not others? Can you give an example of automatic alternation in english? And how do we describe -a/-an? Is it simply "gramaticaly conditioned"?
<dl>
<dd><i>Where a particular alternate is used because the alternative would 'sound wrong', it is called an automatic alternation.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is this sentance is wrong? Or am I just reading too much into a/an sounding wrong to me?</dd>
<dd>Last stupid question (for tonight); under <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoneme.html" title="Phoneme">phoneme</a> it says that "A phonemically "perfect" alphabet is one that has a single symbol for each phoneme" which implies, though it's not made particular explicit, that in most real languages at least some letters have multiple phonemes?

<p>Right, it's an automatic alternation if it always applies to the same sound(s) under the same circumstance(s). An example from American English is <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flapping.html" title="Flapping">flapping</a>, the alternation between the voiceless t-sound [t] in a word like <i>wait</i> and the voiced ultrashort d-like sound <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> in <i>waiting</i> and <i>waiter</i>. You get the same alternation whenever a word ending in the [t] sound receives a suffix that starts with a vowel, as in <i>hot</i>/<i>hotter</i>, <i>bite</i>/<i>biting</i>. The sentence you quote above is wrong to suggest that only the failure to apply an automatic alternations "sounds wrong", because the failure to apply non-automatic alternations "sounds wrong" too. Also, the failure to apply an automatic alternation doesn't <i>necessarily</i> "sound wrong" either; in the case of <i>wait</i>/<i>waiting</i>, it doesn't actually sound wrong to use the voiceless [t] of <i>wait</i> in the word <i>waiting</i>, it just sounds a little stiff or formal, or just very carefully pronounced. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>When a rule exists for determining which alternate to use, based on the surrounding sounds, the alternation is called a phonologically conditioned alternation.

<dd>Some people would say they're completely identical, that all automatic alternations are phonologically conditioned and all phonologically conditioned alternations are automatic. Other people would say that while all automatic alternations are phonologically conditioned, some non-automatic alternations are phonologically conditioned as well (i.e. it's the <i>phonology</i> of English rather than allomorphy that changes <i>a</i> to <i>an</i> before a vowel, even though it doesn't apply to any other word). —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:31, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
