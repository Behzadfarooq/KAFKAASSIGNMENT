<p>Hi alteripse - after reading all the commentary, you will note that I ended up going with a "death" phrasing at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> and eliminating the political controversy talk, since the concensus seemed to be that it belonged elsewhere. This keeps getting edited, so it is hard to know how to phrase it.</p>

<p>Hey there, Alteripse! Compliments on your amazingly extensive additions to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia.html" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia">CAH</a> -- your work is truly impressive. However, I noticed some potentially negative connotation in one of your latest additions:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, surgery for <b>severely</b> virilized XX infants is often performed and has become a subject of debate in the last decade.</i> (my emphasis)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Considering the strong feelings over CAH and its potential for "correction" (and considering that some feel that CAH isn't something to be <i>corrected</i>), I'd hesitate to use the phrase "<i>severely</i> virilized" because of its negative <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connotation.html" title="Connotation">connotation</a>. Maybe "<i>extensively</i> virilized" (or something of the sort) may be better? Naturally, <i>severely</i> may fit the bill; you're the authoritative one here, of course. I just figured I'd bring it to your attention&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDiberri_3d04.html" title="User:Diberri">Diberri</a> | <a href="../../../d/i/b/User_talk%7EDiberri_54fd.html" title="User talk:Diberri">Talk</a> 05:02, Jul 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; you should look at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html#What_do_we_use_redirects_for.3F" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect#What do we use redirects for?</a> if you haven't already done so. Not only is redirecting from an alternative capitalization a good idea in most cases (it prevents accidental duplication of articles and may help in searches; the fact that you started the article capitalized shows at least <i>someone</i> might link to it by that title), but it is also best to redirect rather than delete, generally speaking. You did a cut-and-paste move (usually a <i>bad thing</i>); and while you were the only contributor to the article and therefore only your edits would have been deleted, saving page histories is a <i>good thing</i> in most cases (due to the GFDL and other reasons). Most people like to keep their contributions (sometimes even the erroneous ones), so I'm a bit confused; but I'm sorry if this has upset you. Did my explanation help at all? -- <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 03:33, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>No big deal either way. It just seems more consistent to delete since we don't routinely suggest creating such an "all-caps" redirect for every article on purpose. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">Alteripse</a> 03:49, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>At <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Peter_Reimer_3fed.html" title="David Peter Reimer">David Peter Reimer</a>, those with a <i>special</i> interest in circumcision try to change the reasons for circumcising Bruce. To get you up to speed, this is a quick summery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Months ago, we <i>(you, I, others)</i> determined that the stated reason Max Cham and Jean Huot claimed <i>(<a href="../../../p/h/i/Phimosis.html" title="Phimosis">phimosis</a>)</i> was impossible <i>(or universal and benign)</i> because the prÃ¦puce and glans are fused and the prÃ¦putial opening is too small in infancy. Gairdner 1948 Whither the foreskin?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We determined that the most probable true diagnosis was deliberate iatrogenic <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis.html" title="Balanitis">balanitis</a> from deliberate forced retraction for cleaning leading to deliberate iatrogenic <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis.html" title="Balanitis">balanitis</a> deliberately misdiagnosed as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phimosis.html" title="Phimosis">phimosis</a> in order to get the circumcision-fee. We detetmined this because tens of millions of other babies in North America had deliberate iatrogenic <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis.html" title="Balanitis">balanitis</a> from forced retraction for cleaning leading to deliberate iatrogenic <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis.html" title="Balanitis">balanitis</a> deliberately misdiagnosed as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phimosis.html" title="Phimosis">phimosis</a> in order to get the circumcision-fee in the twentieth century. It is just the most probable cause.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yesterday, <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">User:Jakew</a> removed all of the information about this being a deliberate misdiagnosis of deliberate iatrogenic <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis.html" title="Balanitis">balanitis</a> from deliberate forced retraction for cleaning leading to deliberate iatrogenic <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis.html" title="Balanitis">balanitis</a> deliberately misdiagnosed as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phimosis.html" title="Phimosis">phimosis</a> in order to get the circumcision-fee. and made it look like Max Cham and Huot are nice fellows. This just so happens to suite the <i>special</i> interest in universal circumcision this individual has.</li>
</ul>
<p>Â¿Could you please help? Â¿Could you write what you believe the true probable diagnosis is and why? Could you help rewrite the section of the article about diagnosis?</p>

<p>There are two Syndromes X: cardiac and metabolic.

<p>Hi. Thanks for your best wishes. I am awe-struck at your output, I have quite a way to go before I can match that. The problem is that the more pages I write, the bigger is the list of links to them which have to be written. I suppose I ought to go back to the start of my list and systematically write pages for the links in them, before starting anything totally new. I have been very busy of late in my day-job with a couple of big editing and writing projects, but once I am clear of them and have more time --- I wish! <a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> 14:30, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You had the nerve to claim on my talk page that my last edit on the talk page of the article were "insulting" and wanted to know whether we could resolve the dispute. Well, obviously not, since you seem to regard the mentioning of facts you don't like as insults, and obviously, without facts we cannot resolve the dispute. Anyway, since I do not know whether you would read the answer on my talk page, I copied it here, too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you joking? You were the one who reverted to a POV-pushing version and ranted and insulted me for trying to improve "your" article. And obviously my edits shows much more "intellectual support" for what I wrote than your, too. So maybe you ought to try and to better the next time - like checking facts and not insulting people, for example. However, if you consider my last comment on the talk page as "primary insulting", then obviously there is no basis whatever for a meaningful debate between us, and that clearly shows that you have neither the capacity not the willingness to resolve the problem. Well, so be it. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 15:45, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>On the site from where I search for the PDB, it's a bit hard to distinguish 'l' from '1' because of the font they use. When my program couldn't find 1GLK, I incorrectly assumed it was 1G1K. I thought it looked weird, but figured maybe it was a dimer or one was the catalytic site while the other was the regulation -- I'm not really that familiar with that enzyme. Thanks for catching that and it's fixed now</li>
<li>I apologize for removing the empty headers, especially since it messed things up. I wasn't aware you were still working on them.</li>
<li>In the original formula, there were '=', so I figured someone forgot to push shift, since that's how you get the '+' sign (at least, on many US keyboards). It was an oversight on my part, I'm not contesting the validity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Re: our "friend", it's really sad that these types of things seem to leak in everywhere. If I wanted those kinds of problems, I'd go edit Creationism or something like that. Sigh... --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 05:35, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see you've added the '=' again. Is this a mistake or really a notation which I've never seen before? --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 03:09, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC) It is meant to be equiv to 2- (the opposite of ++). I adopted the equation directly from a review article by Maria Cardenas, who "wrote the book" on the liver form of GK. Her form of the equation is R-CH<sub>2</sub>OH + MgATP<sup>2-</sup> arrow R-CH<sub>2</sub>O-PO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> + MgADP<sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup></p>
<p>I thought my adaptation was a little clearer but do you think we should change back to 2- or use her whole equation? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:26, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, alteripse, thanks for replying on RfA. I hope you didn't think I was taking a poke. I've declined being nominated for adminship a couple of times, and there's always a kind of low-level debate going on in my head about whether or not to accept next time, so I'm interested in how others think. I get to take my pick, huh?&#160;;-) OK, they're all good answers, though they wouldn't all be valid for me. I guess I worry more about wiki addiction than you do (or just have a worse case of it than you do), so adminship getting me to "start doing additional community activities" is on the minus, not the plus, debating team in my head. It's pretty much that team's star rhetorician, even. Anyway, I'm sure you'll make a good, well-balanced admin, you've been doing really good work around the place. And the vote's looking pretty good, isn't it!

But here's the thing - they keep popping up whenever I try to use your tech. again. It's two { then fn1 and then two } .... and then you went in to fix the formatting when I ran into problems. So...I don't really know how to do it properly. Then, when I tried to do it in another article? The fn from Soup appeared in the next article. Confused?

<p>You offered, at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMarietta%2C_Georgia_8c3b.html" title="Talk:Marietta, Georgia">Talk:Marietta, Georgia</a>, to protect the page. You also cite the arbitration, which I am familiar with. Is there nothing else, nothing more forceful or effective, that was envisioned by that ruling?

VirtuousO also inexplicably reverted two other pages, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenzin_Gyatso_eb73.html" title="Tenzin Gyatso">Tenzin Gyatso</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syngman_Rhee_4153.html" title="Syngman Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a>, or at least it would be inexplicable but for the obvious fact that 66.20.28.21 is engaging in specific retribution against me. (Check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=VirtuousO" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=VirtuousO" rel="nofollow">user contributions</a>, and then look at the histories of those pages. The Syngman Rhee edit was pointless disruption in the first place, and VirtuousO restored it after I reverted it.) Is it not possible to determine this userâs IP address, or the IP address of the other sockpuppets operating on these pages, and compare them? Can the admins not develop some evidence that 66.20.28.21 is circumventing the ruling, and take action? Those of us following the career of this editor have mostly viewed it as a source of unacceptable bias constantly inserted through edit wars; but now we are dealing with simple vandalism. What can you do?<br />

<p>It seems that the consensus is for further disruption of this kind to be dealt with immediately, which is good. On the other hand, why must we wait until further disruption? This has been going on quite a while <i>since</i> the decision was made, and I do not see that there has been any enforcement.<br />

<dd>Regarding his dwarfism, that's just not in debate. He was very short (I'd be surprised if he was above four feet in height), and his roles on sitcoms such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Girls_eeec.html" title="The Golden Girls">The Golden Girls</a></i> note this (example storyline: Can Rose date a dwarf?) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 17:07, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then why remove him from the list in the dwarf article? The only thing that doesn't fit then would be the late growth spurt.

<dd>The weird circumstances made it sound as if he didn't belong totally in the dwarf article...like they typecast him as a dwarf but he really wasn't, or something. I don't know; it's all very confusing and I'm tempted to just remove all the Marfan stuff until someone else can back it up; I don't think that'll happen. Do you mind doing it for me?

<p>John Gohde, previously known as Mr-Natural-Health and once banned for three months, brought a request against <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a>, who has been monitoring Gohde's activity for several weeks, for systematically reverting Gohde's addition of infoboxes to articles dealing with alternative medicine. The arbitrators rejected this request, but agreed to consider Snowspinner's "counterclaim" that Gohde had "returned to the behavior which got him in trouble twice before."</p>
<p>I suggest that you join Snowspinner, and perhaps set up a new Request for Comments in regards to John Gohde. Sadly, he is again harassing any Wikipedia user who dares disagree with him. I am saddened to see that he is harassing you, and lying about me.

All I have to say is that I know very little about medical practice, but that there are a whole lot of reasons (mathematical and biological) why the results of biological growth should be lognormal an not normal, and that I can imagine a whole lot of practical reasons why medical practice would use the normal.</p>
<p>As for your comment about college-educated adults, I doubt that 99.9% of college educated adults could tell you much about the normal distribution. Mathematical education of nonmathematicians is usually abysmal through no fault of the nonmathematicians, and considering how hard it is already for people to learn to work with the normal distribution, these nuances would be out of place in most introductory expositions.

<p>Ouch - you thought I was not an English speaker? Wow, I must sound far more unintelligent than I ever imagined. I made the spoonfeeding remark because I felt as though I was pestering you (I was trying to be nice)- I thought when you made your response you were being rude, as if to say "my, my aren't you an idiot" but perhaps I was mistaken? How did you know I like Dylan? Anyways, I'm not sure what the point of your post on my talk page was - should I feel embarassed or stupid because you found my unintelligent due to my post? To be honest, I'm not too familiar with the structuralist movement, but I did know Dickens pre-dated it significantly and I suppose that is the reason for my initial confusion in response to your first post. --<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 02:01, May 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

From what I understand you were trying to make amends, and I appreciate that greatly (if that is the case). So please do not feel as though you should have quit messages ago. Friends?</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> page and read the first sentence, and then go to the talk page. There is a debate going on started by others (the most recent one started by myself) about whether or not the first sentence and definition of abortion is POV. I figured if you are involved with medicine you would have a background of the science behind the matter, etc. I just posted something on there (it's the most recent one) in response to others, and another definition, too.

<p>Dear Alteripse, I see your point and I concur with you on fetus/embryo. (changes there were not from me) I also see the effect you are considering. However, I think the "without survival" is really awkward (and I know why others are more comfortable with it) - it'd make sense only if the death was some side-effect of the procedure, but it's not. Consider, whether you'd describing beheading someone like this: "severing head from the body at the neck, without survival of the subject"? I don't think so. But thanks for your consideration.

<p>Yes, of course - but thank you for trying. I agree that these types of articles are Wikipedia's major weaknesses.

<dd>In all forms of thyroid cancer, we treat with thyroxine not just to replace the missing hormone after removal of the thyroid, but to suppress the TSH and remove a stimulus to regrowth of the cancer. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 15:15, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difference between thyroxine replacement after thyroidectomy for Graves' and for cancer is that for cancer we want the TSH not just normalized but actually suppressed to near undetectable levels.

<p>Like most North Americans I do not understand Balkan conflicts and shouldn't have even looked at the map. I think I reverted by mistake when I was just trying to go back and forth to understand the differences between the images, since that doesn't seem to work the same way as different versions of the text.

<p>I'm moving this discussion here, because the reference desk is no longer a proper place to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>The fact that there are more people living with monosomy X than with any other monosomy is only indicative of the fact that monosomy X is far more prevalent at conception than all other monosomies. According to the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, it occurs in 3% of conceptions, but <b>99% of these result in spontaneous abortion</b>. The resultant .03% of live births having Turner's is larger than any other monosomy, but only because it is so common at conception. Clearly, there is a strong selection against monosomy X. Further, the majority of live births with Turner's are mosaics, meaning that not all of their cells karyotype as 45,X.</p>
<p>As for XXX, I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying, which is likely the fault of my writing. I merely am trying to say that triple-X is often undiagnosed and rarely has obvious signs or severe complications, which is far better than can be said for every other trisomy. There are statistically significant differences in height and IQ in trisomy X, but that there are normal people at all with trisomy X is significant and makes it a far less serious syndrome than any other trisomy. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesmusik_3e65.html" title="User:Jamesmusik">James</a> 17:41, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just found this note, after answering another round at the ref desk. I agree it's time to stop. Your paragraph here on XXX now shows you understand the difference between "any effect" and obvious or severe ones, which was my original contention that you were "close but not quite". As far as Turner's goes, I am not disputing that it usually causes fetal death, but conceptuses with missing autosomes do not even get far enough to be identified as "miscarried" because they are so incompatible with fetal development: you have no evidence that the original nondisjunction events affect the sex chromosomes hundreds of times more often than autosomes, just that they get far enough to be identified in aborted tissue. I doubt you could find an example of even a single case report of a functional adult missing an autosome in a large proportion of body cells, while there are maybe 50,000 people with Turner syndrome living in the United States, going to school and working. A missing autosome is much worse than a missing sex chromosome and Turner syndrome is no exception. Is there anything left to be said? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 20:54, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. A couple of days ago, I decided to tackle rewriting <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanitis_xerotica_obliterans.html" title="Balanitis xerotica obliterans">balanitis xerotica obliterans</a>, as the present article is simply too awful for words. Since it'll take a few days, I've made a start over at balanitis xerotica obliterans/temp, and am gathering references and beginning to flesh out the text. I'd appreciate any input you might have. I'm particularly keen to ensure that I haven't missed any important refs. Thanks. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 20:39, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think you looked at the before and after of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">disease</a> definition very clearly. While there may have been problems with my revision, I believe there were more problems in the previous page. Moreover, the "syndrome" definition wasn't my invention but rather my effort to make the existing incoherence more coherent. I didn't create the "collection of symptoms" phrase - except to interpolate it from the "collection of s" phrase that was on the page you reverted TO.</p>

Also, if you were going to revert to something, you wanted to revert to the version previous to what you reverted to. This version has a somewhat coherent organization. The one by PhilO. This one doesn't have the one paragraph sentence fragment for its first section.</p>

<p>Hi Alteripse, I know you have expressed some reservations with the recent changes made to the reference desk. There is in fact a full page listing located at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_all_cfa5.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/all">Wikipedia:Reference desk/all</a>, with the shortcuts <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_A_8a90.html" title="WP:RD/A">WP:RD/A</a> or <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_ALL_d4f2.html" title="WP:RD/ALL">WP:RD/ALL</a>. The only difference is that the new questions will not appear at the bottom of the "all" page - only ones from the miscellaneous category would. The rest of the new questions will appear approximately 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 ths of the way down. There is a link to this "see all" page from the main reference desk page, but perhaps it hasn't been made prominent enough - from the reference desk talk, it seems to me that many Wikipedians have missed this link.</p>
<p>I really hope that the "all" page would preserve enough of the functionality from the previous reference desk that would suit your needs. There are certainly some changes, but I really hope that you'll still consider answering questions on the occasion. I really liked your answering style, and it was always refreshing to read your posts. Would you please reconsider and help out answering questions as you see fit? Maybe try out the new organization of the pages for a day or so? Please let me know your thoughts on this, as these changes were certainly not intendend to drive away very knowledgable Wikipedians from helping out at the Reference Desk. I really hope everyone would still see you around answering questions! --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 23:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Thanks for your work. the more info on NS available the better as we need more knowledge about this common, but often unheard of disorder.</p>

<p>I did not intend offense, just skepticism about chance of success. I am sympathetic to the rude surprise in store for any clinician in the US who begins to deal with IRB rules for what he thinks is a simple, safe, straightforward study (even just to gather grouped data). Perhaps you can persevere and win our True Grit award. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 14:59, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<pre>
    a.  Beginnnig with my two years as a navy medic in charge of 32 bed pre-post op abdominal and thoracic surgery ward - with   
        commendation ('52 - '54);
    b.  Medical attendant during BBA study period...followed with 2 years post grad. pre-med life sciences during same period as  
        the discovery of 'desoxyribonucleic acid'; 
    c.  A continued, unabiding interest in medicine and materia medica;
    d.  Volunteer ambulance paramedic;
    e.  Distinguished Benefactor of Mayo Foundation;
    f.  Ten year prostate cancer survivor (having refused radiaton therapy to clear remaining 'dirty margins' at bladder...in favor
        of extended combined hormonal therapy in conjunction with my research and utilization of continued holistic therapy);
    g.  Post endarterectomy, left carotid with 95+% blockage, following TIAs and stroke that was addressed 'expeditiously'...
        permitting a return to Mayo Clinic/Rochester for surgery (BASIS for designing and the pursuit of a study to authenticate 
        a new therapy for reversal of fatty plaque stenosis and elimination of unwanted calcium ... utilizing tetracycline HCl
        as one of only two effective bactericides in the destruction of decalcified nanobacteria - once 'defrocked' of their
        protective calcium apatite shells by the use of a combination of neutraceuticals and chelating agent);         
           NOTE:  The two studies referenced in the subject response, regarding the failure of antibiotics to control or reverse
                  vascular disease clearly fail to take into account the mechanics of calcification and the narrow spectrum of
                  antibiotics that will destroy nanobacteria - the underlying cause of arterial disease and unwanted calcium in the
                  human physiology as demonstrated by Kajander, Ciftcioglu, Maniscalco and Taylor...as well as the additional proof
                  of their existence by Drs. Virginia Miller and John Lieske of Mayo Clinic/Rochester.)  
                  My veterinary son and I both had the privilege of spending an afternoon with Dr. Miller and Dr. Lieske to discuss
                  their abstract on "...nanobacterial-like structures..." and view these creatures (100-200 billionths of a meter 
                  in size) under microscope in the culture flask they were so kind enough to have brought to us.  As a matter of 
                  information, these nano-cells are completely devoid of any organelles, yet self-replicate once every two to three   
                  days!
                  FURTHER NOTATION:  Mayo database for long term use of tetracycline has established its 'safety' for extended
                                     period use.
    h.  Add to these the nine months' personal research towards design and development of a clinical study for the purpose set
        forth above which includes:
          i.  Establishing a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation to serve as the 'entity' conducting the study;
         ii.  Establishing the list of conditions be included in the study;
        iii.  Designing (for completion by prospective study subjects and their attending physicians) the application form for
              participation in the study;
         iv.  Creating and sending to hospitals in select areas within six regions of the U.S., invitations to participate as
              'sponsoring' attending physicians (urban, suburban and rural patient environments);
          v.  Subject application data (and 'selection' criteria) to include age, sex, work stye, living environment, exercise
              level, body mass index, meds taken - including OTC, stress level, personality profile, ethnicity, medical 
              history, allergies - including specific allergies related to contrast medium adverse reaction potential, blood type, 
              cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and blood and pulse pressures;
         vi.  Complete and comprehensive "Informed Consent" form executed by applicant and attending physician; copy filed with
              IRB and Study 'entity'.
        vii.  Paid 'pre-test' for nanobacteria antigens/antibodies (nano positivity) followed by test for tetracycline allergy;
       viii.  Research and conclusion for preferential computed tomography scan equipment, methoods, contrast media for safety,
              with 64-slice Siemens - software for conventional calcium scoring (0 though &gt;400) plus percentage of fatty plaque
              stenosis of ROI's (regions of interest) using nonionic contrast medium that permits distinction between soft plaque 
              and blood (not previously available) and with near zero potential for adverse reaction, reduced to zero through
              "qualification" criteria; initial baseline scan and final, 4 month study evaluation scan; each scan 'read' by the 
              same two radiologists...'scoring' both initial and final scans;
         ix.  Transportation and lodging paid for by study funding, including companion support if required;
          x.  Therapy supplies and tetracycline provided all attending physicians for bi-weekly dispensing at time of weight and
              B/P check, monthly blood draw for forwarding to lab of medical facility conducting scans and bloodwork, for 
              uniformity and consistency in calibration and methods. Costs absorbed by Study entity.  Bi-weekly reports delivered 
              to attending physician for use in assuring study participant compliance.
         xi.  Records of blood draw results cross referenced with physical attributes, bi-weekly reports, study participant codes,
              condition being studied, group codes (age/sex) hopefully will afford more data for research and/or conclusions.
        xii.  Funding to be generated via internet solicitation.  Research indicates 765,000 (of 293,000,000 population) willing
              and able to contribute $15 towards study comprised of six hundred (600) participants and their attending physicians.
              Total... $ 11,475,000.  Further solicitations will be addressed to health insurers and industry:  Insurers towards 
              reduction/elimination of high cost invasive procedures :: Industry to participate in reduction of insurance premiums 
              and lost time/key personnel disabilities; long and short term.
       xiii.  Web site development for constant updates of receipts and disbursements; study results by age, sex, condition group
              studied.
        xiv.  Staff to maintain income disbursement records for website and corporation;
         xv.  Staff for recording medical data and results.
        xvi.  Solicitation of lodging and travel for participation to contain cost on a vital study.
       xvii.  Solicitation of Omron for Intelli-sense B/P monitoring equipment (for daily monitoring; bi-weekly report).
      xviii.  Bonding costs, printing, postage, fax (for communicating reports as needed), misc. supplies;
        xix.  Cost of scans, readings, medical facility, storing data generated.

<p>I'm working to make this happen...and realize it will not be accomplished soon...but will keep pecking. Have just been advised that the road has become much 'bumpier' since Duke experienced a death in one of its 'off-label' studies; that it had a severely negative impact upon IRB willingness to participate in them - given these 'relaxations' are from 1998.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I'll go for that "True Grit" award!!!</p>
