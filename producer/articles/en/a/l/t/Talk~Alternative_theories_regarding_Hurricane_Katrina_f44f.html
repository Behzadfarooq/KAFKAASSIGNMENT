<p>The problem with a page like this is that its selectiveness makes it less than NPOV. You could just as well say that God is trying to teach the same lesson to Americans that he did to us Dutch in 1953, i.e. that negligence is a punishable sin, not a natural disaster. And yes there was a lot of negligence, my dear American friends. So another possibility is that Katrina is a blessing-in-disguise, because the 'ramp' of 1953 certainly has done a lot of good to the Netherlands. We decided to replace the blame game by a pledge that we would never be caught with our pants down again and leave our fellow Dutch behind to die like rats on a sinking slaveship. We became a better country for it. I wish America the same betterment <a href="../../../../af/j/c/w/Gebruiker%7EJcwf_7993.html" class="extiw" title="af:Gebruiker:Jcwf">af:Gebruiker:Jcwf</a></p>

<p>Does the insert 'global warming' camp think that by mixing in something somewhat less crackpotted that you're going to somehow make this article survive VFD? I see the same broken argument being presented over and over here by the same people, claiming that someplace someone is saying that Katrina is special compared to other tropical cyclones and that it was caused/made worse by global warming to an extent that others were not. When pressed for citations, I just get the same tired reports such as the times article <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html?cnn=yes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html?cnn=yes" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> where Katrina is only mentioned to hook readers, or the german minister <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200508%5CPOL20050831a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200508%5CPOL20050831a.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> who quite clearly says "frequency of these natural events". Was this a mistranslation? Did they mean to print "Hurricane Katrina" rather than 'these natural events'? I find that doubtful. Whats worse is that not only is this misunderstanding being used to excuse spamming all the Katrina related articles with global warming claims, but that it's causing the entire issue to be misrepresented (that is, it's being represented on wikipedia outside of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_cyclone.html" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> as something special about Katrina when no one is claiming that). For the sake of accuracy, give it up. --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.165.233.150.html" title="User:24.165.233.150">24.165.233.150</a> 23:46, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since it's clear that the text is just going to be blind reinserted without discussion if I remove it again, last night I made some changes which at least made it less misleading. It still will leave the readers going what the heck, and it's inferior to the text in tropical cyclone... but whatever, you have your mention of global warming... it still won't be enough to keep this article from being VFDed. --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.165.233.150.html" title="User:24.165.233.150">24.165.233.150</a> 19:04, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The point of the article is to document allegations that have been made. Would it be sufficient to say that supporters of the theory that global warming leads to stronger hurricanes have recently invoked the name of Hurricane Katrina with the intent of convincing their audience that the two are connected? By the way, to address your earlier point, the major purpose of this article is to <i>prevent</i> "spamming all the Katrina related articles with global warming claims", along with the various "divine retribution" and "weather control" theories that will doubtless spring up again in the other articles from which they came if deleted here. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:37, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It would be accurate and approiate to state that people have invoked "katrina" to bring up the global warming issue, and direct people to the correct discussion on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Cyclone_86bc.html" title="Tropical Cyclone">Tropical Cyclone</a>, which is what I had been changing the text to do. If there had been an intent to claim that Katrina was more related to global warming than other recent storms then someone would have come out and said exactly that, but no on has. So to say otherwise is a misrepresentation. I do appricate keeping the material out of the main articles, but it seems to have happened at the cost of reduced oversight on the quality of the claimes we were making on Wikipedia.

<dd>Sorry about not responding - for some odd reason, I had the article on my watchlist, but not the talk page (probably because the article was moved after it was made). Also, you're quite simply wrong that I "spent quite a bit of effort trying to insert global warming stuff into the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> article itself," and was "told no by multiple editors". As the discussions show (<a href="../../../h/u/r/Talk%7EHurricane_Katrina_393b.html#Causes_and_the_Global_Warming_Discussion" title="Talk:Hurricane Katrina">Talk:Hurricane Katrina#Causes and the Global Warming Discussion</a> and Talk:Hurricane Katrina/Archive08#Global Warming), a majority of editors <i>did</i> want global warming material in that article. The only thing I personally added about global warming was the external link to the CNN article - which you objected to, and which was then soundly approved by the editors on the talk page discussion (Talk:Hurricane Katrina/Archive04#Global warming article link?), objected to only by you under two different signatures. I later moved that link to the separate article on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_effects_of_Hurricane_Katrina_1880.html" title="Political effects of Hurricane Katrina">Political effects of Hurricane Katrina</a> (see Talk:Hurricane Katrina/Archive07#External links), because I agree that there is more politics than science to these contentions, and I then moved all of the global warming material in that article to <i>this</i> article, to keep all the fringe theories in one place. I haven't touched the actual <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> article in days except maybe to revert simple vandalism, but plenty of other editors are <i>still</i> putting global warming commentary there. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:58, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone please provide a source for the following statement: "Most climatologists today believe that the relationship between climate change and hurricane intensity is unproven, and that the increase in hurricane activity noted over the last 20 years, can be accounted for by factors other than climate change such as the 25-40 year cycle." --Dante456 01:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It has been quoted on several Wikipdedia articles that Repent America claimed Katrina was divine retribution. This is not substantiated by the press release. Marcavage never places blame on any event. While he does devote most of the press release to the upcoming Southern Decadence festival, he also mentions other examples of "wickedness":</p>

<dd>"New Orleans was also known for its Mardi Gras parties where thousands of drunken men would revel in the streets to exchange plastic jewelry for drunken women to expose their breasts and to engage in other sex acts. This annual event sparked the creation of the "Girls Gone Wild" video series. Furthermore, Louisiana had a total of ten abortion clinics with half of them operating in New Orleans, where countless numbers of children were murdered at the hands of abortionists. Additionally, New Orleans has always been known as one of the "Murder Capitals of the World" with a rate ten times the national average.</dd>

<p>This article has now bounced around between a number of different names, none of which is 100% satisfactory. It was originally "Hurricane Katrina conspiracy theories," which was rejected because neither divine retribution nor global warming can really be called a "conspiracy"; it was then moved to "Alleged causes of Hurricane Katrina," which is a problematic because it doesn't capture the non-mainstream tenor of these theories, and because the weather control, global warming, and some divine retribution claims were not really about the cause of the hurricane itself, but about factors that purportedly strengthened it or directed its path. Also, there's a nifty theory floating around the internet to the effect that the <i>levee</i> was sabotaged or just outright blown up as part of some nefarious plot - which is related to the hurricane, and should go in this article if any notable figure endorses it, but is not an alleged cause at all. I propose "<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_theories_regarding_Hurricane_Katrina_5c34.html" title="Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina">Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina</a>".

<dd>I've had a think about this, and something like Non-scientific causes of Hurricane Katrina or Unconventional causes of Hurricane Katrina might be good because it makes it clear that these ideas are not in the mainstream.

<p>...but why is <b>Global Warming</b> listed as a conspiracy theory??

<p>I deleted the following material about burning bodies and mercenary soldiers from the article because there is only one source cited, and that source is itself purporting to relate second-hand accounts. However, this seems like a ripe rumor to be discussed (and, if necessary debunked) in the article, if it really is being asserted by any direct, reputable sources, and has gathered any steam:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wayne Madsen also reported that FEMA is treating evacuees like "internees" and that Private Military Contractors are in New Orleans and may be burning victims' bodies to try to cover up the number of actual victims who died:
<dl>
<dd>September 8, 2005 -- Some evacuees are being treated as "internees" by FEMA. Reports continue to come into WMR that evacuees from New Orleans and Acadiana who have been scattered across the United States are being treated as "internees" and not dislocated American citizens from a catastrophe. Some FEMA facilities are preventing these internees from leaving on their own. Reports of mandatory registration and the issuing of FEMA ID cards suggest that FEMA, an agency that is rife with right-wing security goons and severely lacking in humanitarian workers, has other motives in treating poor and destitute American citizens as prisoners in their own country.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, WMR is receiving reports that mercenary private military contractors (PMCs) are now operating in the New Orleans metropolitan area. These may include foreign nationals with questionable human rights records in their native South Africa, Israel, Colombia, El Salvador, Britain, and Australia. PMCs have been extremely active in occupied Iraq, especially under the aegis of massive Pentagon omnibus contracts awarded to Halliburton and its Kellogg Brown &amp; Root subsidiary. Joseph Allbaugh, the former FEMA director under Bush and current FEMA director Michael "Brownie" Brown's college roommate, is currently a registered lobbyist for disaster relief business for Kellogg Brown &amp; Root. Allbaugh's lobbying firm is called the Allbaugh Group. Halliburton has recently been awarded lucrative contracts to repair U.S. Naval bases damaged by Katrina.</dd>
<dd>The presence of PMCs is worrisome. There are unconfirmed reports of mercenaries shooting residents of New Orleans and that mercenaries are involved in burning the bodies of victims in makeshift crematoria set up throughout the city. Three mercenary companies have been reported to be in the New Orleans area: Blackwater USA, Steele Foundation, and Wackenhut. The reported burning of bodies could be an attempt by the White House to suppress the total death count to an "acceptable," "manageable," and "spinnable" level.</dd>

<p>EDIT: I just noticed the part in your message, BD2412, about Fred Phelps and have put the content back and am preparing to despute.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact of the statement itself can not be disputed - there is no question that Phelps actually said what he is quoted as having said. The dispute you have raised is whether it is appropriate to have so offensive a statement in Wikipedia, to which I can only respond that Wikipedia is not censored for content. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I scanned this picture from a St. Petersburg Times article about neighborhoods damaged by Hurricane Katrina, since it didn't appear in the online edition of that article. Almost immediatley after this article was printed there was a frenzy of accusations against the federal government accusing it of trying to kill black people. And yet, according to this, the majority of neighborhoods were mixed race neighborhoods.</p>

<dd>Generally speaking, the conspiracy theories are wrong because they rely on the existence of explanations more complex than what is required to explain the phenonena under investigation. Which is why we have this article, instead of including these theories in <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 17:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not why the conspiracy theories are wrong (they're wrong because you can't ochestrate a natural disaster). The theory of evolution is more complicated than creationism, but that's doesn't make the former wrong or the latter right. Occam was a simpleton.</dd>

<p>From the article: <i>"It should be noted that most of these [alternative theories] do not reflect the mainstream thoughts of their religions."</i> I'm afraid this is a classic instance of original research. See <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:Original research#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position</a>. We as editors cannot introduce our own <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a> and apply it to the hurricane — no matter how popular this interpretation would be among Wikipedians. And we certainly haven't decided where "mainstream religious thought" begins and ends, nor dug up any study on what people believe. So I've removed the text (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alternative_theories_regarding_Hurricane_Katrina&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72610841" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alternative_theories_regarding_Hurricane_Katrina&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72610841" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). I think the criticisms section could be expanded: that's where this kind of theological question can be discussed, using sources of course. <b><a href="../../../o/m/p/User%7EOmphaloscope_e6a5.html" title="User:Omphaloscope">Omphaloscope</a></b> <i><a href="../../../o/m/p/User_talk%7EOmphaloscope_4d06.html" title="User talk:Omphaloscope">talk</a></i> 14:30, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with the revert by Mets501. He removed a link to judicial-inc.biz on the grounds that it's a biased, unreliable site. I imagine I'd agree with him on this point. But the citation was supposed to support the following claim:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Various 'conspiracy' centered websites have asserted that some of the New Orleans levees were intentionally weakened in advance of the storm or deliberately breached after it had passed."</dd>
</dl>
<p>From what I saw, judicial-inc.biz is a "conspiracy centered website" and it made exactly that assertion, so this is a good citation. It proves the point. Yes, in a way, it cites an unreliable source in order to do so, but it doesn't depend on reliability. The claim is "Some X say Y" and it can be proved by showing an X that says Y, even if X is unreliable.</p>
<p>Personally, I find just about every conspiracy site unreliable and biased. So we have three choices: (1) Cite such sources to establish that sources like that say Y; (2) Wait for someone else to say "Some X say Y" and then cite him; (3) Give up on reporting what conspiracy theorists say. I prefer (1).</p>
<p>Remark: This may be academic anyway. I can't link to the website since it's on a spam blacklist apparently. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 01:38, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
