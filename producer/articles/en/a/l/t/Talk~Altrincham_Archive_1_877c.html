<p>Totally agree - this page needs more pictures and more local information (see below). However, when I added my pictures, someone removed them and I've no idea why.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear this page is being vandalised if things are being removed without an entry in the edit summary.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think however your photograph may have been removed because it wasn't entered in the correct way - there are edit conventions which need to be observed. I've just searched for 'including photographs and found that all photographs need to be entered as follows</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Present Day</span></h2>
<p>I cam back to take a look at this article again. This section resembles some sort of developers brief or council planning report - I cannot believe that there are not more important things to talk about in relation to Altrincham than the cost and composition of a roof! <i>(ref A new roof costing £180,000 has recently been installed over the platform at Altrincham Interchange which is currently used for the Metrolink service. The platform had been uncovered since glazed panels were removed three years ago due to safety concerns. The new roof is made of coated steel with clear panels to let in the light)</i> I haven't looked to see who wrote it but do wonder why they deemed this sort of detail appropriate for inclusion. Especially as the cited reference did not present itself when I tried to get it</p>
<p>Why are the cited references local newspapers? These are not the most reliable sources for verifying facts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That my friend is a very broad statement to make with no evidence to support it. Show me some poll or other evidence to show in the UK local media is less reliable than national media. In fact, any table to show the reliability of sources. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandorwien_f900.html" title="User:Candorwien">Candy</a> 19:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is there no reference to:</p>
<ul>
<li>places of worship?</li>
<li>schools and other places of education - and associated scholastic records if relevant?</li>
<li>notable buildings and landmarks? ( for historical, architectural or economic reasons)</li>
<li>the current main employers in the town?</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anybody taken a look at the site of the local history society <a href="http://althistsoc.users.btopenworld.com/index.html" class="external free" title="http://althistsoc.users.btopenworld.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://althistsoc.users.btopenworld.com/index.html</a> (which belongs to the Cheshire Local History Association and the British Association for Local History) or thought about including a link to the local schools eg Altrincham Grammar School for Girls?</p>
<p>I suggest somebody checks the best practice for an article about a town (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_UK_geography/How_to_write_about_settlements" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_UK_geography/How_to_write_about_settlements" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_UK_geography/How_to_write_about_settlements</a>), identifies the gaps and comes up with a plan for improving this. <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 00:58, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have added all of the information about the new developments. There is nothing wrong with mentioning the new roof - it's still a new development which the people of Altrincham will regularly use and should therefore be there. The information used to be headed under 'New Developments' until somebody changed it to 'Present Day'. I will change it back to avoid further confusion. If you wish to create a new sub-heading about present day Altrincham in addition to this then feel free.</dd>
<dd>If the link doesn't work properly then it's because the website has removed the page - it worked originally.</dd>
<dd>The reason why the sources are local newspapers is because they are the only sources available for this information. If I didn't include these, I would have got endless people annoyingly writing 'citation needed' next to every bit of information.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The New Developments section is an important summary of the changing face of the town and I don't see any problem with it. <a href="../../../r/r/j/User%7ERRJ_2728.html" title="User:RRJ">RRJ</a> 13:39, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Industrial history</span></h2>
<p>It is puzzling to see a paragraph about Altrincham never having been a textile town, then citing some engineering firms now gone, at the top of this page, without anyone below making any reference to it. Given that Broadheath used to be a centre for such industries, should this not be mentioned in the article? 86.132.234.4 14:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Altrincham was never a textile town as the word is normally understood, ie applying to somewhere such as Bolton. I can't actually recall anything there to justify the word. What it had, however, in its suburb of Broadheath was a number of medium-engineering machine build works, eg Linotype (hot-metal composition), Richards, Kearns (machine tools), Budenberg Gauge (pressure gauges and the like for steam boilers) - alas, all gone.(unsigned)</dd>

<p>I took on board some of the comments about this page not being as good as some of the others from Manchester, so added the following sections: 1) famous people, which included Paul Young, who lived on the road around the corner from me before he died. 2) education with links to official websites - schools and ofsted reports 3) a picture of the clock tower in altrincham that i took 4) an entry on stamford park with a link to it's website</p>
<p>I only created these entries this afternoon and they've all been removed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Talk page refactoring and quality assessment</span></h2>
<p>This discussion page is very difficult to understand. In the interests of improving this article, I've reformatted the Discussion Page so that it now has a set of headlines which directly correspond to the guideline format for this article and assist new contributors to find the right section for their comment. No comments have been removed but I'ved moved comments to the relevant section of the guideline template for ease of finding things. Contributions may not now be in date order - but the history of contributions is clear if contributions have been signed. I'm not minimising the importance of the 'Naming Conventions' debate but it is now at the end of this discussion page as it is so long and was swamping the discussion page (does it need a separate page?). This hopefully means that people visiting the page for the first time can now contribute to the improvement all the other sections where much more work is needed. <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 09:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>For guidance on conventions see also WikiProject UK subdivisions, Wiki Project UK Geography , and WikiProject UK geography: How to write about settlements I've amended titles within the article to follow largely the suggested guidelines.<a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 09:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK - as of 4th February 2007, we've been regraded to a Category B articles from a 'stub'. now we need to improve it to category A. This means <i>Has several of the elements described in "start", usually a majority of the material needed for a completed article. Nonetheless, it has significant gaps or missing elements or references, needs substantial editing for English language usage and/or clarity, balance of content, or contains other policy problems such as copyright, Neutral Point Of View (NPOV) or No Original Research (NOR). With NPOV a well written B-class may correspond to the "Wikipedia 0.5" or "usable" standard.

Please try and remember to (1) reference only current arrangement unless you are writing about history - which should only go in the civic history section (2) to draw a distinction between Altrincham the <b>area</b> and Altrincham the <b>town</b> when referring to other neighbouring settlements eg Bowdon, Hale, Timperley etc. See <a href="http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/cme3170.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/cme3170.htm" rel="nofollow">Trafford MBC narrative re the Altrincham area</a> Neighbouring settlements mentioned as being part of Altrincham have their own unique page within Wikipedia and this should be recognised on this page - and was until the references were deleted.

<p>I've added a ref to the clock &amp; a few other things at <a href="http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/default.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">Images of England</a> - there appear to be loads of others which could be included (certainly all grade I &amp; II* buildings -IoE has over 100 entries for Altrincham. Just one other thought on the page (though I can't see which of your "sections" to put it in) ... it's best not to have sections with "To be drafted" or similar, don't put the title in until you have some content to go in it.— <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodw_1052.html" title="User:Rodw">Rod</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodw_6741.html" title="User talk:Rodw">talk</a></sup> 11:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guidance states..........<i>This section should be used to write about the settlement as it exists today, and should be distinguished from that of the History section. It should serve to sum up the area/settlement today, perhaps to highlight any contrasts with the past, including the settlement's current use/significance, types of housing, any notable controversies, redevelopment, major employers (if not already mentioned in the Economics section. Suitable sub-sections can include:</i></p>
<pre>
   * Communal facilities - Such as libraries, parks, sports venues etc.
   * Transport - Main centres and modes/means of transport of the settlement today (this may require it's own section).
   * Education - Indicating local schools, colleges, and universitys (if appropriate) etc.
   * Industry and/or /Retail/Commerce - This section may not be required if an economics section is in place.
   * Sport - Including sporting venues, local (notable) teams and relevancies.<i><a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 09:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</i>

<p>This is an 'Altrincham special' heading I've reverted the edit which took out all reference to the Revised Unitary Development Plan. The previous edit could have left the text in even if it took out the link which didn't work as Unitary Development Plans are mandatory for all local authorities and is hardly open to dispute - even if the general public are not always aware of them.

<p>added Helen Allingham, Alison Uttley and reference to the biographies of local people identified on the local history society website.

<p>Some people seem to have an obscession with removing the 'UK' from the location of Altrincham. The UK is the sovereign nation to which Altrincham belongs to. England is not a sovereign country.

<p>Sorry, Cosmopolitancats, my last few edits have sort of clumsily stomped through your arrangement of this talk page. Feel free to refactor me, but wouldn't it be simpler just to archive all the old discussions? That way, the page is smaller, and therefore easier to navigate, and only contains live issues. Apologies again. — <a href="../../../m/h/o/User%7EMholland_48ad.html" title="User:Mholland">mholland</a> 22:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No problem - the important thing is that we should try and do all references to additions and reverts of any significance within the appropriate sections of the talk page. I'm far more concerned by people who edit without any explanation whatsoever!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm rather afraid that if we archived all the old discussions they would start up again. This page has made some quite significant progress recently and it would nice if that could continue without people becoming distracted. In any case I don't know how to archive the section on the naming conventions - which is the only bit which needs to be archived.
