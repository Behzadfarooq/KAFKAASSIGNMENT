Wilson's account of his trip to Niger">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Questioning Joseph C. Wilson's account of his trip to Niger</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence_edd5.html" title="United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence">United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> criticized <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_C._Wilson_74b3.html" title="Joseph C. Wilson">Joseph C. Wilson</a> for claiming that his trip to Niger proved that Iraq was not seeking uranium from Niger. Wilson reported that a former Minister of Niger told him that, during an OAU Ministers meeting in Algiers in 1999, the Nigerien Minister had an informal meeting with an official from Iraq, who wanted to talk about "trade" between the two countries. But their talk never came to any clear topic. The Minister let all matters drop because of UN sanctions against Iraq. And he told Wilson he didn't know if the official wanted to talk about uranium.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In March 2003, the IAEA declared certain documents alleging a sale of uranium from Niger to Iraq to be forgeries.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Senate Select Committee criticized Wilson for allegedly stating that his trip to Niger had proved that <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowcake_forgery.html" title="Yellowcake forgery">Niger documents</a> may have been forged when acting as a source for a Washington post article.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wilson told <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Washington_Post_5b91.html" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> anonymously in June 2003 that he had concluded that the intelligence about the Niger uranium was based on the forged documents because "the dates were wrong and the names were wrong."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Senate intelligence committee, which examined pre-Iraq war intelligence, reported, however, that Wilson "had never seen the CIA reports and had no knowledge of what names and dates were in the reports." Wilson said that he "may have misspoken to the reporter when he said he concluded the documents were forged" (Report 44).</p>
<p>Similarly, an article May 6, 2003 article by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Kristof_8fa5.html" title="Nicolas Kristof">Nicolas Kristof</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_6.html" title="May 6">May 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, for which Wilson was one of the sources, states that "that envoy reported to the C.I.A. and State Department that the information was unequivocally wrong and that the documents had been forged."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a later article Mr. Kristof confirmed that Wilson was the source for this statement, but defended Wilson, stating that although Wilson may not have had the documents in his possession, he may still have provided information necessary to debunk the documents. In that article, Mr. Kristof also explained "Wilson has said that he misspoke when he made references to the documents to me and to two other journalists."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

"We paid his [Wilson's] air fare. But to go to Niger is not exactly a benefit. Most people you'd have to pay big bucks to go there," the senior intelligence official said.

Wilson">Joseph C. Wilson</a> had spoken to him about his wife's role with the CIA while they were waiting together in the green room before appearing on FOX News. He initially said this occurred on three to five occasions, first in February or March of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, more than a year before Novak's column was published. Vallely also said Wilson was proud to routinely introduce his wife as a CIA employee at cocktail parties. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wilson has since demanded that Vallely retract these allegations, calling them "patently false." Wilson wrote to his attorney, as quoted in electronic correspondence included in his demand for a retraction posted on the blog <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Net_Daily_d306.html" title="World Net Daily">World Net Daily</a>:</p>

<p>Wilson's segment was over 15 minutes before Vallely's began. The Fox green room in New York is very small and contains an even smaller makeup room that only has one guest chair. Guests are by themselves in the makeup room. I assume Wilson would have been having his makeup done before his segment, so Vallely wouldn't have been with him then. Even if they did overlap in the green room for a couple of minutes, it strains credulity to think the topic of Wilson's wife's employment with the CIA would have come up.

<p>There are various disputes concerning the covert nature of Plame's status with the CIA. This issue is complicated somewhat by a variety of definitions of <i>covert</i>. While it appears to be clear that Plame's employment status was formally classified by the CIA as "secret" and not for disclosure to foreign nationals, and that her employment was therefore "undercover," and/or "classified," and that she had been classified as a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-official_cover.html" title="Non-official cover">NOC</a>, or non-official cover agent of the CIA, various commentators have argued that on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, when Novak's column appeared, Plame did not fit the legal definition of "covert" as defined in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence_Identities_Protection_Act_45f0.html" title="Intelligence Identities Protection Act">Intelligence Identities Protection Act</a>.<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="These claims needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">citations needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>Plame worked for the CIA for 20 years, and her status, according to the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, was "non-official cover."

<p>A variety of arguments regarding Ms. Plame's status as "covert" have arisen as a result of Special Counsel Fitzgerald's investigation.

"There are people elsewhere in government who are trying to make her look like she was the one who was cooking this up, for some reason," he said. "I can’t figure out what it could be." "We paid his (Wilson’s) airfare. But to go to Niger is not exactly a benefit. Most people you’d have to pay big bucks to go there," the senior intelligence official said. Wilson said he was reimbursed only for expenses. (July 22 2003)</p>

<p>Another false claim is that Valerie sent her husband on the mission to Niger. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee Report issued in July 2004, it is clear that the Vice President himself requested that the CIA provide its views on a Defense Intelligence Agency report that Iraq was trying to acquire uranium from Niger. The Vice President's request was relayed through the CIA bureaucracy to the Director of the Counter Proliferation Division at the CIA. Valerie worked for a branch in that Division. The Senate Intelligence Report is frequently cited by Republican partisans as "proof" that Valerie sent her husband to Niger because she sent a memo describing her husband's qualifications to the Deputy Division Chief. Several news personalities, such as Chris Matthews and Bill O'Reilly continue to repeat this nonsense as proof. What the Senate Intelligence Committee does not include in the report is the fact that Valerie's boss had asked her to write a memo outlining her husband's qualifications for the job.

<p>Others argue that Wilson has said that his wife did not authorize the trip and that he cannot speak about the details. The Senate intelligence committee report and other sources confirm that Plame gave her husband a positive recommendation.

<p>In late July and early August, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the press publicized a classified State Department memorandum which may have been the original source of the leaked suggestion regarding Plame and may help to identify those who were in a position to have and therefore to leak Plame's identity.</p>
<p>According to reports in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i>, that three-page memo was dated <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">June 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and addressed to Undersecretary of State <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Grossman_6f9d.html" title="Marc Grossman">Marc Grossman</a>, who had asked to be briefed on the history of opposition by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Department_dd31.html" title="State Department">State Department</a>'s <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Intelligence_and_Research_740e.html" title="Bureau of Intelligence and Research">Bureau of Intelligence and Research</a> (INR) to the White House's position that <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was attempting to obtain <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> from <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>. The memo summarized the notes (included with the memo) taken by an unnamed senior analyst, of a meeting at the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, at which those in attendance discussed Joseph Wilson's trip to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a>.</p>
<p>The memo shows mainly that the State Department had already decided, on the basis of other evidence detailed in the memo, that Iraq was not seeking to acquire uranium from Niger, and that it therefore opposed Wilson's trip as unnecessary. Two sentences of background information in the second paragraph mention Wilson's wife, identifying her as "Valerie Wilson" and speculating that it was she "who had the idea to dispatch [him] to use his contacts to sort out the Iraq-Niger uranium issue." Although the memo does not explicitly identify Valerie Wilson as a covert agent, that paragraph is marked with an <b>(S)</b>, the code used in a U.S. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classified_document.html" title="Classified document">classified document</a> to indicate that a paragraph is classified at the "secret" level.<sup id="_ref-memo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-memo" title="">[56]</a></sup> Anyone with a U.S. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security_clearance.html" title="Security clearance">security clearance</a> is expected to be familiar with this notation.</p>

This account has been disputed by Wilson, who points out both in "What I Didn't Find in Africa" and in his later comments about his trip to Niger that he never says that Cheney sent him to Niger but rather that he went to Niger at the request of "the Vice President's office." What the editorial states as if it were "in fact" true is not a "fact"; it is "in fact" what has been controversial and in dispute. This claim that Valerie E. Wilson "recommended" her husband has been strongly disputed by those involved in the discussions of the trip; at most, what has been established is that she "suggested" him to her superiors, who made the decision whether or not to "recommend" him for the mission to Niger.
