A hypothetical <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon.html" title="Silicon">silicon</a>-based lifeform</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The most commonly proposed basis for an alternative biochemical system is the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon.html" title="Silicon">silicon</a> atom, since silicon has many <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_property.html" title="Chemical property">chemical properties</a> similar to carbon and is in the same <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table_group.html" title="Periodic table group">periodic table group</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_group.html" title="Carbon group">carbon group</a>.</p>
<p>But silicon has a number of handicaps as a carbon alternative. Because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass.html" title="Mass">mass</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_radius.html" title="Atomic radius">atomic radius</a>, they have difficulty forming double or triple <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covalent_bond.html" title="Covalent bond">covalent bonds</a>, which are important for a biochemical system. <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silane.html" title="Silane">Silanes</a>, which are <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_compound.html" title="Chemical compound">chemical compounds</a> of <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and silicon that are analogous to the <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkane.html" title="Alkane">alkane</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrocarbon.html" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a>, are highly reactive with <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_%28molecule%29.html" title="Water (molecule)">water</a>, and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymer.html" title="Polymer">polymers</a> of alternating silicon and <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicone.html" title="Silicone">silicones</a>, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulphuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.<sup id="_ref-world-building_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-world-building" title="">[1]</a></sup> In general, however, complex long-chain silicone molecules are still more unstable than their carbon counterparts.</p>
<p>Another obstacle is that <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_dioxide.html" title="Silicon dioxide">silicon dioxide</a> (a common ingredient of many sands), the analog of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, is a non-<a href="../../../s/o/l/Soluble.html" title="Soluble">soluble</a> solid at the temperature range where water is liquid, making it difficult for silicon to be introduced into water-based biochemical systems even if the necessary range of biochemical molecules could be constructed out of it.</p>
<p>Finally, of the varieties of molecules identified in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_medium.html" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a> <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_1998.html" title="As of 1998">as of 1998</a>, 84 are based on carbon and 8 are based on silicon.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> Moreover, of those 8 compounds, four also include carbon within them. This suggests a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation upon which to build silicon-based biologies. The cosmic abundance of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>, as well as other <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrestrial_planet.html" title="Terrestrial planet">terrestrial planets</a>, is exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor. However, terrestrial life is carbon-based. Rare carbon proved to be much more successful as a life base than abundant silicon.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that silicon compounds may be biologically useful under certain exotic environmental conditions, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon. A simple real-world example is the silicate skeletal structure of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diatom.html" title="Diatom">diatoms</a>. See <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biogenic_silica.html" title="Biogenic silica">biogenic silica</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_biochemistry.html" title="Edit section: Nitrogen and phosphorus biochemistry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nitrogen and phosphorus biochemistry</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen.html" title="Nitrogen">Nitrogen</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphorus.html" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> also offer possibilities as the basis for biochemical molecules. Like carbon, phosphorus can form long chain molecules on its own, which would potentially allow it to form complex <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromolecule.html" title="Macromolecule">macromolecules</a> if it were not so reactive. However, in combination with nitrogen, it can form much more stable covalent bonds and create a wide range of molecules, including rings.</p>
<p>Earth's atmosphere is approximately 78% nitrogen, but this would probably not be of much use to a phosphorus-nitrogen (P-N) lifeform since molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is nearly inert and energetically expensive to "<a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen_fixation.html" title="Nitrogen fixation">fix</a>" due to its triple bond. (On the other hand, certain Earth <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plants</a> such as <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legume.html" title="Legume">legumes</a> can fix nitrogen using <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbiosis.html" title="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaerobe.html" title="Anaerobe">anaerobic</a> <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacterium.html" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a> contained in their root nodules.) A <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen_dioxide.html" title="Nitrogen dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a> (NO<sub>2</sub>) or <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonia.html" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> (NH<sub>3</sub>) atmosphere would be more useful. Nitrogen also forms a number of oxides, such as <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen_monoxide.html" title="Nitrogen monoxide">nitrogen monoxide</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinitrogen_oxide.html" title="Dinitrogen oxide">dinitrogen oxide</a>, and dinitrogen tetraoxide, and all would be present in a nitrogen-dioxide-rich atmosphere.</p>
<p>In a nitrogen dioxide atmosphere, P-N plant analogues could absorb nitrogen dioxide from the air and phosphorus from the ground. The nitrogen dioxide would be reduced, with analogues to <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a> being produced in the process, and waste oxygen would be released into the atmosphere. Animals based on phosphorus and nitrogen would consume the plants, use atmospheric oxygen to metabolize the sugar analogues, exhaling nitrogen dioxide and depositing phosphorus, or phosphorus-rich material, as solid waste.</p>
<p>In an ammonia atmosphere, P-N plants would absorb ammonia from the air and phosphorus from the ground, then oxidize the ammonia to produce P-N sugars and release hydrogen waste. P-N animals are now the reducers, breathing in hydrogen and converting the P-N sugars to ammonia and phosphorus. This is the opposite pattern of oxidation and reduction from a nitrogen dioxide world, and indeed from the known biochemistry of Earth. It would be analogous to Earth's atmospheric carbon supply being in the form of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methane.html" title="Methane">methane</a> instead of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>.</p>
<p>Debate continues, as several aspects of a phosphorus-nitrogen cycle biology would be energy deficient. Also, nitrogen and phosphorus are unlikely to occur in the ratios and quantity required in the real universe. Carbon, being preferentially formed during nuclear fusion, is more abundant and is more likely to end up in a preferred location.</p>

Fungi and bacteria can produce volatile methylated arsenic compounds. Both arsenate reduction and arsenite oxidation have been observed in microbes.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> Additionally, some prokaryotes can use arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic growth and some can utilize arsenite as an electron donor to generate energy.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorine.html" title="Chlorine">Chlorine</a> is sometimes proposed as a biological alternative to <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, either in carbon-based biologies or hypothetical non-carbon-based ones. But chlorine is much less abundant than oxygen in the universe, and so it is unlikely that a planet will be able to form which has a large enough concentration of chlorine available on its surface to form the basis of a biochemistry.

<p><a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfur.html" title="Sulfur">Sulfur</a> is also able to form long-chain molecules, but suffers from the same high reactivity problems that phosphorus and silanes do.

<p>In addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> as a solvent. It is sometimes assumed that water is the only suitable chemical to fill this role. Some of the properties of water that are important for life processes include a large temperature range over which it is liquid, a high heat capacity useful for temperature regulation, a large heat of vaporization, and the ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds. There are other chemicals with similar properties that have sometimes been proposed as alternatives.</p>
<p><a name="Ammonia" id="Ammonia"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_biochemistry.html" title="Edit section: Ammonia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ammonia</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonia.html" title="Ammonia">Ammonia</a> is perhaps the most commonly proposed alternative. Numerous chemical reactions are possible in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has some chemical similarities with water. Ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does, and in addition it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. Given this set of chemical properties it has been theorized that ammonia-based life forms might be possible.</p>
<p>However, ammonia does have some problems as a basis for life. The <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_bonds.html" title="Hydrogen bonds">hydrogen bonds</a> between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_of_vaporization.html" title="Heat of vaporization">heat of vaporization</a> to be half that of water, its <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface_tension.html" title="Surface tension">surface tension</a> to be three times smaller, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrophobic.html" title="Hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> effect. For these reasons, science questions how well ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together in order to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system. Ammonia is also combustible and oxidizable and could not exist sustainably in a biosphere that oxidizes it. It would, however, be stable in a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reducing_environment.html" title="Reducing environment">reducing environment</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosphere.html" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual for terrestrial life. Terrestrial life usually exists within the melting point and <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boiling_point.html" title="Boiling point">boiling point</a> of water at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_pressure.html" title="Normal pressure">normal pressure</a>, between 0°<a href="../../../c/e/l/Celsius.html" title="Celsius">C</a> (273 <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin.html" title="Kelvin">K</a>) and 100°C (373 K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between −78°C (195 K) and −33°C (240 K). Such extremely cooled temperatures create problems, as they slow biochemical reactions tremendously and may cause biochemical <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precipitation_%28chemistry%29.html" title="Precipitation (chemistry)">precipitation</a> out of solution due to high <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melting_point.html" title="Melting point">melting points</a>. Ammonia could be a liquid at normal temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60 <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmosphere_%28unit%29.html" title="Atmosphere (unit)">atm</a>, ammonia melts at −77°C (196 K) and boils at 98°C (371 K).</p>
<p>Ammonia and ammonia-water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based "<a href="../../../h/a/b/Habitability_zone.html" title="Habitability zone">habitability zone</a>". Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_%28planet%29.html" title="Saturn (planet)">Saturn</a>'s largest moon <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28moon%29.html" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_fluoride.html" title="Hydrogen fluoride">Hydrogen fluoride</a> like water is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. Its melting point is -84°C and its boiling point is 19.54°C; the difference between the two is more than 100°C. HF also hydrogen bonds with its neighbor molecules as do water and ammonia. All of these things make HF a candidate to host life on other planets.</p>
<p>Not much research has been done on liquid HF in regards to its ability to dissolve and react with non-polar molecules. It is possible that the biota in an HF ocean could use the <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluorine.html" title="Fluorine">fluorine</a> as an electron acceptor to photosynthesize energy.</p>

<p>An example of silicon based life forms takes place in the novel <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentenced_to_Prism_491d.html" title="Sentenced to Prism">Sentenced to Prism</a> by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Dean_Foster_f69d.html" title="Alan Dean Foster">Alan Dean Foster</a> in which the protagonist Evan Orgell finds himself trapped on a planet whose entire ecosystem is mostly silicon-based.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most extreme example in science fiction is <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_White_%28author%29_1b5a.html" title="James White (author)">James White</a>'s <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sector_General_abfe.html" title="Sector General">Sector General</a>: a series of novels and short stories about multienvironment hospital for the strangest lifeforms imaginable, some of them breathing methane, chlorine, water and sometimes also oxygen. Some of the species <i>metabolise</i> directly hard radiation and their environment doesn't differ much from the atmosphere of a star, while others live in near absolute zero temperatures. All of the life forms are classified according to their metabolism, internal and external features, and more extreme abilities (telepathy, empathy, hive mind, etc) with four letter codes. Humans from Earth share the <i>DBDG</i> specification with small furry beings called Nidians.</p>

<p>Pratchett has also written the science fiction novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Sun_89fc.html" title="The Dark Side of the Sun">The Dark Side of the Sun</a></i> which features a range of extraordinary lifeforms, including a telepathic body of water, creatures called "Sundogs", which are capable of interstellar travel from birth, and a sentient planet: effectively a giant silicon-based computer.</p>

Outside of science-fiction, life in interstellar dust has been proposed as part of the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panspermia.html" title="Panspermia">panspermia</a> hypothesis. The low temperatures and densities of interstellar clouds would seem to imply that life processes would operate much more slowly there than on Earth.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_C._Clarke_6dac.html" title="Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "Crusade" revolves around a planetwide lifeform based on silicon and superfluid helium located in deep intergalactic space, processing its thoughts very slowly by human standards, that sends probes to look for similar life in nearby galaxies. It concludes that it needs to make planets more habitable for similar lifeforms, and sends out other probes to foment <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernova.html" title="Supernova">supernovae</a> in order to do so. Clarke implies that this is what accounts for most supernovae having occurred in the same region of space and warns that the effort will eventually reach Earth.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

A highly intelligent silicon-based creature made almost entirely of pure rock, it tunnels through rock as easily as humans move through air. The entire species dies out every 50,000 years save for one who tends all the eggs, which take the form of silicon nodules scattered throughout the caverns and tunnels of its home planet, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_planets_d547.html" title="List of Star Trek planets">Janus VI</a>. The inadvertent destruction of many of these eggs by a human mining colony led the mother Horta to respond by murdering the colonists and sabotaging their equipment; it was only through a <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulcan_%28Star_Trek%29_bdbc.html#Mind_melds" title="Vulcan (Star Trek)">Vulcan mind meld</a> that the race's benevolence and intelligence were discovered and peaceful relations established.</p>
