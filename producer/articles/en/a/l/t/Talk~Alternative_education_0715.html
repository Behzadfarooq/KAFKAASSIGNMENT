<p>i think the introduction which gives defintion of alternative education is higly problematice. Here i would suggest by removing the second para where you try to contrast it with USA scenario is what is creating trouble. Why should this alternative education / school etc based on a USA situation. I would suggest it is important here to higlight alternative schooling as agianst the 'Mainstream' or "factory" schooling system.</p>
<p>It is so unfortunate that this article read as if alternative education is only USA phenomenon. even if one traces the anglo saxon history of alternatives AS Nells Summerhill school in UK is the first one. and Indian traditions of early 20th century are equally important to the 'factory schooling' system. Some one needs to correct this</p>
<dl>
<dd>The second paragraph doesn't imply that alternative education originated in the United States, it is merely explaining that alternative education often has a different connotation in the US than it does elsewhere. It is important to explain whether a term has multiple meanings and whether different meanings of the term are used in different areas of the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "Overview" section of the article mentions people from many different countries, the section about specific types of alternative education includes forms that are not from the US (like Krishnamurti schools), and there is a section about alternative education in specific counties. I agree that the article needs a lot of work still. It doesn't clearly describe how the concept of alternative education originated (it just lists names of people influential in it's development), the section about forms of alternative education needs to be revised, the section on international practices needs to be expanded, etc. (I have listed some suggestions for specific changes near the bottom of the page in the section "Suggestions for reorganization and expansion"), but I'm afraid I don't see a US bias. Perhaps you could point out specific examples of places in the article where the views of other countries are not taken into account? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillion_03a3.html" title="User:Amillion">Amillion</a> 22:31, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't you think article is a little heavy in dropping the names of a bunch of dead white men (i.e. Emerson, Dewey, some Swiss guy ect.), despite their importance to the subject.

<p>The introduction of this article says "Alternative education, also known as non-traditional education or educational alternative, describes an education that is modified or particularized for those having singular needs, such as maladjusted people and gifted children." This is not true at all. While forms of education catering to people with special needs may be considered forms of alternative education, they are not the only kind of alternative education. Alternative education refers to ANY form of education other than mainsteam education. Many forms of alternative education are geared towards the exact same people as mainstream education. Unschooling, for example, is a form of alternative education. It is not designed for antisocial children, or dyslexic children, or gifted children, or even exclusively children. It was not designed to meet the needs of any particular special group. Many forms of alternative education share this characteristic. These forms of education are alternative in their methods, not their target audience. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillion_03a3.html" title="User:Amillion">Amillion</a> 15:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Right now the section about alternative education internationally appears to just be scattered plugs for a couple specific schools and programs. I propose that we should strive to make this section about all of the ways in which alternative education is and has historically been thought about and practiced in these countries. If we discuss a particular school, we should do so only to clarify and provide examples of different movements within these countries. The India section (which I moved from the Overview section) is the only one that accomplishes this currently.</p>
<p>I also think that the overview section ought to describe the history of all forms of alternative education (instead of just progressive education). We should explain what factors caused modern mainstream education to come into existence in different areas of the world and when different forms of education began to emerge (or re-emerge), and what these alternative forms were. It might be a good idea to make the overview section into a short paragraph which briefly reiterates that there are several forms of alternative education which vary in purpose, methodology, intended pupils, and philosophy, (education for kids with special needs (disabled, disiplinary problems, malajusted, gifted, etc.), progressive and wholistic education, home education, etc.) and then to tell their specific histories in their own sections. We might also put them in order of historical emergence to make the article flow better.</p>
<p>It might also be a good idea to make a section for different educational structures, like schools-within-schools, home education, charter schools, etc., one for different philosophies, like holistic education, unschooling, etc., different methods, like unit studies, conventional curricula, etc., and one for different target groups, like disabled, malajusted, or gifted people. Basically we should separate the different components of the administration (not the best word, but good enough) of an education; to whom are they administering it, how, why, what are they administering, and in what kind of educational structure. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillion_03a3.html" title="User:Amillion">Amillion</a> 22:43, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's a rough skeleton of what I propose -</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: defines alternative education, states that it is a general term encompassing all forms of education outside of traditional education, briefly states the origin of the concept, describes the different meanings the term might have in different contexts, describes similar terms and their uses and connotations, explains that forms of alternative education may differ in their basic educational and administrative structure, their philosophies of education, their methods of providing that education, and their target pupils.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Educational and administrative structures (each category contains a description of the definition and history of each type)</li>
</ul>
<p>1.1 Stand-alone schools within a mainstream school system- like charter schools (may be paid for with public money)</p>
<p>1.2 Stand-alone schools outside of mainstream school system (not government funded)</p>
<p>1.3 Alternative programs inside of mainstream school (probably government funded)</p>
<p>1.4 Home-based education (probably not government funded)</p>
<p>1.5 A function of, but separate from, mainstream education- like correctional education or special education</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Educational philosophies (again, each category contains a description of the definition and history of each type, description of methods used)</li>
</ul>
<p>2.1 Holistic education</p>
<p>2.2 Student-led education -2.2.1 Unschooling -2.2.2 Autodidactism -2.2.3 Democratic schools</p>
<p>2.3 Montessori method</p>
<p>2.4 Waldorf method</p>
<p>2.5 Special education (there would probably be several subcategories under this)</p>
<p>2.6 Correctional education (there would be different types of this as well)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>International practices (each category will have a description of the meaning and history of alternative education in that country and a description of movements and forms found in that country)</li>

<p>First of all, alternative schools were catered for students with special educational needs as well as those who would like to experience school differently. Saying it is for "at risk" students is a little bit negative. At risk students are special education students. I think saying special education is more positive than saying at risk students. Tell me what you think. (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.177.21.6_eb9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.177.21.6">209.177.21.6</a> - <small><b><a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.177.21.6.html" title="User talk:209.177.21.6">Talk</a></b></small>)</p>
<p>It doesn't say that alternative education only caters to at risk students; it just says that that is a quite common connotation the phrase holds in the United States. Education for at risk students is different from special education in that the term "special education" commonly refers to education geared towards students with disabilities (especially intellectual disabilities), whereas at risk students generally do not have disabilities. Special education is generally conducted seperately from education for at risk students. For examply, look at this definition drafted by the Massachussetes Department of Education: <a href="http://www.doemass.org/alted/about.html?section=definition" class="external free" title="http://www.doemass.org/alted/about.html?section=definition" rel="nofollow">http://www.doemass.org/alted/about.html?section=definition</a></p>
<p>"Alternative Education is defined as "an initiative within a public school district, charter school, or educational collaborative established to serve "at-risk students whose needs are not being met in the traditional school setting." Students who may benefit from an Alternative Education include those who are pregnant/parenting, truant, suspended or expelled, returned dropouts, delinquent, or students who are not meeting local promotional requirements."</p>

<p>At risk students are students that have singular needs. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">Special education</a> is not only for students with singular disabilities. You can go on <a href="http://www.dictionary.com" class="external free" title="http://www.dictionary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dictionary.com</a> and they will tell you that special education includes students with singular needs. What do you think?

<dd>Special education is for students with <i>disabilities</i>. If you look at this site: <a href="http://www3.ksde.org/leaf/survey_on_education_costs/at-risk.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www3.ksde.org/leaf/survey_on_education_costs/at-risk.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www3.ksde.org/leaf/survey_on_education_costs/at-risk.pdf</a> you can see that legally (here it is discussing Kansas statutes specifically) an at risk student is a student that meets one or more of a number of criteria (they are a potential dropout, they are failing, etc.) but <i>does not</i> qualify for special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. While education for at risk students is similar to special education in that it is geared towards a particular audience whose needs can not be met (in the judgment of lawmakers or educators) in mainstream education, and both forms of education are in fact functions of mainstream education (even though they are separate from it) they are not the same thing. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillion_03a3.html" title="User:Amillion">Amillion</a> 01:04, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Click on this link: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Special%20education" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Special%20education" rel="nofollow">definition of special education</a>. Saying at-risk to describe them sounds so negative. Doesn't it sound better when it says singular needs? Special education has changed a lot. It was once only for people with singular disabilities but now it is also for those with singular needs too. People with a mental illness have difficulty with learning and they too need special education.

<dd>Yes, but the dictionary.com definition is hardly evidence of a definitional trend. The fact is that Special Education <i>IS DIFFERENT THAN</i> education for at risk students. They are not the same, they are not conducted in the same facilities, and they are not geared towards the same students. A student who qualifies for special education <i>WILL NOT</i> attend a program for at risk students. It is not a matter of what term "sounds better." These are simply fundamentally different things. Students with disabilities severe enough that they are unable to function in a mainstream classroom will go into special education. Students who are teen parents or are failing their classes for reasons <i>OTHER THAN</i> having a disability (a.k.a. at risk students) will go into programs for at risk students. You claim that education for at risk students is special education because these students have something you call "singular disabilities" or "singular needs." How exactly do you define these terms? Can you find evidence of their use outside of dictionary.com? These so called "disabilities" are not really disabilities at all if they do not qualify the children for special education. And if we examine the term "singular needs," which I can only imagine means "a single problem which results in a child's removal from mainstream education," we can see that at risk children often have more than one "need" (so their needs are not "singular") and children receiving special education sometimes only have a single need (so their needs <i>are</i> "singular"). These children do not differ in the number of their "needs," but in the type. Children go into special education because of medical conditions which interfere with their ability to benifit from a mainstream classroom (including mental illness). They go into education for at risk students because they make poor choices. These are very different things. I'm going to revert your edit. Please leave this version until we resolve this discussion, so that we don't get into an edit war. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillion_03a3.html" title="User:Amillion">Amillion</a> 06:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You also might note that "at risk" is not a derogatory term. It simply refers to the fact that these students are at risk of dropping out. If you did not understand what I attempted to explain in the previous paragraph, you might want to take a look at the second site I cited when we discussed this in the "recent changes" section of the talk page. The site refers to a legal definition of at risk students: <a href="http://www3.ksde.org/leaf/survey_on_education_costs/at-risk.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www3.ksde.org/leaf/survey_on_education_costs/at-risk.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www3.ksde.org/leaf/survey_on_education_costs/at-risk.pdf</a> I can find additional examples of specific legal and academic references if you believe that my claims need more evidence. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillion_03a3.html" title="User:Amillion">Amillion</a> 07:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've done a cursory edit, but it needs more work. In particular, I don't think we should suggest that all or even most alt-ed folks were opposed to <i>compulsory</i> education, per se. Ethan Mitchell 22:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
