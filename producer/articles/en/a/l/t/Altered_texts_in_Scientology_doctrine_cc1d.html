<p>In the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scientology_879d.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, it has long been considered essential that the word of founder <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> is incontrovertible, and that his works must be preserved unaltered. To this end, Scientology's enormous underground <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trementina_Base_297c.html" title="Trementina Base">Trementina Base</a> maintains a scriptural archiving project to preserve his <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_bibliography.html" title="Scientology bibliography">writings</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_filmography.html" title="Scientology filmography">films</a> and <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_Classic_Lectures_b6ac.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard Classic Lectures">recordings</a> for future generations.</p>
<p>However, since Hubbard's death and his replacement by successor <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Miscavige_578d.html" title="David Miscavige">David Miscavige</a>, there have been many subtle and not-so-subtle alterations and omissions from Hubbard's texts and even recordings. These alterations to the "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Tech_fbfc.html" title="Standard Tech">Standard Tech</a>" have caused controversy both inside and outside the Church, especially among <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Zone_%28Scientology%29_3ee3.html" title="Free Zone (Scientology)">Free Zone</a> practitioners. <a href="http://www.truthaboutscientology.com/alteringtech.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.truthaboutscientology.com/alteringtech.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Dianetics%7E_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health_6043.html" title="Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a></i> has also been extensively and repeatedly rewritten by the Church, along with 913 other titles listed in the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> records. <a href="http://www.scientologie.de/english/news/tech-changes/tech_alterations.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientologie.de/english/news/tech-changes/tech_alterations.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Scientology's <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Spiritual_Technology_8d1a.html" title="Church of Spiritual Technology">Church of Spiritual Technology</a> is the owner of the copyrights.</p>
<p>Whether these changes represent a major degradation of Hubbard's original writings, or merely minor edits and improvements that do not change the fundamental thrust of his message, is a matter hotly debated among some Scientologists. Some Scientologists say that they were retaliated against by the Church for informing others that technical alterations have occurred. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005 Miscavige announced that the Church has entered what he calls the "<a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Knowledge_b7be.html" title="Golden Age of Knowledge">Golden Age of Knowledge</a>", during which he intends to make publicly available every word ever written or recorded by Hubbard. It remains to be seen if this includes the content that has already been redacted.</p>

The Guardian's Office for instance at this moment that I speak has heroically acceded to our pleas, so that we could teach an FEBC and hold the fort in, all over the world; and it's much broader than you imagine; has loaded onto itself a great many internal concerns. It's also trying to hold the fort externally. Well they can't do that very long, that's why you are getting pressure here, because the Guardian's Office will probably be holding the org, or the CLO out there will be holding the org, until trained personnel get back to that org. And it's not much mentioned to students, because it would harass them, and put them under a worry, and a stress. So I'm telling you, speed up."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Actually, the Guardian's Office at this exact moment all over the world is holding its breath, waiting for the FEBCs to come back, because they're holding internal actions. Now they're an external group. It wasn't the Guardian's Office in this instance, but I'm just telling you the difference between external and internal. Their attention is out into the public. Their tech is with the ARC broken pc out there in the public, not in the org. So, the person I was speaking to had permitted,..." (7101C23 SO FEBC-05, "How to Post an Org", 1971 edition, tape 5)</p>

They're perfectly willing to handle this sort of a situation, but you've got policy knowledge and other actions of one kind or another in the Guardian's Office at this moment, holding posts of temporary executive director.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Original Version</b>:"So it's all from what viewpoint one is operating. If I were to tell you that we have one of the hottest, smartest units in the world of its kind, you might or might now agree with me, but it's the Guardian's Office. Now, that is a hand-built organization and it was built for a certain definite policy and planning. They had a certain definite purpose. It is better, now hold your hat, it is better today than MI-6, CIA, DIN, State Intelligence or the Abwehr. The decline of psychiatry on the planet came about because they attacked the wrong target, us. There wasn't any unpopularity of psychiatry 'til we opened our mouths, and now it's generally thought to be the case that they're sort of a failed, half-baked, murderous sort of bunch of bums.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The World Federation of Mental Health has now just been transferred to the West Indies and put in the hands of an obscure psychiatrist nobody ever heard of in a back village of blacks. Now, it was the world's most powerful mental health organization, formed by the death-campers who escaped to England. Now, how did it ever get to Jamaica on a back street of a small village? Now, you get the idea? The Guardian's Office doesn't have huge sums of money, they don't have vast numbers of personnel, but they've got technology, they have got some of the hottest technology that anybody ever heard of.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One piece of that technology is over two thousand years old, it comes out of the "Art of War", it's called the "dead agent technique". But the Art of War doesn't state what the dead agent technique could be in full, it was developed within an inch of its life. A newspaper reporter today going into his own morgue files, in any paper anyplace, to get some material to write about Scientology, collides with how bad psychiatry is. Now, how did anybody ever manage that? The people who were running the psychiatric push are dead. Worried to death. Now, how did anybody do that? Psychiatry had a huge escalated program, escalated, climbed right up the escalator and upstairs, fast: To degrade the human race, to supersede all normal justice with psychiatric anything. They had this up to a point where they had legislatures all over the world, and parliaments and so on, were just passing seizure laws which were moving right straight forward which were opening the gate to a totalitarian state for this planet nobody ever heard of. And they made the mistake of attacking us and attracting our attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, one little handful of guys going in against a multi-billion dollar organization such as that, and messing it up and knocking it flat on its back, is quite a feat. And the whole organization was put together and made to run in a few months, and it did its job and accomplished its objectives within three years. Now that shows what can be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever received anything from the Guardian's Office? Have you ever received a letter or anything like that? You don't know too much about them, but have you ever received a note or a letter and so forth from Central Guardian's Offices and so on? They're always very neatly typed and they're usually put together well. Did you ever notice that? So their administrative procedures are in. They follow target policies religiously, they program everything. If some, if somebody is to go out and find out about somebody in some small town someplace or another, he's on fully programmed orders, fully targeted orders just exactly against the target series, but they carry it through to an enormous degree. Now, that's what can be done by establishment. Now that required then brilliant technology, small resources but very, very sound, hard organization and fantastically able management.</p>

An organization that spends more than sixty percent of what it makes has got rocks in its head anyhow, regardless of who gets the other forty, regardless of the tax people, to hell with the tax people. The tax people will do you in anyhow, why worry about it? They've made themselves sufficiently obnoxious and sufficiently bonkers that you just take those steps necessary to obfuscate them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn't matter whether your tax, you submit honest taxes or dishonest taxes or correct taxes or anything else, they'll suddenly tell you, "Well, all of that that you say was expense is really income because a new rule says that the worth of an organization is its debts plus its assets, so therefore these are really assets, so therefore you owe the organization a hundred and twenty-two thousand dollars, and so on." The Guardian's Office will get very cross with you on its finance lines because it has to do tax things and figure it all out some other way and, and so so forth. But never let the fact that money will be taxed deter you from making a mint. That is not the right why.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have enough money and if you've made enough money, the only way Saint Hill has gotten by, you can afford to spend huge sums to protect the huger sums that you have made. The crime is not to have made money. So never fall for the fact that we must not make this money because it will be taxable. No, figure some way where it isn't and go right on making it. An organization has to be valuable enough to compensate management and pay for its management ..."

<p><b>Original Version</b>:"If they keep on rolling it and so forth, it'll handle. The Guardian's Office is probably the best hatted. You know that they, what they do in terms of hatting could be a great lesson to an Establishment Officer. They go to the wildest limits to hat people. They bring in somebody and the person is trained in the office there, and if the person doesn't make it they just offload and they get somebody else. And they work, and they work, and they work, and they work, and they work in order to make good personnel, and they get them. So the upshot of it is, is there is a very good example of hatting. And now they have taken care of the external perimeter that would take care of another push of this type.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another area that we depend on is the Port Captain's office, nowhere near as well as hatted as the Guardian's Office, they do pretty well, they do pretty well, but somebody's really got to roll up their sleaves in that area.

The welfare that is given to the Bantu would call into disgrace most of the tales told about the viciousness of the South African. If the South African's doing anything, he's trying to give the country back to the Bantu. There's more and more reserves being established, more and more land acquired for the Bantu, more and more money poured out on welfare for the Bantu. You get that?
