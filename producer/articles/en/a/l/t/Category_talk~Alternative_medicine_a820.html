<p>I have created a template {{CAMInfobox|title=XXXX}} to replace the inline used in various articles. It is at present installed only in <a href="../../../a/p/i/Apitherapy.html" title="Apitherapy">Apitherapy</a>. As I am a bee article editor (among others) and not an aternative medicine editor I leave it to others (you) to replace the inlines with this template. This is a better practice since an infobox color, layout, or content change may be made in one place and will affect all articles. It is important that all articles with the inline be so converted, lest the template be updated and some articles not be changed.

<dd>To put Alternative medicine in Category:Pseudoscience is to label it a branch of pseudoscience. This kind of generalization is untrue. Sure <i>some</i> Alternative medicine is pseudoscientific, some protoscientific, and some ascientific. <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a> makes it very clear: <b>Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category.</b> --<a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 11:45, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that is very clear. So is the point that since at least some CAM therapies may be supported by scientific research, therefore the pseudoscience tag is controversial?

<dd>It should not be in pseudoscience. It's a mixed bag and the categorization is misleading. Alternative medicine has, at times, formed the instigation for research that brought it into the mainstream. And what is alternative in one place may well be mainstream in another part of the globe. I believe the snake oil salesmen should be identified at their own level, and should not even be included in the alternative medicine category. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 15:26, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Western medicine's tawdry pattern of relentless attacks upon more enlightened practitioners, dating back to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, only seems to be escalating in tandem with its growing political clout, which is clearly attributable largely to the drug industry's trillion dollar plus annual cash flow. If anything, the corruption of the drug industry has poisoned the well of scientific inquiry, bringing even the most prestigious medical journals into disrepute in recent decades. The proposal here is just a sad example of how startlingly pervasive the deterioration of medical politics has become. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 16:45, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coming in late to this debate, I would suggest that the tag 'Pseudoscience' is inherently WP non-PC. It is surely POV by its very nature. There are differences of opinion on what represents 'science' and therefore what represents 'pseudoscience'. In my experience, both tags could apply to some aspects of both 'alternative' and 'mainstream' medicine. Furthermore, there are practices that have developed through observation, in both categories of medicine, which have not been 'scientifically proven', according to modern criteria, and are therefore not EBM (evidence-based medicine). That does not make them invalid. I have held back from editing articles on various aspects of alternative medicine, as they seem so fraught with sabotage, ideology, bigotry and all sorts of other un-WP stuff (sometimes coming from both 'sides'). I believe that WP is the loser in all this. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 10:23, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with some of this - the tag is commonly going to be misplaced. Science is science and many other things are <i>perfectly reasonable</i> other things. Pseudoscience I take to be wrapping non-science in the trappings of science in order to confuse. eg <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgonite.html" title="Orgonite">Orgonite</a>, [[[Royal Rife]] and - given the assertion of subluxations - <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">chiropractic</a>'s fundamanetal theoretical basis are pseudoscience. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">chiropractic</a> as an empirical collection of manipulations for pains in joints and muscles <b>is not</b>, and if it is approached scientifically will include science. Science is powerful and pseudoscience is an attempt to steal that power for fraudulent purposes or at least quackery. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 09:16, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps this deserves some discussion rather than a straight yes/no vote.</dd>
<dd>Quackery has its own category, it does not need to be a subcategory of Alternative medicine for the following reason:</dd>
<dd>Quoted from the article on <b>Quackery</b>: <i>Quackery is a term used to describe the unethical practice of promising health-related benefits for which there is little or no basis.</i>
<ul>
<li>Most if not all types of regulated alternative medicine have a code of ethics. Each alt med-related article should therefore be evaluated as to whether it fits the description of quackery, and if not, perhaps it should not be in the Alternative medicine category?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The <b>Pseudoscience</b> article defines the term as <i>Pseudoscience is a term applied to a body of alleged knowledge, methodology, belief, or practice that is portrayed as scientific but diverges substantially from the required standards for scientific work or is unsupported by sufficient scientific research.</i></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-based_medicine.html" title="Evidence-based medicine">Evidence-based medicine</a> has categories according to the level of evidence on which information is based. Could some CAM articles be classified using this system instead?</dd>

</dl>
<p><b>Remove both</b>. Quackery can be a subcategory of conventional medicine as well, as with plastic surgery being overpromoted, and it's POV to subcategorize it here.</p>
<p>As for having this cat be part of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:Pseudoscience</a>, consider this from <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Questions to ask to determine whether it is appropriate to add an article to a category:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>If the category does not already exist, is it possible to write a few paragraphs or more on the subject of the category, explaining it?</i></li>
<li><i>If you go to the article from the category, will it be obvious why the article was put in the category? Is the category subject prominently discussed in the article?</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><i>If the answer to either of these questions is no, then the category is probably inappropriate.</i> ....</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Categories appear without annotations, so be careful of NPOV when creating or filling categories. Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category.</i> ....</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Whatever categories you add, make sure they do not implicitly violate the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view policy</a>. If the nature of something is in dispute (like whether or not it's fictional or scientific or whatever), you may want to avoid labelling it or mark the categorization as disputed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Given these NPOV considerations, putting the entire <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_medicine_6932.html" title="Category:Alternative medicine">Category:Alternative_medicine</a> into <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:Pseudoscience</a> seems absurd. Even if one defines anything lacking EBM support as pseudoscience (which doesn't appear to be an agreed-upon definition, just one that some infer), not all alt-med lacks support under EBM. One can, again, by fiat simply cease to define any modality as pseudoscientific as soon as it acquires EBM-level evidence, but again, that isn't how the term alt-med is commonly understood either. Where are the verifiable references saying there is scientific consensus that all all-med is pseudoscience? Let those who wish to keep the cat supply them.</p>
<p>The problem is that being in a category is, at least with the present Wiki software, an either/or thing. There is no way to qualify something as falling "partly" in a category, or as having "elements" of that category. Midgley's point (in the preceding section) about chiropractic being both pseudoscientific and scientific is very well-taken. See also the example of "being partially in the kitchen" in the <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_logic.html" title="Fuzzy logic">fuzzy logic</a> article. I think <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a> is pretty clear about what to do in such cases: don't apply the category.</p>
<p>I actually had removed <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:Pseudoscience</a> recently, citing a relevant passage <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>, and another editor reverted without explanation and scolded me to seek consensus (which was ironic, since he didn't attempt to discuss in any way). Most if not all comments I read above support removing it. So you know what? I'm going to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and do so now. However, I won't remove quackery as a sub-cat pending discussion. cheers, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 08:16, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So anyway. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">User:Salix alba</a> suggested that category:Pseudoscience and Category:Quackery "would work better as a see also in the main text rather than as a super/sub category." I think this is sensible. Not all of the "methods used in place of, or in addition to, mainstream medical treatment" are pseudoscientific under WP's definition. Therefore category:pseudoscience should be removed. I'll do so now, noting that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says that the burden of evidence is with editors who wish it to stay. cheers, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 07:21, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find it surprising in light of the above debates that "Pseudoscience" continues to be added as a category (which seem to err to a consensus against adding it). Pseudoscience, as noted above would suggest that alternative medicine is masquerading as science, and a good many alternative therapies make no such claim. Acupuncture, as part of TCM, is an obvious example, making no pretence of being science. Other treatments have also received acceptance as efficacious by mainstream science, such as certain herbal treatments. Thus, it seems a misnomer to throw everything in alternative medicine into Pseudoscience. It would be far more accurate to throw some of these things out of Alternative Medicine and into Pseudoscience. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 05:14, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it interesting that editors are insisting on putting this cat here without discussion, and despite EBM evidence to the contrary in fields such as <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acupuncture.html" title="Acupuncture">acupuncture</a> (similar problems with skeptical editors there making edits without discussion and supporting evidence). Let's see reliable evidence of scientific consensus that all alt-med, as defined here on WP, is pseudoscience. For contrary evidence, see e.g. <a href="http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html" class="external text" title="http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html" rel="nofollow">this talk from Edzard Ernst</a>. Just because vocal skeptics say alt-med is pseudoscience doesn't establish that as a reliable majority view among scientists. If there is EBM evidence and debate, that suggests scientists take these issues seriously and at least a significant minority accepts efficacy for some conditions. Using a cat means WP endorses the POV that alt-med is pseudoscientific. How about getting back to NPOV: if the categorization isn't straightforward, we simply present competing POV's in the article with sources. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 16:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FM, you wrote in an edit summary: <i>"Inclusion in the category is discussed at the relevent article talk pages. This is standing convention, well- and long-settled."</i></p>
<p>What do you mean by "discussed at the relevant article talk pages"? <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a> is not in <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:pseudoscience</a>, which apparently refects consensus at that talk page. There was no consensus on the <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acupuncture.html" title="Acupuncture">Acupuncture</a> talk page for the cat either; one editor yesterday added it, mistakenly calling it a "reversion of vandalism". If some or most alt-med topics should be in cat:pseudoscience, put them there. But not all things labelled pseudoscientific are equally pseudoscientific, and in some cases the cat is inappropriate. No editor so far has demonstrated that consensus exists among scientists that acupuncture or chiropractic are pseudosciences. But they're still alt-med, which means you don't have justification to categorize all of alt-med as pseudoscience. Simple logic. See comments citing Ernst above.</p>
<p>Read the rest of this talk page. There is no consensus for adding <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:pseudoscience</a>, and quite a bit of editorial opinion against doing so. I don't accept your argument from authority that there is "standing convention" that trumps (a) what scientists say about alt-med and (b) consensus on this talk page. If that policy exists you need to cite it.</p>
<p>You mentioned NPOV on <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category_talk%7EPseudoscience_0042.html" title="Category talk:Pseudoscience">Category Talk:Pseudoscience</a>. What NPOV says about describing majority views "as such" does not mean you get to categorize something as pseudoscience just because Randi or Carroll said so. You need to address the NPOV issues raised in <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>. You are mistaken when you say your position is non-negotiable: it is the principle of NPOV itself that is non-negotiable, not every sentence on the NPOV page. NPOV also has to be balanced with of the equally non-negotiable <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Using cats can be POV, and if you want to do so here, you need to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and support your contention that majority views exist. You haven't met that burden for chiropractic or acupuncture, where EBM reviews show that there is debate among mainstream scientists about efficacy. (No reason to repeat myself, so please see my comments at <a href="../../../a/c/u/Talk%7EAcupuncture_1d2f.html#Category:Pseudoscience" title="Talk:Acupuncture">Talk:Acupuncture#Category:Pseudoscience</a>.)</p>
<p>WP works by consensus, and there isn't consensus here. Attempts from editors to argue from authority, avoiding discussion and dismissing arguments they dislike as wikilawyering, don't do much to advance either science or WP. Let's try and work toward consensus as <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> says, with civil and substantive discussion on the merits.

<dd>Medicine is a scientific endeavor. Science requires empirical proofs. Medicine without empirical proofs is not scientific. Hence, pseudoscience. Its not a POV thing; its an accuracy thing. I see a chiropractor myself, and have received much benefit from doing so. Doesn't mean there are claims made repeatedly for Chiropractic care which are without any scientific evidence. FM was absolutely correct to revert; accuracy is our goal here. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 19:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not that simple. Scientists and doctors argue over how to interpret evidence all the time, and disagree over what suffices for empirical proofs. One sees this in peer-reviewed literature all the time, e.g. EBM reviews. If there is a credible significant minority view, WP should not categorically take sides and endorse the majority view by using the cat.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Overpromotion exists with conventional medical treatments as well, but they don't get catgeorized as pseudoscience. It is rhetorically attractive to define alternative medicine by fiat as "that which is without evidence", as Dawkins does. But that doesn't reflect popular, dictionary-level use of the term, and isn't the same as the definition we use on the cat page: "encompasses methods used in place of, or in addition to, mainstream medical treatments." <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>, in its current version<a href="http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, makes a false distinction between alternative and complementary. The two terms are used interchangeably in common usage, and WP should reflect that and not adopt idiosyncratic terms.</dd>

<dd>Sure, acu's theory is not scientific. But nonscientific isn't the same as pseudoscientific. Acu's theory isn't presented as scientific; it's used pragmatically for the results it gets. Testing those results is completely compatible with scientific method, and there is legimitate scientific debate over its efficacy for some things, cf. EBM section in <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acupuncture.html" title="Acupuncture">acupuncture</a>. Sure it's promoted as treating some things without EBM-gold-standard proof, but come on, this is true for sinus surgery, back surgery, psych meds etc. -- we don't call those pseudoscientifc (maybe we should).

One merely needs to Google "science of acupuncture" or "science of alternative medicine" and behold thousands of hits, a number of them by practitioners.

There are also cases where acu is correctly presented as compatible with science, as when scientists do RCT's on it. There are also cases where acu's TCM theory is correctly portrayed as nonscientific (i.e., as a different paradigm than science). NPOV accomodates all these views, allowing them to be presented in articles. <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a> suggests caution in using cats to endorse one side of an argument, and I agree. What should the threshold be? I don't know. Maybe consensus among scientists that the topic is pseudoscientific? No editor has shown that exists in the case of acu or chiro. Not sure what the majority scientific views are here. If we don't know we shouldn't assume. Omitting the cat still allows the arguments to be made without WP endorsing any one.

<dd>Killer Chihuahua <i>Medicine is a scientific endeavor. Science requires empirical proofs. Medicine without empirical proofs is not scientific. Hence, pseudoscience.</i></dd>
<dd>It might seem semantics, but "pseudoscience" does not mean "not scientific", but "pretending to be science", so the initial <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogism.html" title="Syllogism">syllogism</a> is correct, but your final conclusion that that makes it pseudoscience is false. Intelligent Design is pseudoscience. It pretends to be science when it is not. In contrast, while some practioners might pass some alternative medicines off as science, that doesn't make it pseudoscience. Also, just because some scientific evidence accrues supporting a particular treatment, that doesn't just magically shift it into conventional medicine. That process usually takes decades. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 00:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nonetheless, KC, it's fallacious to attempt to redefine alt-med as "that which lacks proof". That's Dawkins' definition, not the one on the cat page which more closely reflects popular understanding and usage of the term. Calling all alt-med pseudoscience suggests to the reader that everything in the cat lacks evidence, and that simply isn't true. (Again, note the lack of consensus on either the chiro or acu talk pages for such a classification.) - <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 05:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>KC, you argued that <i>once scientific evidence is extant it is no longer "alternative" so alt med is accurately placed here.</i> I refuted that above, but it's easy to miss so I'll repeat. You're attempting to redefine alt-med by fiat to an evidence-based definition, but that is not the same as popular or WP definition. Alt-med is defined as a function of whether it's used within mainstream medicine, not on extant evidence. From the cat page: Alt-med <b>encompasses methods used in place of, or in addition to, mainstream medical treatments</b>. Scientists have found evidence for both acu and chiro (see respective articles), and there is no consensus in favor of calling those pseudosciences (see respective talk pages). Evidence can accrue in favor of something, but the switch of that something to "mainstream" usage usually takes a little while longer.</p>
<p>Thank you for mentioning 3RR. I am aware of exactly what the policy says, and that it's a maximum limit, not an entitlement. I undid my revert because I had a total of three that day, and didn't even want to be close. It just seemed like a good-faith thing to do.</p>
<p>It's better to discuss on this page than edit-war. Unfortunately there isn't much middle ground between the category being there or not. As I said, I think that NPOV (see <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>) suggests that in borderline cases, we should err on the side of not using a category. <s>Someone</s> <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">User:Salix_alba</a> already placed a "see also" on the page, which could be a nice compromise approach. <s>It wasn't showing up due to formatting; I fixed that.</s> My edit summary was truncated and should have read: "...and reformat so "See also" is visible". thanks, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 20:54, 14 July 2006 (UTC) <i>(revised 02:17, 15 July 2006 (UTC))</i></p>

<p>No, a personal attack is "you are an idiot". You are a malcontent; you are not contented with Alt Med being in pseudoscience, and are unwilling to discuss the possibility that you may be mistaken.

<dd>Sorry, KC, it is a personal attack, and I do understand what pseudoscience is. I'm perfectly willing to discuss the possibility that I may be mistaken.

<dd>You still haven't addressed my objections to your removing the disputed tag.

Nor have you answered my other arguments above, i.e. that scientists indeed find evidence for acu and chiro, so using the tag to cover all alt-med is wrong.

<dd>Good point. The trouble is that "alternative medicine" and "traditional medicine" are inherently POV terms. In the West, "alternative medicine" subsumes both non-European medical systems AND <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a> practices; "traditional medicine" means <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_medicine.html" title="Western medicine">Western medicine</a>. In the Orient, though "traditional medicine" includes <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayurveda.html" title="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_medicine.html" title="Chinese medicine">Chinese medicine</a> and other practices. However, it would be a mistake to suppress these terms. What is needed is for a GLOBAL perspective to be worked into all articles on these topics. This, of course, will provoke backlash from the conservative Western medical professional who believe that Western medicine is the "only" way to treat patients, as per my London doctor who just smiled indulgently when I told her that I had been to see a dietician and that I practice yoga.
