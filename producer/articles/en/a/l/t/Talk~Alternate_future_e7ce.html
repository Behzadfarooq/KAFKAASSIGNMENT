<p>Is "alternate future" a well-known term, or was it invented by the creator of this wiki page? If the former, could someone provide some examples? And if it's the latter, the article should probably be deleted because of wikipedia's policy on "original research". <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 03:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm very confused by your questions. Provide some examples? The page lists multiple examples: A Sound of Thunder, Marvel Comics, etc. If you're wondering whether "alternate future" is a well-known term, the fact that a Google search for "alternate future" turns up 93,400 hits and one for "alternative future" turns up 467,000 hits suggests that yes, it's a pretty well-known term.

<dd>I meant examples of people using the <i>term</i> "alternate future" as a general way of referring to these kinds of stories. A lot of the google hits don't use "alternate future" in the sense of this article, and even of those that do, it's not clear that it isn't just a case of people individually using "alternate" as an adjective to describe changed futures in particular stories, rather than thinking of a genre called "alternate future". As an analogy, one could say that Back to the Future II featured an "alternate Hill Valley" or that Star Trek's <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirror_Universe_221e.html" title="Mirror Universe">Mirror Universe</a> features an "alternate Spock" or that Philip K. Dick's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_bc69.html" title="The Man in the High Castle">The Man in the High Castle</a> features an "alternate America" (28,400 hits on google for this one BTW, but I don't think it should have its own wiki entry), but these are not recognized as general terms for a genre of stories, they're just uses of "alternate" as an adjective to describe elements of the story that were different in an alternate history. Can you find many examples on google of people using "alternate future" as a general term for a class of stories, rather than an element of one specific story? <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 02:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article's main point is, quoting from the first paragraph, that "an alternate future or alternative future is a possible future which never comes to pass". "Alternate/alternative future" is indisputably a well-known term for an element of many science-fiction stories. That establishes the encyclopedic-ness of the article. The article's primary claim is that "alternate/alternative future" is an element of science-fiction stories. Whether or not "alternate/alternative future" is used as a term for a general class of stories is <i>irrelevant</i> to whether the article is encyclopedic.</dd>

<dd>I disagree that whether or not it's used for a class of stories is irrelevant, since if it's just a description that a lot of people use to describe elements of particular stories, I wouldn't call it a "term" at all, just an adjective/noun pairing that comes up a lot. I'm sure a lot of people use the words "blond man" to describe blond male characters in stories, but "blond man" is not a term that should have its own wiki entry. More to the point, I already mentioned that the words "alternate america" give 28,400 hits on google, do you think this is a term which should have an entry of its own, or would you agree it's just an adjective/noun pairing which naturally comes up when describing stories set in alternate-history versions of america? If you agree, then what do you see as the crucial difference between "alternate future" and "alternate america"? <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 01:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difference is this: "blond man" and "alternate America" are just adjective-word pairings which do not have more meaning than an adjective applied to a noun, whereas "alternate future" implies more than just putting the words "alternate" and "future" together does. As an analogy, I would say that it's the difference between, say, "blue envelope", which is just an envelope that is blue, and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_envelope.html" title="Red envelope">red envelope</a>, which has more implications than just the words "red" and "envelope" put together. —<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/w/User_talk%7ELowellian_719b.html" title="User talk:Lowellian">reply</a>) 06:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see how "alternate future" has implications beyond putting the words together while "alternate america" doesn't, can you explain? Of course in both cases, the words can be used in a non science-fiction context (as many google results for both show), but in a science-fiction context, they both imply a setting for a story (either the future or america) which has been changed by some POD at an earlier point in time. The only real difference is that "alternate future" is more likely to involve time travel, but this is only because we already know what a "normal" america looks like so we can recognize an alternate one in an AH story, whereas we can only recognize that we're seeing an "alternate" future if the story also shows us what the "normal" future is supposed to look like in the context of the author's imagined history. But this is just a condition on when it would make sense to use this particular adjective-noun pairing, it doesn't make it a "term" any more than alternate america. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 08:45, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we're going to come to agreement on this issue. It's intuitively obvious to me that "alternate future" is a term...but if my above arguments can't convince you, then there's not much more I can say. I don't have the time to go dig through academic speculative fiction journals (these do exist!) for references.

<p>(indentation getting out of hand) OK, but before I decide whether to nominate it, can you explain what you meant when you said <i>whereas "alternate future" implies more than just putting the words "alternate" and "future" together does</i>? What specific implications were you thinking of, implications that don't have direct analogies to the implications (in a SF context) of "alternate America"? <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 22:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I meant all the information that is currently in the article. Let me put it this way: walk up to someone who's not a <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurist.html" title="Futurist">futurist</a> and who doesn't read <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>. Ask them what they think "alternate future" means. I don't think they would come up with anywhere near all the information that is in the article, and I think the article "alternate future" as it currently stands has significant room for expansion. —<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/w/User_talk%7ELowellian_719b.html" title="User talk:Lowellian">reply</a>) 20:12, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only implication I see in the article that goes beyond the implications of similar terms like "alternate America" is the fact that "alternate future" is typically used in stories involving time travel...is this all you meant by "all the information that is currently in the article", or did you have anything else in mind? If you're just talking about the time travel thing, then I think that's just because it would make less sense to talk about an "alternate future" in a non-time-travel story...as I said before, <i>The only real difference is that "alternate future" is more likely to involve time travel, but this is only because we already know what a "normal" america looks like so we can recognize an alternate one in an AH story, whereas we can only recognize that we're seeing an "alternate" future if the story also shows us what the "normal" future is supposed to look like in the context of the author's imagined history.</i> <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 09:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would argue against deletion. I don't know that this warrants a really long article, but this is distinct from "alternate history".

<dd>Now RLetson's contribution below is giving me second thoughts--does this "jessesword" site have any kind of recognized authority, in the sense of the references by Wolfe and Clute that RLetson mentions, or does it just represent one non-notable person's own opinions? In itself, the fact that people have used the words "alternate future" together for a long time does not itself justify calling it a "term", any more than showing that people have been using the words "alternate America" for a long time would. I think what's needed is either a published source that treats this as a "term", or else a web reference written by some recognized authority in SF. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 09:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I had no problem finding other mentions.

<dd><b>The useful thing about Jessesword</b> is that it is a lexicography site--its authority comes from its marshalling of examples of actual usage, which are the basis of a dictionary's entries. It's not what Jessesword says about a term on its own authority so much as what it reports about usage. Look at the "full record" for "alternate future" (four examples) compared to, say, "space opera" (23 full examples). The question isn't whether "alternate future" is a "real term" but whether it is in common use in the way the article suggests (about which see my comments below). <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERLetson_6f1f.html" title="User:RLetson">RLetson</a> 17:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found this discussion in passing. I might suggest referencing "alternate timeline" (which is also a term in theoretical science), which includes everything from comic book references, to <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_future.html" title="Back to the future">Back to the future</a>. And when it's used, the term "alternate future" is often used as well when describing the future of such an alternate timeline.

<p>I am not aware of "alternate future" as a term in common use in SF criticism, and despite the citation on Jessesword, one example (and in a work of fiction, not in a critical context) does not establish it as a one. You will not, for example, find an entry for it in Gary K. Wolfe's <i>Critical Terms in Science Fiction and Fantasy</i> (which is, to be fair, now 20 years old), nor in the Clute &amp; Nicholls <i>Encyclopedia</i>. It does indeed seem "intuitive" that there ought to be such a term, and that readers familiar with SF should understand its significance, but that is not the same thing as being an established critical or descriptive term. It is better thought of as a <i>concept</i> belonging to the (well-established) subfield of alternate-history or alternate-world SF, where it is one of the variables that such stories can employ. An encyclopedia--particularly Wikipedia--is not in the business of establishing Nifty Ideas but of gathering already established and documentable information. The fact that SF includes portraits of ambisexual aliens does not mean that there should be an article so named--unless that particular phrase has become part of the vocabulary that readers, reviewers, fans, and other commentators have developed. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_opera.html" title="Space opera">Space opera</a> and BEM (<a href="../../../b/u/g/Bug-eyed_monster.html" title="Bug-eyed monster">Bug-Eyed Monster</a>), on the other hand, are just such terms, and can (and do) support articles. The challenge for editors who would like to see this term get an article is to find not examples of alternate futures in SF but uses of the term in reviews and critical or descriptive writing about SF. Otherwise, I'd say that it is not notable. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERLetson_6f1f.html" title="User:RLetson">RLetson</a> 06:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A review of use of the term on Google shows that it is really only relevant in reference to established science fiction future universes, especially well-known ones. In other words, broadly speaking, it shows up mainly in relation to discussion about comic book settings (e.g. X-Men), media settings (e.g. Star Trek), and gaming settings (e.g. Warhammer 40,000 and various computer games). Because of the commercial (i.e. somewhat derivative) nature of these settings, there isn't a tremendous amount of scholarly interest. A small selection of mentions in reviews includes

"Alternate future" is a smaller related subgenre which is clearly identified, just not yet analyzed because it doesn't appear much in "serious"/literary science fiction. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 23:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Wolfe cites a 1981 bibliography dealing with alternate history (<i>Critical Terms</i>, 6). I still don't see "alternate future" as a <i>genre</i> term, as distinct from a term describing a feature of a particular story. The fact that it is used in passing in discussions of story/comic/TV show plots doesn't quite get it over the threshhold to subgenre status--I'd say it's about at the motif level. (Yeah, picky picky picky--I'm a literary taxonomist.) As for not appearing much in print SF--where do you think TV and comics writers steal their ideas? (Snob flag.) A search of time-travel and AH plot devices will yield plenty of examples of alternate futures/timelines (start with Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series that goes back to the 1950s and work in both directions). <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERLetson_6f1f.html" title="User:RLetson">RLetson</a> 20:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jeff Prucher has written an SF dictionary using the data gathered at the OED SF project, along with other OED data. You can see it at Amazon; it'll be called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-Words-Dictionary-Science/dp/0195305671/sr=8-1/qid=1166225807/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7672171-9339349?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-Words-Dictionary-Science/dp/0195305671/sr=8-1/qid=1166225807/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7672171-9339349?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Brave New Words</a></i>. I helped copyedit it, and am one of the editors of the OED SF project. <i>Brave New Words</i> won't be out till spring, Jeff tells me, but I know it will contain an entry for "alternate future". Cites: 1941 Bester "Probable Man"; 1950 Simak "Time Quarry"; 1979 Asimov "Golden Years of SF"; Spinrad 1981 in Asimov's. There's also an entry for "alternative future": cites are 1939 C.L. Moore "Greater Than Gods"; 1941 Bester "Probable Man"; 1974 Scortia in Bretnor's "SF, Today and Tomorrow"; 2004 Fforde "Something Rotten".</dd>

<dd>There are also entries for alternate/alternative history/world/universe/reality; a total of ten entries all told, all of which refer to the concept of parallel worlds.</dd>

<dd>However, I don't think that really establishes the notability of the term for our purposes. It's certainly a term easily recognized by sf readers, but I think the concept can be covered under <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universe</a>. I think <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history_fiction.html" title="Alternate history fiction">alternate history fiction</a> is a large enough genre that it deserves its own entry, but I don't think there's anything here that can't be covered under <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universe</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 23:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
