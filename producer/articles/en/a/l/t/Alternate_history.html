<p><b>Alternate history</b> or <b>alternative history</b> is a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subgenre.html" title="Subgenre">subgenre</a> of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speculative_fiction.html" title="Speculative fiction">speculative fiction</a> (or some would say of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>) that is set in a world in which <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a> has <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_divergence.html" title="Point of divergence">diverged</a> from history as it is generally known. Alternate history <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> asks the question, "What if history had developed differently?" Most works in this genre are based in real historical events, yet feature social, geopolitical, or industrial circumstances that developed differently than our own. While to some extent all <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a> can be described as "alternate history," the subgenre proper comprises fiction in which a change or <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_divergence.html" title="Point of divergence">point of divergence</a> occurs in the past that causes human society to develop in a way that is distinct from our own.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, this type of fiction has to a large extent merged with science fictional <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trope.html" title="Trope">tropes</a> involving (a) cross-time, or paratime, travel between alternate histories/universes (or psychic awareness of the existence of "our" universe by the people in another, as in Nabokov and Dick; see below); or (b) ordinary voyaging uptime or downtime that results in history splitting into two or more timelines. Cross-time, time-splitting and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another. Thus, cross-time and time-splitting stories will be an important part of this article <i>insofar as they portray one or more alternate histories that diverged from a common past</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_%28language%29.html" title="French (language)">French</a>, alternate history novels are called <i>uchronie</i>. This <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> is based on the word <i>utopia</i> (a place that doesn't exist) and the Greek for time, <i>chronos</i>. An <i>uchronie</i>, then, is defined as a time that doesn't exist. Another occasionally-used term for the genre is "allohistory" (lit. "other history").<a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-all1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-all1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

It recounts the tale of a man who is considered "a madman" due to his perceiving a different <a href="../../../1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a>, a reality in which long-dead famous people are still alive such as the poets <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Burns_c5f3.html" title="Robert Burns">Burns</a>, <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron.html" title="Byron">Byron</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_d781.html" title="Percy Bysshe Shelley">Shelley</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keats_3200.html" title="John Keats">Keats</a>, the actor <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Kean_8be2.html" title="Edmund Kean">Edmund Kean</a>, the British politician <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Canning_fe22.html" title="George Canning">George Canning</a> and even <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_I_of_France_e789.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>.</p>

<p>Although a number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the next major work is perhaps the strongest anthology of alternate history ever assembled. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, British historian <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_John_Squire_8e6d.html" title="Sir John Squire">Sir John Squire</a> collected a series of essays, many of which could be considered stories, in <i><a href="../../../i/f/_/If_It_Had_Happened_Otherwise_388b.html" title="If It Had Happened Otherwise">If It Had Happened Otherwise</a></i> from some of the leading historians of the period. In this work, scholars from major universities as well as important non-university-based authors turned their attention to such questions as "If the Moors in Spain Had Won" and "If <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI</a> Had Had an Atom of Firmness." The essays range from serious scholarly efforts through <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendrik_Willem_van_Loon_28dc.html" title="Hendrik Willem van Loon">Hendrik Willem van Loon</a>'s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>.</p>
<p>Four of the fourteen pieces examined the two most popular themes in alternate history prior to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>: Napoleon's victory and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. One of the entries in Squire's volume was <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s "If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg"<a href="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a> had won the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, considering what would have happened if the North had been victorious (in other words, a character from an alternate world imagining a world more like the real one we live in, although not necessarily getting all the details right). This kind of speculative work which posts from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as a "recursive alternate history", a "double-blind what-if" or an "alternate-alternate history". Other authors appearing in Squire's book included <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilaire_Belloc_fcde.html" title="Hilaire Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Maurois_c24b.html" title="André Maurois">André Maurois</a>.</p>
<p>Another example of alternate history from this period (and arguably the first to explicitly posit cross-time travel from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience) was <a href="../../../h/2E/g/H.G._Wells_27b3.html" title="H.G. Wells">H.G. Wells</a>' <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_Like_Gods_8f94.html" title="Men Like Gods">Men Like Gods</a></i> (1923) in which several British politicians are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross-time machine into an alternate universe in which Britain had changed course in earlier centuries and developed into a seemingly pacifistic and utopian society. When the politicians from our world try to seize power, the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else's universe. Wells works out the entire multiverse-pancake framing complete with paratime travel machines that would become popular with U.S. pulp writers (see below), but since his hero experiences only a single alternate world this story is not very different from conventional alternate history (the intruders from our world cause no significant change in the world they enter and are really just a device for examining the results of a past divergence between Wells' utopia and our own world).</p>
<p>The 1930s would see alternate history move into a new arena. The December <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> issue of <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_%28magazine%29.html" title="Astounding (magazine)">Astounding</a></i> published <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_Schachner_1d00.html" title="Nat Schachner">Nat Schachner</a>'s "Ancestral Voices". This was quickly followed by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Leinster_78ae.html" title="Murray Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s "Sidewise in Time". While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straight-forward divergences, Leinster attempted something completely different. In his "world gone mad", pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines. The story follows Robinson College Professor Minott as he wanders through these analogs, each of which features remnants of worlds which followed a different history.</p>

<p>This period also saw the publication of the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> novel <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Lest_Darkness_Fall_e8d7.html" title="Lest Darkness Fall">Lest Darkness Fall</a></i> by <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Sprague_de_Camp_1bb8.html" title="L. Sprague de Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, which was similar to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Twain_2795.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court_f313.html" title="A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</a></i> but sent an American academic to the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> of the <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostrogoths.html" title="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> at the time of the Byzantine invasion led by <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belisarius.html" title="Belisarius">Belisarius</a>. De Camp's work is concerned with the historical changes wrought by his time traveler, Martin Padway, thereby making the work an alternate history. Padway is depicted as making permanent changes and implicitly forming a new time branch (in contrast to Twain's hero, who ultimately fails, with the result that history reverts to its "normal" course - making this book a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_history.html" title="Secret history">secret history</a>, though this sub-genre did not exist as such in Twain's time).</p>
<p>Time travel as the cause of a point of divergence (creating two histories where before there was one, or simply replacing the future that existed before the time traveling event) has continued to be a popular theme over the decades. In <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bring_the_Jubilee_c6dc.html" title="Bring the Jubilee">Bring the Jubilee</a></i>, by <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Moore_3de5.html" title="Ward Moore">Ward Moore</a>, the hero, who lives in a backward world in which the South won the Civil War, travels through time and brings about an alternate history in which the North won at Gettysburg. <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Bradbury_a4ab.html" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Sound_of_Thunder_0330.html" title="A Sound of Thunder">A Sound of Thunder</a></i> creates a scenario in which the time travelers inadvertently destroy all history as we know it.</p>
<p>When a story's assumptions about the nature of time necessitate, as in the Bradbury tale, a replacement of the visited historical time's future rather than just the creation of a new time line, the next step is obviously the founding of a time patrol (a device that is <i>not</i> to be confused with the paratime police, see below). Such an agency has the grim task of saving civilization every day, every hour, with patrol members—depicted most notably in <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul_Anderson_c3f6.html#Time_Patrol" title="Poul Anderson">Poul Anderson's Time Patrol</a>—racing uptime and downtime to preserve the "correct" history.</p>
<p>This can lead to terrible moral dilemmas. In <i>Delenda Est,</i> the interference of time-travelling outlaws causes <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthage.html" title="Carthage">Carthage</a> to win the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Punic_War_97a8.html" title="Second Punic War">Second Punic War</a> and destroy <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. As a result, there is a completely different Twentieth Century - "not better or worse, just completely different". The hero, Patrol Agent Manse Everard, must return to that period, fight the outlaws and change history back, restoring his (and our) familiar history - but only at the price of totally destroying the world which has taken its place, and which is equally deserving of existence. The stakes are the highest imaginable: billions of lives balanced against other billions of lives, for one man to decide. "Risking your neck in order to negate a world full of people like yourself" is how the hero describes what he eventually undertakes.</p>
<p>Of course not all time travel stories involve alternate histories. The writer may ignore the possibility of change, or have the cause-and-effect work out so that the time traveler's actions cause the future he remembers, as in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Harrison_70ae.html" title="Harry Harrison">Harry Harrison</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Technicolor_Time_Machine_5f7a.html" title="The Technicolor Time Machine">The Technicolor Time Machine</a></i>.</p>

<p>H.G. Wells' "cross-time"/"many universes" variant (see above) was fully developed by De Camp in his 1940 short story "The Wheels of If" (<i>Unknown Fantasy Fiction</i>, October 1940), in which the hero is repeatedly shifted from one alternate history to another, each more remote from our own than the last. This subgenre was used early on for purposes far removed from quasi-academic examination of alternative outcomes to historical events. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fredric_Brown_84a6.html" title="Fredric Brown">Fredric Brown</a> employed it to satirize the s-f pulps and their adolescent readers—and fears of foreign invasion—in the classic <i>What Mad Universe</i> (1949). In <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_Simak_4460.html" title="Clifford Simak">Clifford Simak</a>'s <i>Ring Around the Sun</i> (1953), the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed (the ultimate divergence) but where a band of mutants is establishing a colony; the story line appears to frame the author's anxieties regarding <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.</p>

<p>Also in the late 1940s and the 1950s, however, writers such as <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Beam_Piper_edc2.html" title="H. Beam Piper">H. Beam Piper</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Merwin%2C_Jr._9589.html" title="Sam Merwin, Jr.">Sam Merwin, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Norton_0410.html" title="Andre Norton">Andre Norton</a> wrote thrillers set in a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">multiverse</a> in which all alternate histories are co-existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and/or paratime capsules. These authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and/or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of James Bond style secret agents (Piper called them the "paratime police").</p>
<p>This concept provided a convenient framing for packing a smorgasbord of historical alternatives (and even of timeline "branches") into a single novel, either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villain(s) through multiple worlds or (less artfully) via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors (or between paratime agents and new recruits) regarding the histories of such worlds.</p>
<p>Paratime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Many-worlds_interpretation.html" title="Many-worlds interpretation">Many-worlds interpretation</a> of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> (first formulated by <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Everett_1043.html" title="Hugh Everett">Hugh Everett III</a> in 1957) to account for the differing worlds. Some science fiction writers interpret the splitting of worlds to depend on human decision-making and free will, while others rely on the <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterfly_effect.html" title="Butterfly effect">butterfly effect</a> from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_theory.html" title="Chaos theory">chaos theory</a> to amplify random differences at the atomic or subatomic level into a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macroscopic.html" title="Macroscopic">macroscopic</a> divergence at some specific point in history; either way, science fiction writers usually have all changes flow from a particular historical <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_divergence.html" title="Point of divergence">point of divergence</a> (often abbreviated as 'POD' by fans of the genre). Prior to Everett, science-fiction writers drew on higher dimensions and the speculations of <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._D._Ouspensky_c434.html" title="P. D. Ouspensky">P. D. Ouspensky</a> to explain their characters' cross-time jauntings.</p>
<p>While many justifications for alternate histories involve a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">multiverse</a>, the "many world" theory would naturally involve—many worlds, in fact a continually exploding array of universes. In quantum theory, new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event, and even if the writer uses human decisions, every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline. A writer's fictional multiverse may, in fact, preclude some decisions as humanly impossible, as when, in <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Watch_%28novel%29_3acc.html" title="Night Watch (novel)">Night Watch</a></i>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Pratchett_8474.html" title="Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen, has happened, nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife. When the writer explicitly maintains that <i>all</i> possible decisions are made in all possible ways, one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave, nor clever, nor skilled, but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route, take the stupid action, fumble the crucial activity, etc.; few writers focus on this idea, although it has been explored in stories such as Larry Niven's <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_the_Myriad_Ways_abf9.html" title="All the Myriad Ways">All the Myriad Ways</a></i>, where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import.</p>
<p>In any case, even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world, it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred (even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite, it is still possible to assign a different <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Measure (mathematics)">measure</a> to different infinite sets). The physicist <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Deutsch_377b.html" title="David Deutsch">David Deutsch</a>, a strong advocate of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, has argued along these lines, saying that "By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives. When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen." <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0268.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0268.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> This view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories, but a few writers have tried, such as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Egan_b618.html" title="Greg Egan">Greg Egan</a> in his short story <i>The Infinite Assassin</i>, where an agent is trying to contain reality-scrambling "whirlpools" that form around users of a certain drug, and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves, attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences but he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves.</p>
<p>Many writers -- perhaps the majority -- avoid the discussion entirely. In one novel of this type, <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Beam_Piper_edc2.html" title="H. Beam Piper">H. Beam Piper</a>'s <i><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Kalvan_of_Otherwhen_c7ff.html" title="Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen">Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen</a></i>, a country is saved because a Pennsylvanian cop is dropped into it, with the trade secret of how to make gunpowder, before it is overrun; the paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it, where the country <i>will</i> be overrun, but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed, remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved.</p>
<p>The cross-time theme was further developed in the 1960s by <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Laumer_6a3b.html" title="Keith Laumer">Keith Laumer</a> in the first three volumes of his <i>Imperium</i> sequence, which would be completed in <i>Zone Yellow</i> (1990). Piper's politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Kurland_785c.html" title="Michael Kurland">Michael Kurland</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Chalker_9cd7.html" title="Jack Chalker">Jack Chalker</a> in the 1980s; Chalker's <i><a href="../../../g/o/d/God%2C_Inc._384e.html" title="God, Inc.">God, Inc.</a></i> trilogy (1987-89), featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz, marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural. Kurland's <i>Perchance</i> (1988), the first volume of the never completed "Chronicles of Elsewhen", presents a multiverse of secretive cross-time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross-time travel, ranging from high-tech capsules to mutant powers. ' Another seminal work in the genre must be Keith Roberts' <i><a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavane_%28novel%29.html" title="Pavane (novel)">Pavane</a></i> (1982), which hearkens back to 1968 and a Britain conquered in 1588 when the Spanish Armada was not destroyed by a providential storm.</p>
<p>The concept of a cross-time version of a world war, involving rival paratime empires, was developed in <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Leiber_b097.html" title="Fritz Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s Change War series, starting with the Hugo-award-winning <i>The Big Time</i> (1958); followed by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_C._Meredith_7307.html" title="Richard C. Meredith">Richard C. Meredith</a>'s <i>Timeliner</i> trilogy in the 1970s, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McCollum_44ab.html" title="Michael McCollum">Michael McCollum</a>'s <i>A Greater Infinity</i> (1982) and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Barnes_%28author%29_e423.html" title="John Barnes (author)">John Barnes'</a> <i>Timeline Wars</i> trilogy in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Given the limitless fictional possibilities of paratime travel themes, and the fact that both <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> and the many-worlds theory of quantum physics provide a highly plausible hard-science-fiction foundation for such stories, it is probable that this variant will continue to flourish in tandem with the more "conventional" alternate history stories described below.</p>
<p>Such "paratime" stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next, providing a science fictional explanation—or veneer—for what is normally fantasy. <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Allston_b25d.html" title="Aaron Allston">Aaron Allston</a>'s <i>Doc Sidhe</i> and <i>Sidhe Devil</i> take place between our world, the "grim world" and an alternate "fair world" where the Sidhe retreated to. Although technology is clearly present in both worlds, and the "fair world" parallels our history, about fifty years out of step, there is functional magic in the fair world. Even with such explanation, the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world, the more likely the story is to be labeled fantasy, as in Poul Anderson's "House Rule" and "Loser's Night."</p>
<p>In both science fiction and fantasy, whether a given <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universe</a> is an alternate history may not be clear. The writer might allude to a POD only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept, or may present the universe without explanation to its existence.</p>

<p>Most of the early cross-time thrillers depicted the multiverse in Euclidean terms (pancake universes stretching to left and right of any given zero universe with the divergence point being earlier and earlier, and the differences greater and greater, the farther one moved in either direction from the zero point). McCollum and some later writers, however, have posited a pseudo-Einsteinian paratime in which universes are constantly shifting around, moving closer or farther from each other, with time dilating or contracting from one universe to another in unpredictable ways. This framing device expands the potential for using cross-time fiction to compare different outcomes uptime, downtime and crosstime all at once.</p>

This book, widely regarded as Dick's masterpiece, has enhanced the prestige of alternate history in mainstream literary circles, although Dick was not yet recognized beyond SF circles when it was first published. Dick's book also contained an example of "alternate-alternate" history, in that one of its characters is the author of a book in which the Allies won the war.</p>

Some critics believe that the references to a counter-earth suggest that the world portrayed in <i>Ada</i> is a delusion in the mind of the hero (another favorite theme of Dick's novels). Strikingly, the characters in <i>Ada</i> seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version, calling it "Anti-Terra" while its mythical twin is the real "Terra." Not only history but science has followed a divergent path on Anti-Terra: it boasts all the same technology as our world, but all based on water instead of electricity. When a character in <i>Ada</i> makes a long-distance call, all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power.</p>

<p>The late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular-fiction versions of alternate history, fueled by the emergence of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Turtledove_6c42.html" title="Harry Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>, the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a> genre and two series of anthologies— the "What Might Have Been" series edited by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Benford_8260.html" title="Gregory Benford">Gregory Benford</a> and the "Alternate ..." series edited by <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Resnick_bf8a.html" title="Mike Resnick">Mike Resnick</a>.

<p>Since the late 1990s, Harry Turtledove has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history. His books include a series in which <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">the South</a> won the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> and another in which aliens invade Earth during the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>.

He has also launched an alternate history series for teenagers that utilizes a version of H. Beam Piper's paratime-trading-empire framing.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focusses on worlds in which the Nazis won World War Two.

<p>Many fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world, but with magic added. Since the existence of magic implies different laws of nature it is difficult to imagine a credible point of divergence: The effects of divergence would have existed throughout human history and indeed throughout all evolution of life (unless one posits sudden changes in the laws of nature in medieval or modern times brought about by aliens, a time-space warp, etc.). One example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul_Anderson_c3f6.html" title="Poul Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Hearts_and_Three_Lions_8f20.html" title="Three Hearts and Three Lions">Three Hearts and Three Lions</a></i> in which the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter_of_France_41f4.html" title="Matter of France">Matter of France</a> is history, and the fairy folk are real and powerful. A partly familiar European history for which the author provides a point of divergence is <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randall_Garrett_bde3.html" title="Randall Garrett">Randall Garrett</a>'s "<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Darcy_%28fiction%29_9753.html" title="Lord Darcy (fiction)">Lord Darcy</a>" series: a monk systemizing magic rather than science, so the use of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digitalis.html" title="Digitalis">foxglove</a> to treat heart disease is called superstition.</p>

<p>The <i><a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Maker_29e1.html" title="Alvin Maker">Alvin Maker</a></i> series by <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Scott_Card_9716.html" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a> (a parallel to the life of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a>, founder of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>) takes place in an alternate America, beginning in the early 19th century. Prior to that time, a POD occurred: England, under the control of Oliver Cromwell, had banished "makers", or anyone else demonstrating "knacks" (an ability to perform seemingly supernatural feats) to the North American continent. Thus the early American colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts, and counted on them as a part of their daily lives. The political divisions of the continent is considerably altered, with two large English colonies bookending a smaller "American" nation, one aligned with England, and the other an exile for the house of Stuart. Actual historical figures are seen in a much different light: Ben Franklin is revered as the continents's finest "maker", George Washington was executed at the hands of an English army, and "Tom" Jefferson is the first president of "Apallachee", the result of a compromise between the Continentals and the British.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the "Old Ones" still manifest themselves in England in <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Roberts_7f2d.html" title="Keith Roberts">Keith Roberts</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavane_%28novel%29.html" title="Pavane (novel)">Pavane</a></i>, which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of Elizabeth I allowed the Spanish Armada to conquer England, the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible: the fairies really were present all along, in a secret history. Again, in the English Renaissance fantasy <i>Armor of Light</i> by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Scott_a632.html" title="Melissa Scott">Melissa Scott</a> and Lisa A. Barnett, the magic used in the book, by Dr. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dee_d7cc.html" title="John Dee">John Dee</a> and others, actually was practiced in the Renaissance; positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a POD, Sir <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Sidney_e7f8.html" title="Philip Sidney">Philip Sidney</a>'s surviving the Battle of Zutphen, and shortly there after saving the life of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Marlowe_6b85.html" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>.</p>
<p>Many works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function, and where the consequences of such reality would not, in fact, disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history. Many ambiguous alternate/secret histories are set in Renaissance or pre-Renaissance times, and may explicitly include a "retreat" from the world, which would explain the current absence of such phenomena.</p>
<p>When the magical version of our world's history is set in contemporary times, the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_fantasy.html" title="Contemporary fantasy">contemporary fantasy</a>, using in effect a form of secret history (as when <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josepha_Sherman_d784.html" title="Josepha Sherman">Josepha Sherman</a>'s <i>Son of Darkness</i> has an elf living in New York City, in disguise) on the other. In works such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s <i>Magic, Incorporated</i> where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul_Anderson_c3f6.html" title="Poul Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s <i><a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Chaos_%28novel%29_36b2.html" title="Operation Chaos (novel)">Operation Chaos</a></i> and its sequel <i><a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Luna_c058.html" title="Operation Luna">Operation Luna</a></i>, where djinns are serious weapons of war—with atomic bombs—the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history—although references in <i>Operation Chaos</i> to de-Gaussifying the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a POD. The sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of Einstein and Planck in 1901, resulting in the theory of "rheatics". <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Moseley_29c4.html" title="Henry Moseley">Moseley</a> applies this theory to "degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces." This results in the suppression of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferromagnetism.html" title="Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetism</a> and the reemergence of magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Alternate history shades off into other <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_subgenres.html" title="Fantasy subgenres">fantasy subgenres</a> when the use of actual, though altered, history and geography decreases, although a culture may still be clearly the original source; <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Hughart_e982.html" title="Barry Hughart">Barry Hughart</a>'s <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge_of_Birds_b60c.html" title="Bridge of Birds">Bridge of Birds</a></i> and its sequels take place in a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_world.html" title="Fantasy world">fantasy world</a>, albeit one clearly based on China, and with allusions to actual Chinese history, such as <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Wu_of_Zhou_63af.html" title="Empress Wu of Zhou">the Empress Wu</a>. Richard Garfinkle's <i><a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_Matters_d3a0.html" title="Celestial Matters">Celestial Matters</a></i> incorporates ancient Chinese physics and Greek <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotelian_physics.html" title="Aristotelian physics">Aristotelian physics</a>, using them as if factual.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Pullman_dc03.html" title="Philip Pullman">Philip Pullman</a> mined both pseudo-alternate history and cross-time themes in <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/His_Dark_Materials_4b59.html" title="His Dark Materials">His Dark Materials</a></i> (1996-2000), a science-fantasy trilogy for young adults. Most notable is his variant version of England in the first volume, although given the different (magical) laws of nature there could be no credible point of departure, nor does Pullman attempt to provide one.</p>
<p>A fantasy version of the paratime police was developed by children's writer <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Wynne_Jones_9e2d.html" title="Diana Wynne Jones">Diana Wynne Jones</a> in her <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrestomanci.html" title="Chrestomanci">Chrestomanci</a></i> quartet (1977-1988), with wizards taking the place of high tech secret agents. Among the novels in this series, <i><a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_Week_aff8.html" title="Witch Week">Witch Week</a></i> stands out for its vivid depiction of a history alternate to that of Chrestomanci's own world rather than our own (and yet with a specific POD that turned it away from the "normal" history of most worlds visited by the wizard).</p>
<p>Other authors have used paratime concepts without the police; <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul_Anderson_c3f6.html" title="Poul Anderson">Poul Anderson</a> uses the tavern the Old Phoenix as a nexus between alternate histories. A character from a modern American alternate history <i>Operation Chaos</i> can thus appear in the English Civil War setting of <i>A Midsummer's Tempest</i>. In this context, the distinction between an alternate history and a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universe</a> with some points in common but no common history may not be feasible, as the writer may not provide enough information to distinguish.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Pratchett_8474.html" title="Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s works includes several references to alternate histories of <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld.html" title="Discworld">Discworld</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_At_Arms_efc8.html" title="Men At Arms">Men At Arms</a></i> observes that in millions of universes, Edward d'Eath became an obsessive recluse rather than the instigator of the plot that he is in the novel. In <i><a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingo.html" title="Jingo">Jingo</a></i>, Vimes accidentally picks up a pocket organizer that should have gone down another leg of the Trousers of Time, and so can hear the organizer reporting on the deaths that would have occurred had his decision gone otherwise. Indeed, Discworld contains an equivalent of the Time Patrol in its <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_Monks_45c7.html" title="History Monks">History Monks</a>. <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Watch_%28novel%29_3acc.html" title="Night Watch (novel)">Night Watch</a></i> revolves around a repair of history after a time traveler's murder of an important figure in Vimes's past. <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/Thief_of_Time_30c5.html" title="Thief of Time">Thief of Time</a></i> presents them functioning as a fullscale Time Patrol, ensuring that history occurs at all.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history.html" title="Edit section: Elements of Alternate History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elements of Alternate History</span></h2>
<p>There are certain elements which are common to all alternate histories, whether they deal with history on the micro-level (personal alternate histories) or the macro-level (world-changing events). These elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a point of change from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing;</li>
<li>a change which would alter history as it is known; and</li>
<li>an examination of the ramifications of that change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternate histories do not:</p>
<ul>
<li>need to be set in the past;</li>
<li>need to spell out the point of divergence;</li>
<li>need to deal with world changing events; or</li>
<li>need to include famous people.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history.html" title="Edit section: The boundaries of alternate history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The boundaries of alternate history</span></h2>
<p>This leads to readers encountering stories which read <i>as though</i> they were alternate history, but which are not. An example would be <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Who_Sold_the_Moon_cc01.html" title="The Man Who Sold the Moon">The Man Who Sold the Moon</a></i>. Written in the 1940s, it posits that the first moon launch is run by a private organization rather than a government agency in the 1960s. New readers encountering the book may well presume that this is alternate history since it is clearly a counter-factual depiction of the first moon launch, now almost 40 years in the past. However, <i>when written</i>, the first moon launch was nearly 30 years in the <i>future</i>. Thus, <i>The Man Who Sold the Moon</i> is out of date <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> and not true alternate history; among many fans of the genre, however, such incorrect future history is often considered 'honorary alternate history'. It is a convenient way of reading with enjoyment an ever-increasing number of old SF stories and books, in which the events described did not happen at the time indicated in the text.</p>
<p>Also one should not confuse the AH subgenre with <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_history.html" title="Secret history">secret history</a>, which gives an account of history at odds with our general understanding--presenting its own account (whether seriously or satirically intended) as having been concealed or suppressed by an elite. For instance, a story that depicts key events of U.S. history as having been controlled by the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminati.html" title="Illuminati">Illuminati</a> and the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasons.html" title="Freemasons">Freemasons</a>--or by aliens--might be secret history. But mischievous writers occasionally unite AH and secret history. One example is a story in the anthology <i>Alternate Presidents</i> in which <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dukakis_8fbd.html" title="Michael Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> defeats <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> for the presidency in 1988 and then is taken to a secret saucer base under <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a> to meet his new masters.</p>
<p>AH also should not be mistaken for fantasy tales that employ a lost history trope, i.e., that assume a stage of human civilization which supposedly has been forgotten through the passage of time, not through conspiratorial suppression. The works of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Howard_bc8f.html" title="Robert Howard">Robert Howard</a> and <a href="../../../j/2E/r/J.R.R._Tolkien_b884.html" title="J.R.R. Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a> are excellent examples of lost history, which generally does not purport to represent a different time-line from our own.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have novels that explore Points of Divergence (the key concept in alternate history) without actually being works of alternate history themselves. Two good examples are <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Williamson_8a19.html" title="Jack Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>'s influential pulp novel <i>The Legion of Time</i> (1938) and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marge_Piercy_837b.html" title="Marge Piercy">Marge Piercy</a>'s critically acclaimed <i><a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman_on_the_Edge_of_Time_abac.html" title="Woman on the Edge of Time">Woman on the Edge of Time</a></i> (1976). In the Piercy book, which follows Williamson's basic conception but is still strikingly original, a patient in a mental hospital is able to travel into two alternate futures—one an ecotopia run by reformed <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather_Underground_770c.html" title="Weather Underground">Weather Underground</a> types and the other a fascist dystopia run by people-hating robots. Decisions she must make to resist an insidious new type of brain operation will determine which future wins. This is a time travel story, a cross-time story, a Christopher Priest style delusional alternate reality story and a POD story all rolled into one but it is <i>not</i> alternate history because the POD occurs in the present (or perhaps the near future) not in the past.</p>
<p>Less obvious is the difference between alternate history and "what if" stories. The latter subgenre extrapolates, from the present, a concrete near-future possibility that is often an expression of current public fears (hence the alternate term "cautionary tale" used by Sackville-West, see below). For instance, beginning in the 1870s the British reading public was treated to a number of what-if books about a German or French invasion of an unready British Isles. During the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinclair_Lewis_a81e.html" title="Sinclair Lewis">Sinclair Lewis</a> wrote of a <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> takeover in the United State in his classic <i><a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here_794a.html" title="It Can't Happen Here">It Can't Happen Here</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>). During the early years of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Sackville-West_9b1f.html" title="Vita Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a> penned the science fantasy <i>Grand Canyon</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>) in which the Germans invade a woefully unprepared United States. One could define such tales as borderline alternate history, since they are usually set in a time that is only shortly after the time of writing and the events described could not have occurred without a branching of history before, if only slightly before, the book was written.</p>
<p>The boundary, like many in literature, is a broad line with grey edges (not unlike the fog around the alternate universe portals in science-fiction stories of fifty years ago). Would a 2005 author writing a story set in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> in Heinlein's universe, or <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Verne_fa88.html" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Nemo_715e.html" title="Captain Nemo">Captain Nemo</a></i> universe be writing SF or AH? Opinions differ.</p>

<p>A few movies about alternate pasts, however, focus on individuals rather than historical events and some students of AH would say these are <b>not</b> alternate histories (e.g., <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Capra_af99.html" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a>’s <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i>, and more recently <a href="../../../k/r/z/Krzysztof_Kie%C5%9Blowski_1d4f.html" title="Krzysztof Kieślowski">Krzysztof Kieślowski</a>'s <i>Blind Chance</i>, <i><a href="../../../s/l/i/Sliding_Doors_32f6.html" title="Sliding Doors">Sliding Doors</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_Lola_Run_b254.html" title="Run Lola Run">Run Lola Run</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/e/_/Me_Myself_I_e1d1.html" title="Me Myself I">Me Myself I</a></i>and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Butterfly_Effect_20ea.html" title="The Butterfly Effect">The Butterfly Effect</a></i>). However, in the Capra film the angel shows <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Stewart_33aa.html" title="Jimmy Stewart">Jimmy Stewart</a> an alternate history in which he was never born—the changes in his home town are serious and far-reaching, creating a much darker reality for his neighbors. Thus if one posits, as Capra does, that changes in personal lives create a ripple effect in the larger history, then such stories do qualify as a type of alternate history (one could call them "alternate local history" or "alternate interpersonal history"). Such worlds with relatively small (and sometimes almost undiscernable) changes in personal lives were given the name "cognate universes" by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Vance_7df8.html" title="Jack Vance">Jack Vance</a> in the novelette "Rumfuddle" (1973).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_show.html" title="Television show">television show</a> <i><a href="../../../s/l/i/Sliders.html" title="Sliders">Sliders</a></i> presented alternate histories under the science-inspired guise of quantum-navigating the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28science%29.html" title="Multiverse (science)">multiverse</a>. The alternate Americas in most episodes are nasty <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystopias.html" title="Dystopias">dystopias</a>, although sometimes this is not evident at first. Another such television show, a South Korean drama, <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gung.html" title="Gung">Gung</a> presents a point of divergence where the Korean monarchy is restored after independence from the Japanese Empire even up to the 21st Century.<a href="http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/drama/gung/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/drama/gung/index.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (Note: This website is in Korean.)</p>
<p>The dramatic possibilities of alternate history provide a diverse genre for exploration in <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing games</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_role-playing_games_by_genre.html#Period_Adventure.2FAlternate_History_Genres" title="List of role-playing games by genre">Many games</a> use an alternate historical background for their campaigns. In particular, the fourth edition of <a href="../../../g/u/r/GURPS_536d.html" title="GURPS">GURPS</a> uses a setting containing multiple different alternate histories as its default campaign setting, with the supplement <a href="../../../g/u/r/GURPS_Infinite_Worlds_6165.html" title="GURPS Infinite Worlds">GURPS Infinite Worlds</a> detailing a large number of alternate worlds included in the setting, many of them carryovers from the third-edition GURPS supplements <a href="../../../g/u/r/GURPS_Alternate_Earths_045f.html" title="GURPS Alternate Earths">GURPS Alternate Earths</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/r/GURPS_Alternate_Earths_II_5b29.html" title="GURPS Alternate Earths II">GURPS Alternate Earths II</a>.</p>
<p>For the same reasons that this genre is explored by role-playing games, alternate history is also an intriguing backdrop for the storylines of many video and computer games. One of the most famous example of an alternate history game is <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Command_%26_Conquer%7E_Red_Alert_807a.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>.</i> It presents a point of divergence where <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> goes back in time to eliminate <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> long before he gained power in Germany to prevent World War II from ever taking place. He is successful in his mission, but in the process allows <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to become powerful enough—as a direct result of not having a strong rival dictator like Hitler to keep his power in check—to launch an all out campaign to conquer Europe, sparking an alternate (and ultimately costlier) version of the Second World War and, eventually, a third world war in the 1970s where the USSR invades the USA.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimson_Skies_8f34.html" title="Crimson Skies">Crimson Skies</a> is one example of an alternate history spawning multiple interpertations in multiple genres. The stories and games in Crimson Skies take place in an alternate 1930's <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, where the nation crumbled into many hostile nation-states following the effects of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">Great War</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>. With the road and railway system destroyed, commerce took to the skies. Great cargo <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">zeppelins</a> escorted by fighter squadrons are the targets of many ruthless air pirates and enemy countries. The project was developed into a board game simulating aerial combat that was introduced by <a href="../../../f/a/s/FASA_d928.html" title="FASA">FASA</a> in 1998. In 2000, <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipper_Interactive_c987.html" title="Zipper Interactive">Zipper Interactive</a> developed the property into a computer game, which was published by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. In 2003, it returned as <a href="../../../h/i/g/Crimson_Skies%7E_High_Road_to_Revenge_e01f.html" title="Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge">Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge</a> for the <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox.html" title="Xbox">Xbox</a>, as well as a collectible miniature games from <a href="../../../w/i/z/WizKids_3e3b.html" title="WizKids">WizKids</a>. The series has also led to the creation of various promotional novels, comics and short stories.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history.html" title="Edit section: Points of divergence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Points of divergence</span></h2>
<p>The key change between our history and the alternate history is known as the "<a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_divergence.html" title="Point of divergence">Point of divergence</a>" (PoD). In <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K._Dick_87c3.html" title="Philip K. Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_bc69.html" title="The Man in the High Castle">The Man in the High Castle</a></i>, the PoD is the attempted assassination of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. In reality, this attempt failed. Another alternate history with a point of divergence connected to Roosevelt is the backdrop to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Roth_9a4a.html" title="Philip Roth">Philip Roth</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plot_Against_America_fa5e.html" title="The Plot Against America">The Plot Against America</a></i>, in which Roosevelt is defeated in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1940_c891.html" title="United States presidential election, 1940">US presidential election</a> by the isolationist <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a>, who reaches an accommodation with the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers.html" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and keeps the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> out of the war. In Robert Harris's <i><a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatherland_%28novel%29.html" title="Fatherland (novel)">Fatherland</a></i>, the PoD occurs when a German attack into the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> succeeds in the Nazis seizing vital oil and cutting off supplies to the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>. This forces the USSR to surrender, enabling the Axis Powers to bring the remaining Allies to the peace table, one by one. Some variants of the theory of the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28science%29.html" title="Multiverse (science)">multiverse</a> posit that PoDs occur every instant, springing off <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universes</a> for each instance (see <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history_%28fiction%29.html#Introducing_the_paratime_patrol" title="Alternate history (fiction)">introducing the paratime patrol</a> for further discussion of this point).</p>
<p>Even mainstream <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> stories are known to have points of divergence. For example, in the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Star Trek</a></i> episode "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever_%28TOS_episode%29_0747.html" title="The City on the Edge of Forever (TOS episode)">The City on the Edge of Forever</a>" (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>), Dr. McCoy travels back to the 1930s and inadvertently makes a change that leads to a Nazi victory in WW2. The entire franchise might be seen as alternate history since key events such as the <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics_Wars_5558.html" title="Eugenics Wars">Eugenics Wars</a> of the Star Trek universe's late 20th century did not occur in ours, but as noted in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history_%28fiction%29.html#The_boundaries_of_alternate_history" title="Alternate history (fiction)">the boundaries of alternate history</a>, stories like Star Trek's that were originally intended as <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_history.html" title="Future history">future history</a>, but which feature events which did not come to pass in reality, are usually not considered genuine examples of alternate history.</p>
