<p>The article is <i>obviously</i> written by a person who is of literal mind because it presents only one point of view. The Church has evolved, the English language has evolved. Especially in the management of the organization, for example: A paragraph talks about how "2 paragraphs" were deleted. Those 2 paragraphs talked about the Guardian's Office which is no longer part of the Church. There are other examples too. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 20:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your argument is irrelevant: OSA succeeded the GO and performs the same function, just a different name. Also, the mention was done as a contemporaneous example by LRH. Now it would serve as a historical example and an important one which underscores the other points he made in that lecture. David Miscavige is attempting to rewrite history in this case at the expense of learning to not repeat history and why.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point in regard to the removal of two paragraphs about a disbanned, no longer existant organization. That organization got the Church into a fair amount of trouble. It performed certain functions and those functions are fulfilled today. But there is a difference, besides the personal who were removed from the GO. The matter of checks and balances within the organization is different, the organization is different. In this way the old GO got the Church into trouble while the new OSA which does some of the functions which the old GO preformed, is not likely to make the mistakes the old GO did. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:34, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In the Church of Scientology, It has long been considered essential that the word of founder L. Ron Hubbard is incontrovertible, and that his works, or "Tech", must be preserved unaltered.</i> Then the article lists out some examples. If the article confined itself to "Tech" then the article <i>might</i> be true. However, the article does not. Instead some examples of changes in administration, "Policy" are spelled out. Please understand, I'm not suggesting that Policy be deleted out of the <i>"Altered Texts"</i> article in order to fulfill the first sentence of the article, okay? But I'm promoting toward a better, more accurately stated article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 20:36, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fahrenheit, please confine your comments to the issues raised, rather than to present your evidence by refusing to discuss the issues raised. I am raising the issue that the article uses that introductory sentence to present other information. The article presents <b>policy changes</b> under the guise of "Hubbard's <b>tech</b> is viewed as incontrovertible". Do you understand? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 10:35, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No it clearly does not and you are just captiously arguing again to waste the time of productive editors. Happy ho-hos banned user Terryeo.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:13, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, now you have removed the "tech" portion of the statement, Fahrenheit. How can you change the article and state your change to be motivated by a "captious arguement and a waste of productive editing", yet do it? Please stop your personal attacks, <a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">User:Fahrenheit451</a>. However it leaves a statement which no Church staff member would agree with, which (probably) no Church member would agree with and which is, I believe, unattributable by Hubbard's own words. In fact, Hubbard's own words suggest the opposite. "Build a better bridge" was clearly Hubbard's intent and attitude. Today we have computers and internet. Hubbard was not alive when those came into common use. Do you suggest the Church Management <b>ignore</b> and throw out all computers and stick to <b>only</b> Hubbard's policies which <b>obviously</b> do not include computer use, computer protocal, computer messages, etc. etc.&#160;? Of course not&#160;! Management moves on, therefore policy changes. Therefore the initial statement doesn't apply to modern Church management. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The "build a better bridge" statement is a very general statement and does not authorize technical or policy alterations and omissions, so that statement is inapplicable. LRH does state on the febc tape, pr becomes a subject:"Progressive and dynamic technologies actually do not cease to develop, they continuously refine." That statement seems to countenance "refinement", but not omission or adding something "new", like the so-called patter drills or turning violating any of the ten points of "keeping scientology working" into suppressive acts or changing the definition of a floating needle. Your computer use argument is a strawman. The subject at hand are the original works of LRH, then altered by david miscavige. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 02:44, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I recognize that your reply is somewhat civil, though your use of "strawman" could have been more pleasently presented. I don't accept that "build a better bridge" could ever be inapplicable. Actually it is the whole issue and no change would have been made without that in mind. Apparently you don't feel it appropriate that the Church begin to use computer technology? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 04:19, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Whether these changes represent a major degradation of Hubbard's original writings, or merely minor edits and improvements that do not change the fundamental thrust of his message, is a matter hotly debated among some Scientologists</i> says the article. But there is no mention of any publication which states such a "hot debate", there is no newspaper, book or other publication which is attributed to having published the "hot debate among some Scientologists". Yes, there is a little personal opinion on personal website which <b>says</b> it disagrees with the Church of Scientology, but those persons are not Scientologists. The debate is, therefore, not among Scientologists and should not be represented as being among Scientologists. And, even if there is such a debate, it should be cited because, as it stands, it is a weasel worded sort of statement. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 05:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that this article is still at the beginning... The problem of altered texts was discussed in one of the Lisa McPherson countersuits in the court of Judge Schaeffer. It came out that there is a highly mysterious new entity named "AVC" which is allowed to change the "scripture". <a href="http://www.whyaretheydead.net/lisa_mcpherson/bob/A-017-071502-Oliver-V4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.whyaretheydead.net/lisa_mcpherson/bob/A-017-071502-Oliver-V4.html" rel="nofollow">Authority Verifications and Corrections Unit</a> --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 15:54, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a>, you suggest someone do some "research". Might I suggest, since your are attempting to create a controversy where none exists, your suggestion of research serves little purpose in an encyclopedia. Obviously it is directed at creating controversy, rather than at creating good, useable information for an encyclopedia. Might you consider another springboard for suggestions, such as emails, or asking friends or user talk pages, rather than an article's discussion page? Part of the reason I point that out is that, the Church spells out how Bulletins and Policy letters are created. There's nothing hidden about the process. In fact, should you walk into a Church and ask them in person, they would probably point you to the appropriate book. If you actually have interest, I could quote and cite policy which defines the process you suggest someone "research?" <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says: <i>These alterations to the "Standard Tech" have caused controversy both inside and outside the Church</i>, but no citation is given of any kind of controversy inside the Church. A link is provided to a group of dissidents <b>outside</b> the Church, but nothing is cited about controversy caused within the Church. To my knowledge, the opposite is true. The few changes in 1000s of pages of tech and policy have all been for the better and the membership supports them. While it is possible there is controversy within the Church, the statement should not be in the article because it is unsupported. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:05, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>gosh, it is interesting that you would reply, Tilamn. Notice my request for a citation there? <i>These alterations to the "Standard Tech" have caused controversy both inside and <b>outside</b> the Church</i> (Emphisis added). No citation is supplied. It is an unattributed statement, it is an uncited statement. It needs a citation if the statement is to remain. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is it incumbant on an editor to suppy a citation if he wants a statement in an article. "Inside the church" is not cited.

<p>My language is plain english. Works for me. You are a relatively new editor here on Wikipedia which has, as its foundation toward a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> a policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which states something like, "the threshold for inclusion is verifiability". I have pointed out as clearly as possible a piece of information which is within the article, but not verified. I believe it is unverifiable. I beleive it is pure whoo-dee-doo, added by a confused editor who hoped to make a strong point. In attempting to make his point, he stated a falsehood. The falsehood is not large in quantity of words, but is large in implication. <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a>, you have twice refused to confront the issue and have attempted to substitute for the issue, a separate issue. <i>Prove there is no controversy</i> is the issue you substitute. That might be how you babble along on Alt.Net.Scientology, but on Wikipepdia <b>the burden of evidence is on the poster of the information</b>. Do you see the difference? There is an uncited piece of information, <b>...caused controversy inside the Church ...</b> and I am requesting it be cited. <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a> your persistant use of such terms as <i>boo-boo</i>, your suggestion of <i>delete this thread</i>, your persistant refusal to confront the issue raised and your persistance in failing to understand <b>even when pointed out to you</b> wikipedia's standards of editing are not good recommendations of your conduct as a wikipedia editor. To be more specific, if you can not understand plain English, how can your attempting to communicate in "my language" be helpful? The issue has nothing at all to do with whether the membership of Church of Scientology views <i>alterations in scripture</i> to be valid, invalid, controversial or sent by God, the issue <b>ONLY</b> has to do with what has been <b>previously published by reliable and reputable sources</b> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The statement needs a citation if it is going to remain in the article. Furthermore, I am not the only editor who told you of the appropriateness of keeping personal issues out of article discussion spaces. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:37, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>both inside and outside the Church, especially among Free Zone practitioners.</i> There is simply no citation whatsoever about "inside the church". That is purely whoop-de-doo original research and thought up fantesy by Wikipedia Editors.

<dd>Clearly, you have refused to understand Wikipedia Policy when it has been pointed out to you. I will do so once more. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> makes clear, the burden of including an information in an article is that it be supportable. More specifically, an information must be supported by a <b>previously published information by a reliable and reputable source</b>. Until you understand the burden of such support is upon the editor who intorduces the information, it is most unlikely that your statements will contribute. The reason I say that is because in this section alone you have stated several dispersive posts which do not in any way, address the issue which this section raises. You state things about "well, if the inside the Church people do support it, then it is up to you to make the case". But this is <b>NOT</b> the situation. It is your obligation as an editor to understand the policy which you edit under. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> spells it out and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> clarifies for particular situations. You are way, way off base Tilman, because you do not address the issue raised. And, further, you disperse attempts to arrive at a concensus of editor opinion by raising the separate issues which you raise in this section. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 22:11, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, if a piece of Hubbard's words have been removed from a tape, the Wikipedia Policy and Guideline to go by is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (the threshold of inclusion is verifiability) and then its more specific directions, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Both talk about widely published information being easily cited. However, that isn't how the information about Crowley once being Hubbard's "good friend". Instead the article in the section == Tape 18 == presents a germanic reference. While in some articles with no other potential reference, a germanic reference might be necessary, in this article 2 other references are cited. Don't you think it better to go with what <b>can</b> be widely understood than to present an esoteric german reference which isn't understood by most readers? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:13, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see. Once again you make a statement which says, "No, I didn't read the last thing which you said about deleting a thread". So, okay. You don't get it. All right. I would like to see an article which present what the membership thinks of these topics, but, unfortunately, the membership's statements rarely make the news. They are rarely inflammatory, you see?

<dd>And again, you are very blatantly trying to shift the topic of conversation <i>off</i> the real issue, onto some tangent which you insist on terming -- incorrectly -- "the obvious issue". This is a tactic you like, isn't it? I noticed you using in regards to Hubbard's "barley formula", trying to bring up the issue of whether today's modern corn syrup has additives or not.</dd>
<dd>The real issue is that the Church is quietly changing what Hubbard said. You keep saying "well, the Guardian's Office turned out to be bad! So of course they went back and erased all the things Hubbard said about how great the Guardian's Office was!" You are studiously <b>avoiding</b> any discussion of the enthymeme in that syllogism, which is "Organizations and individuals are allowed to go back and rewrite the historical record when it reflects poorly on them in the light of later events." Are you perhaps so studiously avoiding discussion of that principle because you know it's not only not accepted, but actively repugnant, to the majority of thinking people? Or do you actually believe that the Church can go back and try to cover up evidence that the Guardian's Office had the full support of L. Ron Hubbard itself while it was committing illegal acts? You can say "Well, the GO must have been in the right after all, if Hubbard was supporting them!" or you can say "Hubbard wasn't aware of the illegal acts they were performing; Mr. Source with all his OT abilities was completely fooled by the Guardian's Office" but what you <i>can't</i> do is go and rewrite history to pretend that Hubbard never gave the Guardian's Office that fulsome praise. <i>That</i> is the real issue and your insistence on this red herring of "well, see, here are all the <i>reasons</i> why it would be really convenient for the Church to rewrite history this way! Duh!! How dare you question whether the Church <i>is allowed to</i> rewrite history just because it would like to?" is not only tiresome but getting disruptive. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:55, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is that these are not just any 'publications after the disbanding of the Guardian's Office'. These are publications <i>claiming to reprint, unaltered</i> the statements Hubbard made <i>before</i> the disbanding of the Guardian's Office. <i>That</i> is the issue. When a large corporation finds out that its vice-president has been embezzling money and they fire him, they take a <i>new</i> group picture of the senior executives.

<dd>The datum upon which this article is built, the datum which is presupposed, which is presented as non-negotiable and the word of god is false. But I've said or implied this stuff before.

He spells out the emotional tone level of persons who are unable to do anything but literally apply what they read or are told. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 15:50, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both Fahrenheit451 and myself were banned for a period of time, in part for the above discussion. I point out again, an editor has created <i>Original Research</i> by using the phrase, "..inside the Church.." because the article does not include <b>any</b> verification for that statement and I strongly suspect, there has never been and never will be any publication which states that alterted texts have produced controversy inside the Church. It is basically a pile of hogwash. That you editors <b>insist</b> it is somehow significant certainly aligns with other misrepresentations of Scientology information, but in this one instance, <i>... inside the church ...</i> is not documented. There is no reference for that piece of Original Research. It should be removed from the article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 19:03, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have utterly, totally mis-stated the situation. Your reply is uncivil because it does.

"Inside the church" is unsupported by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s <i>.. previously published by reliable and reputable sources</i> which is exactly what <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <b>requires</b>. My comment is about the article. That you misunderstand that my comment is about the article and instead, direct your comment to me, in an attempt to convince me, personally, about a piece of information does not produce a better article. Even if you were to personally convince me the article itself would not satisfy WP:V. Please stop wasting my time with your personal comments, directed to me. Instead direct your attention to the article. Information which is does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s verifiability standard is nothing but fairy tale and original research, it should not be presented in the article in the first place and it should not stand in the article because of an editor's personal belief. The situation <b>is not</b> controversial within the Church, in fact, quite the opposite. But I don't claim the opposite is true, what I claim is there is no published source of information which states that altered texts are a controversial issue within the Church. Therefore "within the Church" <b>must</b> come out of the article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 16:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me just say, the issue is a dumb, dead issue. Within the Church, the 'alterations' have been to keep current with the times, a sort of quality control of past changes in situation that were not reflected in the policies and guidelines. <i>especially amongst freezone practitioners</i>, well, I would certainly expect that since <i>freezone practitioners</i> are freezone because they have misunderstood something completely, made an issue of it and hence, are out of Scientology by their own choice. They are persuing their misunderstanding and using 'altered texts' as an excuse to proliferate their misunderstanding. <i>outside the church</i> has no meaning at all to Scientology, as Scientology is the only organization on the planet which disseminates Scientology. A few policy letters have been changed, those changes were toward a more universal, more legally correct (call it politically correct if you like) presense of Scientology across the globe, in various countries wherein Scientology would otherwise be an unacceptable 'new' religion. Just sounding off on the reality of the sitatuation. Of course I understand this is simply tooooo much for some editors to confront and they will attack this position. heh. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 04:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stating my opinion as part of an attempt to bring the article's very bad attribution up to Wikipedia standards is not a personal attack. I am perfectly willing to state my opinion. Any opinion I state which says, "all freezoners .... (anything)" is not a personal attack. Perhaps, you, Fahrenheit451, can follow the reasoning on that because the word "personal" references to an individual while the word "all" would reference to all of the people of a group. A "personal attack" would necessarily have to single out a single, particular and only one individual from a larger group of said individuals.

<p>Terryeo, I think that regarding alterations being in pursuit of a more legally or politically correct standing of the documents in question you are correct as regards some of the alterations made, and that considering the time in which LRH wrote and lectured it is, I suppose, a natural process of progression that these things are corrected at some point in order to prevent an unacceptable situation to the outside world (keeping in line with the R-factor of society, I suppose). However, some elements of the changes, particularly relating to things like meter reads and processing (take the issue over the changed F/N read definition - which I personally think might lead to O/Rs, or the changes to the L&amp;N procedure, for example) couldn't really be ascribed to this. I mean, I'm prepared to accept these particular changes may in fact be perfectly correct, but still, they couldn't be ascribed to political correctness. Regarding the Freezone however, Terryeo, I don't really think your assessment is correct. (For the record, I'm not a freezoner, and don't have any interest in being one.) Back in the early Book One days, of course, pretty much all of the Dianetics movement was originally based around unofficial, "grass roots" co-audit clubs; the whole idea, as indeed pointed out by LRH on many occasions, was that the tech was designed to be used. I think the theory re. M/Us being the sole cause of the freezone movement isn't really a fair assessment - what ever happened to "what is true for you is true for you", as LRH put it, all Scientologists of course have their own reality on the subject. Without the unofficial development of the Book One co-audits, I don't expect that the subject would have developed to the degree that it has, and so it is incorrect to assume that "Scientology is the only organisation on the planet that delivers Scientology". Indeed, as an experienced Scientologist, I'm sure you've applied Scientology tech to help people, as indeed LRH repeatedly said one should do - that would, surely, be a method of dissemination not directly undertaken by the Church?

<p>Here again is a very <b>bad</b> secondary source. A link within the article points to "The Truth About Scientology" which is a personal website created and maintained by "Kristi Wachter".

<p>Wachter's site is used as the reference which states Gene Zimmer's opinion. On that basis, the phrase, <i>These alterations to the "Standard Tech" have caused controversy both inside and outside the Church</i>. The site is personal. Watcher presents Zimmer's and other's opinions. The article is introduced on the factuality of a personal website. Wikipedia standards do not allow that. I notice Feldspar, Tilman and Fahrenheit are "owning" the article. In the sense they revert any change which does not place Watcher's personal website right up there in the top of the page, as the first citation.
