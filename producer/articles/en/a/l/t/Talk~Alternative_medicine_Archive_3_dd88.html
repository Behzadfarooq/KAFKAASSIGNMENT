<p>I've reverted MNH's revert that he describes as "remove babbling" I'm sorry but <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">user:Bmills</a> text reads a lot better than yours IMO. Please specify what it is you object to here so that we can sort it out line by line in necessary rather than reverting <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 14:19, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not original text. This is precisely how <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> looked about a week or two ago. The text has been improved since then. I simply am reversing, their restoration of a very amateurish presentation of babble.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As this is intended to be an encyclopedia article (he says more in hope than anything else), the first thing would be that the intro paragraph give a brief definition/summary of the content. I also bolded the term Alternative medicine on first appearance, as per wikipedia conventions. It may not be Shakespeare, but, in all modesty, I cannot see how my text could be termed babbling. <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a> 14:38, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not know that it was not originally written by Bmills, however i don't see how that makes any difference. How do you define "improved"&#160;? Who gets to decide if a text has been imroved or not? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 15:03, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually the intro paragraph today was all my own work. Clearly Mr Natural Health is the only one qualified to decide when text is improved as the rest of us are ignorant babblers. <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a> 15:19, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

The user that Mr NH is calling @#$%^&amp; above was in fact me (I told him that I was the person that made the edit he didn't like over on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflicts_between_users_62dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflicts between users">wikipedia:Conflicts between users</a> which is why I an accusing him of lying rather than being mistaken) so he has no reason whatsoever to say this about David.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My complete definition of Alternative Medicine</span></h2>
<p>What I find interesting is that the very first controlled research study ever done was done in the 1700's on the subject of scurvy in the British Navy. The concept of using diet rather than a medication (like seawater) to treat the medical condition called scurvy classifies it as <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> as well as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_therapy.html" title="Natural therapy">Natural therapy</a>. So, alternative medicine actually has been doing valid research longer than <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">Medicine</a> has.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh, science is much newer than religion. Does that make science invalid? It doesn't make either more or less valid, IMHO. They operate in different ways. Also, in the 1700's we also tried to "treat" measels with leeches, and "treat" being a witch (or an alternative medicine praticioner) by burning, so it's hardly a good example of an era of sane medical thought. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>A lot of science people are obviously confused about the definition of Alternative Medicine. One key to understanding AM, is thinking in terms of the method of treatment used. Once you start thinking in terms of treatment methods, everything becomes clear. Medicine's primary method of treatment is prescription medication.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was raised in Tucson, where we count diet, execise, and mental health as parts of treatment. AFAICT, the rest of the world counts those, too. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>The second key, is who is doing the treatment. AM is always performed by a non-physician by definition. <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">Quackery</a> historically from the perspective of a physician has been any form of competition, regardless of the science used.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, you're in a bind of your own creation. Andrew Weil is a physician. Is he practicing any alternative medicine or not? By your own statements, he couldn't be, because he is a physician. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus, a psychologist using <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_behavior_therapy.html" title="Cognitive behavior therapy">cognitive behavior therapy</a> to treat the medical condition called <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">Depression</a> is practicing AM. Any other conclusion, would mean that the psychologist is practicing medicine without a license.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Psychologists are licensed. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>But, the field of cognitive behavior therapy, itself, is not AM. It is only AM when it is used to treat a medical condition.</p>
<p>While these fine points might be slightly confusing, they are precisely what AM is about and precisely why all professionalized forms of AM or CAM are in fact strongly based on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a> much to the horror of the dated-viewpoints of the scientism people.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The scientists are usually upset about non-scientific methods sneaking in with scientific ones. The prayer effect is a good model for this issue. Those who pray recover faster, this is well known. However, there is little science to back up a statement such as "praying to Kali will make you live longer". While praying to Kali could improve one's recovery from surgery, there is little evidence that it does actually make people live longer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This doesn't mean Kali is a fake goddess, it simply means that there is no sound science to back up certain claims. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not all areas of AM have been professionalized nor are all areas based on science, but the most popular ones are.</p>
<p>When exploring the individual branches of alternative medicine four questions need to be answered. The answers to these question will reveal whether or not each branch of alternative medicine is mostly quackery or something that the public should seriously consider using.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1.What is the method of treatment utilized?</dd>
<dd>2.What are its therapeutic effects?</dd>
<dd>3.What medical conditions does it effectively treat?</dd>
<dd>4.What modes of action could plausibly account for these therapeutic effects?</dd>

<dd>My objection to your addition is that it applies equally to all conventional medical treatments.

<p>I will certainly brag about these 4 points, as I added them; rather than the brain-dead medical scientism people.</p>
<p>When a physician provides AM services to his clients he is said be practicing complementary medicine. Which is just another way of saying that CM is AM practiced by a physician. Andrew Weil trains physicians at the University of Arizona on AM in his Integrative Medicine program. So, apparently, only graduates of his integrative medicine program can claim to be practicing integrative medicine.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, there are competing programs. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whether or not board certification is required, is unknown by me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No more so than a physician approving of a patient praying. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>The final bug-a-boo of AM are the eclectic branches which are not known for any single method of treatment. You cannot make generations about these eclectic branches of AM. In these cases, you have to go practitioner by practitioner.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We do not have to go preacher by preacher to study the effects of prayer. Maybe this is different, but I do not see a compelling argument being made that each and every claim must be disproven individually. If a physician said that their scalpel reduced surgery recovery time, it would be investigated based on that one physician. If ten thousand physicians made the same claim, about the same scalpel, only one scalpel needs to be tested, not ten thousand physicians. If they had ten thousand different scalpels, each should be tested. -Bop</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has been my position on AM, from day one. It is perfectly correct. And, my position, is my position. Obviously, my position is not subject to debate.</p>

<p>It seems to me that without a decent definition, the simple linguistic sense of 'alternative medicine' REQUIRES it to have appeared later than medicine. Until you have medicine you can't have alternative medicine. Also, please let's avoid western-centrism. Aruvedic (sp?) medicine, for example, was/is definitely not "alternative" in Inida, it is in the 'west'. If you are talking solely about self-styled "alternative", mainly western pratitioners, the topic becomes rather narrow,</p>

<li><b>the complaints-and-mediations-per-genuine-authoring (CAGA) ratio</b> Editors making a Wiki living out of cutting things they never care to read, let alone understand, will be asked to produce this CAGA credential.

<p>The edit-warring and generally unhelpful talk-page discourse over the past few days leads me to believe it would not benefit from further editing at the moment, so I've protected it as a temporary measure. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 10:07, Feb 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my sleep I came upon a new general argument in support of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>. It was starring me in the face all along, but I did not recognize it for what it was until this morning. So, I go first thing to improve this article once again and what do I find? Theresa and her antics have once again ended up with this simple top node article being protected. May I suggest Mediation, Theresa? -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">Mr-Natural-Health</a> 14:18, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1)It's all my fault? Irismeister has no part in it whatsoever ? Tell me Mr Natural health, do you think it acceptable to put in a claim that is unsourced ? Do you agree with irismeisters inserted text?</dd>

<dd>On day one when I first cleaned up this article by removing all the pro-science bias, one of the first things that I did was remove a paragraph on homeopathy added at the very top.</dd>

<dd>A general top node article on alternative medicine should not discuss or mention any specific branches, such as iridology, under any circumstances; outside of listing the various branches as links.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Make one exception and people will start babbling about homeopathy, astrology, faith healing and who knows what else. These comments belong in their respective articles. Want to comment on iridology, then put it in <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iridology.html" title="Iridology">Iridology</a>.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New argument in support!</span></h2>
<p>Genuine physicians who are holders of the M.D. degree and who as physicians are subject to the disciplinary actions from the state boards who licensed them to practice medicine; do in fact offer alternative medical services to their patients. Hence, these physicians must see some value in these alternative forms of treatments. Further, the University of Arizona, College of Medicine, under the leadership of Andrew Weil, M.D., offers to practicing physicians a program in Integrative Medicine. In this fellowship physicians are trained in "guided imagery, homeopathy, acupuncture and osteopathic manipulation." The program <a href="http://www.ahsc.arizona.edu/opa/horizons/1997/integrate.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ahsc.arizona.edu/opa/horizons/1997/integrate.htm" rel="nofollow">"neither rejects conventional medicine nor embraces alternative practices uncritically."</a> -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">Mr-Natural-Health</a></p>
<p>Hey guys, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> is meant to be an encylopaedia artice about the subject, not a tit for tat for/against essay. Aducing more agruments in support or against isn't the point and the fact that so much time is being wasted on this talk on such arguments, with a liberalhelping of personal abuse, makes me despair of it ever being a proper encyclopaedia article at all. <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a> 14:45, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
