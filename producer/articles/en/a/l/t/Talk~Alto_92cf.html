<p>Would it be fair to say that altos, sadly, tend to be a relatively ignored (by the casual listener) part of the choir/opera cast?

<dd>In he context of a choir, it's true that they normally just chug along, filling in harmonies and not doing anything very interesting, but that's probably also true of the tenors. But I certinaly think that it would be fair to say that the majority of female leads in operas are written for sopranos rather than altos, yes. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>Isn't kontralto a female voice even lower than alto? (according to answers.com) --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleassar777_7cf2.html" title="User:Eleassar777">Eleassar777</a> 09:28, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi: the article seems to intimate that the names are the same, although contralto may frequently be of a darker "coloring" and have a slightly lower range. I suppose not distinguishing between contralto and alto would be like calling a mezzo simply a soprano. Does that make sense?&#160;:-) I've always felt that contralto <b>should</b> mean a deeper, darker sound. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanypo_ad52.html" title="User:Danypo">Danypo</a> 23:19, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, it's "contralto" with a "c", as it's from Italian. Secondly, there is no difference between "contralto" and an "alto singer", except that "contralto" is more specific. "Alto" can be a vocal range, either male or female, or a certain clef (C clef on middle line is alto clef), or a kind of an instrument ("alto flute" for instance). "Contralto" is specifically a female alto singer (unlike an alto countertenor, for instance). As said below, "alto" can also refer to the vocal part in musical harmony, but "contralto" is always the singer.</dd>

<p>There is no way to realistically "artificially enhance" vocal range. I suppose it could be done...but even with modern day granular based pitchshifting it cannot with ANY degree of transparency. Additionally it is perfectualy reputable to deduce the range of any singer (pop, classical, or anything) by considering their lowest and highest recorded notes. Voice quality is a bit more subjective, BUT not more subjective than in the classical world! I don't consider Fischer-Dieskau a baritone because he and his agents told me so, I consider him a baritone because of what I've heard come out of his mouth in song. I'm deleting the entire comment from the page. Jmejia 23:22, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many years ago a very knowledgeable musician explained to me that <i>contralto</i> refers to the voice (or to the singer having that voice), and <i>alto</i> refers to the musical part. This is similar to the difference between <i>mezzo-soprano</i> and <i>second soprano.</i> For example, a mezzo-soprano would likely sing the second soprano part, but a soprano or a contralto could also sing second soprano, and a mezzo-soprano might sing alto. A contralto would most likely sing alto, but might sing second-soprano or, in some choirs, tenor.</p>
<p>Thus, the voices are soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass, while the vocal parts are first and second soprano, first and second alto, first and second tenor, and first and second bass.</p>

<p>I see a list of famous basses and tenors in the popular basses section. You had the popular alto singers a few days ago and now they are gone. Please put them back! Even if that happens to be a list mainly consisting soul singers. The alto voice is usually associated with sultry, rich, soulful and powerful singers. I'm looking for more alto artists that I can learn from and emulate.</p>

<p>Is Azucena really a contralto? Her lowest note is low a (below middle c) which she gets to sing only at the end of her story-telling, while there are several high a's, couple of high b-flats and even a high c in her part, all in forte! She fits the mezzo category better. Great alto parts that are not mentioned include Marfa (Khovanshchina), Konchakovna (Prince Igor) and Tancredi (pants role).</p>

<p>As this article carries no citations, I think it would be prudent to include an informational comment to that effect at the <b>TOP</b> of the page (not buried at the bottom).</p>
<p>Additionally, there are those of us who do not accept the use of "alto" and "contralto" as synonymous and interchangeable. As such, I would like to place an informational comment to that effect as well — also at the top of the page. I have seen such comments, indicating that some of the content is disputed, but do not know where to find and insert them. May I have an assist here?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<dd>I'd rather have the list of famous alto's made reliable before we start whinging on about alto/contralto differences. It is quite common to shorten contralto to alto and is done often in books on singing that i own. Contralto as a full term is generally only used to refer to the type of VERY heavy female voice in the range these days. Also, male alto's are covered in the countertenor articles. --<a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_9bbe.html" title="User:I'll bring the food">I'll bring the food</a> (<a href="../../../i/27/l/User_talk%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_063e.html" title="User talk:I'll bring the food">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_I%27ll_bring_the_food_8850.html" title="Special:Contributions/I'll bring the food">Contribs</a> - <a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_other_1668.html" title="User:I'll bring the food/other">My Watchlist</a>) 01:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
