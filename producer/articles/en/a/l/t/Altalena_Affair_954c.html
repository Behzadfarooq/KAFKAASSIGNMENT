<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Altalena_Affair_954c.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>As the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> was coming to an end, Jewish leaders proclaimed the establishment of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a> (May 14, 1948). The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Government_df55.html" title="Provisional Government">Provisional Government</a> and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF proved complicated, and several paramilitary groups continued to be active outside the IDF. One of the largest groups, <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Etzel</a> (Hebrew acronym for Irgun Tzevai Leumi, National Military Organization), planned to ship weapons and fighters to the newly formed state. The plans included a ship renamed Altalena (a pseudonym of Zionist leader <a href="../../../z/e/e/Zeev_Jabotinsky_ca43.html" title="Zeev Jabotinsky">Zeev Jabotinsky</a>) and a target date for the ship's arrival from Europe was set to mid May 1948. The Altalena, purchased by Irgun members abroad, was originally intended to reach Israel on May 15, 1948, loaded with fighters and military equipment.</p>
<p>Weapons purchase and organizational matters took longer than expected, however, and the sailing was postponed for several weeks. Meanwhile, on June 1st, an agreement had been signed for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF and one of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to cease all independent arms acquisition activities. Consequently, representatives of the Israel Government were informed about the ship and its sailing schedule.</p>
<p>The Irgun headquarters in Paris did their best to keep the Altalena's preparations for departure a secret, but it was difficult to conceal the movement of 940 fighters and the loading of a large quantity of arms and ammunition. It was feared that if the plans were discovered, attempts might be made to sabotage the Altalena at sea.</p>
<p>For this reason, when it raised anchor on June 11th, no cable was sent to the Irgun command in Israel, for fear that it would fall into the wrong hands. These precautionary measures proved fruitless, however, and the following day Radio London reported that the Altalena had sailed from Port-de-Bouc (<a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>) in the direction of Israel with 1,000 Jewish volunteers and a large quantity of weapons on board.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that the first truce had begun on June 11th. When the Irgun leaders in Israel learned through the broadcast of the embarkation of the vessel, they feared that this breach of the truce conditions (i.e., the ban on bringing military equipment and fighters into the country) would be revealed. <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Begin_0c8c.html" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a> decided therefore to postpone the arrival of the ship, and the Irgun staff secretary, Zippora Levi-Kessel, sent a wireless message to the Altalena to stay put and await orders. A similar cable was sent to <a href="../../../s/h/m/Shmuel_Katz_de47.html" title="Shmuel Katz">Shmuel Katz</a> (member of the General Headquarters), who was then in Paris, but the ship had already left the day before the message arrived.</p>
<p>On June 15th, Begin and his comrades held a meeting with government representatives, at which Begin announced that the ship had sailed without his knowledge and that he wanted to hold consultations on how to proceed. In his diary for June 16th, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ben-Gurion_1a9e.html" title="David Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a>, the head of the provisional government, wrote the following about the meeting:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><a href="../../../y/i/s/Yisrael_Galili_b6b0.html" title="Yisrael Galili">Yisrael [Galili]</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levi_Eshkol_71ab.html" title="Levi Eshkol">Skolnik [Levi Eshkol]</a> met yesterday with Begin. Tomorrow or the next day their ship is due to arrive: 4,500 tons, bringing 800-900 men, 5,000 rifles, 250 Bren guns, 5 million bullets, 50 Bazoukas, 10 Bren carriers. Zipstein (director of Tel Aviv port) assumes that at night it will be possible to unload it all. I believe we should not endanger Tel Aviv port. They should not be sent back. They should be disembarked at an unknown shore.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Galili informed Begin of Ben-Gurion's consent to the landing of the ship, adding a request that it be done as fast as possible. Zippora Levi-Kessel then radioed the vessel to come in at full speed. The following day, a working meeting was held between Irgun representatives and Ministry of Defence personnel. While the Irgun proposed directing the Altalena to <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Aviv_6d0d.html" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> beach, Ministry of Defence representatives claimed that the Kfar Vitkin beach was preferable, since it would be easier to evade UN observers there. The ship was therefore instructed to make for Kfar Vitkin.</p>

<p>Intense negotiations between representatives of the Provisional Government (headed by David Ben Gurion) and Etzel (headed by Menachem Begin) followed the departure of Altalena from France. Among the issues discussed were logistics of the ship's landing and distribution of the cargo between the military organizations. Whilst there was agreement on the anchoring place of the Altalena, there were differences of opinion about the allocation of the cargo. Ben-Gurion agreed to Begin's initial request that 20% of the weapons be dispatched to the Irgun's <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> Battalion, which was still fighting independently. His second request, however, that the remainder be transferred to the IDF to equip the newly-incorporated Irgun battalions, was rejected by the Government representatives, who interpreted the request as a demand to reinforce an "army within an army."</p>
<p>The Altalena reached Kfar Vitkin in the late afternoon of Sunday, June 20th. Among the Irgun members waiting on the shore was Menachem Begin, who greeted the arrivals with great emotion. After the passengers had disembarked, members of the fishing village of Michmoret helped unload the cargo of military equipment. Concomitantly with the events at Kfar Vitkin, the government had convened in Tel Aviv for its weekly meeting. Ben-Gurion reported on the meetings which had preceded the arrival of the Altalena, and was adamant in his demand that Begin surrender and hand over of all the weapons:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his separate activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The debate ended in a resolution to empower the army to use force if necessary to overcome the Irgun and to confiscate the ship and its cargo. Implementation of this decision was assigned to the Alexandroni Brigade, commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), which the following day surrounded the Kfar Vitkin area. Dan Even issued the following ultimatum:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"To: M. Begin<br />
By special order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defence Forces, I am empowered to confiscate the weapons and military materials which have arrived on the Israeli coast in the area of my jurisdiction in the name of the Israel Government. I have been authorized to demand that you hand over the weapons to me for safekeeping and to inform you that you should establish contact with the supreme command. You are required to carry out this order immediately. If you do not agree to carry out this order, I shall use all the means at my disposal in order to implement the order and to requisition the weapons which have reached shore and transfer them from private possession into the possession of the Israel government. I wish to inform you that the entire area is surrounded by fully armed military units and armored cars, and all roads are blocked. I hold you fully responsible for any consequences in the event of your refusal to carry out this order. The immigrants - unarmed - will be permitted to travel to the camps in accordance with your arrangements. You have ten minutes to give me your answer.<br />
D.E., Brigade Commander"</dd>
</dl>
<p>The ultimatum, and in particular the demand for an answer within ten minutes, was insulting and unrealistic. It was made, according to Even "in order not to give the Irgun commander time for lengthy considerations and to gain the advantage of surprise." Begin refused to respond to the ultimatum, and all attempts at mediation failed. Begin's failure to respond was a blow to Even's prestige, and a clash was now inevitable. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties. In order to prevent further bloodshed, the Kfar Vitkin settlers initiated negotiations between <a href="../../../y/a/27/Ya%27akov_Meridor_6915.html" title="Ya'akov Meridor">Ya'akov Meridor</a> (Begin's deputy) and Dan Even, which ended in a general ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander.</p>

Altalena on fire after being shelled near Tel-Aviv</div>

<p>Begin had meanwhile boarded the Altalena, which was now heading for Tel Aviv. He hoped that it would be possible to enter into a dialogue with the Provisional Government and to unload the remaining weapons peacefully. But this was not the case. Ben-Gurion ordered <a href="../../../y/i/g/Yigael_Yadin_832e.html" title="Yigael Yadin">Yigael Yadin</a> (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the Altalena. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn.</p>
<p>There was danger that the fire would spread to the holds which contained explosives, and Captain <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monroe_Fein_07a5.html" title="Monroe Fein">Monroe Fein</a> ordered all aboard to abandon ship. People jumped into the water, whilst their comrades on shore set out to meet them on rafts. Although Captain Fein flew the white flag of surrender, automatic fire continued to be directed at the unarmed survivors swimming in the water. Begin, who was on deck, agreed to leave the ship only after the last of the wounded had been evacuated. Sixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army; six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on Tel Aviv beach. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>After the shelling of the Altalena, more than 200 Irgun fighters were arrested on Ben-Gurion's orders. Most of them were released several weeks later, with the exception of five senior commanders (Moshe Hason, Eliyahu Lankin, Ya'akov Meridor, Bezalel Amitzur, and <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_Kook_55a9.html" title="Hillel Kook">Hillel Kook</a>), who were detained for more than two months. (They were released, due to public pressure, on August 27, 1948).</p>

<p>The Altalena Affair exposed deep rifts between the main political factions in Israel, and continued to be a major source of bitter controversy in the Israeli political discourse for decades. Proponents of Ben Gurion's actions praised them as essential to establishing the Government's authority and discouraging factionalism and formation of rival armies. Furthermore, Ben Gurion's supporters argue, a state must have a monopoly over the use of force (see <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> for a detailed discussion of this idea). Etzel, by attempting to import weapons to use as a private militia, was undermining the legitimacy of the fledgling State of Israel.</p>
<p>Opponents condemned the unnecessary violence and claimed that opportunities for a peaceful resolution were intentionally frustrated by Ben Gurion and top IDF officers. As events have faded into history, the debate on Altalena in Israel has become less intense, though it was reignited for a short time when a political party headed by Menachem Begin won the Israeli general elections in 1977. Opponents still hold a grudge against Labor for discriminating against them before and after the creation of the state and hold his leadership responsible for not doing enough to defend Jerusalem during the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_War_of_Independence_b2a8.html" title="Israeli War of Independence">Israeli War of Independence</a>. They believe that had Ben Gurion allowed the Altalena to resupply fighters in Jerusalem, the war would have ended with more territory for Israel.</p>
<p>Years later, on the eve of the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, in June 1967 (after Ben-Gurion had retired from political activity and Levi Eshkol was Prime Minister), Menachem Begin joined a delegation which visited Sde Boker to ask David Ben-Gurion to return and accept the premiership again. After that meeting, Ben-Gurion said that if he had then known Begin as he did now, the face of history would have been different.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_b27b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> commanded over the sinking of Altalena, and allegedly took part in the shooting. His role in the Altalena affair became a central issue among right-wing critics during his second tenure as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Israel_ea19.html" title="Prime Minister of Israel">Prime Minister</a> (1992-1995).</p>
