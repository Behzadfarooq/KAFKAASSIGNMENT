<li>Find me <i>any other encyclopedia</i> which considers Chirac's receding hair or brown eyes important enough to write about, in an article up to five times as long as Wikipedia's (just to make it really easy!), then I'll take that suggestion seriously. -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a>

It's a current events website, not a dedicated encyclopedia, but the point stands. The appearance of world leaders is a subject of considerable interest, and rightly something that should be covered in Wikipedia. Using images for those who can access them, and a text alternative for those who can't.</li>
<li>If you mean the Schröder lawsuit, that might indeed be sufficiently interesting to include in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der_a308.html" title="Gerhard Schröder">his article</a>, but it would almost certainly be non-alternate text -- because I doubt you could find any image that would successfully convey the necessary details about the lawsuit. And the rest of Schröder's appearance <i>still</i> wouldn't be important enough to write about. -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a></li>

<li>Cumulonimbus_thumbnail.jpg in <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumulonimbus.html" title="Cumulonimbus">Cumulonimbus</a>: "" (appearance already in text)
<ul>
<li><i>disagreed</i>: "the clouds can appear striking..." ["... during sunset."]</li>
<li>When the article is long enough to have a section on "How to photograph cumulonimbus" without looking silly (about ten times as long as it is now, maybe), then you might have a point. Until then, why is how they look during sunset any more important for <i>the text of an encyclopedia article</i> than how they look during sunrise or at midday? (Hint: "Because I happened to have an image of it in the visual rendering" is not a valid answer.) -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a>
<ul>
<li>Their appearance at mid-day <i>is</i> covered in the main text (see references to anvils).</li>
<li>So why not move the image to that part of the text, so the article doesn't sound jumbled -- <i>e.g.</i> "During the spring and summer, cumulonimbus clouds are more likely to form in the afternoon, due to the heating of the earth’s surface[[Image:...|, but they look even more striking at sunset]]."? Because, as with <a href="../../../a/l/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAlternate_text_for_images_fcfd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Alternate text for images">my dilithium-3 example</a>, that's not what the image is intended to convey. It's intended to convey what cumulonimbus looks like in general, and that's already in the non-alternate text. (Hmm, perhaps it shouldn't be.) -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a></li>
<li>No - that para is about cumulonimbus <i>formation</i>. The second para is the one that is (partly) about their <i>appearance</i>. Both image and alternate text are thus well-placed, though they could be improved if/when the Wikipedia software is changed to allow mid-paragraph floating images. The purpose of the image is to convey BOTH what the clouds look like in general AND what these specific examples of the clouds look like. The former is in the text. The latter is, correctly, in the alt text.</li>

<li>Hey, you're improving.&#160;:-) But I can't tell how many rounds that cartridge is by looking at the picture, so if it's worth mentioning in the article at all, it should be <i>outside</i> the alternate text for the sake of us poor fully-sighted people. And discussion of how "The Tommy Gun is often pictured" would make sense in a section on "Tommy Guns in entertainment" or "Tommy Guns in art", but the article has neither.

<li>For more than three quarters of these images (77/100), the most appropriate alternate text is nothing at all. So I was quite correct when I wrote "The best alternate text is usually nothing". I really hope, now, that people will stop changing "usually" to the vaguer "often".</li>

<dd>Images are often used as a visual aid, and thus tend to repeat information that is already stated in the text. As a consequence, the appropriate <tt>alt</tt> text is likely to contain repetition as well. I see no reason to believe that this repetition is a bad thing, though. With a little bit of cleverness, it's easy to avoid redundant-sounding text.</dd>

<dd>It has indeed always been acceptable for the various media in a mixed-media article to repeat each other partially or completely (<i>e.g.</i> subtitles); but that's a red herring, since a text-only rendering is by definition single-media. If an encyclopedia article's text repeats itself, the article is obviously flawed; and whether that faulty repetition occurred in alternate text or non-alternate text is something text-only readers are (and should be) completely oblivious to. -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a></dd>

<dd>In some cases, the alt text for the image can convey <i>additional</i> information that might be inappropriate in the text of the article. For example, the text of the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blekinge.html" title="Blekinge">Blekinge</a> article states that Blekinge is bordered by Småland and Skåne, but the image also conveys the additional information, such as <i>where</i> Blekinge is in relation to these two provinces (namely, that it is South of Småland and East of Skåne). This information could also be stated in the text of the article, but it's the kind of thing that is <i>best</i> conveyed by an image. So it makes sense for that image's <tt>alt</tt> text to convey this information as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, the article on <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia_Airlines_5a55.html" title="Iberia Airlines">Iberia Airlines</a> contains a photo of one of the planes in their fleet. It seems that this photo primarily conveys information about the airlines' insignia and color scheme -- information which is not stated elsewhere in the article, probably because it's the kind of thing that is best shown with an image. So again, the <tt>alt</tt> text should convey similar information regarding the insignia and color scheme.</dd>

<p>The only examples where I am uncertain as to my choice are the articles on music albums, which contain an image of the album cover (about ten of the above examples). It may be <i>somewhat</i> interesting to describe the album cover design (not to be confused with describing the <i>image</i> of the album cover, <i>e.g.</i> "Photo of album cover").

<dd>I think that if I'm interested in some album, one of the things I might want to know about it is what the cover looks like.

<dd>I challenge you to find <i>any</i> encyclopedia, anywhere in the world, music-specific or general, on the Web or off, which -- in the entries for albums -- describes covers textually when they're <i>not</i> particularly noteworthy or controversial.

An example of "controversial" would be any case where the cover was censored or caused the album's sale to be restricted. I'm looking for covers <i>other</i> than those ones, which means at least 99 percent of them.) I think you'll find album covers are described either as images, or not at all, because describing them as text would sound ridiculous; the same applies in Wikipedia as it does anywhere else. -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a> 19:41 15 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mpt says "the article would need to be considerably longer before the insignia would be worth mentioning" in response to one suggestion, and makes similar points elsewhere.</p>
<p>Articles in Wikipedia are <i>always</i> works in progress. It's entirely reasonable for a short article to mention a specific detail that might seem out-of-place in an article of that size. This is because every article is a work in progress, and what seems out of place in June might be completely reasonable in December.</p>
<p>Some people <i>do</i> think we should <a href="../../../b/a/l/Wikipedia%7EBalance_parts_of_a_page_c8e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Balance parts of a page">balance parts of a page</a>, but that's only really supported in cases of <i>massive</i> imbalance - not for single sentences such as we have here. We tend to shy away from removing <i>factual</i>, <i>verifiable</i> information on grounds of "irrelevance". There are a few fringe cases where we do, but they're few and far between.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fully agree. The "it's not in the article" argument (and anything like it) holds no water in an open-content environment. Nobody is claiming that every article on Wikipedia is devoid of out-of-place sentences, minor imbalances, and bias towards a particular thing (such as sheep lice, or a particular Grace Kelly movie).

<li>I once had a one-volume Macmillan Encyclopedia in which (IIRC) the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> article was only a few hundred words, but included the fact that Presley featured on a US postage stamp. I judged it was similarly interesting for <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero_Wolfe_75c4.html" title="Nero Wolfe">Nero Wolfe</a> to have featured on a San Marino postage stamp, especially since he was a fictional character (as opposed to the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocletian.html" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> example, where putting emperors on coins was S.O.P. and not worth mentioning for any emperor in particular). If, however, Wolfe has featured on postage stamps for other countries too, then that should be mentioned in the <i>non-alternate</i> text (because the San Marino image by itself can't possibly express that); and of those stamps the San Marino one would no longer be particularly remarkable, so its alternate text would become "".</li>

<li>The sentence "Stop Esso France was sued by Esso, who alleged falling profits because the campaign used a parody Esso logo featuring dollar signs in place of the letters 'ss'." seemed incomplete to me -- I was thinking "used it for what? what was so profit-reducing about it?". It happened that the brochure worked as a good textual example of how the Campaign were disseminating the logo. If, however, anyone can find a better example but don't have an image for it, that example should go in non-alternate text, with the brochure's alternate text becoming "".</li>

<li>It seems very straightforward to me that a summary of how the states voted should be included in an article about a U.S. election.

<p>Obviously I need to find better ways to explain alternate text, but from the Schröder example and the election examples I think maybe I see the disconnect we're having here. The key is not whether something is "important enough to be mentioned outside the image alt text". It's whether it's important enough to be in the text, of an article of that length (modulo questions of balance), <i>at all</i>. Remember, in Lynx and other text-only browsers, alternate and non-alternate text are largely (and correctly) indistinguishable from each other.</p>
<p>Perhaps I've been trying to explain it completely backwards. Here's another way of looking at it, based on <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/augm.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/augm.html" rel="nofollow">the "Augmentative authoring" approach of Jukka Korpela</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write/edit the article text so that it is as complete, sensible, balanced, and well-structured as you can make it, as an image-less article, for your text-only readers.</li>
<li>If you have an image which is a clearer and/or quicker way of expressing something which you'd expressed with some of your text <i>x</i>, use the image to envelope <i>that text</i> -- no more and no less -- as its alternate, without the text itself changing its position within the article [[Image:...|<i>x</i>]]. Do that with as many of your images as you can.</li>
<li>If you have images which are relevant to the article but do <i>not</i> make any of the existing article text redundant (as is usually the case), insert them with alternate text of "".</li>
</ol>
<p>That way you end up with a great graphical version, <i>and</i> your text-only version is identical to the best possible text-only version you produced in step 1. Win win. (Another advantage of this approach is that it works just as well for hyperlinks, audio, video, <i>etc</i> as it does for images.)</p>
<p>Do you think that would work as <a href="../../../a/l/t/Wikipedia%7EAlternate_text_for_images_33c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Alternate text for images">an explanation</a>? Did it work for you?</p>

<p>Problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>We typically add images to articles while they are still incomplete, nonsensical, inbalanced, and/or badly structured. We never reach the stage, with any article, of thinking "right! That's the text done!"</li>
<li>As you know, we currently can't use mid-paragraph images.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I could support the addition of some advice such as: "One way to create alt text for new images is to move (not copy) text from the main text to become part of the alternate text for your new image". <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>

<dd>I don't know if the above is much better than the other arguments you have presented. It has the strong drawback of presuming that the text will ever reach anything like a "finished" state, as Martin notes; it also bears more resemblance to a guideline for when it's appropriate to submit images, rather than a guideline about how to write alt text for existing images. A guideline which says "<i>Don't submit images for articles unless suitable alt text already exists in the article, or unless you are prepared to improve the article's text to create such suitable alt text</i>" seems very likely to scare people away from submitting images at all, and would be quite counterproductive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There seem to be many different perfectly good reasons to inser an image into an article. Possibly the most likely is "I happened to have an image which relates to this article." But there are also reasons like:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A picture is the <i>only</i> way to explain something (the photo of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, or the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Lisa_763f.html" title="Mona Lisa">Mona Lisa</a>)</li>
<li>A picture is the <i>best</i> way to explain something (the graph of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_logarithm.html" title="Natural logarithm">Natural logarithm</a>, or the map of <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>)</li>
<li>A picture is the <i>easiest</i> way to explain something (a picture of an <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga.html" title="Amiga">Amiga</a> computer or the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_Bridge_e830.html" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>)</li>
<li>A picture is the best substitute we have for poorly implemented or not fully standardized technology (such as any math article using <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7ETeX_markup_6e28.html" title="Wikipedia:TeX markup">TeX markup</a>, or any images that were converted from <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVG_cd15.html" title="SVG">SVG</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am still not sure what I think of the best way to handle each of these. I am not fully convinced that the alt text must necessarily be a phrase taken directly from some (possibly hypothetical) all-text version; In some cases, especially in situations where no alt text will do (if the image is the <i>only</i> way to explain something), it seems acceptable to use some form of delimited descriptive phrase, such as <tt>alt="[Mona Lisa]"</tt>. As you have said, the user may be interested in downloading or printing the image, and providing them with something indicating what it is they're downloading would be helpful (and, as noted on the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAlternate_text_for_images_fcfd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Alternate text for images">other talk page</a>, having null or empty-space strings used as hypertext links is probably not too wise). -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 01:40 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
