<dd>I'm sorry, but I think you should stop the ad hominem attacks ("college dropouts" and similar claims). This article on "alternative medicines" starts by defining them as different from "conventional medicine", but there's not a single sentence anywhere defining what "conventional medicine" is. Since you seem unable to discuss matters without going to the level of schoolyard taunts, I'll take it upon myself to make up a definition. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 17:36, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We have already gone through this route before!!! That is why you are supposed to read through the talk pages. Conventional medicine was originally <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_Conventional_medicine_e2bb.html" title="User:Irismeister/Conventional medicine">User:Irismeister/Conventional medicine</a> but was moved because it was classified as an essay.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the word <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a> is not even a required part of the definition as I have already proven. Of course, my definition of AM was edited out yet again for maybe the 5th time. I do not see this topic being an issue at all. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 02:51, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have proved nothing. Your definition talks about "medical treatment". What is "medical treatment"? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 17:10, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The last version of my preferred definition was:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Support" section</span></h2>
<p>Mr-Natural-Health, I cut down three of your points in the "support" section to their essence. You might want to read George Orwell's excellent essay <i>Politics and the English Language</i> for help on doing this yourself, so that I don't have to fix your muddle. First, your long-winded statement</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Genuine physicians who are holders of the M.D. degree and who as physicians that are subject to the disciplinary actions of the state boards who licensed them to practice medicine; do in fact offer alternative medical services to their patients. Hence, these physicians must see some added value in these alternative forms of treatments for their patients.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>became</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some licensed doctors prescribe certain alternative medicines.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but I do not need you to tell me the essense of what I had written. Ergo, I do <b>not</b> find that your re-write is an improvement to what I had writte above. The entire point was <i><b>these physicians must see some added value in these alternative forms of treatments for their patients,</b></i> -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 04:02, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that is implied in my rewording. They wouldn't prescribe it if they didn't see value in it. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">✎</a> 04:29, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but the emphasis is on <i><b>these physicians must see some added value in these alternative forms of treatments for their patients.</b></i> Your quip is totally worthless as support, in my opinion. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 04:43, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, the paragraph</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some of the strongest support for the value of clinical experience in alternative medicine comes from conventional physicians who have voiced their criticisms of evidence-based medicine (Tonelli 2001, Downing 2003). These physicians, while arguing about their need to apply population evidence to the patient standing before them, are in effect supporting the value of eclectic branches of alternative medicine which place great value upon the clinical experience of the practitioner.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>became the more clear sentence</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The alternative medicine industry claims that its products will become mainstream medicine one day.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but I do not need you to tell me the essense of what I had written. First, of all AM practitioners offer services rather than products to their patients. Your assertion that AM is selling products shows me that you do not know anything about the subject of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a>. <i><b>Population evidence. patient standing before them, eclectic branches, clinical experience</b></i> are all key phrases which your re-write left out. I am selling the <i>essence</i> of alternative medicine to the public. And those key phrases are all an important part of the sizzle in my opinion. Ergo, I do not find that your re-write is an improvement to what I had written above. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 04:17, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um... yeah, I left those out, that's why it's a total rewrite and not just fiddling about with grammar. I don't see how adding those "key phrases" contributes to the point of what is supposed to be an encylopedic summary. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">✎</a> 04:29, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, well you see unless the paragraph sells AM there is no point in puting it in the article. So, your re-write is worthless. Just thought that you might want to know. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 04:45, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, I unclouded the mysterious statement</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Any positive effects on patients, even if only based on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effects</a>, still provides benefits to overall patient health that traditional medicine may not have provided.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and here is the <b>quite</b> more plain result:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>The alternative medicine industry claims that the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a> is just as helpful as actual medicine.</b>

<hr />
<p>Since, you have opened the door. I am seriously thinking about re-writing the entire criticism section. You know, ... clean it up real good. I will make it real clear and concise to the public. You know: white-wash all its main points so that it becomes totally worthless as criticism, just like you have done for the support section. So, that it will be great fodder for sixth graders. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 04:51, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I can't get this bit to make sense</p>
<p>The criticism voiced about homeopathic remedies applies equally well to conventional medicine as it does to any alternative treatment method. Specific alternative treatment methods are never used as universal cures for all that ails you. Specific medicines and treatment methods are designed to only treat a specific health condition just like in conventional medicine.</p>
<p>If you read the orogon of the medical art you will find that homeopathy does claim to be able to cure everything. Also I fail to see how the rest is relivant.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 16:52, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Psychosocial Treatments as Alternative Medicine</span></h2>
<p><i>This conversation was copied from the former Talk:Conventional medicine.</i></p>
<p>My area of interest in alternative medicine is psychosocial treatments. Psychosocial treatments is the Alternative Medicine of the New Millennium. I find it an exciting field. There is a lot of overlap between psychosocial treatments and some other forms of alternative medicine. In many respects it is a method of organizing the different forms of treatments. While a few forms of psychosocial treatments require the professional services of psychologists most can be self-taught with the aid of books or instructional videos, or can be learned from an experienced practitioner. Although some initial training is needed, once these techniques are learned, most people will need no additional outside assistance. I think that these psychosocial treatments will leave TCM behind in the dust.</p>
<p>I am going to first update my web site with this information. I am currently writing editorials on it. I will eventually get around to writing another 100% original article on it, here. I am <b>not</b> going here first, of course. These people are too hostile and narrow minded. I am kind of tire of wasting my valueble time with these @#$*^% over this NPOV nonsense. Most of these critics, are about 30 years out of date. I am <b>not</b> going to throw my pearls in front of swine, as they say. Most of these editors rank the importance of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> at the same level as the their article on <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampon.html" title="Tampon">tampons</a>.

<p>John, I heartily commend you for your psychosocial treatment interest - a perfect future. Really ESSENTIAL. By all means, <i>margaritas ante porcos</i>&#160;! - Who, indeed, is written in the Vulgate, who would feed pigs with pearls&#160;? I for one, will currently retire from Wiki, having made a few points and having ended my assignment here with some fascinating finding of facts about the anti-information cabal. Wiki is not a meritocracy. The fact that you managed to write a perfect AM article shows that only serious people like you can invest so much time and energy into not being bitter, and saying what they have to. I am also serious, not bitter either, and also say what I have to. Looks we are in the same boat, really&#160;:O) I wish you good luck in your career. For the time being I have more important things to do than demonstrating the values of editing at face value&#160;:O) Nice meeting you, John, and keep up the good work&#160;! - <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 08:37, 2004 Mar 31 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>There should be a section in support of alternative medicine as well as a section of criticism of it (and preferably summaries of several other positions). This is simple NPOV policy.</li>
<li>Both the "support" and the "criticism" sections should be written in an NPOV way, using language that <i>presents</i> the arguments instead of making the arguments themselves.</li>
<li>It's pointless and childish to revert simple, constructive changes such as the format of <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craniosacral_therapy.html" title="Craniosacral therapy">Craniosacral therapy</a> and various other links.</li>

<dd>During my 30 day ban (Feb 11 - Mar 12, 2004), the "support" and the "criticism" sections were removed by somebody else.

Then <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">User:Ashibaka</a> showed up and started dicussing writing style. From the edit summary comments of <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">User:David Gerard</a> I added back the the "support" and the "criticism" sections to AM while maintaining <b>all of the then current text</b>.

Everything RK did in alternative medicine today, and for the last several months was a <b>revert</b>. The last edit summary made by me today before RK's reverts was (=Branches of alternative medicine= Kinesiology is a science studied by physical therapists rather than a form of alternative medicine. Ergo, Applied kinesiology is AM, but kinesiology certainly is not). Therefore, I have been making 100% constructive additions and changes to this article on Alternative medicine over the last month, with the except of reverting RK's reverts. I have prevented nobody from editing and making changes in this article or from discussing it in talk. I have and will continue to be willing to discuss in talk any specific edit made by me on the alternative medicine article.

<p>Right now, the article is a block of prose (criticisms) and a string of bullet points (support). Each part is in fact a bit of its own turf, with the two factions defending "their" parts against intruders from the other side. This is of course not what NPOV is about.</p>
<p>I suggest that we structure the article by <i>topic</i>, rather than by <i>POV</i>. That would mean that we get sections like</p>

<li>Legal framework</li>
<li>Placebo effect</li>
<li>International use</li>
</ol>
<p>..and so forth, with each section having opinions of both critics and supporters. This would help in turning a collection of opinions into an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>Citations would also be useful. The matter is complicated by the fact that both factions usually focus on a discipline of AM, rather than on the field as a whole.

<dd>I believe that I have it now. One of the many possible classification systems useful in CAM would be classification by standard of knowledge: Supernatural, Pseudoscience, Protoscience, or "Real" science. Having studied the medical research of real science for the last couple of years, I can honestly report that the way of real medical science, otherwise known as medical scientism is just plain stupid and inefficient. Even with classification by standard of knowledge, CAM cannot be all lumped into just one pejorative category as most of the science people seem to be insisting upon. In short, your position is really not very rational. Homeopathy, for one thing, would be classified as a Pseudoscience and not Supernatural as you just claimed. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 05:48, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Classification by standard of knowledge is actually a classification by quality of evidence. Hence, the practice of clinical medicine with 85% of its current practices having been unverified by "real" science would only be classified as a protoscience. Only the practice of evidence-based medicine would qualify as a "real" science. Now compare CAM to Conventional medicine using a "Safety" classification system. Integrative medicine, by the rules of rationality, would be in the same class of evidence as EBM is.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Deleted YET agian!!! The rule by idiots is rapidly coming to an end! Are you a sixth grade student? Or, perhaps still in Kindergarten? The challenge was five examples of Alternative Medicine Practitioners. A stupid publicity stunt at the level of the National Enquirer tabloid magazine about <i>dowsing claims, parapsychologists, and "psychics"</i> obviously does not qualify. Responding to a comment in your cited link: <i>There are no worse liars than critics still operating at the level of Mickey Mouse Kindergarten attacks.</i> -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 12:50, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Will restore again. If AM folks cannot show a natural path, then the claim is, de facto, supernatural, until a natural path is known, shown, and provable." Dowsers" often also claim also to find "danger zones" in the human body, so it's very relevant. As far as "kindergaten attacks", I will refrain from insinuating you are only in the sixth grade, but make note of your attack at the same time.</dd>

<p>Can I please see some challenging college level criticisms aimed at the field of alternative medicine as a whole? Or, am I addressing a group of college drop outs?</p>

<dd>You are addressing a much larger group.... including individuals who aren't so stupid as to believe that one or two cited papers in support of an idea are enough evidence to affirm a theory. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 12:34, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And, I cannot believe that any rational person would actually try to quote a cheap tabloid publicity stunt because they don't have the mental acumen to articulate a rational criticism against alternative medicine.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, stop posting rediculous claims, hit the books, and start with evidence-based science, rather than bizarre meta-studies and citations of proposterous claims, and then stringing them together in such a way as to support a personal theory. In short, if you are doing real science, publish. Not on wikipedia, but in real journals. "Naturopath weekly" doesn't count. "Science" and "Nature" count.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Research methodology</span></h2>
<p><i>The scientific community argues that many studies carried out by alternative medicine promoters are flawed, as they often use testimonials and hearsay as evidence, leaving the results open to observer bias. They argue that the only way to counter observer bias is to run a double blind experiment, where neither the patient nor the practitioner knows whether the real treatment is being given or if a placebo has been administered. This research should then be reviewed by peers to determine the validity of the research methodology. Testimonials are especially useless in this procedure, because by chance alone some people will get cured and will be able to testify that the method really helped them. Furthermore, if the majority of people using a method do not notice any benefit or even get worse, there will still be a minority that can testify that the method really helped for them.</i></p>
<p>I give up! You have just argued about research methodology. Now, what does that have to do with alternative medicine? -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 03:36, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All medical techniques, to be accepted as such, have to demonstrate some properties (efficiency on some illness, reasonable side effects etc...) - otherwise, they can't be called "medicine", not even "alternative".
