	    <p><b>Alter Road</b> is a north-south thoroughfare of approximately four miles length in southeastern <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>'s <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_County%2C_Michigan_6437.html" title="Wayne County, Michigan">Wayne County</a>. Although Alter Road itself is completely within the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a> city limits, it is a symbolic dividing line between the overwhelmingly <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">African-American</a> City of Detroit and the likewise overwhelmingly <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_%28people%29.html" title="White (people)">Caucasian</a> City of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grosse_Pointe_Park%2C_Michigan_8553.html" title="Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan">Grosse Pointe Park</a>.</p>
<p>Like <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_Mile_Road_a914.html" title="Eight Mile Road">8 Mile Road</a>, another well-known thoroughfare of political, ethnic and economic demarcation in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metro_Detroit_e73b.html" title="Metro Detroit">Metro Detroit</a>, Alter Road has long been considered something of a "<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>" to separate communities. In fact, quite literally, there are places at which concrete barriers have actually been erected so as to reduce the interaction between the two cities. A prime example would be the intersection of Alter and Goethe, just south of Mack Avenue, at which—right where the City of Grosse Pointe Park's property line commences—that municipality has closed off Goethe to thwart both vehicular and pedestrian movement. Along nearby Mack Avenue—another border between the two municipalities—the City of Grosse Pointe Park has likewise made some of its intersecting north-south side streets inaccessible to vehicles, so as to reduce the potential for criminal activity, with the intersection of Mack and Wayburn Avenues in Grosse Pointe Park constituting a prominent example.</p>
<p>In his <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> book, <i>Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States</i>, author Kenneth T. Jackson describes Alter Road as "[t]he most conspicuous city-suburban contrast in the United States...". And in reference not only to Alter Road, but in general to all thoroughfares which separate Detroit from its suburbs, author Tamar Jacoby, in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> book <i>Someone Else's House: America's Unfinished Struggle for Integration</i> declares: "Eight Mile Road, Alter Road, Telegraph Road and Tireman Avenue; though originally arbitrary—lines on a map—the boundary between Detroit and its suburbs had become a chasm between two social classes. In some places, usually where the road was wide, it divided slum from new, upscale housing development. At other spots, once similar houses on either side of the street now looked like pictures before and after a natural disaster."</p>
<p>The four-mile stretch of Alter Road provides some contrasts of its own. At its southernmost, below <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Avenue_%28Detroit%29_05af.html" title="Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)">Jefferson Avenue</a>, are generally well-kept dwellings and the pleasant Mariner Park which hosts a still-functioning lighthouse. At one time, a major medical facility was located nearby at the "foot" of Alter Road called Marine Hospital. This particular section of the road parallels the narrow Fox Creek and it is at this southern end that Alter Road leads to the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_River_d34e.html" title="Detroit River">Detroit River</a> and to the southern starting point for <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Saint_Clair_%28North_America%29_1baa.html" title="Lake Saint Clair (North America)">Lake St. Clair</a>, with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada's</a> <a href="../../../p/e/c/Peche_Island_cac5.html" title="Peche Island">Peche Island</a> nearby.</p>
<p>North of Jefferson Avenue, however, Alter Road is quite blighted—as is much of the City of Detroit. However, Alter Road's northernmost blocks, between Warren Avenue and Chandler Park Drive—most especially its intersection with the meandering <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Drive_94ff.html" title="Outer Drive">Outer Drive</a>—offer a somewhat in-between of the two extremes.</p>
<p>Up until the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, there was little visible difference between Alter Road, and the streets immediately west of it inside the Detroit city limits, as compared with the streets immediately east of it inside the Grosse Pointe Park city limits. The southeastern corner of Detroit was majority Caucasian at the time (as was the city as a whole) and did not suffer the urban decay which plagues much of Detroit currently. If one had crossed the border back in those days, one might not have noticed exiting one municipality and entering the other.</p>
<p>There is speculation that during the early development of the City of Detroit, Alter Road became a city boundary because it was the farthest point that the Detroit Fire Department was able to offer coverage. This may well have been one of several reasons that Grosse Point Park then developed as a separate municipality.</p>
<p>The Florida-based, and internationally-known, rock band <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter_Bridge_5db9.html" title="Alter Bridge">Alter Bridge</a> takes its name from former <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creed_%28band%29.html" title="Creed (band)">Creed</a> guitarist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Tremonti_6e0a.html" title="Mark Tremonti">Mark Tremonti</a>'s childhood experiences growing up in Grosse Pointe Park. For many years, there has been a small bridge at the intersection of Alter Road and Korte (over Fox Creek); as a child, Tremonti was forbidden to venture past that bridge, leaving the safety of Grosse Pointe Park and delving into the dangers lurking in the City of Detroit.</p>
<p>Author <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~dtanoury1/Tanoury.html" class="external text" title="http://home.comcast.net/~dtanoury1/Tanoury.html" rel="nofollow">Doug Tanoury</a> has published a poem—on the internet—about this thoroughfare entitled, simply enough, "Alter Road."</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, it was reported that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Broadcasting_Company_8a11.html" title="National Broadcasting Company">NBC television network</a> had ordered a script for a new drama entitled "Alter Road" based upon the novel of the same name by Detroit area author <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowell_Cauffiel_3ef2.html" title="Lowell Cauffiel">Lowell Cauffiel</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Schwimmer_25b1.html" title="David Schwimmer">David Schwimmer's</a> Dark Harbor Productions was said to have been the executive producer of the project which was to have revolved around two families separated by race and class along the Detroit-Grosse Pointe Park border. Apparently, there was a loss of interest and the program was never televised.</p>
