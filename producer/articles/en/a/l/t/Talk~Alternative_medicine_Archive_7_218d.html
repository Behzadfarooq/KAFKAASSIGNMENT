<p>PS, for everybody: Using Word as Photoshop, with a revenge, desperatingly expecting others to correct her own mistakes, while writing here above that she has plenty of time to lose, hmm, shall I continue?</p>
<p>An editor and a sysop writing <i>anything</i> but alternative medicine on the alternative medicine page is a troll. She prevents real job being done, she turns Wiki into a market where volunteers lose their time contributing and cops like she is lose everybody's time policing. Not to be continued, let alone reccommended. Just let her laugh all the time - for her own enjoyment (perhaps she needs it badly, judging from her venting alleged charms on the market place&#160;:O). Message for Theresa: get a life, dear! While John here is the only one doing the the real work, to his honor, just let us all HELP him or at THE VERY LEAST let him REST unharassed, and hey, alternative medicine, anyone&#160;?&#160;:O) - <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 14:31, 2004 May 17 (UTC)</p>

<p>MNH: in the interests of article editing without reversion wars and working well with others of different viewpoint to yourself, it would greatly help if, should you feel a revert is the only possible sensible edit, to put a suitable explanation in the edit summary.

Incidentally, please admit you are only a brutal WikiCop policewoman who only messes around here - or prove your good will by answering my EIGHTH request to remove the <i>fight or flight</i>, most stupid unexplained addition. Ya know, that disgraceful POV you cared to lay like a rotten egg, on top of the other AM article. Prove you can behave without messing around or attracting all attention to you, away from whatever we do. Prove your grown up charms - intellectually, if you can.

<p>David, before you bother John any more, please note Theresa harasses him in editing, after a long history of conflicts, bannings and disruptions. She is becoming a pain for the Wiki community. I will reflect on the appropriate procedure and count on you for serious admonitions for her delirious behavior. Just watch her systematic, childish, and recently sexual harassment on the iridology pages and in these pages - last archives. There is a pattern of Theresa attacking and smearing the AM and I articles. This is hostile behavior, abuse of sysop powers, harassment at large and more than her previous libel. I mean business, David! Drop your aggressive insinuations, and contribute sensible content - or leave and let us work here. You disrupt our work and do nothing new. An area where you CAN do something is to police the policewomen. Do it! It will help. Try to be really helpful for once. <i>Quies custodies ipsos custodes&#160;?</i> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 17:21, 2004 May 17 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me remind you what you did to the iridology page: Here's what you found as an <i>ersatz</i> of explanation: "I would have more faith in your good intentions if they didn't involve posting your own name or your own website as an authority on the validity of iridology. - David Gerard 21:23, Mar 30, 2004 (UTC)" And here is what <i>vox clamantis in deserto</i> were (what I preached in the desert for you), David: David, what you reverted on grounds of "self-promotion" was only good information. Please see the iridology talk page for details. We must not hunt POVs and delete them. We must only mark them as such, and explain them seriously. NPOV is a measure of central tendency in a wide field where all POVs are spread eagle. NPOV editing is not some innate or recessive trait of some <i>uebermenschen</i> - it's only a grand mean of all POVs expressed as such - and especially <b>freely</b>. Your insistance in automatic reversion did not help you see the fact: For two months, the iridology page was frozen on the good version. You reverted to the wrong one. Here we go again&#160;! - irismeister 22:53, 2004 Mar 29 (UTC)</p>

<dd>sexual harrasment? You like it! You know you do! You called me baby for months despite my asking you not to because i found it offensive. Now you going to go running to get "serious admonitions"? Don't be so bloody daft. You mention my name in every other post you make. You post rubbish on my talk page despite my not having spoken to you in weeks. You are obsessed with me, and you know it.You call me a police woman cause you fantasize about me in the uniform -especially the boots.

<dd>Theresa honey you are delirious. You are in the AM page, here. And in Wiki. And in public. If you want to show me something, or discuss my sexual preferences, you can still dream on about using Wiki for that purpose. You and me, baby, we can arrange a private meeting, you know. Just what does this have to do with our work here in AM&#160;? Can't you tell the difference between our work (you don't know what it is) and your play (the only thing you do with your Word image editor? If you want, I'll be in London on June 5th, like Jim and David. Perhaps they can introduce you to me.

There is a special section where you can teach WikiCop habits, special English or drawing "Word jpegs". This is for medical articles, honey, a place for grown-ups. Now be the good girl we all know you are and save Wiki from the embarassment you cause. You are the fastest growing Wikipain and rapidly becoming a Wiki institutional trolling trademark. Today we have little time for you. As for my face, just face it dear, and bare with me - it's none of your business, as, I'm afraid, is editing per se. You belong to the Royal Wikipolicewomen Constabulary - and we'll see each other in London, only stupid as you are, you won't recognize me sugar. My name is Jipa, TK. And my face has long turned away from yours, a long time ago when I realized you were only the medical articles troll you are.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Standards Of Quality Guidelines"</span></h2>
<p>These may be a matter of some controversy, in that MNH is treating them as absolute hard incontrovertible Wikipedia rules when it's actually a style guide suggestion list written <i>entirely</i> by MNH. So therefore informed only by his point of view, no opposing points of view. I hope, MNH, you can see how this might lead to it not being considered absolute hard incontrovertible Wikipedia rules by others, but rather as a long essay on your point of view. To this effect, I've added a relevant notice, which I certainly hope MNH would not silently remove while controversy remains.

Too many beautiful words and too many diversions, plus your history of iridology page reversals do not make you a good candidate for my list of Wiki people I respect.

Wiki people are of course aware of the growing list of Wikicops doing nothing but traffic regulation and gesturing.

<p>The SQGs when finished are for the benefit of all editors. Any editor will be able to quote these guidelines by number in order to point out precisely what is wrong with the latest edit on any CAM article, without having to resort to personal attacks, such as yours. In CAM, there are more restrictive requirements than just NPOV, such as the controvsey notice above which <i>your quote</i> totally ignored. They are not my invention as your lies are trying to say. The SQG is a complication of direct quotes on what other editors have written on the subject.</p>
<p>I simply tested them out, once, on one stupid quote, which just so happens to have failed 6 out of the 12 guidelines or 50%. <b>That fact alone, should tell you who exactly the trouble maker here is.</b> It certainly is not me. You better get use to them, as you will be seeing them in the future on virtually all of my edit summaries and talk comments.</p>
<p>There is no <i>personal style guide</i> existing in this project.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SQGs have no <i>direct</i> bearing upon the compliance audits. The CAs will be based on a master list of key questions that are derived from the SQGs. Again, the SQGs will allow editors to objectively talk about what is wrong with the latest edit without resorting to personal attacks.</p>

<p>Osteopathy in it's orginal form is and always will be alt med (or quackery depending on where you draw the line between the two) DO's don't really practice osteopathy any more which is why they have the same status (pretty much) as MD's. In my country osteopaths pratices something far closer to the orginal form and as such are very defintly alt med. There are also a number of people who practice the orginal form of osteopathy who are definetly in the alt med catigopry. As such the point is meaningless.</p>

<p>Checked, Sam. The only trouble is that when sysops become trolls, Wikiconstruction is not a matter of avoiding them, but a matter of policing the Wikipolice. There is an old Roman adage, <i>quies custodiet ipsos custodes</i> - referring to the logical mess Wiki now becomes. Indeed, this is what happens when we are in a "milking mentality". By taking anything it can grab from articulate, competent, patient volunteer idealists, the likes of John, while banning them, taking their time, insulting them with theresa-branded stuff, <b>we are not doing a service to the cause of quality in Wiki</b>. We are only making it a sixth-grade nonsense somewhere down the sink, towards the general direction of the Web's red shift&#160;:O) And on a more general tone, putting ten cops, like a pack of wolves feigning to cry wolf for every new ingenious author, is little short of disgraceful. Therefore, I'm afraid Wikipolice is not the Wikisolution, but the Wikiproblem. We, in Wiki are not running about killing value. We are for increasing it!</p>
<p>So, Sam, I'm afraid we shouldn't hide ourselves behind rewiews. There is only one logical issue when Wikipolice is nasty - the <i>issue from above</i>&#160;:O) Appreciate your tone, though&#160;:O) - <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 14:55, 2004 May 19 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me explain it to you in plain English, <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykReeve_0a97.html" title="User:MykReeve">MykReeve</a>: You see only what you want to see. I wrote the criticism of Conventional Medicine working to add hard data for three months. It was dismissed with one second gesture. Do you think I am some idiot to work and see the work treated like this&#160;? CM is beyond criticism, as are Wikicops, as are Wiki admins, as are all self-inflated people messing around with nonsense questions like yours. AM is criticized by the same people who attack osteopathy, capisci&#160;? Let me see: How shall I put it for you to grasp the concept&#160;? Let's try: If you get a criticism of say, your <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbness.html" title="Dumbness">dumbness</a>, by me, a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monkey.html" title="Monkey">monkey</a>, who criticizes <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinism.html" title="Darwinism">Darwinism</a>, you dismiss my criticism on grounds of my alleged incompetence, for I also rejected Darwin <i>en bloc</i> with your own dumbness.

<dd>My comment has nothing to do with your "criticism of Conventional Medicine", I was referring to a specific sentence that is illogical for the reason that I give above - the fact that osteopathy is criticised by anyone has no implications for the validity of other criticisms of alternative medicine.</dd>

<p>A newspaper report quoting two people is in fact "anecdotal evidence." I don't see how it could be described as anything else. Placing the words "Anecdotal evidence of criticism", apart from it being a phrase that doesn't actually make any sense, above the Dawkins quote as some sort of "tit-for-tat" (which, btw, shows insufficient <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">wikilove</a> on your part), is meaningless.</p>
<p>If it isn't, can you please explain how the phrase "Anecdotal evidence of criticism" means anything usefully.</p>

<dd>AM still favors the support side. It will be like this for ever. Just thought that you might want to know. Your arguments still look second rate. Just my opinion, but I am right as usually. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde</a> 19:42, 27 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mr NH's latest edit summary</span></h2>
<p>MNH has just made the following comment in the edit summary "<i>(I found these quotes. I wrote the argument. I added them to the text. This is the original intro that I want for this argument.)"</i></p>
<p>John you don't seem to understand how this project works. You simply can't say "I want it like this". <i>anyone</i> can edit your text at anytime. understand that you feel you have ownership over the stuff you add to an article but your feelings are not important to this project (niether are mine or anyone elses) It's hard I know to see you work editted without restraint but you have to either accept it, or leave wikipedia for a different, non collaborative type of project. Having said that I have no objection to the edit you made to the article. Your intro looks fine to me. It's your edit summary that has me worried. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 14:44, 24 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me (though I always hesitate to put words in people's mouths, and would invite correction if I'm wrong) that it's an admission by MNH that this article is POV and he intends to keep it that way.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EALargeElk_ecec.html" title="User:ALargeElk">ALargeElk</a> 08:39, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pardon my broken English, but it seems to me that you guys are simply admitting that you are nothing but trolls trying to waste other people's time. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde</a> 15:49, 28 May 2004 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>Speaking from a personal POV I'm trying to create the best damn encylopedia the world has ever seen. MNH has stated on his talk page that he does not intend bothering with AM or iridology anymore.I think that is a wise decision. I suggest we take him at his word, respect his wishes, and stop asking him any more questions. Assuming he doesn't edit this page, ot the article page in the next few days, I suggest we archive the talk, start again and work to get the article as good as we possibly can so that we get some stability. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 16:10, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be pointless IMO. I've already tried mediation. Our mediator called the process off. it is unlikely IMO that we would find another person willing to act as a mediator. No since MNH has already got as far as Arbitration before, I think asking the arbitration committee to reevalute MNHs behaviour to see if their previous ban reformed him in they way they had hoped. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 18:19, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
