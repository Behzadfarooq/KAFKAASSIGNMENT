<p>There is an excellent article on alternative 3 here: <a href="http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/121_a3.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/121_a3.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/121_a3.shtml</a>. Perhaps worth investigating. I have also read an article in FT where the original author goes to an A3 conference but doesn't really have the heart to say it was all a hoax, it ends with a tongue in cheek comment that he was beginning to beleive it all himself having heard the 'evidence' and been subjected to the zeal of the participants!<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.29.102.57_b3ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.29.102.57">82.29.102.57</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.29.102.57.html" title="User talk:82.29.102.57">talk</a>) 14:53, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>This article takes three paragraphs to get to the point. It is not clear what "Alternative 3" is until that point. There's nothing really wrong with the text, it just needs to be improved structurally to explain what Alternative 3 is in the first paragraph, then get on to the explaination of it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Francis_c89a.html" title="User:Sam Francis">Sam</a></p>

<p>I think the author should go here <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/alt3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/alt3.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and look at the copyright date <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/images/April1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/images/April1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and then think about rewriting. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnanel_b5e3.html" title="User:Marnanel">Marnanel</a> 01:46, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, if there is a "documented disappearance of literally hundreds of scientists", then a list might start to convince us that the sky is really falling. It would also be helpful to answer the referenced website's claim that " its producers announced that the entire thing had been a joke." Is it true? If so, do you believe the government is pressuring them, or the aliens are mind-controlling them or something? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 14:30, Sep 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I keep thinking about how to improve this article and keep stalling because there's just so much wrong with it. There's lots and lots of POV stuff and inaccuracies (for example, a copyright date of April 1 is significant because copyrights on TV programmes never usually show the day and month-- in over twenty years of watching Anglia this is the only example I know of). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnanel_b5e3.html" title="User:Marnanel">Marnanel</a> 14:52, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think I saw this in the 70s. What I remember was images of red rocks of Mars similar to those by the Viking probe and suddenly something moves under the ground, as if a mole were digging under the surface. Was this the program?</p>

<p>I saw this, and even kept the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Times_2a4f.html" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a> for some years (I hesitate to suggest I may still have it!). It was not transmitted in April (too obvious), and stretched the credulity of a 15 year old. The copyright date was a clear admission of a hoax. It is amusing that people still believe this, they are probably the same ones who believe that the apollo missions didn'y go to the moon, an that the Earth is flat. Does anyone mind if we remove the NPOV tag now? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a> 17:14, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've just downloaded and watched the programme. Although it's dead creepy, it's not particularly convincing (the actor playing 'Bob Grodin' has a very unconvincing American accent). I believe the article makes it sufficiently clear that the programme was not real, although I think a lot of people would like to <i>believe</i> that there might be salvation in the planets. Eno's 'Music for Films' is well worth purchasing, and his theme music also popped up on a 1981 film called 'Schiele: Excess and Punishment' about <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egon_Schiele_0fc4.html" title="Egon Schiele">Egon Schiele</a>, the artist.</p>
<p>In fact, 'Bob Grodin' is played by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_Rimmer_d488.html" title="Shane Rimmer">Shane Rimmer</a>, the British film industry's favourite cheap American. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 23:20, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I also remember seeing this programme, but an interesting sidelight is that it was already known to be a hoax before it was broadcast. At least one newspaper (a local one for East Sussex) mentioned it in their TV listings. This must be a strike against the suggestion that only subsequent government pressure forced the programme makers to call it an April Fool.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think the previous contributer must be in error in saying that the programme was in Radio Times. As it was broadcast on ITV, it would have had to be in TV Times. (Many people have forgotten, or never knew, that up till the 1980's you had to buy two listings magazines for television in the UK!)</p>

<p>Didn't know where to put this and I can't seem to find it here on wikipedia.</p>
<p>In 2001 <a href="http://www.lorecordings.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lorecordings.com/" rel="nofollow">Lo Recordings</a> released an album named Alternative 3: Original Soundtrack. The music is written and performed by Anne Shenton (<a href="../../../a/d/d/Add_N_to_%28X%29_77ec.html" title="Add N to (X)">Add N to (X)</a>), Barry 7 (<a href="../../../a/d/d/Add_N_to_%28X%29_77ec.html" title="Add N to (X)">Add N to (X)</a>), Steve Claydon (<a href="../../../a/d/d/Add_N_to_%28X%29_77ec.html" title="Add N to (X)">Add N to (X)</a>), Richard Thomas and Jon Tye except tracks 02 (Alternative 1), 09 (Alternative 2), 16 (Alternative 3) &amp; 18 (Brain Drain) written and performed by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Gane_1b25.html" title="Tim Gane">Tim Gane</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereolab.html" title="Stereolab">Stereolab</a>), Andy Ramsay (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereolab.html" title="Stereolab">Stereolab</a>) and Jon Tye. Produced by Jon Tye.</p>
<p>All music taken from the forthcoming motion picture "Alternative 3" - Is written on the back, I don't recall seeing any Alternative 3 movie ever advertised or any information about it on the internet so I was wondering: What movie?</p>
<p>The booklet contains an introduction to the story and the names of the songs clearly indicate a referance to the original Alternative 3 story so there is no other Alterntive 3 at hand.</p>

<p>I only vaguely remember seeing the program (I was only 12 or 13 at the time), but I read the book quite recently. There the global crisis was not overpopulation (as it ways says in the article) but a runaway greenhouse effect. The three alternatives were: (i) The use of nuclear weapons to "puncture" holes in the earth's outer atmosphere and release the surplus heat (followed by a program of strict control on future CO2 emissions), (ii) moving human civilisation underground to escape rising surface temperatures and (iii) moving the human race elsewhere in the Solar System. Was the book different from the TV version, or are the three alternatives listed in the article incorrect? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 141.241.199.27 (<a href="../../../1/4/1/User_talk%7E141.241.199.27.html" title="User talk:141.241.199.27">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.241.199.27_a9c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.241.199.27">contribs</a>).</small></p>
