<p>It seems to me I have been linking a lot recently. Maybe you are looking at older things. Anyway I will work on it. I don't think everything needs explaining in Wikapedia, if it is clear enough so they know whether they need to look things up. Like, I would not expect an article on Fock, but if someone is working on long range propagation, it is good to have the name to start with. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that on the <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos.html" title="Amos">Amos</a> page, you placed an interwiki link to an article on the Hebrew Wikipedia (<a href="../../../../he/%D7%A2/%D7%9E/%D7%95/%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1_2.html" class="extiw" title="he:עמוס_2">he:עמוס 2</a>) that was related to a specific entry in the page. As the English page is a disambiguation page and the Hebrew page is an article about a series of communication satelites, the two are not a translation of eachother so the link to the Hebrew article should not belong with the other interlanguage links.</p>
<p>What you should do instead is to use an inline interlanguage link next to the item in the list that you are describing. That way, the article in Hebrew appears next to the list-item instead of with the other interlanguage links. For how to use inline interlanguage links and for more details, see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterlanguage_links_c114.html" title="Wikipedia:Interlanguage links">Wikipedia:Interlanguage_links</a></p>
<p>I have done this for you on the Amos page. If you have done something similar on other pages, could you please make the changes I described.</p>
<p>Of course, an even better solution would be to write an article about the Amos communication satelites on the English Wikipedia, but until that happens, using an inline interlanguage link is the best option.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/User_talk%7EAltmany_1327.html" title="Edit section: Berlin and  Seelow Heights">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Berlin and Seelow Heights</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of the text for the battle of Berlin, Seelow Heights and Halbe, was originally written by be me, the Berlin article after the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBerlin_0f4f.html#Copyright_violation" title="Talk:Berlin">Talk:Berlin#Copyright violation</a> so these are battle articles over which I have spent some time considering the contents.</li>
<li>All the textbooks I have read on the battle of Berlin cover the period from the start of the attack in the early hours on 16 April to the capture of Berlin. This means that all the statistics, number of men, tanks, KIA, etc tend to be for the whole operation, not just for the city phase of the Battle of Berlin.</li>
<li>The battle of the Oder-Neisse is a two front battle over a front of many kilometres (&gt;100?) It is not just the attack on the Seelow Heights over which the heaviest fighting took place.</li>
<li>If you look at the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBerlin_0f4f.html" title="Talk:Berlin">Talk:Berlin</a> you will see a comment by me:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Finally the sections "The battle of the Oder-Neisse" and "The encirclement of Berlin" are much more developed than section "The battle of Berlin" , so this article makes it look that it was all over bar the shouting once the city was enveloped. It was not. The encirclement of Berlin" took 5 days (April 20-25) so the section "The battle of Berlin" which took longer form (April 25 - May 2) should be at lest as long as that and probably longer.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>When I re-wrote the Berlin article I mainly concentrated on the initial stages of the Battle. It was always my intention to either let others write the city part of the battle to the same level of detail as the encirclement, or some day do it my self. Because from my point of view the detail earlier in the article is about right the problem with it is that the information about the city is too little. The information on the Seelow Heights is way to little. That battle should have a paragraph for each morning, afternoon, evening and night of the three/four days.</p>
<p>So that gives you an overview of my position. Now to answer your specific points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The merge of the two Seelow Heights articls. You are of course free to merge any additional information you think needs to be merged in. I considered moving the speculation about attacking around the Heights. But this is very dicey ground. As Churchill said "The terrible Ifs accumulate." Please have a look at the section "Wartime consequences" in the historys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultra&amp;oldid=23287744" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultra&amp;oldid=23287744" rel="nofollow">Ultra:15 September 2005</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultra&amp;oldid=23625884" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultra&amp;oldid=23625884" rel="nofollow">Ultra 20 September</a> and today <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra.html#Wartime_consequences" title="Ultra">Ultra#Wartime consequences</a> page/secton, and the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Talk%7EUltra_f190.html" title="Talk:Ultra">Talk:Ultra</a>. Please have a look at the last paragraph of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Quatre_Bras_bc5a.html#Conclusion" title="Battle of Quatre Bras">Battle of Quatre Bras#Conclusion</a>. It is fun to write "what ifs" (There a half a dozen books of that title now) but it is laden with POV and does not improve the articles, particularly if more that one "if" is piled on top of the statement. The speculation in the paragraph needed a balance put on it. For example the 1BF had been drawn up on a very narrow front, so given that Zhukov could not go round. The other Front commanders could and did do that. But if I added that to the paragraph to give it balance then it starts to become ifs on ifs. Armchair generals can alwasy fight a battle better than it was fought at the time, but I do not think it helps most Wikipedia articls to include that speculation fun as it is! This is not just because it is POV laden (and open to POV revert wars), I do not see it as encyclopaedic.</li>
<li>you wrote "<i>Battle of Berlin, IMHO, was much better with a shorter section about The battle of the Oder-Neisse</i>". I have answered that above. The Battle of Berlin is at the right detail, what is needed is more on the city battle. The text in the Seelow Heights is mealy seed material.</li>
<li>Heinrici's defensive preparations are "preparations" just as "This freed up General Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front (2BF) to move west to the east bank of the Oder river." are preparations. The Battle started on the 16th of April.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope now that I have laid out my stall you will consider taking over the city part of the battle and write a day by day account of its capture because that is what is needed to polish the Battle of Berlin article. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:00, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>In any case, note that the Battle of Halbe sub-section is exactly the opposite in size - a very short note linking to the main article.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think there are two reasons why the Battle of Halbe is semi-detatched. Until Beevor wrote about it in detail it was ignored to a large extent by other English language books on the Battle of Berlin. Unlike the Seelow Heights once the decision was taken by the IX not to fight their way into Berlin, it is not really part of the Battle for Berlin. To use the analgy of a domestic party gone wrong: Halbe was a fight in the back guarden, while the Seelow Heights was like gate-crashers kicking down the front door. The former is a sideshow and the latter crusual to what happened. You also might like to have a look at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Halbe_0e06.html" title="Talk:Battle of Halbe">Talk:Battle of Halbe</a> where I have just posed a question. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:16, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm looking for some people to help get involved in a dispute regarding the neutrality of the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_b033.html" title="Timeline of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Timeline of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>. It's apparent to me that this timeline as a whole exhibits systematic bias. My main concerns are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Israeli actions are explained, Arab ones are often not. 2) Victims of Arab violence are given detail and descriptions, victims of Israeli violence are ignored or relegated. 3) "Facts" are cherry picked to emphasize one POV over another.</p>
<p>If you have any time, perhaps you could give the page a look, and get involved in the discussion as well.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
