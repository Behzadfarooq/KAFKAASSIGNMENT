<p>You guys really need to get your facts straight, this is one the reasons why Wikipedia will never become a 100% trusted source of information. For one the theory that Japanese is part of the Altaic family is a theory that died out among linguists in the early 1900s, the most accepted theory is that Japanese is in the Japonic language family and there is NO linguist out there worth his weight that claims Japonic to be a part of Altaic. Please look up the facts before spattering them online, thank you.</p>
<p>This is a purely amateur opinion.</p>
<p>Linguists may not have proven a genetic relationship of Japanese or Korean, but the syntax is so similar I was able to learn it quickly simply by plugging the words into the same place they would be in Japanese (a language I have written 7 books in). If the relationship is only a "sprachbund," I wonder how it is so close a fit structurally speaking. Could we have genetic relationships which involve more than one parent and include some borrowing by contact so that this is not an either/or matter?</p>
<p>In respect to the non/existance of a Altaic language family, an anecdote:</p>
<p>In an Indian grocers in London I heard some men talking at work in the back of the store and asked if they spoke Tamil. They said ""yes," do you know Tamil?" I said, "No, this is the first time I have ever heard it."</p>
<p>Yes, I knew it because Tamil sounded just like Japanese (Niigata prefecture, to be exact). I had heard Tamil was Ural-altraic and what do you know!</p>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I m not professional linguistic either, but so far what I know, similar syntax is not very strong proof for genetic realtonship between languages. Also Tamil is not Ural-Altaic, but Dravidian language. I think this article is still slightly POV. Altought Ural-Altaic hypothesis has strong supporters, majority of the linguistics do not favor this idea. I will do some editing and if someone has objections, please bring them up here.--<a href="../../../k/u/l/User%7EKulkuri_07b6.html" title="User:Kulkuri">Kulkuri</a> 09:29, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree with the claim that Altaic is mainly based on similar syntax and typology; it is practically a slander on the many linguists who have put together collections of Altaic roots, and indeed reconstructions, one of which I have linked to below. While I agree that most linguists probably don't favor the idea, I am not at all convinced that that applies to the majority of historical linguists, or of linguists working on these languages. The case against Altaic needs to be made too, but not by attacking claims that Altaicists haven't made. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 20:24, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for edits and feedback. Especially history of altaic theory is useful. I will do some editing later, perhaps splitting article in two paragraphs (pro and against altaist theory). Right now I will take few weeks holiday from wikipedia and other duties.--<a href="../../../k/u/l/User%7EKulkuri_07b6.html" title="User:Kulkuri">Kulkuri</a> 07:22, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have, er, "improved" the opening paragraph. I felt that "controversial" is best used for something whose existence is accepted but whose importance or value is debated, and have replaced it with "putative", which I believe better indicates that some people just don't believe in it. Likewise I have rephrased other points for consistency with this state. I do not claim that the original was insufficiently NPOV, and I do not believe I have increased or decreased the level of scepticism within the article, but rather used terms more consistently conditional.</p>
<p>Also I've reworked the bullet list into a sentence, the better to increase symmetry with the latter items, rather than have three items bulleted and three not.</p>

<dd>There are two main schools of thought about the Altaic theory. One is that the proposed constituent language families (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic in the basic theory; with the addition of Korean and Japanese in extended 'Macro' versions) are genetically or 'divergently' related by descent from a common ancestor, 'Proto-Altaic'. The other school rejects this theory (so it is often called the 'Anti-Altaic' school) and argues that the member languages are related by convergence (mainly loan influence). The adherents of the divergence theory reject the criticism of the 'convergence' theorists, but they have not been able to overcome some flaws pointed out by the critics that essentially disprove the 'divergence', or traditional 'Altaic' theory. The continued popularity of 'Altaic' nevertheless exceeds that of the Flat Earth theory. Some adherents of the theory note strong similarities in the pronouns and other elements of the proposed members of the family and argue that the languages may even be related through a larger family such as Nostratic, but this is popular linguistics and wishful thinking that distorts or ignores the scientific principles of historical-comparative linguistics. The 'Altaic' and 'Ural-Altaic' theories are based on typology and loanwords. Both Uralic and 'Altaic' languages do follow the principle of vowel harmony, are agglutinative (stringing suffixes, prefixes or both onto a single root) and lack grammatical gender (see noun case). However, this is not evidence of genetic relationship. Unfortunately, genetic (divergence) theories are much more popular than convergence theories. No scholar of the convergence school has written a thorough monograph on the debate, citing the scattered, rather obscure scientific literature and examples.</dd>

<p>The citation of Comrie (1981) is out of date and may be misleading. Comrie seemed to follow Greenberg and Ruhlen in believing that Altaic was too narrow a group. In any case, in The Atlas of Languages, rev. ed., (2003), Comrie et al. include Altaic as a language family. See page 38, where Altaic, Uralic, and Indo-European are postulated as part of the larger Eurasiatic group. For more, see pages 46-49, which shows that Comrie et al. clearly accept Altaic but are not sure about the affiliation of Korean and Japanese. This affiliation is strongly advocated by Miller (1995) in Languages and History, an excellent summary of the Altaicist position, showing its basis in phonology and morphology (sounds and words) rather than relying on syntax and loanwords.</p>
<p>Most opponents of the "Altaic hypothesis" apparently are specialists in Indo-European. See Winfred P. Lehmann (1962/1997) p. 86 but compare to p. 87. Lehmann says "such proposed relationships...are not based on evidence obstained through the comparative method..." which suggests he has not read Miller. Roger Lass (1997) actually seems quite upset that anyone would propose "Altaic", but he singles out Greenberg and Ruhlen in Scientific American (1992) and R. Wright in Atlantic Monthly (1991) for scolding. He makes no mention of Miller. However, both Lass and Lehmann refer to Lyle Campbell's article in Philip Baldi (ed.) Linguistic Change and Reconstruction Methodology (1990). I haven't had a chance to read this, because I live in Taiwan and don't have access to a good library; I will, however, try to read it this summer when I am back home (USA).</p>
<p>Taking the "pro" side, Aleksandra Steinbergs in an article in Grady et al. (1996) claims there is "substantial evidence that Korean and Japanese are also members of the Altaic family." (pp. 396-7).</p>
<p>Finally, when I clicked on Roy Miller, there was no article. When I checked the web, there were so many entries under that name that it was difficult to sort for the right one. I propose using his full name, Roy Andrew Miller, which narrows the web search considerably (but still leaves some sorting to do). I will shortly prepare an article on Miller for Wikipedia; the problem is finding out where he is and what he's doing now. Any suggestions? Retired in Hawaii? Teaching in Norway?</p>
<p>As for the discussion of affiliations, I worry about the problem of loanwords coming into play. Both Japanese and Korean borrowed heavily from Chinese, especially nouns and verbs. Anyone who has studied Japanese can see remnants of this in the use of kanji; kana are used to show inflections and postpositions, making the division clear. Korean is not so clear, but as a student of Chinese I often use the loanwords to figure out the meaning of Korean sentences. The fact that Japanese and Korean have very similar patterns (syntax) is also interesting. Postpositions in both languages follow very similar rules and even sound the same. This, of course, may be due to borrowing. Both Korean and Japanese may have had different syntaxes long ago, the way Old English did. Without records, we cannot be sure. This is what makes Miller's work on reconstruction so informative and helpful.</p>

<p>This is the crux of the problem. Staunchest opponents of the Altaic theory do not know the languages involved. Turkish and Mongolian are so similar that dismissing a genetic relationship is like denying the genetic relationship of identical twins. On the other hand, the same experts lower the bar so low so that the extinct Anatolian languages can be admitted to IE. It is hard not to see the racist undertones in this general approach. Especially when "white" people speak a non-indo-european language there just isn't any interest in their languages and experts quickly annnounce that these languages are language isolates, suggesting that academic interest in such languages would not be a good career move. And about the non-white people's languages, well, frankly, these experts' time is too valuable to waste on such things.</p>
<p>Wikipedia could be most effective in such controversial topics by listing the facts and creating an enviroment where new knowledge is created. Turning Wikipedia an imitation of Encyclopedia Britannica by repeating what experts say is not doing justice to the power of this interactive medium.</p>
<p>By the way "A Board of Trustees" for Wikipedia is really a bad idea.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. What you say about dismissing the relationship of Turkish and Mongolian is very true, and then you go on a tangent and make some icky comments that I feel the need to oppose.</p>
<p>Admitting the extinct Anatolian languages into IE can't seriously be called "lowering the bar" in any context. In fact, Anatolian is providing us with a wealth of new insight into Proto-IE. <i>Hittite and the Indo-European Verb</i> by Jay H. Jasanoff is still blowing my mind. Believe me, the inclusion of Anatolian <i>raised</i> the bar for IE.</p>
<p>Second of all, any educated IEist worth anything understands that Indo-European languages aren't quote-unquote "white languages". Indo-European covers everything from Pashto to Swedish. That's a pretty broad range of human skintones if you ask me! Any true racist simply couldn't be a recognizable IEist nowdays without having a major sense of conflict with known facts. They would inevitably become some nutty maverick off to the side claiming that Sweden is the true homeland of the IE or some crazy thing. And certainly Altaic et alia are not 'non-white languages' unless you can somehow explain what 'white' even means. Again, Altaic-speaking peoples have various physiologies and skintones. Let go of the "us-versus-them" mentality. IEists aren't out to destroy Altaic studies&#160;;) However, perhaps if there is racism, it involves what the <i>general masses</i> are spending their time on. They will tend to gravitate to IE because there is so much more written about it, while Uralic and Altaic gets put to the side. And of course, there are those hardcore racists drawn to IE because of its unfortunate spinoff theories by the <a href="../../../n/a/z/NAZI_19d8.html" title="NAZI">NAZIs</a> and the bible-based <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japhetic.html" title="Japhetic">Japhetic</a> nonsense otherwise long since buried in IE Studies History.</p>
<p>But I'd bet that the obsession over IE instead of Uralic or Altaic is not so much because of any racist intentions on anyone's part so much as the fact that IE languages enjoy a longer written history than most other language groups. <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> also has a long written history and much is known about that group and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Semitic_0c88.html" title="Proto-Semitic">Proto-Semitic</a>. Altaic does not have such a long written history.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a board of trustees idea is what I was thinking of too. I like the name&#160;:) It seems like a natural evolution of things. And I support your idea that new knowledge could be created. Perhaps people could be organized into 'organized projects' of sorts. Not just these simple "entry projects". It would really band people together towards various causes or interests. It would be a step up from this plain ol' Wikipedia thing&#160;;) --<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlengordon01_3627.html" title="User:Glengordon01">Glengordon01</a> 05:51, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems to me that wikipedia is oddly dubious of the Altaic languages, to an extent that is not true for similarly controversial language groups like, say, <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilo-Saharan_languages_2960.html" title="Nilo-Saharan languages">Nilo-Saharan</a>. For instance, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAltaic_languages_35fb.html" title="Category:Altaic languages">Category:Altaic languages</a> is a member of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProposed_language_families_1c4c.html" title="Category:Proposed language families">Category:Proposed language families</a>, which warns us to be careful of using it.

Altaic has been accepted as a language family for a long time, and is generally listed as such in standard reference works. It seems as though a much more controversial issue - "should Korean and Japanese be included in Altaic?" - is being confused with the question - "should Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages be combined into Altaic?" While there is dispute about both questions, it seems as though the former theory has never reached the status of being generally accepted; while the latter was generally accepted, but is now being challenged. I think our treatment of both controversies should be to err on the side of the established convention - that is, of an Altaic language family that only includes Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic. This should be the baseline position given in the article, and controversies on both sides should be mentioned - is the group not broad enough? Is the group nonexistent? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:14, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well said. Personally, I don't see what the fuss is about with Altaic. Even if it's a sprachbund, there is absolutely something left under all this rubble that can be still be called "Altaic".

<p>which enables the paragraph to sound more neutral while still strongly stating the doubt on its existence. My reason for this edit was that in the previous version, there was no information on the number of Altaic family proponents, only a mention of that it "is rejected by many". This asymmetry was also incompatible with the statement</p>

<p>On the whole, I agree with most of Gordonglen's opinions on the subject - It is important to let go of the "us-versus-them" mentality and consider the issue with objectivity.</p>
<p>The "Altaic" problem has three sides to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The political perspective</li>
<li>The scientific perspective</li>
<li>The practical problems</li>
</ul>
<p>The political perspective is that the "Pan-Turkic" movement (still kept alive in various countries) has its roots in the 19th century and the Ural-Altaic language group. If the Ural-Altaic hypothesis is generally accepted, the idea can be revitalized. ( For example, the common cultural ancestry of all Turkic speaking peoples and Mongolians, and Finnish and Hungarians could be traced to the Hsiang-Nu Emprise of the Asian Steppes. ) On the other hand, the PIE hypothesis could be used to support the Huntington claim of Clash of Civilizations thus: The IE ethnic group could be claimed to have intrinsic values that allows it to prevail, these values are shown in religion, daily life and are progressed through centuries by language; and the superiority of the IE culture can be claimed to be proven by the geography that it has expanded to. This problem arises when the language family is equated with an ethnic group - a speculative approach with dangerous political consequences: See <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleolithic_Continuity_Theory_3136.html" title="Paleolithic Continuity Theory">Paleolithic Continuity Theory</a> for an hypothesis claiming that IE *did* originate in Europe. Also see Genetics section under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-Europeans_5fc0.html" title="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Proto-Indo-Europeans</a>. (Contrary to what may appear to be the case, there is a claim that IE originated in Europe in the Paleolithic period, and it can have political consequences.) Fact is, that language families, apparently a harmless scientific subject, can become tools for right-wing policies when they are equated with ethnic groups, cultural spheres or races.</p>
<p>Both political views are way too much distorted and senseless to be considered seriously in academic circles; but both ideas have a chance gaining popularity - with 'masses general' as Glengordon puts it.</p>
<p>The scientific perspective is that the comparative linguistics is insufficient to explain certain cases in languages. I am also an amateur, however the following example could be good for explaining the dilemma: In modern Turkish, (Altaic family) the singular pronouns are as follows: Ben, sen, o. (3rd being neutral sex.) The Hungarian (Uralic family) singular pronouns are: En, Te, ö. (pronounced "o," same as the Turkish equivalent.) Here is the problem: The 1st and 3rd pronouns may suggest common ancestry. However, the 2nd pronoun could suggests otherwise. Pronouns are very basic word forms and are not usually borrowed. Therefore, the situation does not have sufficient evidence to suggest common ancestry, but borrowing is not a viable explanation as to the existence of common fundamental vocabulary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the comparative linguistics method has been most succesful with the IE family, in a sense, the best support for comparative linguistics comes from the language family that gave rise to the theory. Imagine an alternate scenario where the theory for linguistic ancestry could have been developed by people speaking Nilo-Saharan family languages: Perhaps they would have considered a different methodology to find common ancestry?</p>
<p>The practical problem with the Altaic language family studies contitutes three issues: First, agreeing with Glengordon, IE enjoyed a much longer period of written texts. Second is the lack of texts in the given time period. The third is a general lack of interest: The IE languages were written with various alphabets, so common roots could be determined only after these different alphabets were transcribed in the modern latin alphabet. This is yet to be done for the Uralic and Altaic families.</p>
<p>For this page, I think it is best to mention that mainstream linguistics consider Uralic and Altaic families to be separate groups, but also to mention the Ural-Altaic hypothesis. It is certainly not a good idea to merge the pages: They should stay separate pages. This is also the framework for various common ancestries suggested for PIE, such as the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Asiatic_8ab9.html" title="Afro-Asiatic">Afro-Asiatic</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Uralic_5f4f.html" title="Indo-Uralic">Indo-Uralic</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-World_language_31e3.html" title="Proto-World language">Proto-World</a>.</p>
<p>On a side note: Hittite and Luvi *are* Indo-European. No "bar" is involved, in fact, Hittite is *the* language that supported the IE family in the sense that the theoretical basis for laryngels (proposed before Hittite was deciphered) was quote-unquote proven by Hittite. -- <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinanozel_e215.html" title="User:Sinanozel">User:Sinanozel</a> {timestamp}</p>

I assume you're referring to this? To me, "rejected" implies that the theory is disproven, which it of course isn't. A scientifically objective way of stating the status of Ural-Altaic is: "Ural-Altaic is <i>insufficiently proven</i> to the satisfaction of mainstream linguists". Also, Ural-Altaic may be a dead <i>name</i> but it's hardly a dead <i>theory</i> since it continues to thrive on in the form of a subhypothesis of the larger <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostratic.html" title="Nostratic">Nostratic</a> family.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The dismissal of Uralic-Altaic comparisons is due more to a fundamental denial of Proto-Altaic itself by a vocal group of conservative extremists. Afterall, by denying Proto-Altaic altogether, it slyfully undermines any comparison of Uralic to a now-conveniently "non-existent" protolanguage. A delightfully orwellian tactic&#160;:) I've noticed extreme conservatives play mindgames by purposely abusing the term "mass comparison" to vilify anything produced by an opposing camp.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The pronominal systems of Uralic and Altaic are clearly related somehow because of not only the "mi-ti-an" pattern noticed long ago, but an entire set of deictic and interro-relative pronouns too, as well as the presence of a trace pronominal oblique case marker *-n- in both families. IE and Etruscan can even help to confirm all of these same patterns. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_R._Bomhard_b001.html" title="Allan R. Bomhard">Allan R. Bomhard</a> has published ample stuff on this but I may be ignorant of other lesser known individuals who have as well. No sensible linguist thinks that it's <i>unlikely</i> that Uralic <b>*mun</b> ~ <b>*minä</b> (Jahunen) would be unrelated to Altaic <b>*bi</b> and its oblique stem <b>*min-</b> (<a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Starostin_fd09.html" title="Sergei Starostin">Starostin</a>) because these similarities are part of a larger structural context (namely specific similarities within an <i>entire</i> pronominal system that <i>as a whole</i> cannot likely be due to chance anymore).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If sound correspondences between Uralic and Altaic haven't been well laid out to this day, it is in my view strictly because of linguist politics that hold the field down by constantly propping up a petty war between narrow-minded conservatives and out-to-lunch mavericks. Somewhere in between are the victims of moderateness and honest science. I've already noted, for example, that the Altaic *m/*b alternation is a specific pattern attested in a few languages like <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Min_62f0.html" title="Southern Min">Southern Min</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guarani_language.html" title="Guarani language">Guarani language</a> where it is particularly associated with "nasal harmony" <a href="http://ling.nthu.edu.tw/teal/TEAL_oral_HsiuHsueh_Sylvia_Liu.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ling.nthu.edu.tw/teal/TEAL_oral_HsiuHsueh_Sylvia_Liu.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In other words, we can see by comparison with real-world languages that *b in Altaic *bi must be from earlier *mi in order to explain the preservation of *m in the oblique *min- where a following *n is coincidentally present. Pre-Altaic nasal harmony is the only rational cause of this pattern based on my observation. That's how <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_reconstruction.html" title="Internal reconstruction">internal reconstruction</a> is done. This common sense helps to balance out one-sided accusations by anti-Altaic denialists.</dd>

<p>According to major reference works, everbody agrees on Turkic, Tungus, and Mongolian families. These language families have some common words and they are typologically similar. Whether they are genetically related or not is the subject of ongoing research. The similarities could be result of long-term contact.</p>
<p>All languages are influenced by languages they are in contact with. According to the standards set by linguists, languages that make up a family must show productive-predictive correspondences. The shape of a given word in one language should be predictable from the shape of the corresponding word, or cognate, in another language. Turkic, Tungus, and Mongolian satisfies all these similarities.</p>
<p>I do not agree with the idea that the Anti-Altaic hypothesis necessitates total abandonation of the Altaic one. This Altaic Language article seems to me a propaganda of the Anti-Altaic hypothesis rather than an objective comparison of the two.</p>
<p>The family name "Altaic" is a commonly used terminology to label these languages. Turkic, Tungus, and Mongolian are still Altaic regardless of exact status of Altaic is. The dispute is a minor issue among a small circle of specialists. Furthermore, even these specialists use the term Altaic to label, especially, for these three language groups. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User_talk%7EE104421_cfd3.html" title="User talk:E104421">e104421</a> 7 September 2006, 00:47 (UCT)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with E104421. While I personally haven't seen any compelling evidence for an Altaic connection, I don't believe that the label is useless. I've seen just as little evidence for the Niger-Congo language family and have seen very good arguments against the unity of the Uralic family, yet there's little dispute over whether or not they're useful labels.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, I agree that the emphasis in this article should be on Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic. Starostin's connection of Korean and Japanese to Altaic are much more controversial than previous definitions of the family and should possible get their own section within the article, rather than being lumped with the more established branches. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStraughn_f4fb.html" title="User:Straughn">Straughn</a> 14:38, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Some of the Korean items seem like gibberish, not Korean. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 13:32, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, I think a few initial entries are from the published work cited before the table. I recently added some others from the German version of this article, <a href="../../../../de/a/l/t/Altaische_Sprachen_f47d.html" class="extiw" title="de:Altaische_Sprachen">de:Altaische Sprachen</a>, which is highly complete and comprehensive compared to the English version, and is marked "lesenswert" (recommended for reading). I think no one knowing Korean checked the page before, could you please fix if there are mistakes? One possible reason that these might not make sense could perhaps be that they are Old-Korean and not properly marked.

<dd>The only fixes I can do are deletions, because I'm <del>unaware of any</del> not knowledgeable about cognates, and adding non-cognates would be an error. I had a look at the German version, and I can only recognize 5 modern words out of the 18 pairs of Old Korean-Korean that are there. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 01:32, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, no, no. Firstly, find the original source for the cognate table (no source is cited). If it's older than the Altaic Etymological Dictionary from 2003, <b>DELETE IT</b>. That book presents a new reconstruction of Proto-Altaic with radically different vowels. <s>I'll look for a better cognate list in Blažek's paper</s> (after I'll have finished transcribing the phoneme inventory and the correspondence lists from there).</p>
<p>If it survives, change what it looks like. Currently, the Turkish orthography is used for Turkish, one of the common transcriptions is used for Japanese (why modern Japanese instead of Old Japanese?), and a completely idiosyncratic phonetic transcription (probably Starostin's) is used for the rest (including Korean, for which two official transcriptions exist)! What we should do is obvious: use <b>both</b> official orthographies (which exist for all of the modern languages given) <b>and</b> IPA transcriptions.</p>

<p>(Regarding the deletion above, there are lots of cognates in Blažek's paper, but only a few selected Japanese, Silla, Koguryo, Kitan and/or Tabgač reflexes are given for each – nothing of encyclopedic value.)</p>
<p>David Marjanović | david.marjanovic_at_gmx.at | 17:50 CET, 2006/11/3</p>
<p>So. I replaced the old cognates table two new tables, based on the EDAL ( = Starostin et al. 2003), one for a large number of numerals and one for other nouns; note that some of the new reconstructions (e. g. "heart") are strikingly different from the old version. I think the article is long enough now.&#160;:o) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Marjanovi%C4%87_e46b.html" title="User:David Marjanović">David Marjanović</a> 17:02, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>[sorry for the chaos yesterday – that bizarre computer didn't show me the cognate table because I hadn't refreshed the page, but did show me my own edits!!!]</i></p>
<p>I'm the one who made today's changes. I put the sentence about Comrie in italics because I don't understand it. Does Comrie think that Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic are members of Nostratic, but not more closely related to each other than any of them is to any other Nostratic language families?</p>
<p>I'll start adding the sound correspondences listed by Blažek next. Someone, after all, has to put some actual evidence for Altaic into the article! David Marjanović | david.marjanovic_at_gmx.at | 21:40 CET | 2006/10/29</p>
<dl>
<dd>Added correspondences between the plosives.</dd>
<dd>David Marjanović | david.marjanovic_at_gmx.at | 23:13 CET | 2006/10/29
<dl>
<dd>Finished consonant and vowel tables.</dd>
<dd>Yesterday I also added the reconstructed phonology of Proto-Altaic. Then someone moved it below the sound correspondences. <b>If nobody protests till Sunday, I'll put it back, above the correspondence tables,</b> because the current order, although more logical scientifically, is worse didactically and stylistically: readers should first see what sounds there presumably were (two short tables) and then how they evolved (two very long tables).
<dl>
<dd>Done. Also renamed "reconstructed morphology" to the much better fitting "morphological correspondences".</dd>
<dd>David Marjanović | david.marjanovic_at_gmx.at | 17:49 CET | 2006/11/9</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Next: Case and number suffixes and pronouns from Blažek's paper.</dd>
<dd>I hope somebody can check out the prosody table in that paper. Does it mean Starostin et al. reconstruct pitch accent or even tone for Proto-Altaic?</dd>
<dd>Also please compare my version of the vowel correspondences to the original. Blažek puts a dot under some Proto-Turkic /a/ and /e/ and a breve on some Proto-Korean /a/; those are apparently separate phonemes, but what are they supposed to have been pronounced?</dd>

<dd>Hi, as someone very much interested in Altaic studies, I'm following your contributions to the article with great excitement. May I suggest you to create a proper Wikipedia account and continue with your work on the article using that? If you haven't noticed yet, it's very simple to get an account, just use the "Create account" link on the top right corner of any Wikipedia page. That way, it would be easier to communicate with you (via your talk page) and recognize your contributions in the edit summaries. Edits from a registered user always get more credence than from an anonymous ip address. There are situations where anonymous edits are not allowed at all, like on pages with "protected" status. Please see <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_create_an_account__49b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Why create an account?">Wikipedia:Why create an account?</a> and keep up the good work.

<dd>Thank you – I will register sometime soon to create the article Phylogenetic nomenclature which is sorely missing. So far I don't need an account, IMHO. I don't need any credence at present – I cite my sources, which are usually available online for free and linked to in the references or external links section (as in this case), and I mention my edits on the respective talk pages.</dd>
<dd>Communication might be even easier via e-mail. That's why I put my address in my "signature".</dd>

<dd>Entered morphology table and pronoun table. Please check for misunderstandings! Unlike Starostin et al. I put the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tʰ/-</span> forms and the /s/- forms in the same lines because the required sound shift would be no weirder than what happened in Greek (Classical Greek /sy/ "thou" instead of the expected */ty/, without a regular sound shift).</dd>
<dd>I wonder if anyone who has read the etymological dictionary by Starostin et al. has ever argued against the existence of Proto-Altaic… do we know if there still <b>is</b> a controversy?!?</dd>

<p>I reverted the edit by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Marjanovi%C4%87_e46b.html" title="User:David Marjanović">User:David Marjanović</a> for two reasons. First, I don't think it's a good idea to introduce a less common term such as <a href="../../../b/u/y/Buyeo_languages.html" title="Buyeo languages">Buyeo languages</a> to the infobox, especially as that classification is in itself highly controversial; and second, the "Altaic" origin of Japanese is certainly not a very widely accepted view among specialists (see <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language_classification.html" title="Japanese language classification">Japanese language classification</a>).--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnte_Aikio_9bb9.html" title="User:Ante Aikio">AAikio</a> 11:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Buyeo languages" is not a common term i agree with you, but <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese language</a> or at least <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Japanese_1802.html" title="Old Japanese">Old Japanese</a> language and <a href="../../../g/o/g/Goguryeo_language.html" title="Goguryeo language">Goguryeo language</a> are very close, you can not refute that hypothesis because there are proofs written in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hou_Han_Shu_07eb.html" title="Hou Han Shu">Hou Han Shu</a> and also Old Korean book written in Classical Chinese characters. According to my knowledge, there are also no real evidence relationship between Japanese language and <a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryukyuan_languages.html" title="Ryukyuan languages">Ryukyuan languages</a>, which both belong to the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japonic_language.html" title="Japonic language">Japonic language</a> family. Regards<a href="../../../w/h/l/User%7EWhlee_2402.html" title="User:Whlee">Whlee</a> 19:09, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, OK. At least Korean is back in again.</p>
<p>However, whoever wrote "Unofficial" into the Altaic languages template (at the bottom of the page) was being childish. This is science, not bureaucracy. There is no such thing as "official". There are only "disproven", "controversial", "improbable" and the like.</p>
<p>The main reason why I put Buyeo (a term I had never seen before; I've only seen "Koreo-Japonic", which is an ugly word, and "Eastern Altaic", which is vaguely mentioned in the EDAL) into the infobox, instead of just restoring Korean, was that it spares me the work of including Goguryeo, Silla, Baekje and whatever else all separately...</p>
<p>That the membership of Japonic in Altaic is not widely accepted (at least among people who haven't read the EDAL&#160;:-&gt; ) does not matter <b>here</b> – what matters is that most Altaicists (maybe all now, now that the EDAL has been published) include it.</p>
<p>I'll write "Korean and its relatives" and "Japonic and its relatives" into the infobox, make them "often included", and restore Ainu as "rarely included" – it's not included in the EDAL, but for all I know there are still people who consider it possible that Ainu is Altaic (rather than "Austric" or than just giving up). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Marjanovi%C4%87_e46b.html" title="User:David Marjanović">David Marjanović</a> 23:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Better yet: to avoid confusion, I wrote "and its extinct relatives" behind Korean and Japonic. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Marjanovi%C4%87_e46b.html" title="User:David Marjanović">David Marjanović</a> 23:18, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should keep that template&#160;: <a href="../../../a/l/t/Template%7EAltaic_languages_af45.html" title="Template:Altaic languages">Template:Altaic languages</a>, because lots of Koreans "ignore" that pure/native Korean words (i.e. those which are not <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-Korean_20de.html" title="Sino-Korean">Sino-Koreans</a> words) of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_language.html" title="Korean language">Korean language</a> are related to the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altaic_languages.html" title="Altaic languages">Altaic languages</a> family, i'm also wondering whether Japanese peoples know that pure Japanese vocabulary (<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html#Kun.27yomi_.28Japanese_reading.29" title="Kanji">Kun-yomi</a>) may also come from the same family.

<dd>I don't understand your reasoning. It doesn't have any basis in webpage and information design. Take a look at a page like <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish language</a>. You can view an Infobox to the right side that clearly lists language family, with links to <a href="../../../o/g/h/Oghuz_languages.html" title="Oghuz languages">Oghuz languages</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic languages</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altaic_languages.html" title="Altaic languages">Altaic languages</a>. A reader can quickly gather information regarding the classification of this language and click on the links to see what they are about. This is good presentation of information. The templates at the bottom don't do anything except take up page space and act as a redundant "See also" section. I'm not a big fan of these kinds of templates. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Template%7ERomance_languages_82f3.html" title="Template:Romance languages">Template:Romance languages</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Template%7ETurkic_languages_f5ae.html" title="Template:Turkic languages">Template:Turkic languages</a> are equally useless, but tolerable since the scope of the "family" is small. --<a href="../../../s/b/o/User%7ESborsody_63e3.html" title="User:Sborsody">Stacey Doljack Borsody</a> 23:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
