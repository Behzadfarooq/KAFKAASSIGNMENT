<dd>That's interesting. Is any distinction made between "alternative rock" and "indie music" in Britain? The most common term in the United States is "alternative rock" (2,070,000 Google hits). I have heard "alternative music" (376,000 Google hits) used here, but it's definately less common. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcegikmo1_4637.html" title="User:Acegikmo1">Acegikmo1</a> 13:46, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should Linkin Park really be mentioned in this article? I'd hardly consider them representative of alternative. Modern mainstream music does not really reflect the original styles or ethics of alternative rock. Much of what still gets mislabeled "alternative" seems to be mere shallow imitations of the true form, and I'd say Linkin Park is amongst these bands. Modern mainstream rock may have some influences from alternative, but it is definitely not alternative itself. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 17:43, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably, the dumbass which classified Linkin Park as "alternative rock" dislikes hip hop and has forgotten that LP features a rapper - i.e. Mike Shinoda - in its line-up. Only hip hop detractors (or Shinoda detractors, perhaps?) call LP "alternative rock".</dd>

<p>I think Pixies should be mentioned as a significant 80's alternative rock band, not least because they form a 'missing link' here, having been influenced by Husker Du, and being the main influence on Nirvana.</p>
<p>(And that's a statement of fact, not opinion. These influences were acknowledged by the bands themselves. Of course, in my opinion they hold their own very well against these other bands.)</p>

<p>I edited this entry to mention Pixies, and some idiot changed it back. Like them or not, Pixies had a huge influence on alternative rock and should not be overlooked.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with your edit is that you failed to comprehend the sentence. the sentence says, "Notable alternative bands of the early and mid-1980s include R.E.M., Sonic Youth, The Replacements, and Hüsker Dü from the United States, and New Order, The Smiths, The Cure, and The Jesus and Mary Chain from the United Kingdom." The Pixies relased their first album in 1987. dditionally, if we change the sentence to say in the entire decade instead of early on and only listing integral bands to the development of alternative rock, then we have list a lot more bands. What makes the Pixies more important than Dinosaur Jr, Throwing Muses, the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, and a great many more bands that emerged in the late 80's? It's unnecessary for that sentence. if you want the Pixies mentioned (and I think they should, but the way), write about them in a separte sentence. WesleyDodds 01:54, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"What makes the Pixies more important than Dinosaur Jr, Throwing Muses, the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, and a great many more bands that emerged in the late 80's?" Well to start, there's their overwhelming influence: Nirvana, Radiohead, and Smashing Pumpkins were three of the biggest-selling alternative acts ever, and all were inspired by the Pixies. For more info about their "importance," check out <a href="http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_said.html" class="external free" title="http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_said.html" rel="nofollow">http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_said.html</a></dd>

<p>Regular Rock and Roll with the BASIC 4-4 time signature came from Blues music perfected in Chicago as well as country music. The reason Alternative Rock seems to be called Alternative is from its subtleness taken from Jazz time signature styles, primarily. Jazz was invented in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
<p>When you listen to bands like Phish verses The Grateful Dead the similarities are very similar but with one major difference. Phish seems like an alternative band compared to GD being a straight rock style. Phish’s emphasis seems geared more toward Jazzy “off-beat-type” riffs.</p>
<p>This makes Alternative Rock feel less “booming, solid or definitive” as compared to Regular 4-4 Rock. But Alternative music seems sexier and more descriptive because of less emphasis on time signature and more on substance and fluidity.</p>

<p>Perhaps understandably so, this article is incredibly US-centred. For instance, writing that alternative music was only played on this or that college station entirely ignores that while it might have been marginal in the US, it was not at all so in the UK and other places, such as Australia, or Germany, where neue Deutsche Welle ruled the charts in the early to mid 80s. I had to stop rewriting it when I got to the part that suggested that alternative bands did not have spectacular sales. This is complete nonsense. It might be true of the US, but it certainly isn't of other countries. The UK used to have "indie" charts that ran alongside the regular ones, and it wasn't uncommon for records to top both. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 08:46, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article mostly focuses on Nirvana in the mid 90s...but that really isn't all that true. Back in the early 90s, Nirvana was considered "grunge" and while Nirvana DID help punk bands come into the mainstream, by the mid 90s the word "alternative" was no longer associated with solely Nirvana. In fact, from what I remember from 1994-1995 period, when someone mentioned alternative music, pop-punkish bands like Greenday and Offspring would come to mind. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyerhell_a8a1.html" title="User:Flyerhell">Flyerhell</a> 05:58, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose spliting off the current list of alternative rock genres into an article titled "List of alternative/indie music genres". The reason for this is I plan to add more genres to the list than space might allow for future additions to the body of the article, and to list indie genres (that is, genre called "indie" after alternative went mainstream), which currently do not have a definitive listing on Wikipedia. Alternative and indie are used interchangeably enough (especially in regards to genres like <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoegazing.html" title="Shoegazing">Shoegazing</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_pop.html" title="Noise pop">noise pop</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-rock.html" title="Post-rock">post-rock</a>, and others) that I feel such an article title would be the most appropriate heading. I'm using AMG's genre Alternative/Indie rock database as an example of what this list would contain, although due to the nature of Wikipedia we could list far more in number and those in general obscurity.</p>
<p>The list would include genres like grunge, Britpop, shoegazing, indie rock, twee pop, psychobilly, industrial rock, C86, grebo, space rock, post-rock, post-punk revival, gothic rock, Paisley Underground, noise pop, noise rock, jangle pop, dream pop, geek rock, alternative metal, Madchester, Christian alternative music, lo-fi, sadcore, slowcore, math-rock, and more. We could leave a short sentence on this page listing at least a few of the more notable genres (such as grunge, Britpop, and gothic rock) along with the link to the list page.</p>

<dd>That might a good way to do it. But we should also account for future expansion of the main article itself. Right now a lot more can be added about the history of and opinions on alternative rock. Also, those were just the styles I could think of off the top of my head. There's certainly smaller scenes that could be listed, and a page solely devoted to genres might help highlight them. Lastly, there are people who would probably be searching for "Indie genres" instead of "Alternative genres" (especially in the UK) so an article title that references both might help out.

<p>I propose the splitting of this article into Alternative Rock and ALternative Music as in my experience these mean too different things although I have not enoucntered the term or style of Alternative ROck that often.</p>
<p>Alternative Rock Article: To describe a specific style in line with other such musical genres as <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">Punk</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal</a></p>
<p>Alternative Music: Now im sure they'll be some disagreement about this BUT in my experience Alternative Music is used as an umbrella term to cover a variety of musical genres including Punk, Indie, Emo, Metal, Gothic Rock and youth scenes including Goth, Emo, Grunger, Punk, Metalhead etc. The followers of these scenes often have overlapping musical tastes, attitudes and friendship groups (i.e metalheads hang with Grungers without problems when many metalheads would not hang with a chav simply becuase they are a chav) The Article does not properly reflect this use of the term and is geared more towards Alternative Rock as a Musical Style and its history.</p>

<dd>This is a common misperception. "Alternative" is meant to refer not merely to an outsider mentality, although that's how it got it's name. Rather, it refers to post-punk music genres developed in the indie scenes of various regions that exised outside of the mainstream for the most part until the 90's (which is why bands like Oasis are called alternative, because they emerged from the Manchester indie scene). This excludes both metal and non-alternative forms of punk (emo and pop-punk are occasionally lumped in with alternative). Terms like <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_metal.html" title="Alternative metal">Alternative metal</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_hip-hop.html" title="Alternative hip-hop">Alternative hip-hop</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_country.html" title="Alternative country">Alternative country</a> exist, but these are largely devised in relation to their overall genre, and do not necessarily have any connection to alternative rock (although Alternative metal at times <i>is'</i> alternative rock, as are a scant few alt. country bands like Wilco). "Alternative" does have a lot of connotations in popular culture, but here it refers to this particular phenomenon. WesleyDodds 04:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a line in the Overview I've long wondered about:</p>
<p><i>In the late 1970s and early 1980s only CFNY, a commercial radio station in Toronto, Ontario, regularly broadcasted alternative rock in North America.</i></p>
<p>There's a number of things murky about this. First of all, alternative rock didn't really come into its own until the mid-80's or so. Certainly no one called bands later identified as alternative that in the late 70's. Additionally, many modern radio station that play alternative rock and call themselves alternative stations these days certainly didn't play alternative rock until the very end of the 80's at the earliest. KROQ, for one, primarily played punk, New Wave, and other modern rock pretty much until 1990; they certainly didn't play alt-rock as much as college radio did. There's a reason it was called <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_rock.html" title="College rock">college rock</a>. Also, looking back at the history this line was added by an unregistered user who only made edits in the alternative and punk rock pages having to do with Canada. I mean, it's great that there's an effort to add a more global perspective to the subject, but this just doesn't seem accurate.</p>
<p>What is the connotation here for "alternative"? Is it just that CFNY played a lot of left-of-center music? That doesn't mean it played "alternative" in the genre sense. From the looks of it, it was simply a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeform.html" title="Freeform">freeform</a> station that ended up focusing on alt-rock later in its history, much like KROQ. Unless someone can confirm that CFNY was playing early alternative rock artists on a regular basis in the early 80's, I feel we should take this line out. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 10:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The majority of music played by WLIR on Long Island in the early to middle '80 consisted of New Wave, Novelty hits and Techno Pop. However REM ,New Order The Cure and later The Alarm and The Smiths were in very heavy rotation. Husker Du and The Replacements were in light rotation by the mid 80's. One thing I have never understood is why here and elsewhere The Cure and New Order are considered alternative rock. They are synthesizer based not guitar based. The Cure musically were and are New Wave lyrically and visually proto Goth. New Order were techno innovators. The only reason for these two bands to be included are if you consider any post Velvet Underground genre alternative. If you make that case then KROQ and the Toronto station must be included. 4:00, 9, March 2006 (EK)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Cure is considered alternative rock because they are a <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_rock.html" title="Gothic rock">gothic rock</a> band, which is pretty straightforward criteria. They also have a fairly eclectic sound. They can be considered New Wave for only brief periods: their first album and the post-<i>Pornography</i> phase {"Let's Go to Be", "The Walk", "The Lovecats"). New Order are alternative because, even though they were a dance band, they approached dance music coming from a punk/post-punk/indie perspective, while still emphasizing their rock side on certain tracks. They were also probably the most high-profile and successful <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_%28music%29.html" title="Indie (music)">indie</a> band in Britain in the 80s, being the flagship band for <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_Records_1e23.html" title="Factory Records">Factory Records</a>. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:07, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is not to say that just because a radio station plays The Cure or New Order means they play "alternative rock". "Blue Monday" is the best-selling 12" single of all time, after all, and like you satid New Order is commonly considered a dance band by those who know litle about the band itself (which is common since they rarely gave interviews in the 80s). Both bands in the mid-to-late 80s fit comfortably on New Wave/modern rock radio playlists like KROQ while still receiving heavy rotation on college radio. If anything they were the more mainstream examples of early alternative rock at a time when it was almost exclusively uderground. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:24, 9 March 2006 (UTC).

<p>I found a book in my archives call "Rock Yearbook 1985" which provided an in depth review of 1984. There was an article called "The Declaration of the Independents" by David Fricke which analyzed the emerging underground American guitar rock scene. Here are some quotes relevant to this discussion "Consider the dee-jay on Los Angeles pionerring KROQ-FM last year took a break from the stations usuall diet of English synth-pop and cheap novelty records (howsabout a band called Killer Pussy?) to play taste of The Dream Synicate's Halloween from The Days of Wine and Roses. After only 30 seconds , he bruskly yanked the needle off the record and announced with misguided pride 'I like to give local bands a chance, but this is rediculous. You won't be hearing any more of that band on this station' ". "MTV relegates alternative rock videos like REM's dreamlike Radio Free Europe to the 4am graveyard shift". And from The Year in Music - Rock article by Adam Sweeting "the drab New Order" "These faceless artisons managed to lodge the impenatrably forgettable Blue Monday into the UK charts for months end" "New Order remain one of the great unsolved crimes". Notable from above. 1. You were correct about KROQ 2. The term "Alternative" was in use by 1984 3. The New Order quotes shows how much history really does change prespective 3:45, 10 March 2006 (EK)</p>

<dd>I don't have much free time either (or tech-savvy) so hopefully when I start up the Alternative Wikiproject in the next day or so someone can sign up for it. Your choices are great, but I'd trade "How Soon Is Now?" for "What Difference Does it Make?" or "This Charming Man" (which is already on the Smiths article page) since even fans and critics agree that "How Soon is Now?" is in no way representative of the band's style. I also think a Husker Du song from <i>New Day Rising</i> and onwards might work better, since "Something I Learned Today" still is very much a hardcore track.</dd>

<dd>Admittedly, "How Soon Is Now?" is representative of The Smiths style, but it is one of those alt songs that stands out as an icon of the genre. And I chose "Something I Learned Today" as it shows the movement from hardcore to alt (as the song is, IMO, halfway between the two genres).</dd>
<dd>I like your choices for The Replacements, Pixies, and Dinosaur Jr. All 3 bands should be included as they are amongst the most important 80s alt bands. The others seem like good choices too, though I'm not sure all of them need to be added. What we need mainly is samples of the most important bands and bands that represent a variety of different subgenres.</dd>
<dd>I think what you should work on for now is giving finding a justification for each band that you want to add. If they you can't find a reason for them to be considered important or representative of a subgenre, then you can throw them to the side for now. This at least seems like a good place to start with determining what we should and shouldn't include. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 16:39, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For Husker Du, I was thinking "Celebrated Summer" would be a way more effective song for the same point, because it alternates between fast intense verses and quiet acoustic breaks, making explicit the contrast and symbolically tearing down hardcore and helping give birth to alternative in the process. It's also quite acclaimed.</dd>

<dd>I was thinking of picking a band each from major subgenres, but that won't necessarily work since a band might not have great influence or importance on alt-rock as a whole outside of its genre. I was thinking about that when trying to think of a Britpop song to list (which is why I settled on "Supersonic" because it has loud "indie" guitars). That's why it's better to choose The Cure over Bauhaus or The Sisters of Mercy. Luckily some bands have a huge influence on a number of subgenres, like the Smiths, Sonic Youth, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and R.E.M., or are hugely important to the development of alternative as a whole, such as Husker Du, the Replacements, and Nirvana, or are very visible and successful examples of alternative rock that cannot be associated with any one particular subgenre, like Smashing Pumpkins and Radiohead <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:23, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During the early 1990s, several black artists were labeled "alternative" just because they played music that most black people didn't play at that time. Living Colour was heavy metal &amp; blues mixed, but got labelled alternative. Tracy Chapman played folk but was called alt. These are just two examples of the odd categorization that black musicians were put into if they didn't play pop, r&amp;b, or rap. None of those mislabelled based their music in punk, which was the defining characteristic of alternative. Still, the mainstream music industry still gave them this label to cash in on alt's popularity.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'd like to mention that I'm removing Alternative hip-hop from the genre list. It's not punk-based, and thus is only connected to this music form by its name. I'll move it to the See also section, though, since the name at least gives a reason to footnote it. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:55, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The alternative hip-hop label occurs mainly because it was an "alternative" to mainstream hip-hop (read: gangster rap) at the time; I don't think it was necessarily meant to refer to alternative rock. Unlike alternative metal and alternative dance, which have "alternative" in the name because they meld alternative rock proper with other genres. It might be wise to put a short sentence in the alt hip-hop page about the context of the name. We probably don't need to link it here.</dd>

<dd>On a related note, I've long wondered if we should add <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_country.html" title="Alternative country">alternative country</a> to the list, since the "alt. country" movement has revolved around such undisputedly alternative/indie bands like <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Tupelo_872a.html" title="Uncle Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a> and its spinoff groups <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilco.html" title="Wilco">Wilco</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_Volt_62fa.html" title="Son Volt">Son Volt</a>.

<p>While that rewrite is certainly bad, I have been thinking of reworking the article for a long time. Primarily, I mean creating a detailed history of alternative rock split along national lines, so there's a section on American alternative rock and British alternative, followed by the rest of the world. This is precipitated by my noticing that while the overview starts with an all-encompassing view it becomes US-centric by the time it talks about Nirvana's breakthrough. Plus it's couldn't hurt to try and gived a detailed history of alt-rock, which really doesn't exist anywhere.

<p>Do we have any sources from the 80s that veirfy that the term has been used back then? In my memory the term was only widely used after the Nirvana revolution increased interest in formerly independent acts enough so that lots of them signed up with major label and got listed on mail order clubs like BMG or Columbiahouse. Of course they couldn't use "indie" since it implied independent label, so the used alternative as a replacement. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 03:00, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you scroll up on the Talk Page, you'll see a reference from 1984. "Alternative" is certainly in use by 1989 when New Order, PiL, and the Sugarcubes go out on the "Monsters of Alternative Rock" tour. By 90-91 it's pretty common (relatively speaking). For example, the <i>Guitar World</i> article on the first Lollapalooza from Summer 1991 uses the phrase "alternative rock".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, keep in mind a lot of the major alt-rock bands of the late-80s/early 90's were already signed to major labels when Nirvana broke through. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 09:44, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's the precise difference? It strikes me that a lot of bands who would nowadays be "alternative", e.g. <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_%28band%29.html" title="Television (band)">Television</a> were called punk at the time, and would have been known as New Wave in the late 70s, early 80s, and alternative in the late 80s to present. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 14:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>How hard it is to define New Wave and how that definition has changed over the years is dealt with in the New Wave article and discussion page. As I mentioned in the New Wave discussion page I have a broad view of what is New Wave. That said from what I see A Flock of Seagulls would be considered the prototypical New Wave band from a 2006 perspective. Differences would be Alternative would more rock to New Wave’s pop. Alternative would be more guitar driven (how would Industrial fit into this?). New Wave fashion and hair styles would be more colorful. Again not that I really agree with this but this seems the most common view. 02:32, 12 June 2006 (EK)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In general "New Wave and "alternative" refer to two very different things. New Wave is post punk (in the broad sense) music that emerged right after punk rock (around '78 or so) that often was very successful. Alternative rock came a bit later, mainly out of post-punk (the genre) and hardcore, and was mainly underground. Some bands are considered both New Wave and alternative, but not a lot really. Off the top of my head I can think of The Cure, New Order, XTC, and maybe a few others. They really have no direct evolutional connection like alternative has with hardcore and post-punk, where the bands start off in those styles and then become alternative. I suppose the main difference between the genres is that in the 80s New Wave was played on commercial stations like KROQ but you could only find alternative on college radio. That, and alternative by and large revolves around the guitar. <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Reynolds_8cae.html" title="Simon Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> in his recent book on post-punk writes in the afterword about how post-punk and New Wave were relatively futurist (particularly in the use of synths) while the alternative/indie rock that began to emerge in the early 80's was more about rejecting the contemporary music mainstream usually by way of incorporating influence from the past. There's a paragraph where he defines R.E.M. and the Smiths as "the most important alt-rock bands of the day" by how they embraced the guitar and recalled the past through various ways. Once I get that book back from a friend I'm going to work in some references from it, even though the space he devotes directly to alternative rock in the book is less than ten pages.</dd>

<p>I agree completely with EK. MTV was instrumental in breaking bands such as Inxs, Duran Duran, and of course "Video Killed the Radio Star," Boy George, Thompson Twins, Devo, which can be considered new wave bands, and played them over and over all day long. I think it would be useful to list New Wave and the mainstreaming of New Wave as a major, if not THE precursor to the mainstreaming of Alternative. In this case, MTV plays a vital role.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not so sure MTV played that big of a role that early on. MTV didn't really help alt rock until after Nirvana got big, as they were still backing hair metal as the big thing in rock until then. They may claim otherwise, but they are known to lie (for instance, they'd like you to forget the racist policies they implimented in the pre-"Thriller" days, and that they didn't get rid of them until Jackson's label complained).

<dd>I did not forget MTV racist past but it is irrelevant to the question of what role MTV had or did not have in “breaking” alternative rock. But like them or not MTV was responsible for video being a major force in breaking new acts in the 80’s (which video is not today also in part due to MTV). You can argue correctly that college radio had these acts “first” and that 120 minutes had a very limited audience due to it’s being relegated to the “cult” timeslot of Midnight to 2AM Sunday Night/Monday morning. But college radio also had a limited audience and 120 minutes played bands shortly after college radio discovered them. Some people listened to college radio and had 120 minutes reinforce their interest in certain bands. Others first saw these bands on 120 minutes. We can debate how big a role MTV had but I do it think it had enough of a role in the early days to a least get a mention in the article. As for after Nirvana VJ Kennedy was almost as big a cultural figure for a few years as Nirvana and Pearl Jam (who musical style I think is more 70’s hard rock then alternative or grunge). She probably does not belong here but in the alternative culture article. 14:44, 15 July 2006 (EK)</dd>

<dd>Certainly <i>120 Minutes</i> is a notable component in the history of alternative rock, but I really don't think it had much to do with "breaking" alternative into the mainstream. Certainly it was one of the only venues you could catch a lot of this music outside of college radio. But then again, it waws pretty much a late-night ghetto, kind of like a low-key "Headbanger's Ball". Alternative artists were <i>expected</i> to be played on <i>120 Minutes</i>. From what I recall, <i>Come As You Are</i> mentions that while the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" video had a world premire on <i>120 Minutes</i>, the real breakthrough was when the video started showing up in MTV's regular rotation. When alternative hit it big, then <i>120 Minutes</i> was in the perfect position to capitalize on it. If it is added to the article, it warrants just a brief mention. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 20:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do agree with the brief mention and will put it in the "Overview" section. I think we have had in this debate a miscommunication on what I meant by "breaking" alternative acts.

It was supplanted by nu metal and pop punk in mainstream prominence at the time. There were a number of articles saying alternative was dead or rock was dead at the time; MTV and <i>Guitar World</i> even eliminated their categories for alternative rock in awards ceremonies around 1999. Still, that paragraph could probably use a rewrite. Someone added it a while ago and I pretty much left it alone since it covered a period that hadn't been addressed before. But certainly people have been talking about a revival of alternative rock in the last few years, from that SPIN magazine article I referenced to the emergence of "Classic alternative" radio formats. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 20:56, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Has returned to the mainstream". In the years 1997 thru 2002 alternative music did not go through a radical overhaul in style and continued to chart thus presenting an argument against that statement. But those years will be remembered as the Boyband, Britney Spears era and the last four years will be remembered for the post punk, new new wave revival or whatever you want to call it which is an argument for that statement. 15:28, 16 July 2006 (Ed Kollin)</p>

<p>I am placing this article's GA nomination on hold for seven days, because while it has no problems that I consider showstoppers, it needs some fixing. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article needs a thorough copyedit for proper grammar.</li>
<li>The lead paragraph tells us that "alternative rock" is made up of bands, but later says it is a genre, made up of other genres. I don't think it adequately defines the term or introduces the concept of sub-genres within a large genre.</li>
<li>Consider renaming "Overview" to "History".</li>
<li>There are sections for alternative rock in the US and the UK. It didn't exist anywhere else? Even if there is nothing significant to cover, at least include a paragraph concerning alt rock's effects in other countires.</li>
</ul>

<p>The way that the sound samples are scattered throughout the article seems to be a bad stylistic choice. It makes editing the article a bit more confusing for newcomers, and pushes around the text in ways that are asthetically unpleasing to the eye. It'd probably be best if we just put all of them in their own section. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 21:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the concept is understandable, but I think it could have been better implemented. For one, the US song box should have been at the top of the section, and not touching the rest of the text. Also, I personally don't like having anything left-aligned in articles; it seems more natural for the text to be on the left side of a box (as English is read left to right). The UK box is a similar situation. It also wouldn't hurt to add the other 3 samples to those two boxes, as being separated looks odd and gives no explaination for why it is that way. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:11, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole touching the text part is another result of performing the edit while on this computer; I looked at the page on another computer today and saw your edit looked fine. So yeah, my bad. As for the separate sound clips, I tried to arrange the clips in each section in order to provide context, so for example the British alt-rock clips roughly correspond to each paragraph (goth, Smiths-inspired indie rock, shoegaze, Britpop, and 2000s indie rock). While I tried to give equal weight to each facet of alternative rock and its history, I think we can all pretty much agree most notable alt-rock came out in the late 80s and 1990s. So rather than shove clips by Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins into the sections (bands that are quite notable in alternative rock as a whole but in a sense redundant if the clips were placed alongside the Pixies and Nirvana ones), I just placed them at the bottom as a sort of "additional listening". I was also thinking about replacing the Cure clip with Bauhaus' "Bela Lugosi's Dead" (the song no one argues <i>isn't</i> a goth song) and putting a later Cure song like "In Between Days" or "Just Like Heaven" in the section at the bottom, since that's when they became really popular (trivia: <i>120 Minutes</i> voted the "Just Like Heaven" video the greatest alternative video ever). A New Order clip was another consideration; there were a few dancey strains of alternative in the 80s that should probably be represented and while New Order is a major band from that period (best-selling 12" single of all time, even if it is technically a techno song), they were largely separate from the major trends. It's kind of annoying how idiosyncratic some alternative bands can be, and how they sometimes don't fit into clean-cut categories like grunge or shoegaze or indie pop, which I guess is part of the purpose of the section at the bottom. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 06:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everything about MTV and KROQ mentioned applies to this station. By the 1982-1985 period New Order was in heavy rotation as was the Cure and The Smiths by the end of the period. REM got it's share of airplay. Long Island has three million people living there and the station was listened to in next door New York City because the commercial rock stations there at the time were album oriented rock 01:39, 24 July 2006 (Ed Kollin)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing against the station. Just that in the process of reorganizing the section I felt that bit was unnecessary and made the paragraph too long. The paragraph says "Most commercial stations ignored the genre", which implies there was some sort of presence somewhere anyway. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 11:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>== The article has several inaccuracies and gives the short-shrift where commercial radio is concerned. KROQ, WLIR, and KQAK, alone, defined alternative music for millions of people prior to even 1985. When KITS came on in 1986, it was a ratings monster from the start. WFNX went full-time alternative in 1985. WOXY came into being in 1983; WHFS was playing the Jam as far back as 1979, and there are plenty more.--FemmyV 17:59, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>KROQ played mainly synthpop, New Wave, and post-punk through most of the 80s; you can check out their year-end countdowns here on Wikipedia as proof as this. The thing is a lot of things have been labeled alternative, but if you actually trace the roots of a lot of styles and bands a cleaer picture of what is and what isn't of the genre becomes clearer; some of what people might consider alternative rock during the 80s is often skewed towards what got commercial airplay during the day, when the roots of the alt-rock breakthrough in the 90s actually come from bands that were very underground. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This maybe hard to ask, it is my favorite genre of music, but isn't Alternative Rock dying out of style. To me Alternative Rock seemed to be at its peak from 1991 to around 2001. It seems to me that Alternative Rock is starting to fade away as <b>Nu Metal</b>, <b>Rap-Pop</b>, and <b>New Wave</b> Music are taking over the Top-40 charts. Shouldn't there be a new genre to categorize the newer Alternative Rock bands, maybe a <b>Post-Alternative Rock</b> genre because the newer bands don't really fit the style of '90s alternative Rock.

<dd>OK! I Googled it and a lot of bands claim to be Post-Alternative Rock. However I can't seem to find any solid evidence that it is a real term or if they've just made it up, most are in the indie scene. Some Alt-Rock from the '90s came up such as the band Cake, but I believe they are too early to be in that category. 2002 seems to be the year coined that Post-Alternative hit big with "Swing, Swing" by the All-American Rejects and "Curbside Prophet/The Remedy" by Jason Mraz. But again those two examples are just my opinion...Does anyone know of any major bands claiming to be Post-Alt Rock because that would be enough proof to star an article??? <a href="http://www.rockerie.com/thescene/bands/128/" class="external text" title="http://www.rockerie.com/thescene/bands/128/" rel="nofollow">Welker, a band I believe fits the idea of Post-Alt.

<p>I'm not so sure about the term meriting a page. It would have to fit the notability guidelines in Wikipedia, such as appearing frequently in print, being listed on site like Allmusic.com, being described, etc. I myself have never heard the term, or any talk about "post-alternative" music. In addition, many critics are currently talking about a resurgence in alternative rock.

<p>I started a rough draft page for Post Alternative Rock. User:Tigerghost/Post-Alternative Rock. It is in need of sources before it actually becomes a page though. And also it would be nice if this does become an article because it could finally find a home for the punk pop and Rock pop articles. Many don't believe that Punk-pop and Rock-Pop fit the criteria for the Rock or Punk genres, so this might ease the conflict between them. And to the responses of WesleyDodds, I really like Alternative Rock and <i>Post-Alternative Rock</i>. I don't think that <i>Post-Alternative</i> has the same feel as Alt-Rock of the '90s. That is why I think <i>Post-Alt</i> should be a sub-category of Alt-Rock...not a death point for it. But I do agree, I must have solid evidence before creating a page. I have also added indie-rock as a sub-genre. (<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerghost_e638.html" title="User:Tigerghost">Tigerghost</a> 09:04, 7 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>No. <i>Post-Alternative Rock</i> echoes Glam Metal. It isn't considered it. An echo is never the same as its source, similar, not the same. The point is that Alt-Rock from this decade is still considered Alt-Rock. Alt-Rock from the '90s sounds very different from Alt-Rock from the '00s. <i>It is too broad</i> is the point i'm getting at. They don't have to call it Post-Alt. All they need is to clarify better between '90s Alt Rock and '00s Alt Rock. 00's Alt Rock needs to a have a more universally excepted name like Grunge was. Rock pop is not the basic idea though because back in the late '90s, Alt-Rock was Rock Pop.(<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerghost_e638.html" title="User:Tigerghost">Tigerghost</a> 12:27, 7 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>The thing is alternative rock by its nature is broad. It's just pretty much with Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins and others during the 90s it got a reputation in the public eye for primarily being music with loud, distorted guitars, ironic lyrics, and tons of angst. Pretty much what defined alt-rock during the 80s (when it was also called College rock and indie) was that it was music that developed as a result of punk rock in the indie scene that was restricted to the underground. Sonic Youth, The Replacements, The Smiths, Kate Bush, Half-Japanese, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Cocteau Twins and hundereds more could sound and did sound completely different from one another and still were alternative rock. And a lot of popular alt-rock right now (Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, etc.) still has noticable ties to alt-rock before it. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe this article could include some more information on the precursors of underground and alternative music. While it did represent a clear break from everything else that was going on in the seventies, alternative music owes a lot to 60s underground music such as The Velvet Underground, the 13th Floor Elevators, Iggy Pop, Love (RIP Arthur Lee, aug. 2006) and Syd Barrett (RIP July 2006). ­74.56.146.147 11:15, 7 August 2006 (UTC)Bububu</p>

<dd>Thought about it, but it would be kind of hard to write about them since they're not all influential over a huge swath of alt-rock (sure Sonic Youth and the Sisters of Mercy pray at the altar of Iggy, but it's certainly not universal) and many are a step removed from being direct influences on the genre (that extra step being <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a>).

<p>Until Nirvana broke, alternative included everything from cowpunk to psychedelia to (some) dance music. What many are calling "British New Wave" of the mid-1980s - New Order, The Cure, XTC, were - at that time - initially called "New Music," or "Cutting Edge" (after the MTV show hosted by Peter Zaremba). "Alternative" came around 1986 or so, when radio trade publications finally settled on a name for the format. The harder bands that many seem to think define "alternative," were merely one spoke on a huge wheel.</p>

<dd>From the Preface: <i>This book began as an almost successful attempt to review all of the significant albums with a direct connection to new wave music - records that either directly led to or resulted from the 1976-1977 upheaval spearheaded by the Clash, the Sex Pistols, Ramones, Television, Blondie, etc (Although it came to be - and remains - a derisive designation for watered-down bands who affected hip style but were bland enough for American pop radio, "new wave" was originally a general and non-judgemental description of bands upsetting the norm in the late '70s.)</i></dd>
<dd><i>... While dance music has, in the past, fallen outside of the stylistic framework of this book, there's no getting around it's current dominance* - so much more so now than during the disco era - of the pop life. In light of the Manchester rave scene, the rise of DJ/performers, industrial music and, of course, hip-hop, the '80s proved that rock 'n' roll and dance music can't escape each other.</i></dd>

<ul>
<li>At the time the 1991 edition came out, there had also been a huge alternative dance scene, for some years, in clubs that would book bands like RHCP, Miracle Legion, Scruffy, etc. and have DJs on off-nights.</li>

<dd>From the Preface: <i>The publication of this book's fourth edition at the end of 1991 was precipitously if not propitiously timed. The exploding success of Nirvana's <b>Nevermind</b> made "alternative music" a household term and attracted an enormous audience to music once thought to be permanently outside the putative mainstream.</i></dd>
<dd><i>... Furthermore, the connection of this decade's developments to the music that first kicked down some of the corporate business barricades and opened the DIY doors for business led to the inevitable conclusion that the '90s were shaping up as a clear and distinct era, with <b>Nevermind</b> conveniently serving as the inaugural message of Lollapaloozalot.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alternative Music had everything to do with creating an audience and a ready-made market for Alternative Rock. If alternative music fans hadn't accepted Jane's Addiction, there wouldn't have been a door for Nirvana to kick in. By eliminating an Alternative Music page in favor of an Alternative Rock page, you're saying that one movement that was part of a wide genre (most Alternative fans in the mid-80s through early '90s resisted the wide use of subcategories) became the genre, itself. --FemmyV 20:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're confusing a format commonly referred to as "alternative music" (better known as <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_rock.html" title="Modern rock">modern rock</a>) with a specific genre. The genre known as alternative used to be called "college rock" in the US and "indie" in the UK during the 80s; alternative/modern rock radio was the most receptive radio format to the music as the 80s wore on. And as far as I've seen when talking about a genre, "alternative rock" and "alternative music" have been largely interchangeable. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another thing: there's a few encyclopedias of alternative music out that while are very useful for individual biogrpahical information, <i>really</i> stretch the boundaries of the term in the genre sense, often including the Velvet Underground, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Big Star, punk, and any music considered "left of center". Past attempts to chronicle the history of alternative rock have tried to construct a history of the genre without noticing two things: one, the genre's immediate roots are a result of the enviroment created in the aftermath of punk, post-punk, and hardcore; and two, alternative rock often references music from the past, including the Velvet Underground. I mean, look at all the revival movements: jangle pop, Paisley Underground, the entire Creation Records roster (set up with the philosophy of mixing psychedelia with punk rock), the garage rock revival, Britpop, post-punk revival, etc. Reynold's afterword in his book is primarily devoted to pointing this out, in contrast to the "futurism" of post-punk and New Pop. As he says "'Alternative' defines itself as pop's other" so a lot of what goes on in the genre (such as R.E.M.'s murky folk-isms and grunge's deconstructed metal) are oppositions to what's going on, usually by recalling old sounds and recontextualizing them. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 23:52, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have brought up some interesting points, though. I think the distinction that must be made isn't between "alternative rock" and "alternative music" (especially considering a lot of people simply say "alternative") but between the word and what it is describing. One thing I've personally wondered for a while is where the term "alternative" in regards to music came from and when it was coined; the earliest references I've personally seen are no older than 1989. If you have the sources, we could add an etymology section to the article, like <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">Punk rock</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a> have. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 00:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yep it is difficult. Unlike punk which arrived overnight the transformation form post punk/new wave to alternative was so gradual that only by looking back from 2006 can you see it happening.

<dd>They also play The Clash and The Jam. Love both bands, by the way. That's why it's good not to rely on programming (radio or TV) to determine the scope of a genre. After all, their goal is to play whatever certain people want, not to categorize and analyze the music. They help from a reference point of view, but mainly for context, not outright definition. Spending a few hours the other week looking at radio websites' histories and essays on the alternative/"modern rock"/"New rock" (there was a station site that actually argued that all music played on modern rock stations is called "new rock" now, and is all the same genre) they play found while searching for info through Google was kind of depressing from the viewpoint of this recently-graduated history minor.</dd>

<dd>The shift to alternative should probably be worked in to a broader scope in the Overview. Like you said, alt-rock came about gradually. Some early alternative bands like R.E.M., the Smiths, and Bauhaus emerged pretty fully-formed, but many others like Husker Du, the Replacements, The Cure, the Banshees, Meat Puppets, New Order, X, and so forth were punk, post-punk, hardcore, or New Wave before they changed their styles. A recurring theme I have found among all these bands in my reading is dissatisfaction with the limits of punk and trying to expand beyond them. But it's pretty hard to say at any point "alternative rock started <i>here</i>". It's still too amorphous a genre, compared to other types of rock like punk and heavy metal. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 00:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Definitely they're an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_pop.html" title="Indie pop">indie pop</a> band, but the important distinction is the "indie" part: the band's existence as an essential component of the 80s indie scene. And no matter how pop they were, Morrissey's lyrics were not typical pop fare, talking about veiled homosexuality, politics, child molestation, depression, Oscar Wilde, etc. The majority of British alternative bands drew influence from the Smiths, and that continued with Britpop. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 18:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the infobox claims that the genre only experiences limited popularity, while almost all of todays' mainstream rock bands are or could be described as "alternative" (look into green, afi, blink 182, bands like that). thus, alternative rock is tremendously popular. how do we define the genre so that it is only marginally popular? 67.172.61.222 19:55, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the term "alternative" is almost all-encompasing, though, almost no modern rock band could not be considered alternative. it is very popular and just because there are a lot of underground bands doesn't diminish that. even the article itself says that the term is used to describe mainstream rock in the new millenium. 67.172.61.222 03:20, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Er, no. For example, Linkin Park, The Darkness, and blink-182 aren't alternative rock bands, just to name three random examples that appear on modern rock radio. Right now it certainly has a mainstream presence, but it's not dominant like it was during the 90s. The article is saying that "alternative" has been used indiscriminately at times, not necessarily that everything belongs under the label. And for every band that breaks through there have been many more who remain underground, to the point where entire alt-rock subgenres have been underground or only gained exposure with a freak hit. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 07:05, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anybody else think we should include a section about the ambiguity of term today. I mean, you have bands as dissimilar as Coldplay and Nickelback being put under that umbrella. What are the stylistic characteristics of an "alternative" song? It's got to be one of the most confusing terms around.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's always been ambiguous and amorphous. Back in the 80s bands as dissimilar as Sonic Youth and The Smiths were alternative. In the 90s bands as dissimilar as Blur, Nine Inch Nails, and Primus were. As the article currently says, there are no set guidelines to an alternative song. However, the subgenres are a little more defined (dspite what fans of particular bands might say, there are some common defineable traits that embody genres like grunge, goth, Britpop, shoegaze, etc.), so I've always found it easier to determine the boundaries of the genre by defining the subgenres. In the case of the two bands you mentioned, Nickelback is post-grunge and Coldplay grew out of the post-Britpop movement. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 12:27, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well we should refer in the article to how slippery a genre it is to nail down and admit that. Also "alternative" in the UK was largely supplanted by "indie" as a term in the late 80s. And there are some journalists/commentators who have now admitted that "indie" (nee alternative) is now dead and not useful as a term. Agreed that the subgenres make sense. this is partly because they were, mostly, of a limited time period. <a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemstone66_475c.html" title="User:Jemstone66">Jem</a> 08:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Alternative" stopped being useful as a genre classification about a decade ago, actually. No band that emerged at <i>any</i> time in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a> should be categorized or described as "alternative", because they just <i>aren't</i>. Neither Nickelback nor Coldplay are actually "alternative"; for one thing, what on earth is there for them to be an alternative to? The <i>only</i> reason "alternative" is still used by some as a genre label, in fact, is that there hasn't been a new genre that's come to <i>dominate</i> rock music the way alternative did — so people still think in terms of "alternative". But what's important to remember is that alternative is defined first and foremost by <i>the parallel existence of another rock genre for alternative rock to <b>be</b> an alternative to</i> — so any rock band, such as Nickelback or Coldplay, that exists <i>within</i> the rock establishment, rather than on the outside kicking down the doors, <i>cannot</i> be alternative. Not even if it's strongly influenced by bands that <i>were</i> alternative. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:22, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must object to the following sentences:</p>
<p><i>During the 1990s, many artists who did not fit the "alternative" label were nonetheless given it by mainstream record labels in the hopes of capitalizing on its popularity. Some pop musicians, such as <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanis_Morissette_39bf.html" title="Alanis Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hootie_%26_the_Blowfish_a64c.html" title="Hootie &amp; the Blowfish">Hootie &amp; the Blowfish</a> were given the label on the basis of nuanced differences from other pop artists.</i></p>
<p>I think there is a pretty strong consensus that Alanis's music from the mid- to late-'90s is alternative rock. The idea that it's just pop marketed as alternative is absurd. It may be more pop-oriented than, say, Nirvana, but the alt-rock roots are fairly unmistakable, especially in songs like "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_Oughta_Know_4b53.html" title="You Oughta Know">You Oughta Know</a>." I can't remember anyone ever classing Hootie as alternative.

<dd>There's no consensus that Alanis was ever "alternative" in any meaningful way (and even if there had been one, it would be wrong).
