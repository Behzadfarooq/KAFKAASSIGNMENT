<p>This is even better than radical anti-speciesism! Now i can call people 'Carbonists'! --MichaelTinkler</p>
<p>This article gives the impression that 'carbon chauvinists' believe that carbon is the only possible basis for life solely because that is what life is based on on Earth. I would think most 'carbon chauvinists' would hold that only carbon-based life is possible, not just because that is how life is on Earth, but also because carbon based compounds are more common in the universe in general, and they form more easily and are more versatile than silicon-based compounds. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/SJK_88ad.html" title="SJK">SJK</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, is it really <i>chauvenism</i> if the person has a good, solid reason for his or her bias?&#160;:)</p>
<hr />
<p>I would say it is too narrow-minded to say only carbon based life form is possible because we could only find carbon based life form on earth. The condition on earth probably could only support carbon based life because of the atmospheric temperature, pressure and oxygen in the air. It is not impossible that there are organisms in other worlds that breath chlorine or hydrogen sulphide or swim in a ocean of molten lava or liquid hydrogen.</p>
<p>Imagine this. When a carbon based life form jumps into a pool of magma in a volcano, it just burns to ash and dies. When a silicon based life form (assuming there were one) leaves the confine of the magma, it just solidifies and dies too. No scientist can enter the magma and survive, then how can anyone disprove the possiblity that non-carbon based life exists in the center of the earth? Likewise for hostile world such as venus, or even the core of a star, there may be life forms that we don't and will never recognize.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a *REALLY* important point. It ought to be made in the article. We ought to accept our vast ignorance of how life on earth works. For instance until a few years ago the existence of deep-ocean-bottom life forms near volcanic vents that used <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemosynthesis.html" title="Chemosynthesis">chemosynthesis</a> for energy rather than the sun's <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthesis.html" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> was unknown. This was good old fashioned regular right handed DNA life, right up to clams and crabs (pretty damn high up the chain), but the genus are distinct, and all the energy comes out of the volcanic vent not from the sun. This would have been considered fantasy just 10 years ago.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Pretty good integration, *but*:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is already an article on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_life.html" title="Artificial life">artificial life</a> so this section should be retitled</li>
<li>most people refer to a 'clanking replicator' as a <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robot</a>, or would if they met one</li>
<li>the initial example of creation-by-intelligence listed carbon nanotubes as the basis, which is sstill carbon (and of course can be used structurally and for computing as well, depending ont he type, so maybe this should be mentioned in the carbon section?) - it's not as clear now that intelligence required to build a "clanking replicator" could be ANY oif the above forms on ANY planet.</li>
</ul>
<p>- trying not to be a Carbonist</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "artificial life" section of this article is focused on the context of non-carbon biochemistries, which is not the same as the existing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_life.html" title="Artificial life">artificial life</a> article. Likewise, a "clanking replicator" is a <i>subset</i> of robot; there are many robots which are not clanking replicators (in fact, all currently-existing robots are not clanking replicators). And finally, the fact that carbon nanotubes are indeed carbon is mentioned in the article; the reason for their inclusion is that it's a different _form_ of carbon than any known life currently uses. I don't think any of these points need major amendment. I'll add that intelligent life could construct life based on the other non-"machine" biochemistires as well, though. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There, just did a little tweaking. The "artificial life" section starts out with a very general paragraph which doesn't specify "machine-type" artificial life, and the ending paragraph "Scientifically, the relevance of this possibility is that high intelligence in a transition species may be the means by which an otherwise-impractical basis for life gets started, after which it can continue to evolve by more natural means." is also nonspecific, is that what you were after? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Shouldn't the section on artificial life mention possibility of non-material forms of life (such as those simulated in a computer) or at least state that it is dedicated only to material forms of life?</p>
<dl>
<dd>All forms of life are "material", and the use of the phrase "artificial life" or "genetic algorithm" for symbol processing are basically and utterly WRONG - a profound bias we should not introduce, and one we should not apologize for simply ignoring. Wait long enough, and the stupidity that passes for "genetic algorithm" or "artificial life" in software only will simply go away since it is irrelevant to genetics, or life. It just mirrors current biases about those.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Question: it is theoretically possible to simulate a live creature by simulating it down to every last atom. Is such simulation alive? Is it unethical to torture it? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 15:43 2 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Not because you can't do that to simulate life (assuming, for the sake of the exercise, that we have the technology to perform the exact duplication), but because at that point you don't have a <i>simulation</i> of life, you have life itself. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, fine, so there could be silicon-based life&#160;;) The next question is: at which level of simulation does the simulation become alive? Cellular? Tissue? Organs?</dd>

<p>But then, the entirety of the rest of the article is devoted to theoretical bases for life that are <b>not</b> carbon-based.</p>
<p>In other words, this article spends its entire time discussing the <i><b>opposite</b></i> of the title!</p>
<p>An article with this title should be spending its time explaining the basis of the belief that all life must necessarily be carbon-based, not the opposite.

<p>Renaming from <i>carbon chauvinism</i> to <i>non-carbon biology</i> is a good move in that it now accurately relects the actual content of this article. However, there are a large number of links in other articles pointing to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_chauvinism.html" title="Carbon chauvinism">Carbon chauvinism</a> which gets redirected here. Some of them seem to be looking to link to an article that describes non-carbon based life, but others refer to a supposed bias against the idea of non-carbon biology. The article on <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a> for instance has this statement:</p>
<p>"All life on Earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds. Some assert that this must be the case for all possible forms of life throughout the universe; others describe this position as '<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_chauvinism.html" title="Carbon chauvinism">carbon chauvinism</a>'."</p>
<p>Once the final status of this page is decided (for instance, merged with astrobiology) we might need to clean up some of these dangling links that refer to the old content of the article, since the context of the above link is now misleading. Personally, I think <i>carbon chauvinism</i> is a loaded term. It also seems to be rarely used. But, some wiki pages link to the term with the expectation that it will be defined. The term is even used in <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-carbon_biology.html" title="Non-carbon biology">non-carbon biology</a> itself without being defined:</p>
<p>"In addition to carbon compounds all currently known terrestrial life also requires water as a solvent. Although not strictly "carbon chauvinism" since water doesn't contain carbon, it is sometimes assumed that water is the only suitable chemical to fill this role and so similar issues apply."</p>
<p>This article (or wherever the content gets moved to) might benefit by mentioning the debate over the possibility of non-carbon based life. The article currently lacks arguments on why carbon based life is seen as most likely. There are a couple of interesting points in the [<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html" class="external text" title="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html" rel="nofollow">ET life FAQ</a>].</p>

<p><i>Finally, of the molecules identified in interstellar space as of 1998, 84 are based on carbon and 8 are based on silicon. Moreover, of the eight Si-based compounds, four also include carbon. This suggests a greater abundance of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos&amp;hellip</i></p>
<p>I question whether the above statement is accurate. Are we talking 84 individual molecules, or 84 <i>varieties</i> of molecules? If the latter is correct, which seems likely, then it does not suggest a greater <i>abundance</i>, but rather a greater <i>variety</i> of complex carbon compounds. It says nothing about abundance, which I suspect is most critical for providing adequate resources for life. If so, does anyone have data on what relative <i>abudances</i> are for carbon- and silicon-based molecules identified or theorized in interstellar space? -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 07:08, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The source is this, I believe: <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I'm sure it's referring to <i>varieties</i>, since there's no way to detect individual molecules. As for abundance, <a href="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/abund_uni.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/abund_uni.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> indicates that there's 3.5 times as much carbon in the universe as a whole as there is silicon - don't know if that's by mass or by moles. So it looks like both abundance <i>and</i> variety may be true. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:31, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bryan, thanks for the speedy and excellent references! I agree that <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html" class="external text" title="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html" rel="nofollow">[1</a>] suggests it's varieties and not abundance. I think <a href="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/abund_uni.html" class="external text" title="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/abund_uni.html" rel="nofollow">[2</a>], though, doesn't provide nearly the punch about abundance that the rest of the quoted passage above ("<i>… providing less of a foundation upon which to build silicon-based biologies</i>") implies. One might read it and think there aren't enough complex silicon-based molecules to bother about. I'm guessing that there are at least 2-3 orders of magnitude more mass contained in stars than there are in planets, but it's the tiny amount of planetary mass where we concentrate our search for life. Compared to that, a mere factor of 3.5 seems insignificant. It leaves an incredible amount of mass to harbor potential silcon-based life. (It doesn't change the other arguments, but this particular one probably shouldn't sound so strong.) -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 07:56, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, though since the FAQ link above is referring to the interstellar medium I suspect the universal abundances are more relevant than they would be if it was just planets.

<dd>I didn't mean to imply that planetary mass has anything to do with this question. I was just using the star/planet mass ratio to point out that two factors of the same order of magnitude are practically equal when one considers other astrophysical ratios. I was thinking that if the actual abundance of carbon molecules was several orders of magnitude more than those of silicon, I would be less inclined to look for silicon-based biochemistry, but with only a 3.5:1 ratio, they're practically even competitors. (Of course, this doesn't account for the other logical arguments presented in the article that favor carbon. It's just that this argument didn't sound very strong to me.) -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 17:31, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have changed the carbon - silicon cosmic abundance ratio to "roughly 10 to 1" rather than 3.5 to 1. Check <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/elcosmic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/elcosmic.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/abund.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/abund.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> . Also see this chart <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~gdg1/cosmicab.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humboldt.edu/~gdg1/cosmicab.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> which you can find in a lot of spots; C is clearly an order of magnitude greater than Si. I did find the 3.5 ratio once, <a href="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/abund_uni.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/abund_uni.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, which may be the source of the error. I only noticed this because I just set down a book (Faint Echoes, Distant Stars) which also lists the 10 - 1 figure. Anyhow, I'll take four sources ahead of one. Note too, that 10 to 1 corresponds to the 84 to 8 molecule ratio mentioned earlier in the paragraph.</p>
<p>Regarding the above discussion, an order of magnitude is an order of magnitude: carbon and silicon are not "even competitors" when it comes to abundance. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 07:36, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A single article or category should be created that encompasses all hypothetical extraterrestrial biospheres and biochemistry. Thus this article should either be edited to specify its name or be rename or moved to a better more generalized name.</p>
<p>This topic may fit better under <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrobiology.html" title="Astrobiology">Astrobiology</a> and could be placed as a sub-topic of astrobiology. If not then either move all the topics in this article that are not specifically related to non-carbon biology or rename the article to take into account those topics. For example replacement of water with ammonia or another fluid medium or the replacement of oxygen for biological oxidation reactions with another oxidizer (such as chlorine or sulfur compounds) is not strictly related to non-carbon biology and in most hypothesis and science fiction involving a biosphere with such differences carbon biology is still used. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerBen_3b13.html" title="User:BerserkerBen">BerserkerBen</a> 22:35, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>So Non-carbon lifeforms are simply out of the scope of Astrobiology as a contemporary science (or would-be science, depending on your POV) because it does not, in fact, try to study them much. That is one of its failures.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One the other hand, the Astrobiology article should clearly have something about the fact that there could be lifeforms of other kinds but that we just don't currently investigate them. Or maybe something about the assumptions of astrobiology researchers or something...

<dd>Er... nobody seems to care. I enriched and reorganized the Astrobiology quite a bit, and I do not think that non-carbon biology can fit in there. For one thing, it is maybe still bigger than astrobiology, so it would flood it.

<p>Fine enough but I still thin something needs to be done: Exotic solvent based life and exotic oxidizer utilizing life are usually referred to as carbon based, and the real life examples we have of such things are of course carbon based, having these topics under this title is a erroneous.

<dd>Ben is right that this article is still mis-labelled. It's basically Life as We Don't Know It rather than strictly Non-carbon biology. And Jules is right that this would swamp <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrobiology.html" title="Astrobiology">Astrobiology</a>. What about two smallish articles: Non-carbon biology and Non-aqueous biotic solvents? Anything not strictly related would not be included.

<p>I agree with the new name, it seems that it encompasses all that this article is and gives rise to some more expansion. Nobody seems to be thinking about merging this article with astrobiology anymore so I removed the ugly tag. The article has been renamed to something more inclusive already and nobody had a bad reaction to it (except, arguably, a strange declaration of love, but I guess that counts as positive&#160;;-) ) so I'm removing the tag from the Talk page, too.

<p>As I added my beloved Discworld trolls to the silicon-based life section (they brought me here in the first place) I reflected that I hadn't included them here in the first place because it didn't feel serious, but a Star Wars fan didn't have such qualms, so I couldn't resist anymore.</p>

<dd>I've looked into the feasibility of a boron biochemistry myself (albeit briefly). The trouble is that boron suffers from a very low cosmic abundance. It forms some interesting molecular cage structures though, and has a good ability to catenate, so it should be considered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Molybdenum and tungsten (amongst the other transition metals) pose other problems. They have excellent coordination and (in some cases) catenation ability, but transition metals tend not to form stable enantiomers -- in other words, D and L isomers will tend to flip back and forth. The inability to form stereospecific compounds may hamper their ability to form biomolecules</dd>

<dd>The rarity of Boron would lead to a rather interesting ecology, if a biochemistry is possible. Presumably life would evolve methods of concentrating boron compounds. Perhaps plant-analogues would form symbiotic relationships with small insect-sized creatures who would gather boron-rich materials, such as dead organisms and feces. At any rate, it seems to me that if life evolved beyond small unicellular organisms, it would have to concentrate in small "islands" of life surrounded by vast lifeless regions, as opposed to Earth, where life is essentially universal. These islands would also be rather isolated from each other, and would have to have some method of counteracting the forces of erosion which would otherwise tend to remove the crucial boron <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENik42_afcf.html" title="User:Nik42">Nik42</a> 06:47, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_biochemistry.html#Other_exotic_biochemical_elements" title="Alternative biochemistry">Other exotic biochemical elements</a> section of the main article chlorine is proposed as an alternative to oxygen. How can this be true? Chlorine is vastly different from oxygen. It generally accepts only 1 electron instead of 2 in bonds and is highly elecronegative. It is essential for oxygen to be able to establish covalent bonds with 2 other atoms. Chlorine can not do that. Also chlorine forms alot of ionic bonds and pulls electrons from other atoms. Explanation?!? --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisFromStockdale_4e98.html" title="User:BorisFromStockdale">BorisFromStockdale</a> 04:05, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I agree. Chlorine exhibits a lot of ionic character, making it's covalent bonds rather poor. However, on the other hand, the two elements aren't quite as different as might be immediately apparent. Chemically, Chlorine and oxygen have similar electronegativities (oxygen is also capable of forming ionic bonds and pulls electrons from other atoms), and the two are both capable of forming Van der Waals bonds. Granted, chlorine would be unable to play a directly analogous role. A Chloride (-Cl) group could emulate the functionality of a hydroxy (-OH) or ketone (=O) group, but not an ether (-O-).</dd>

<li>C6H1206 + Cl &lt;-&gt; CCl4 + H2O + 1207Kj/mol</li>
<li>C6H12O6 + O2 &lt;-&gt; CO2 + H2O + 2799Kj/mol</li>
<li>C6H12O6 &lt;-&gt; 3C02 + 3CH4 + 128Kj/mol</li>
<li>C6H12O6 &lt;-&gt; 2C2H50H + 2C02 + 64Kj/mol</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It just plug and chug ethalpies, glucose was used as the standard. Because the ethalpy values were all made under standard temp and pressure here on earth they might not very accurate on alien world with very diffrent pressures and tempatures. Also glucose might not be a common biomolecule especially on a halogen world where chloride might be in the place of oxygen. Even so I think the values give a descent estimate as to what the energetic would be. Numbers 5 and 6 are just methogenic and common fermentation here on earth which many simple single cell life forms live off with ease. Hydrogen would only provide 10 times as much energy as common fermentation, oxygen of course provides ~40 times as much, although aerobic metabolism in biochemistry is about 40% efficient and fermentation is about ~70% efficient, so in real life aerobic metabolism only provides about 20 times more energy then fermentation.</dd>

<dd>I've seen PNA before for use in DNA tags, the problem with it is that without the repulsion of the phosphates the tempature and energy needed to denature PNA double stands would be very high (not a problem for very high temperature environments) and thus the rate and energy needed for replication could be much higher. An advantage would be that nitrogen would be more abundant then phosphorus.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerBen_3b13.html" title="User:BerserkerBen">BerserkerBen</a> 00:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
