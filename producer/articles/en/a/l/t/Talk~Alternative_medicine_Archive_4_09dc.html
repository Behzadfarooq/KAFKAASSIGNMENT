<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a>. This article must be an encyclopaedia article, not a dispute between so called official medecine and Alternative medecine. It must be possible to be NPOV about this too and avoid nasty and void observations. One question which might help "What was 'official medecine' before a scientific base was given to it?" So a sort of continuum exists between official medecine and alternative medecine. Seeing it this way might make it easier to come on common ground.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Advocacy vs. Neutrality</span></h2>
<p>A lot of this discussion is missing the point. It seemns Mr. Natural Health is a an advocate of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a>, based on his website and his Wikipedia contributions.</p>
<p>But Wikipedia is not the place for proving that one's own cherished viewpoint is true -- or that's not it's <b>primary purpose</b>. We're supposed to be making general articles about subjects. Now, these articles often need to discuss the pros and cons of things -- but I don't like to see article development stalled because certain people want their cherished POV to predominate.</p>
<p>Let's go back to writing an article that explains what alternative medicine is:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it different from other forms of medicine, i.e., what is it an alternative TO?</li>
<li>Who is in favor of it, and why?</li>
<li>Who opposes it, and for what reasons?</li>
<li>What is its current legal status in various countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I hope that you CANNOT TELL MY OPINION of alternative medicine from my comments or edits; I have tried my best to practice what I preach here&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:49, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As ever, Uncle Ed, you talk sense. It seems to me that the problem here is that we have an advocate (or advocates) who cannot let go of their POV and who so need to stand back from the article.

<dd>Seems to me that you guys simply have not been able to articulate a logical argument about what is so wrong about a very legal practice called alternative medicine.

<p>It's not POV to say who is in favor or against something. It <b>is</b> permitted in the article.

<p>I added 2 items to the Support section, although they seem more like CM problems than AM support.</p>
<p>Someone might want to go in and clarify (it's kinda spread out and vague right now) that there are quacks and serious professional physicians on both sides of the fence, and that some of the AM fields have problems due to lack of a professional organization to set standards and certify knowledge/ability -- although lack could also be an indication of quackery.</p>
<p>While I believe that some AM is indeed quackery and/or placebo, I do also have concern that CM has problems.</p>
<p>After looking over this article, though, I suspect that NPOV is difficult. My suggestion at present would be to create a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventional_medicine.html" title="Conventional medicine">Conventional medicine</a> article, and move some of this article over there. The lack of such an article indicates (to me) an NPOV problem. The two items that I added aren't terribly relevant to AM; they are CM problems, not reasons to favor AM over CM. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 20:34, 2004 Feb 15 (UTC)</p>

At last we hear the voice of reason&#160;! The people has spoken&#160;! Unfortunately I could not write the relevant parts myself&#160;! Will have to wait and see, being hunted myself out of editing, and searched for under WANTED doctrines, complete with DNA fingerprints and iris scans. For I dared to challenge the local consensus about me not being a crack, as a MD <i><b>and</b></i> a five-star irismeister (alternative-towards-conventional bridge builder)&#160;:°) That's, I believe, a case study in the limits of Wiki editing. Things get heated once mr NH is in, and freeze to death once he's banned. Not healthy, methinks! Are we, the people, into debating sincerely, and writing truly great Wiki articles, or just into fighting each other's egos&#160;? Look at this page! Judging from the activity (once bursting to the point of page protection only to be less than calm now) it looks as if the purpose here were some witch hunt, not quality hunting!

<dd>Does the term 'conventional medicine' make any sense outside this context? Why isn't this just redundant with <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a>? If the stuff in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventional_medicine.html" title="Conventional medicine">conventional medicine</a> makes no sense outside the context of "alternative medicine", it should go here - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 09:05, Feb 18, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. Conventional meaning in general, and here in France <i>following an agreement with an accreditation body</i> , and since <i>everybody</i> must have an arrangement with at least some board in order to practice medicine, it surely makes no sense. So, redundant, you are right, it is or at least should be. This is an old issue, methinks. Hippocratic and Knidic medicine. Salernitan and Maimonidean, orthodox vs alternative, official vs underground, <i>quies custodiet ipsos custodes</i> (who certifies the certifiers) etc, etc. Hmm. it's really a hard choice&#160;!

<dd>It seems to me a bad precedent. We do not have an article "conventional chemistry" to contrast with "alchemy", for instance, or "conventional geography" to contrast with "flat earth", or "conventional engineering" to contrast with "building bridges out of cheese". Rather, the articles on chemistry and geography and engineering discuss chiefly the main line of scientific knowledge, while making reference to critics of the mainstream, "alternatives", and the like when they exist and have advocates whose positions can be described.</dd>

<dd>Medical doctors do not do "conventional medicine"; they do medicine -- just as astronomers do astronomy and engineers do engineering. There does, in fact, <i>exist</i> a mainstream of these disciplines, which Wikipedia articles can describe correctly as such. This mainstream is not arbitrary, not simply a matter of "convention", as the term "conventional <i>whatever</i>" implies. There also exist movements outside the mainstream, which Wikipedia articles can also describe -- but must make clear that this is what they are. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 17:56, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, if we agree to cut conventional medicine out, we relativize the alternative, by hanging it from the absolute pillar. It's also a dangerous precedent, but has the advantage of avoiding yet another bout of hard work in the conventional stub&#160;:-) Hmm, methinks I must still think&#160;!

<dd>"Alternative" is <i>always</i> relative, whether it's medicine or music. The word means, after all, a choice to be different -- which implies the question, <i>Different from what?</i> Different from the usual, the established, the well-understood -- experimental; dissident; revisionist. A new, unproven drug in clinical trials is, in one sense, "alternative medicine" after all -- it is an attempted <i>alternative</i> to whatever is the current standard treatment for an ailment.</dd>

<dd>Thus, there is no abiding set of "alternative" medicinal practices. Integrated over time, the term is null. However, there are things one can say about categories of medical practices. For instance, it is an attribute of today's "mainstream" medicine that it is considered by its practitioners and the general public to be tested according to the methods of physical science. Thus, with respect to <i>this</i> measure, we may locate: (1) medicinal practices whose advocates attempt to prove them scientifically to the medical community, but which have not been accepted by the medical community as proven yet: <i>experimental</i> medicines; (2) medicinal practices whose advocates consider them scientifically proven despite the opposition of the medical community: <i>dissident</i> medicines; and (3) medicinal practices whose advocates reject the standards of scientific testing, preferring standards such as faith or tradition: <i>non-scientific</i> medicines.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is, I suspect, the latter two categories and not the former which articles such as this attempt to discuss. However, the categories are not so clear as one might wish. That is a peril of attempting to write on the subject of "alternative medicine". One may consider the case of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypnosis.html" title="Hypnosis">hypnosis</a> illustrative; a practice which many in the public consider witchy and not scientific, but which appears to have some proven medical uses. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 00:46, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The above has the obvious gift of clarity. However, I doubt that the main attribute of medicine, even in today's pan-scientific context, is really <i>being scientific</i>. I know I raise more than a few eyebrows and I apologize in advance, in a sort of <i>captatio benevolentiae</i> . But medicine is (although less and less every day, I concede) an art too. A vanishing form of deep interactions which can hardly be described as only a specific difference (<i>definiendum</i> ) of the scientific "thing" (<i>definiens</i>) - this is no doubt an art. This traditionalistic point of view (again, <i>concedo</i> - this is indeed a declaration of bias) is not idealistic either. Stephen Jay Gould aptly named such <i>fringe</i> view on art-science no-man's lands something like, if I recall correctly, <b>magisterii</b>. Science is only the hard core of what we call <i>biomedicine</i> . However, clinical experience, intuition and even feelings in mainstream medicine still spell the difference between good and bad doctors. In the semiology and clinical <i>propaideia</i> I studied decades ago ( a mixture of hippocratic, knidic, salernitan, avicennic and maimonidean approaches to the nuts and bolts of the trade), we were encouraged to <i>taste</i> the patient, something that could bring us in prison these days... The bottomline is that <i>alternative</i> rapidly becomes the common final exit pathway for all these <i>shamanic</i> approaches. I could not possibly stress more my agreement on the idea that there is no such thing as an alternative attribute to medicine. There really is one and only one medicine - that medicine which is best for the patient's interest in a given case. We are heading towards the definition of alternative only as an instantiation of what the french invoke and exhort under the derogative name of <i>la logique comptable</i>. My final view is that perhaps our article here should include <b>Thus, there is no abiding set of "alternative" medicinal practices. Integrated over time, the term is null</b> - an absolutely perfect observation, in the body of text. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Conventional_medicine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Conventional_medicine" rel="nofollow">Kind request for more comments <b>here</b></a> Sincerely, <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 09:51, 2004 Feb 19 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Psychosocial treatment and life expectancy of cancer patients</span></h2>
<p>Vickers (2004) is far from persuasive about the advantage of psychosocial treatment in increasing life expectancy of cancer patients. He notes that "several studies do... <b>appear</b> to show survival advantages" [emphasis is mine], and goes on to say that one oft-cited study which found this result (Spiegel <i>et al.</i> 1982), has not been successfully replicated (Cunningham <i>et al.</i> 1998; Goodwin <i>et al.</i> 2001).</p>
<p>Evidence for the positive mental benefits of reduced pain and improved mood, however, seems far more convincing, and has been successfully replicated. - <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykReeve_0a97.html" title="User:MykReeve">MykReeve</a> 18:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My interest in that study was that it documented <b>psychosocial treatment</b> as a form of alternative medicine. As you may recall, once upon a time, a bunch of people were claiming that all this psyche stuff was not alternative medicine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is plenty of evidence that says that it does effect survival time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also like this quote:</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small>"<i><b>establishment of programs that provide complementary therapies at major cancer centers such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Dana-Farber, University of California at San Francisco, and MD Anderson.

<dd>If the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center uses complementary therapies because they work, what more need I say?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">False claims about Wikipedia policy by Mr-Natural-Health</span></h2>
<p>MNH claims, in edit summary, <i>"ALL reverts, even by RK, are not permitted because I am currently not banned."</i> This claim is false. Nothing in Wikipedia policy limits the reversion of edits to those done illegally by banned users. Reverting is used, by and large, when the harm caused by a given edit significantly exceeds its benefit, <i>well before</i> abuse reaches the point where a ban is necessary. MNH has already been banned once; in this light, making false &amp; misleading claims about Wikipedia policy should be grounds for further action. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 21:47, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
