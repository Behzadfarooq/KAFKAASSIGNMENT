<p>I think we should not adopt the tone of the newsgroup when describing it.</p>
<p>They refer to the labels they hand out as "awards" - reminiscient of the "Big Screw" award given out at MIT - like it's all in good fun.</p>
<p>But our article should emphasize that the recipient of the "kook" label might NOT take it so kindly.</p>
<p>Let's use words like <i>label</i> and <i>brand</i> in the article.</p>
<p>Also, the mere fact that the article is "protected" is no reason to revert my changes. The protection is against vandalism, not against ordinary changes made by a contributor in good standing. Please don't use "protection" to win an edit war. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 13:55, May 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you, Ed. While I'd prefer to see this person's name removed entirely, I'd go along with your compromise suggestion of rewording the context in which his name is used.

<p>To the anon editor(s), I've tried to argue for Wollmann's name to be deleted, but so far I've been outnumbered (though this is a wiki, so the situation could change). However, as things stand, the best I can achieve here is to make sure the context in which the name appears is NPOV. If you're around, can you say what information you would like to see added so that the reference to that name is fair and accurate? For example, we could add something about who Wollmann is (a very brief description) and how the award came to be made (also very brief). Please bear in mind that editors are not allowed to make legal threats if they want to continue editing, and if another revert war ensues, the page may be protected again. Many thanks, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:08, May 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Joost, we just had an edit conflict and I've overwritten some of your edits inadvertently. Now I'm not sure whether to add them back or what. I've edited in roughly the same direction as you. I've added the names of more award winners so the disputed name doesn't stand out so much, and have added a link to the award winners list, so people can see that it's not a serious thing in any way. I also added that the subscribers are anonymous. I felt a bit silly editing it, but I think it's slightly more NPOV now. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:42, May 6, 2005 (UTC)

And anyone who loves painting can't be all bad; I added a link to his art gallery (which is still the top hit for 'edmond wollmann,' something he can be thankful for) to the links section.

<dd>Sorry, I felt I had to remove it. This article is about the newsgroup, not Wollmann. It's on topic to mention what titles the newsgroup gave Wollmann, but any further detail specifically about Wollmann himself not related to that should go into an article about him (provided one is warranted). I didn't see anything in that external link that was about the newsgroup. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:20, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The dispute is between:</p>
<ol>
<li>those who insist that they "may" or "ought" to mention in the article that <b>certain people (possibly anonymous) have labelled a specific, named individual a "kook"; and,</b></li>
<li>those who say that this is either not nice, or that it smacks of endorses the slur</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, in the case of a very famous and well-known person - someone who has <a href="../../../n/a/m/Name_recognition.html" title="Name recognition">name recognition</a> from 10% or more of the English-speaking world, let us say - there is no question of "privacy" or being "non-notable". We can say that many Democrats and other leftists have called Bush a "moron".</p>
<p>But are we really obliged (or even permitted) by Wikipedia's Mission, to perpetuate this slur on Mr. Wollman? Would it really HURT the project, if we omitted his name from the list of those persons that a Usenet newsgroup (which permits anonymous posting) has branded as <i>kooks</i>?</p>
<p>I'd prefer to have a link at the end of the article, referring curious readers to the newsgroup FAQ. Let them satisfy their curiousity directly from the source.</p>
<p>I'm going to change the article radically. And if people start reverting it, well I get three reverts a day, don't I? (And if anyone goes over that, don't say you weren't warned.) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 14:17, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Kook of the Millennium" seems a pretty notable title to me, at least in context of this article, and as I've argued on the mailing list Wollmann doesn't appear to be a particularly "private" individual. IMO removing his name simply because he's vigorously complaining and issuing legal threats (apparently without any real legal grounding or intent to follow through) <i>does</i> hurt the project; it shows that we're willing to remove information that people just plain don't like if they raise enough of a ruckus. I'm not terribly interested in this information or this article itself, but I am quite interested in the principles being established here. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:57, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is there a reason why the article wound up at the title "the alt.usenet.kooks newsgroup" instead of just plain "alt.usenet.kooks"?

<p>My view is this: what some people are concerned about here is that Mr. Wollmann may be bullied by having his name included demeaningly in this article. Well and good. Other people are concerned that Mr. Wollmann is doing some bullying of his own by trying to force us to remove his name from an article in which it was rightfully included (refer: wikien-l). This concern is also well and good. I think we should be able to walk the middle ground here by including the data in an informative fashion. Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 15:19, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree. The list of notable "kook of the" recipients is verifiable, relevant, informative, etc. If giving such an "award" is bullying, it is not Wikipedia that's doing it - it's the denizens of alt.usenet.kooks. I'm restoring the list, IMO its removal is unjustified. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:47, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bryan, you wrote above that you're not interested in this article as such, but in the principles. I agree with you about the principles, and I've fought to keep material in WP that certain groups (LaRouchies, neo-Nazis) have tried to remove. But this is the wrong battleground. There are other principles at stake here, primarily that we shouldn't become bullies. This is a private individual who has done no harm except to act foolishly and be an irritant. Even a link to his website has been removed, so now there isn't even any information about who he is. I agree with Ed that the name ought to be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:18, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I've disputed the assertion that we are being "bullies" in the first place, and also that this is a private individual. If I don't agree with those, then as far as I'm concerned there <i>aren't</i> any other principles at stake here (at least not that I've seen anyone mention). I removed that external link to his website because this article's about the newsgroup, not the person. If Wollmann himself is notable enough to have information about who he is in Wikipedia, he can have an article devoted to him easily enough. Once upon a time he did, in fact, but it got deleted (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Edmond_Wollmann_ccc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Edmond Wollmann">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Edmond Wollmann</a>). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:15, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've restored the list again. I agree with Bryan; and Ed's justification, in his edit summary, for reverting ("policy discussion on this matter has not been concluded (see mailing list)") is specious. Plus his treating the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">3RR</a> as entitlement to revert three times is not looked upon very highly by many Wikipedians, and makes the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarmonious_editing_club_c3f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club">Harmonious Editing Club</a>, which he founded, an even bigger joke than it already was. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacoDeposit_8aab.html" title="User:TacoDeposit">Taco Deposit</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETacoDeposit_4b46.html" title="User talk:TacoDeposit">Talk-o to Taco</a> 19:38, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The burden of proof is on him who asserts that the target of criticism is "notable". For example, I might be pretty well known around Wikipedia, but I am otherwise a private citizen. If you want to see REAL ANGER, just try putting <b>my name</b> in an article. (Instead of performing this experiment, e-mail me privately and I'll tell you what Jimbo did to the guy who actually tried this. Hint: he only tried it <b>once</b>.) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 17:25, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Beg to differ. The burden of proof is on him who asserts that the <i>criticism of said person</i> is notable <i>within the context of the article</i>. In an article on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, we would not write "the Usenet newsgroup alt.usenet.kooks has named Clinton Kook of the Month for..." because this would be completely out of whack; Clinton is notable, but AUK's slam on him is certainly not. In the context of alt.usenet.kooks <i>itself</i>, however, Wollmann is most <i>certainly</i> notable. I can Google and dig up posts that demonstrate this, but I hope you won't require me to. The fact that the unsurpassed scope of "Kook of the Millennium" was felt to aptly fit mr. Wollmann alone should be enough indication.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, I <i>am</i> interested in the article as such, I am not arguing on principle, I am the original author, and I disagree with both Sarah and Ed on this.

<dd>Yes, it is. He shouldn't haul out threats like that. You were not helping matters by reverting it as dedicatedly as you did, however. Now that we're <i>here</i>, let's <i>talk</i>.

<dd>That would do nothing to fix the problem Ed moved the article for in the first place—the capitalized "A". However, that problem admits no solution in the current Wikipedia configuration. There's talk of change, but until that's a fact, this abject monstrosity of an article title (there, I've said it) should not remain.

<dd>Identifying individuals by name on the Web is grounds for civil defamation suits. Administrators of news readers, the folks that archive news group messages to the Web so it could be available to the search engines, have to grant removal requests all the time. That's the advice given by Google attorney. "We're just a conduit, but the web sites, the secondary publishers, and the original authors are culpable. You are well advised to go after them, and they're likely amenable because they know they can be sued." If you cannot be identified or located (like some of the stalkers in alt.usenet.kooks), you are not vulnerable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know that two of the fellows you have identified in this forum have only recently become aware of the Wikipedia entry. Apparently, a high school reunion committee coordinator found it in a search of the person's name, and the person is ticked off to say the least. He was already shopping for an attorney. Apparently, it's much simpler than plodding through Wiki's prohibitive and bureaucratic arbitration procedures. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>I'm not at liberty to disclose the identities of the persons seeking legal relief, and I don't want to compromise them. You are correct to suggest that the original authors in Usenet are culpable. But this does not exclude your culpability (and identifying and locating the original and often anonymized authors in Usenet is cost-prohibitive). Under civil law (and under the Communications Decency Act), you are a "secondary publisher" or "re-publisher" and you share in the liability. In some cases, the original Usenet messages are not even archived to the Web or do not show up in the first dozen pages of results. But yours does, and therein lies the grounds for the lawsuit. The immunity you seek (just reporting what others said) is restricted to "conduits" (e.g. Google, telephone company). - <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>Then I don't think you'd mind if they dropped your names on a web site, factually citing your defamation. I don't have any interest in going out of my way to save your hyde by providing citations on the civil and communications law. If you're interested, you can look it up yourself. It by no means guarantees victory for the plaintiff, but it's definitely a legal basis for a lawsuit (and one that could prove expensive either way for the defendant, win, lose, or draw). As for the "proper place for it," I just thought I'd alert you in the event they proceeded, because you folks would be named in the lawsuit as well. I have no interest in seeing one.

<dd>The lawsuit threats are laughable. In the US, where the Wikimedia servers are located, libel and slander only apply to false statements of fact represented as truth. In <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertz_v._Robert_Welch%2C_Inc._75d9.html" title="Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.">Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</a></i>, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that "under the First Amendment, there is no such thing as a false <i>idea</i>". Opinions are never libelous. You can call someone an asshole, a shithead, a kook, a rotter, a moron, all to your heart's content. Only specific false claims qualify as libelous or slanderous, and even then only under specific, delimited circumstances. In effect, libel law in the US is almost (though not quite) a dead letter, and deliberately so - to do otherwise would have a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilling_effect.html" title="Chilling effect">chilling effect</a> on protected speech.

<p>But there is certainly a totally negative report of alt.usenet.kooks as well. Here is a totally independent assessment and report of newsgroup stalking and harassment, where alt.usenet.kooks appears prominently and over and over; this independent report is by a Ph.D. in Social Psychology: <a href="http://www.fireflysun.com/book/sci.psychology.psychotherapy.PUBLIC.php" class="external free" title="http://www.fireflysun.com/book/sci.psychology.psychotherapy.PUBLIC.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fireflysun.com/book/sci.psychology.psychotherapy.PUBLIC.php</a> This psychologist has no reason to misrepresent alt.usenet.kooks and a search of that web page shows the newsgroup, alt.usenet.kooks, coming up several times as an abuse newsgroup, with the FACTUAL details of its role in stalking and abuse DOCUMENTED and made clear.</p>
<p>The fact that the main FAQ for this newsgroup (www.lart.com/auk/) appears on a web site whose domain is 100% bogus as far as responsible person, contact person, responsible name, etc. supports this view. In short, lart.com is a totally anonymous domain because, IN VIOLATION OF ICANN RULES, it is totally falsely registered. Correspondingly, alt.usenet.kooks is inhabited largely by similar anonymous and unseemly people -- often looking to harass others for kicks. A google search for the posts of most of the regular participants of alt.usenet.kooks shows them going off-topic to OTHER newsgroups frequently to HARASS people.</p>

<p>What "Braloj" also leaves out is how the "independent report" is nothing but a Brad Jesness SOB (supporter of Brad) who is 100% invalid WHOIS contact info. This so called "independant" admits his name is fake and use it for his WHOIS contact info. When he got caught using a fake Tacoma, WA address, he then switched to a fake address in Utah. Yet "Brad Jesness" never speaks about the fake name and fake address because Brad has few SOB's and needs all the help he can get.</p>
<dl>
<dd>REPLY -- Research revealed that the independent reporter is a social psychologist. His domain data (i.e. actually that of a staffer) was valid in every respect except for the telephone number (who wants to be contacted at home?). He claims that he was deliberately tardy in updating the information once his staffer relocated because his staffer complained about being stalked by a Usenet gang (which may have included the author of these remarks about Brad). He claims it took some time to find a solution to the problem of cyberstalking, hence the most recent domain data ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>... The new domain data can be traced to the address of a Web hosting service, which appears to be that hosting the independent source's Web site. I might write the company to confirm whether he has secured permission to use its address as proxy for his own. But if he has, he's simply found a viable solution to a personal problem of cyberstalking. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 172.149.8.228 (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.149.8.228.html" title="User talk:172.149.8.228">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.149.8.228_e0c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.149.8.228">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Talk%7EAlt.usenet.kooks_597b.html" title="Edit section: Making the &quot;list of kooks&quot; more NPOV?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Making the "list of kooks" more NPOV?</span></h2>
<p>Much of the controversy about this page has centred on the use of individual names in the article. At the time of writing, the list of names is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Past "winners" include people of Usenet notoriety such as Archimedes Plutonium, Kenneth Pangborn, Vito Kuhn, Sollog, psychologist Brad Jesness, John Grubor, Richard Bullis, and astrologer Edmond Wollmann, who was voted "Kook of the Millennium", but also prominent people like Bill Gates, Pierre Salinger, Gary Glitter, or Bill Clinton</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems to me, as a participant in the newsgroup, that this list is somewhat arbitrary. Vito Kuhn is the most recent winner of the Kook of the Month award, but is no more notable on Usenet as a whole or in AUK than any of a few dozen other winners. On the other hand, Bill Gates is notable everywhere, for more important reasons. There is no objective criterion for inclusion on the list, although it seems to be generally accepted that <i>some</i> examples should be given.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest that the list be changed to include only</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Winners of <i>exceptional</i> "kook awards", such as Kook of the Millennium, Kook of the Century, and Kook of the Decade</li>
<li>(b) Winners of "kook awards" who are considered notable enough to have Wikipedia articles in their own right.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would, at present, produce the following list of names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edmond Wollmann (Kook of the Millennium)</li>
<li>Earl Curley (Kook of the Century)</li>
<li>John Grubor (Kook of the Century and Decade)</li>
<li>Brad Jesness (Kook of the Decade)</li>
<li>Richard Bullis (Clueless Eternal Newbie)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a> (has his own Wikipedia article)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a> (ditto)</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> (ditto)</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Glitter_8713.html" title="Gary Glitter">Gary Glitter</a> (ditto)</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> (ditto)</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sarfatti_a43b.html" title="Jack Sarfatti">Jack Sarfatti</a> (ditto)</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_evolution_hearings.html" title="Kansas evolution hearings">Kansas Board of Education</a> (ditto)</li>
</ul>
<p>This would exclude two of the names currently listed (Mr Pangborn and Mr Kuhn), on the grounds that they're not considered particularly notable in the newsgroup. It would also exclude <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Salinger_e465.html" title="Pierre Salinger">Pierre Salinger</a>, who won his award for "trolling the media", and is not regarded in the newsgroup as a "kook". It would thus be less subjective than the existing list.</p>
<p>In this and other respects, the article certainly needs revision. I'm reluctant to make such changes myself, since I'm closely associated with the newsgroup and might provoke further vandalism by people who would consider me biased. So this is just a suggestion. The article certainly needs <i>some</i> attention. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_J_Ross_7b63.html" title="User:Peter J Ross">Peter J Ross</a> 21:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You raise good points, so I've gone ahead and updated the list as you suggest. As for the other things, I suppose in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety (and accusations of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a>) you could post rewritten chunks here on talk and have other editors incorporate them into the articles instead. That way there's always at least one other person giving their "stamp of approval" to the text before it goes "live". (I'm not really qualified to revise the article myself, I've only got this article watchlisted as a relic of the vandalisms of Christmas Past.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:47, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>although these kookologists attacked me personally at my workplace, i am quite capable of presenting only facts in a neutral way. i could care less who thinks i'm a "kook", especially, if it's some random bozo on usenet, so don't confuse this with some sort of retaliation effort. the people who did this, have already ashamedly sulked off into the the ether, hopefully to never try this sort of harrassment again with anybody else... especially someone who might not be savvy enough to defend themselves using IT knowledge. i am not adding any of my own writings or commentary to the wiki at all (except maybe here, in the talk section, where it is appropriate), just the "smoking gun" of various messages sent to my ISP by these people, and a chronological archive of approximately 2 years worth of their messages in a "private" Yahoo! Group that they opened up for a few minutes not aware that i'd be able to archive most of the content there in that time. the aar_skeptics archive is interesting, in that it matches up perfectly with historical events outside of the group, reveals sockpuppetry (your missing citation), team effort (ala: your missing citiation), cyberbullying (are you getting the picture?). i leave the reader to interpret the archived behaviours of the "kookologists" on their own, as i've added no commentary and present the actual files as they were received, with redacted emails as needed (to protect the innocent, and those hit by the kookologists' "scatter shot" <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberstalking.html" title="Cyberstalking">cyberstalking</a> techniques). i don't understand what is not NPOV about offering the crank emails that "kookologists" sent my way, to the rest of the world. obviously, alt.usenet.kooks is not a neutral space. it is quite well known to be a haven for these sorts of attacks: <a href="http://netkooks.org/netkkkops" class="external free" title="http://netkooks.org/netkkkops" rel="nofollow">http://netkooks.org/netkkkops</a></p>
<p>i posess these archives because one of the "kookologists" had threatened litigation using a fake identity. they attempted to trick my employer (a major university) into believing that i was doing something that i shouldn't be doing. this is probably a form of collusion, since two "kookologists" were involved in a "team effort", similar to your missing citation for such alleged actions in the wiki. perhaps if i filed charges on these people for their actions, you'd be able to include links pointing to the court documents on appropriate government websites? let me know if that will help, or maybe you can add "cyberstalking" and "possible criminal activity" to the "Controversy" section and give it a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag so that you may deny any references which actually prove such.</p>
<p>not that i'd want this, but perhaps you should just delete the article if there is no way to cite the "contoversial" parts, because this push by certain wikipedia members to disallow clarifications of the "hearsay" that you seem to allow in the article, is rather damning for your organization, imo. it's quite evident that there is a strong push to keep factual and historically accurate information from being included in this entry, for whatever reason that might be. perhaps you should consider that you may have just witnessed the "event horizon" where now the "kookologists" need to vandalize this entry to prevent facts from being added, instead of the so called "kooks", as the evidence is quite undeniable, depsite the fact that i have even more that i haven't published.</p>
<p>i do not understand how anybody is going to present the real life harrassment of people by "kookologists" in such a way that you'd ever accept citation. you seem to allow the names of people who may or may not believe themselves to be kooks displayed prominently, and you link to caballista.org and insurgent.org, which are owned and populated by the same people calling themselves "kookologists". this smacks of a revenge entry on wikipedia that is being bolstered by the proponents of those two websites. how is that a NPOV, exactly? this would be like denying the fact that the watergate tapes exist inside the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">watergate</a> wiki, and letting nixon's lackeys prevent mention of them.</p>
<p>you have taken out a link to archived "smoking gun" information about once prominent posters and supporters of alt.usenet.kooks. please explain why it is that you did this, otherwise i will just have to revert it back, and we can watch you remove it wholesale with no valid explanation and no courage to defend your actions.</p>
<p>your refusal to explain yourself and/or possibly present any compromise is completely expected, but fyi all of this is being archived for later publication and dissemination, as i've already got archives of you people editing the talk pages and history when changes are made that you don't like.

<dd>Hi. Please review the guidelines for sourcing, located at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">Wikipedia:Reliable Sources</a>. Your personal website doesn't qualify, I'm afraid. If you have any third party references (such as to a newspaper or a published book) those would fit with wikipedia's verifiability policy. Further, statements such as 'Any modest perusal of posts in alt.usenet.kooks by regular users of the newsgroup who call themselves "kookologists" reveals a "pack mentality"' are heavily loaded and quite POV, in my estimation. If some third party journalist has made such statements, we can include them. They can't be cited to a primary source (such as example postings) without running afoul of the policies in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Original_Research_6a12.html" title="Wikipedia:No Original Research">Wikipedia:No Original Research</a>. - <a href="../../../e/h/h/User%7EEhheh_6717.html" title="User:Ehheh">Ehheh</a> 17:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i dunno, it sure seems like you are denying the actual evidence of stalking by these freaks being included, yet you accept links to websites that are obviously owned by a "third party" who is obviously as familiar with alt.usenet.kooks as i am. if you can't prove that the person(s) who own(s) those sites are not socked up and posting in alt.usenet.kooks, how can you be so damn sure that they are NPOV websites? i can understand that it is "on my website", and that i might be biased, by my offer of these archives to the public is not biased.</dd>

<dd>obviously, you allow the non-NPOV comments about some people being labeled "kooks" by a handful of self-published hooligans based on non-NPOV postings in usenet that just happen to show up on a regularly updated website controlled by people working closely with kookologists. the irony is thick.</dd>

<dd>could you maybe point out which parts of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">Wikipedia:Reliable Sources</a> allows rouge usenet user driven websites such as insurgent.org and caballista.org to be used as "reliable source? i cannot see how either of those two sites could attain "reliability". caballista.org seems to be affiliated with usenet juggernaut and self-proclaimed "kookologist" 'pinku sensei', who apparently is close enough with the owner of the domain to let him/her use it as his email address in usenet posts: <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=dEwIGBsAAADBk_9UY-dl1Y_LLhOPo0HuIuid2kocSeixFbkSOY96jg" class="external free" title="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=dEwIGBsAAADBk_9UY-dl1Y_LLhOPo0HuIuid2kocSeixFbkSOY96jg" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=dEwIGBsAAADBk_9UY-dl1Y_LLhOPo0HuIuid2kocSeixFbkSOY96jg</a> similarly, insurgent.org appears on usenet in the posts of "kookologist" 'cujo desockpuppet': <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=5T5apBIAAAAdIs96ImKzfgBCnPwwSwbwII73Nnd8MGuFrQYThHx-nw" class="external free" title="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=5T5apBIAAAAdIs96ImKzfgBCnPwwSwbwII73Nnd8MGuFrQYThHx-nw" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=5T5apBIAAAAdIs96ImKzfgBCnPwwSwbwII73Nnd8MGuFrQYThHx-nw</a></dd>

<dd>please explain how it is a NPOV presented by these websites when they allow usenet posters to affiliate with them directly by using their domain name in the From: headers of their posts. furthermore, what the alt.usenet.kooks group seems to exist for is "researching" the activities and posts of certain posters on usenet. how is that not "original research"? these people are not professionals or even accredited (or at least they fear associating their professional titles and real names for some reason). they even draw paralellism to research by adopting the term "kookologist". i know this shouldn't be difficult for you to respond to directly, but take your time if you need to. i'm in no rush.</dd>

<dd>the "kookle search engine" is not an FAQ, neither is the list of users names whom they have researched and determined to be "kooks", nor is the "Kook Kard Deck , Kook Chess Set, &amp; Kook Tarot Deck". i contend that it is self published tripe produced by unverifiable sources (see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>). usenet group FAQ's are text files found posted on usenet in the appropriate group, therefore rendering them "not reliable", since they could be posted by anybody. how this can be absorbed into a website and become a reliable source, befuddles me. show me a reliable author of this so-called "FAQ website" that is patently much, much more than a FAQ, and you've got something. fail to, and well... it's your onus.
