<p>Is having studies that support or detract from specific alt med claims really a good idea? The problem is that I could produce dozens of studies that find not effects for homeopathy of chiropracty and the articlr could end up looking slightly odd. Wouldn't it be better to put studies aimed at specific forms on thier own pages?<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 16:16, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)~</p>

<dd>That's reasonable but the problem is, the section gives the impression that AM therapies are on the whole ok, and that some people dismiss the whole of AM becuase of the failings of one branch of it. I am trying to redress the balance by showing that debunking is not confined to just say for example homeopathy, but in fact applies to many other bramches of AM. If you or anyone can think of a way of wording this critism of AM without the need for all the references, then i am happy to port them to the respective pages. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 14:41, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I think one example per critism would be a good apraoch. Currently we have two examples of research showing that a perticular alt med does not work I havn't got round to reading the iridology research yet but assuming it is of good quality I would keep it ond drop the mention of the bbc test (which doesn't really test homeopathy anyway). There are some cross CAM aricles such as this onehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12974558 which may be useful.

<dd>I hate to break your bubble, but the <b>way of real science</b> says that no single research study can either prove or disprove anything in medical / health research. Most research papers state <i>more research is needed</i> for a reason. Even <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventional_medicine.html" title="Conventional medicine">conventional medicine</a> does this. They issue practice guidelines which tries to or suggests how clincial practice should treat a specific medical condition.

<p>Re: Citing Michalsen 2003, Gonsalkorale 2003, and Berga 2003... Psychology (CBT, Hypnosis) and a hot bath (hydrotherapy), are alternative medicine? How are studies about fairly welll known, HMO/publicly publicly paid for, normal kinds of medicine "alternative", be useful in supprting C/AM? I don't see anything in the listed branches of C/AM that covers hot baths being good for circulation as anything other than accepted science, or that indicated basic psychotherapy as being anything other than conventional medicine.</p>
<p>I was going to remove the studies, and all text that references it, but it might be nice if someone could explain to me how hot baths are anything but accepted conventional medicine, or why CBT is supposed to be something beyond mainstraim, conventional, science and medicine. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 06:21, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>At this time, I would like to point out that my comment in our Wikiproject standard of quality guidelines about adding any hint of controversy in the first 3 paragraphs documents non-compliance to our guidelines was created long before the latest change in the article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition</span></h2>
<p>The definition that currently leads this article is "broadly describes diagnosis, treatment or therapy used in place of conventional medical treatments." This is vague and is contradicted within the next few paragraphs by the mention of "complementary medicine". I assume that the author did not intend to exclude complementary use of alternative therapies, but that is precisely what the definition says. I propose to delete it and replace it with the more precise and accurate definition I added at the end of the first paragraph, but as a matter of courtesy and in view of the amount of controversy on this page, I am inviting comment before deleting. My major reservation about my new definition is that it is primarily applicable in the US and Canada, and probably most of Europe and the developed world. I welcome further improvement. alteripse 1 may 04</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, the very term is an oxymoron! I started out about 5 talk archives ago with using my own personal definition of alternative medicine. It did not last long. I suggest that we simply stick to how it is defined in the dictionary, if for no other reason than NPOV. About 30 different online internet dictionaries currently define the term, as we have defined it. So, I fail to see any problems with the present method. The science people seem to think that it is all alternative medicine. That AM is by definition quackery, etc., etc., etc. Using your own private definiton, Perhaps, is the very definition of controversy? -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 17:09, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>1. I think I understand what you are saying, but the definition as it stands is simply wrong. Most alternative medicine in the US and Europe is not used instead of scientific medicine, which is what the definition says. You didn't address this objection.</li>

<ul>
<li>2. The definition I offered is quite objective and applies to everthing in the list of types of alternative medicine. Why do you claim it is NPOV?

<dd>Ok, you convinced me. I changed the sentence and will not change the primary definition. I think the concept I am offering is worth keeping because it is the principal core of the controversy.

<p>Think about it a bit. <i>... therapy which can be provided legally by persons who are not licensed to diagnose and treat disease."</i> If it is legal, then it is regulated by the government. So, if it is both legal and regulated then the alternative practitioners are licensed to diagnose and treat disease. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde, aka Mr-Natural-Health</a> 19:28, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I couldn't have put it better, Mr. Gohde. You've grasped the paradox and the essential dishonesty in so much of alt med, at least in the US. Why do you think all the wanna-be physicians from chiropractors to naturopaths to the makers of dietary supplements tell the consumer "this product/procedure is not intended to diagnose or treat disease..."? Much of alt med is simply people and companies who want to pretend to be physicians without the inconvenience of having to learn so much and without the responsibility of being accountable for outcomes. The biggest difference between the stuff you buy in the nutrition store and the stuff you buy from the pharmacy is that those who sell things labelled "dietary supplements" can avoid all the inconvenient laws related to honest labelling, consistency of contents, and that little item of demonstrating that the product actually helps the condition they sell it for. But that of course is POV. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">Alteripse</a> 20:10, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Doctor ... Alternative medicine is a very broad area. Many would include DO's (Doctor of Osteopathy) in the definition. In Virginia, DO's are practicing medicine right alongside MD's.

<dd>Mr. Gohde, your removal of my factual sentence without justification is discourteous. It was an entirely factual statement regardless of your or my POV.

<dd>I am not reverting the paragraph but insist you are making a factual error. Honest chiropractors treat subluxations to maintain health; they don't treat disease. They will be the first to tell you that. Again, your example supports the essential importance of this distinction. If you want to argue that alternative practitioners <i>are</i> actually diagnosing and treating disease in the same way physicians do, you are accusing them of doing something illegal in much of the developed world. This issue of whether and how alt med practices and the alt med culture are shaped by the laws defining medical diagnosis and treatment is at the heart of the whole cultural controversy over alt med. You keep omitting the sentence but you haven't responded with anything that is civil, accurate, and substantive. I said I would leave the page alone and I will keep my word. This is a last attempt to engage in civil and substantive discussion but if you can't or won't I'll drop it and leave the whole topic alone here as well.<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">Alteripse</a> 02:44, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Severe social disconnect</span></h2>
<p>The last time I was struck by the level of disconnect was when MNH implied that people might have to actually pay for vitamins.... I guess he lives in a country where people don't pay for basic health. In the US, we almost always pay. For everything. Vitamins, drugs, everything.</p>
<p>That made me think about a whole lot of other issues. Mostly about his tone in this discussion. He may be fighting to get vitamins to the public, while others are so tired of paying for fake "supplements" that they decry his vitamins. He may live in a country that does ten times as much about a fatal disease, but people still die, so he may blame the available medicine. Others of us note that we don't get free basic HIV cocktails, and have become cynical about paying for new "cures".</p>
<p>In the US, we don't get interesting, free, "complementary" medicince. We don't even get free medicine. We are fighting for mere basics, he is fighting for luxuries.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think we should all note that we are not connecting on the same level. If we adjust our minds for such, maybe we would have less flamewars. Reading into MNH's pages, folks in the US don't even eat well,, but in the US, how would we know? <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 10:30, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what all this rucus is about, but the problem people have with what governments internationally have agreed to do with vitamins + minerals and other dietary supplements is horrorfying for people whose lives literally depend on these things.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deletion of other points of view</span></h2>
<p>MNH's recent edits appear to be expuinging points of view he doesn't agree are true. While he may have a case that they are not true, I would suggest that removing incorrect points of view is actually a bad idea if they are points of view that are commonly held. Removing something as a "lie" is inappropriate if it is a view that is sufficiently commonly held to mention, even if marked as false.</p>
<p>An example is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=3592221&amp;oldid=3592188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=3592221&amp;oldid=3592188" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> edit, in which a both common and notable view was removed (with an inaccurate edit summary - 19th century tabloid??) when it clearly belonged in the article, but in a different place <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=3592361&amp;oldid=3592326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=3592361&amp;oldid=3592326" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>While MNH's tremendous and dedicated energy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is to be admired, I might suggest others may care to go through the removed content and replace portions as appropriate in the article. The article is not a one-person project with MNH the arbiter, after all. I shall be devoting some time to this myself, in the interest of a better article - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 23:37, May 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The long process of restoring other points of view to the article</span></h2>
<p>I'm starting on an effort to restore alternate points of view to the article. That one side considers them "wrong" and "lies" doesn't change the fact that they're notable points of view that exist and should therefore be mentioned in the relevant section.</p>
<p>I'm doing this by going back through the long, long, long edit history and restoring deletia wherever feasible (to an appropriate section) - I'm assuming the people who put that stuff in did so with the best interests of the article at heart, not in order to spread "lies," as per <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. <i>"The ideal is to make articles acceptable to everyone."</i></p>
<p>If others feel this is a suitable task, I encourage them to do so as well. (If not, I'm sure it'll be apparent that I'm the only one.)</p>
<p>(I am assuming good faith on the part of MNH, something I have failed to do in the past. I apologise for this and will try harder.)</p>
<p>Would someone like to change the section headers to be labels rather than declarative statements of a point of view? The meaning need not change - only the didactic tone - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 09:48, May 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, there is nothing to restore, David, and the very long process of making this article a very good example of NPOV has already been active, did you notice, for a few months. Patience is to be credited to John. He already went into that long process, and there is bliss after his patience. Not that it is perfect, but he worked hard and did a great, simply great job - much unlike others here, people with a cop's mentality, whom I will not name again since we all know who they are. But we'd much appreciate a less stereotypical and more content-happy attitude from you. Just restore less, redirect less, and contribute more - content, that is. Contribute content, not discussions, and contribute it in a NPOV manner, as per Wiki policies. Thank you, and happy editing&#160;:O)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please rest assured that I too am into an even longer process of ALWAYS re-restoring the NPOVs as they have been painfully gathered, hand picked and cherished by John, to say nothing about his incredible patience with you and his commendable, down-to-earth formulations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, David, it's too easy to call for destruction and then claim reconstruction. It's more difficult, but also braver in the heart and deeper in the general direction of wisdom to build without destroying (forget Halliburton).</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Oh my, o my&#160;:O) Look who's here! You are under AC decreee prohibition to address to me as a cop. You are watched. You don't answer my messages to you.

<dd>LOL viral code? then ROTFLMAO must be the mother of all viral codes. And yet it's so true. You know what's so funny? You don't want my commenting yet you choose to invite my comments by posting crap on my talk page. Strange behaviour indeed, unless you secretly enjoy me laughing at you.

<dd>But of course, sugar! It was love at first sight! Why did you waste so much time&#160;? Took you SIX months to notice&#160;:O) Sadly, for the destiny of our burgeoning romance, this is ony a place for editing AM stuff. And I'm not available anyway. I am happily married, and have lots of kids and less and less time for you. For the sake of John's time, and even yours, my dear, go do some homework and let us do the real work here, will you&#160;? Be the nice girl I know you are. And the next time you are a fancy London guide for us transoceanic savages, forget Bedford Street or I'll kick your retroviral code out of your policing or diverting AM "contributions"&#160;:O) - <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 13:58, 2004 May 17 (UTC)</dd>
