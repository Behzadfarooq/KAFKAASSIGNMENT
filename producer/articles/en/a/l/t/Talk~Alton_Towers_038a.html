<p>It says in the box on the right that there are 2 water rides, however I would suggest that there are 3: the log flume, the river rapids and the ripsaw (which squirts the riders as they tumble around and people do come off it pretty drenched)... anyone disagree? 16th Nov 2006</p>
<p>I disagree. I think that in order to be a water ride, the ride vehicle needs to run on water (as in the case of the Flume and the rapids). You could argue that you come off Nemesis drenched if it was heavily raining, yet that isn't a water ride. Although Ripsaw does feature water, so do many 4D cinemas, but due to the water being only an added feature, they are not water rides. Chocology 12:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>before i visited disney world last year, alton towers had been the greatest theme park i had ever visited, when i was peritcullarly intrested in it i saw a program about it's history and the surrounding area post-year 2000 it contained information on the new atraction being built within the towers HEX, it gave the impression that the story line involved with the ride was actually true and that there is a massive tree somewhere entirely chained up. i was wonderring if anyone has any information on this as it interrests me greatly? the ride is such an unique feature of the park.</p>

<dd>There is a tree that the legend is based on but its location isn't publicised to protect it from visitors. --<a href="../../../f/o/z/User%7EFozi999_dc4e.html" title="User:Fozi999">Fozi999</a> 12:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Rita - Queen of Speed claims to reach 100 kilometres per hour within a few seconds of launch" - whoever wrote this... is there any particular reason why it doesn't just <i>reach</i> 100kph? If it's an Alton Towers statistic I would assume it's true.</p>
<p>Also, has there really not been any talk on this article yet? Weird... --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 20:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the reason it's been written like that is because the launch speed and acceleration differs between every launch and 100kph is not reached each time. I'm not sure whether 100kph is a theoretical maximum or whether the launch inaccuracy allows it to exceed this speed. However, I don't think this is really relevant to this article and a simple statement of "<i>it reaches 100kph in about 2.5 seconds</i>" would probably be better. --<a href="../../../f/o/z/User%7EFozi999_dc4e.html" title="User:Fozi999">Fozi999</a> 11:50, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At first I assumed that it would be the same each time, on the basis that it just goes round the same track with the same forces on it, but I guess different riders give the train different masses. As you say though, it's not really relevant. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 15:37, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The launch speed is very accurate - the computer controlling the winch that pulls the train along can adjust the speed whilst the ride is in-mid launch. So, if the computer realises halfway down the launch track that the train is not on target to hit 100km/h, it speeds up the winch slightly. You can see a photo of the computer in action <a href="http://gallery.towersalmanac.com/displayimage.php?pos=-4172" class="external text" title="http://gallery.towersalmanac.com/displayimage.php?pos=-4172" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</dd>

I'll put it here first so that people can make changes to it before i add, some bits are of course written in a way not to educate but tell, as coursework and articles are different.

<p>History of Alton Towers</p>
<p>The history of Alton towers dates back to the 8th century when the towers were first built. The fortress was owned by Ceolred, king of the Mercian empire. Then in the 1100’s the land and fortress were given to Bertram de Verdun, a crusader who received the land for his fighting. Eventually, the estate was owned by the French Talbot family. The first Earl of Shrewsbury, John Talbot, fought alongside Henry V for much of his life, and the family were always close to the hearts of the rulers of the country. The fortress now became a house and was called Alveton Lodge and was the summer residence of the Talbot's. Now Charles (the 15th Earl) inherited the house and began to take more interest in the house and began to expand. He also wanted to further develop the gardens. Work began in 1800, and continued until 1852. One of his biggest wishes was to develop the dry valley into one of the finest gardens in Britain, and he did. Over 5,000 conifers and 8,000 other trees were planted in the grounds and many lakes and pools, dug by hand, were made from water diverted from the spring at Ramsor. In 1811 the name of the site changed again, into Alton abbey, even though there were no characteristics present to give it an abbey status.</p>
<p>In 1827, Charles died and his nephew John inherited the land. He also shared his vision for the estate, and took over his work. A monument was erected to Charles in the gardens, with the words 'He Made the Desert Smile'. Then in 1837, the Shrewsbury's main residence in Heythrop burned to the ground and everything that was recovered, was moved to newly renamed (again) Alton Towers. The towers were now extremely valuable. They had great works of art including paintings by artists like Raphael and Van Dyck. Further work was done on the house when Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, began working for the Earl. Much of the house as it is seen today is the work of Pugin. He also continued the development of the garden.</p>
<p>The towers were now in serious trouble. It was 1852 and Earl John had just died; now the house was thrown into legal disputes with many of the family all fielding their own army of lawyers. In the end Henry Chetwynd Talbot, won the battle for the house, but in the process had built up an extremely large bill. He began selling many of the objects in the house to pay for these bills. Yet again in 1860 Earl Henry ran in to money troubles. This time he needed money to repair some parts of the house, this time he used a better strategy, he opened the house and gardens to the public. He organised fetes, illuminations and firework displays, as well as exhibitions of instruments of torture, and balloon festivals. In the early 1900's, he developed the Talbot motor car, which would soon become the first motor car to travel 100 miles in one hour. It was a great day out and this was the start of its turn into a theme park. Four years prior to the attractions the earl and his wife split and the earl strangely moved out leaving his wife in the towers and agreed to pay her an allowance, this he never did. The decline of the towers had begun…………</p>
<p>It was in 1918, that much of the Shrewsbury properties were sold, and ultimately, in 1924, the Alton Towers estate itself was sold to a group of local businessmen. Once again, an auction was held, and all the contents of the house were sold to the highest bidder. The park was kept open and some rooms were changed into cafes or restaurants and many shops were opened. Then in the Second World War the estate was requisitioned by the army to be used as an army training facility and during this time no repairs were carried, this just furthered the decline. It wasn't until 1951, that the Towers were returned to the Alton Towers Company, and due to the post-war shortage of metals such as copper and lead, the whole interior of the house was removed for sale. Then finally everything was abandoned with the exception of the Chapel, that housed a model railway, and the Armoury, that became a gift shop. Then the rise of Alton towers was about to begin.</p>
<p>In the 1970’s the towers were bought and the new owners began to build some attractions and restored parts of the house, and reinforced the floors and ceilings to allow public access. Then, in 1980, with John Broome in charge, things began to turn around for Alton Towers. He decided to turn the 500 acre site into a leisure park for the family. The park already had a few attractions, but he knew they needed something more. On land to the east of the Towers, he constructed the U.K.'s first double corkscrew roller coaster. Visitors came from every where and eventually the park was bought by Tussauds. This was one of the best things that happened to the park as now they had a wealthy company backing them and had almost unlimited funds. Then Tussauds was bought by the Charterhouse group in 1998. Ever since it was bought at least one new ride has been built every year. Then in 1996 a hotel was built as the experience had become so big that one day was not enough to see everything. Now the towers are still standing and are well maintained by the Tussauds group, who are still the registered owners.</p>
<p>The park has also greatly expanded the hotels, there are now two hotels. The oldest hotel is a themed one that has many different rooms including a chocolate room and a bubble room. The newest hotel is a indoor waster park as well called splash landings and is also situated near the site. There are as yet no plans to further extend the parks hotels.</p>

<p>The final paragraph of this section, about garden gnomes makes absolutly no sense whatsoever. Plenty of people are ready to delete any alterations I make straight away but none seem able to make sense of the paragraph so it still makes naff-all sense. Instead of winging at me for 'vandalism', correct the paragraph or delete it.

<p>I've removed the gnome paragraph because the wording "in punishment for which" was, sadly, unencylopedic. It was also an unsourced claim at odds with (also unsourced) claims in the <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnome.html" title="Gnome">gnome</a> article, and I couldn't find any support for the Alton Towers claim through the, admittedly limited, wonder of google.--<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 14:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Air was NOT the first flying coaster. In fact, it was not even the first flyer to be built in the UK. While it was the first of Bolliger &amp; Mabillard's flying coasters, <a href="../../../v/e/k/Vekoma.html" title="Vekoma">Vekoma</a> already had their flying dutchman style coasters at that time.</p>
<p>Some would consider Skytrak the first flyer to be built in the UK (and the world, for that matter). However, it was not nearly as free as most flyers in that, rather than having your back to the car and strapped in, riders were lying on their stomachs on the car. In addition, it was closed within its first year. Few, therefore, would call it the "first flying coaster". Nearly every website I've seen claims that Vekoma invented the flyer with "Stealth" at Paramount's Great America.</p>
<p>Alton Towers never claimed that AIR was the first ever flying coaster, just that it was a "New Generation Flying Coaster" which is certainly true due to the loading mechanism and smoothness of it. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGameOn1988_da08.html" title="User:GameOn1988">GameOn1988</a> 04:25, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I updated the controversy section when I noticed that the Spectator Article used as a source for press criticism didn't actually say anything about the Islam day being politically correct. Liddle didn't use the term Political correct, he gave a semi-reasoned opinion piece criticizing the idea that one group of people would need a day when others wouldn't be there in order to enjoy the facility. I don't think I captured it that well (and I'm not sure it was such a great piece of journalism in the first place...) but I tried to better reflect the actual content. If there are press pieces critizing Islam day as being politically correct, we could revert and cite those sources instead. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 13:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are three water rides at Alton Towers that run entirely on water, and are in operable without set water. They are The Flume, The Conga Rapids and the Jet Boats (on the lake; they're in even the picture). You can go on the ride, it is a mechanical and lots of people go on them - what objections could be had because it sounds like water ride to me.</p>

<p>There are some issues with this section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nudists day. As far as I am aware, there has never been a nudists day at Alton Towers. The world record attempt was carried out prior to the normal opening hours of the park. The park was subsiquently opened to the public when the record was completed</li>
<li>Neither the nude record attempt nor the Gay days are controvertial. A controversy requires that there is despute over the suitablility of an event of this type at Alton Towers. Without a citation of this controversy, I would suggest that these items are moved to a different section. Maybe a Trivia section is required as these events are not core to the Alton Towers business.</li>
<li>I would suggest that the content about the noise abatement, Ropers and the fireworks display is moved to the controversy section as it seems to logicaly fit under this heading.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will await coments before making any changes <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunta_c522.html" title="User:Munta">Munta</a> 13:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also think there is a significant issue with this section, regarding the Islam day. Contrary to the opinion of certain elements of the tabloid press and their readership, Alton Towers is a privately owned theme park who are free to hire out the park to any group they choose regardless of their religion. Had they chosen to hire out the entire theme park to say a group composed entirely of dentists who chose to exclude all other members of the public, it is safe to say the adverse publicity created would be practically nil. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - I would agree with that comment. It is certainly true that there was some media histeria over this event and it is important that both views get an airing. Do you know of any sources for the alternate view. <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunta_c522.html" title="User:Munta">Munta</a> 12:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"It was rumoured that Runaway Mine train would receive a retheme for 2007, which may have included a karaoke style theme with speakers and microphones for riders to sing along. In early December the park management announced that this re-theme would not take place." Took this out because a rumour that has since been disproved or is correct but isn't going to happen doesn't belong in an encyclopaedia in my opinion.

<dd>Looks great. One small point though. I still think that the "nudist day" should be removed and the reference is only to the nude record. I have never seen any evidence that they held a "nude day" - in fact, there wouldn't be enough nudists in the country to make a nude day profitable - and where would they hold their change for the stalls&#160;;) <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunta_c522.html" title="User:Munta">Munta</a> 01:23, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to request that ThemeParks-UK (<a href="http://www.themeparks-uk.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.themeparks-uk.com" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>) is added as an external link to the Alton Towers page on Wikipedia, according to the guidelines for external links websites that provide meaningful, relevant, neutral and accurate material should be considered.</p>
<p>Established in 2000, the ThemeParks-UK website has been providing an independent guide to the UK's theme parks for over 6 years. It enables visitors to view a wide range of information and images covering 5 of the UK's top theme parks all on one easy to use website: Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Chessington World of Adventures, Drayton Manor and Legoland Windsor.</p>
<p>Although ThemeParks-UK is not operated or funded by the parks that it features, due to the close relationship with the parks own management it always has the latest and most accurate information. In order to offer visitors more than the parks own websites ThemeParks-UK provides extra features such as opinion polls and the opportunity to have their own reviews and photos added.</p>
<p>During its time online, ThemeParks-UK has become a recommended website of the tourist boards VisitBritain and EnjoyEngland. It has become popular both in the UK and internationally, been featured in the press (Daily Echo), a national computer magazine (Web User) and has been included in the official magazine of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (Fun World).</p>

<dd>There used to be quite a few fan-site links in the External Links section of this article, but it was problematic as there were frequent edits by various anonymous users to bump their preferred site to the top of the list, or even remove links to sites they disliked. In the end they were all removed, which fixed the problem, even if it wasn't the ideal solution. But as long as people can be responsible with this section, I don't see why unofficial site links can't be added - my site is <a href="http://www.towersalmanac.com" class="external text" title="http://www.towersalmanac.com" rel="nofollow">Alton Towers Almanac</a>, I feel it's worthy of a link, but I'm wary of a repeat of the earlier situation I described, hence why I've kept links to ATA off the article.</dd>
