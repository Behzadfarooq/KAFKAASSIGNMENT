<p>Regarding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alternative_school&amp;diff=36797750&amp;oldid=36319520" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alternative_school&amp;diff=36797750&amp;oldid=36319520" rel="nofollow">last edit</a>: first, that should <i>not</i> have been tagged as a minor edit by any means. The entire content of this page has been altered! Second, this merge and change seems precipitous and questionable. The rationale seems to be that the article on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">alternative education</a> will take over the content that this article used to contain, while this article will now treat "alternative school" as though it meant "special-needs" school. I'd like to hear a little <i>justification</i> for this drastic change. What evidence is there that "special-needs school" is a more common meaning of the term than "school practicing alternative education"? Why should Wikipedia treat "alternative schools" as a phrase with a completely different meaning from "alternative education"? This seems a little euphemistic to me. I'd rather be precise in meaning, moving this content to "special-needs school" and restoring the old content here, unless there is overwhelming evidence that the common usage of the term means the opposite. At a minimum I think this is confusing enough that it needs to be put into a disambiguation header. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 15:38, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First things first, my apology on the "minor edit" tag. It was a simple oversight on my part to uncheck the box. I realized it immediately, but WP provides no means to correct this simple yet seemingly world-moving error. As for the move/change—I do/did intend to post the rationale on the discussion page, but got called away from my desk. I am a participant in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Alternative_education_dbbd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Alternative education">WikiProject Alternative education</a> which, by the way, your are invited to join. We are tackling the task to inventory, assess, and develop the content of articles in the new <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_education_5cbe.html" title="Category:Alternative education">Category:Alternative education</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>The dilemna</b>: The term <i>Alternative school</i> and the article <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html" title="Alternative school">Alternative school</a> do not refer to the same thing. The article describes <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a> (while mixing it with the meaning of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_school.html" title="Independent school">Independent school</a>), while the <i>term</i> refers to schools for students with special needs, i.e., "at-risk" students, potential drop-outs, pregnant teens, returning students.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>A solution</b>: I proposed in project discussion that the content of the current Alt. school article be split and appropriately merged with the Alt. ed. and Ind. school articles, so that Alt. school can be used for the article about alternative or special-needs schools.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is little-to-no information regarding which term, <i>alternative</i> or <i>special needs</i>, is more common—it appears to be fairly equal, although <i>alternative</i> appears to be replacing the other, mainly because the word <i>special</i> has come to be used pejoritavely. However, the term <i>alternative education</i> is well established as the most common term used to describe all forms of non-traditional education, which <i>alt/special needs school</i> is a type of. If <i>special needs school</i> has negative connotations, and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">alternative education</a> has effectively covered the subject of educational alternatives, then it makes sense to use <i>alternative school</i> to cover the subject of special needs school. I'm sure that the appropriate use of redirects will sufficiently dispell any confusion about any of these subjects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to your question: "What evidence is there that 'special-needs school' is a more common meaning of the term than 'school practicing alternative education'?", there is no good answer. That kind of information is not tracked statistically. There is evidence, however, that a 'school practicing alternative education' cannot be adequately defined by a single type of school, <i>alternative school</i> or otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This was discussed. Only one other editor contributed to the discussion, with support. There were no objections. I proceeded. There was nothing illicit intended.

<dd>Thanks for the reasonable and prompt response. (And good work on the article on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">alternative education</a>, which I hadn't seen until recently; it is shaping up very nicely and is a great contribution.) In general, I think it would be better to leave a proposed merge/rewrite like this open to comment for a while before doing it, but perhaps your discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Alternative_education_1fe3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Alternative education">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Alternative education</a> has already reached most of the interested editors. I don't think you're correct, at least not generally, that the primary meaning of "the <i>term</i> [alternative school] refers to schools for students with special needs". Its meaning may vary depending on the context and the specific speaker (though this is obviously insufficient evidence, "special-needs school" is not what <i>I</i> mean when I say "alternative school"). In the absence of evidence to the contrary about the phrase's usage, I'd suggest that both meanings of the phrase -- "school practicing alternative education" and "school for special-needs students" -- need to be covered, and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguated</a> with prominent notices at the top of the articles. One good potential way to accomplish this might be to make "alternative school" into a pure disambiguation page, pointing to the article on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">alternative education</a> and another article on special-needs schools, where the content you placed here would (in my opinion) fit better. But perhaps we should wait a few days before completing the change, just in case other editors want to comment on this issue. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 22:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the "good work" on the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a> article. As a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Alternative_education_dbbd.html#Focus_articles" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Alternative education">focus</a> article in the new <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_education_5cbe.html" title="Category:Alternative education">Category:Alternative education</a>, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Alternative_education_dbbd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Alternative education">WikiProject Alternative education</a> participants have been pouring over it pretty thoroughly. I'm glad you like it. Although I do not agree <i>entirely</i> with your position on this, I would be okay with using <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html" title="Alternative school">Alternative school</a> as a disambiguation page. I am a little concerned with people confusing <i>special-needs</i> with <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">special education</a>, but if <i>special education</i> is actually a component of <i>special needs</i>, along with students with other kinds of obstacles (i.e., pregnancy), then maybe there is nothing to fret. Is this what you understand to relationship between the two to be? If so, I think we can make this work. I will direct the other project editors to this discussion for some additional input before we move on it.

<dd>I'm generally with Master Scott on this one. Special-needs school would be just as confusing, especially since many "alternative schools" are really for incorrigible discipline problems. We shouldn't have a dab page for only two meanings, but Rbellin is right that whatever we do we should have prominent dab notices at the top. If we can think of a better name for the alternative-schools article I'm open to change. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 00:54, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These articles will no doubt be affected by whatever our final decision: <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html" title="Alternative school">Alternative school</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">Special education</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_school.html" title="Special school">Special school</a>. If we add Special needs school, that's five. How many are needed for a dab? <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_needs.html" title="Special needs">Special needs</a> has already been redirected to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">Special education</a>. Is this accurate? The biggest problem that I am seeing is that we are lumping kids with developmental difficulties with kids with other obstacles (truancy, pregnancy, rehab from illness, etc.) together. I have never heard of putting them together in the same classes. Is it done this way? I can't imagine how that would work. I can see them being put in the same administrative category of Alternative education, but not the same physical classroom, i.e., Alternative school.

<dd>I think we've gotten all the input that we can hope to get. Most of the current content of this article has been covered--more accurately, and in more detail--in other existing articles. The information here is redundant, and not entirely accurate. Remember, there is no alternative education dictionary. Much of the vocabulary used is less than twenty years old and has not "settled" into easily discernible patterns. Alternative education itself is "headless", so there is no authority to turn to for a standard regarding terminology. Based on this and some further digging I've done, my recommendation would be to change this article to one about schools that cater to roughly three groups: <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">Special education</a>, Special-needs education (or, "high-risk"), and <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gifted_education.html" title="Gifted education">Gifted education</a>. The latter is generally covered by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter_school.html" title="Charter school">Charter schools</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet_school.html" title="Magnet school">Magnet schools</a>, and the like, but in some circumstances--like states without such programs--alternative schools serve them as well. Most of the info under <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html#Types_of_alternative_schools" title="Alternative school">Types of alternative schools</a> actually describes <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_school.html" title="Independent school">Independent schools</a>, and components of <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_choice.html" title="School choice">School choice</a>, and can be integrated into those articles.

<dd>While I'm basically okay with whatever other editors want to do with this article (as long as a prominent disambig notice points to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a>), I would still like to caution against the linguistically <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptive.html" title="Prescriptive">prescriptive</a> and narrow stance implicit in this last message. Remember, not everyone uses the phrase "alternative school" to mean the same thing you do. The current "Types of alternative school" section describes one valid and relatively common use of the phrase -- as I said above, it means "school practicing alternative education" -- and I see no evidence that this is, as you claim, the same meaning as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_school.html" title="Independent school">independent school</a>. I think the best alternative for this page may be to turn it into a pure disambiguation page rather than trying to cover some ad-hoc mixture of all the possible meanings of the phrase. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 03:57, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your concerns completely. Prescription is not my intent, just clarity. Making the task more difficult is the fact that in popular use, the phrase "alternative school" and the term <i>alternative school</i> have been attached to different things. The <i>phrase</i> "alternative school" is a noun with a descriptive adjective. It describes a school which teaches using alternative education. It could be phrased alternately as "school teaching alternatively", but this is awkward and inefficient grammar, so most choose the former, more susinct version. On the other hand, the term <i>alternative school</i> is a <a href="../../../n/o/u/Noun_phrase.html" title="Noun phrase">noun phrase</a> which is used to describe a specific kind of school. A noun phrase is treated as a unit, or a single noun. Similarly, and perhaps more obviously, the phrase "big apple", or "apple which is big", and the noun phrase term <i>Big Apple</i>, or New York City, are completely different. My point is this: An article, as it stands now, is using "alternative school" as a phrase. Most, if not all, of the things that make up this article are already covered elsewhere, and under more specific and appropriate terms. The info here is, in effect, "sqatting". And, since the disambiguation police have deemed a dab page with only two meanings inappropriate, then we are left with a homeless article about the term "alternative school". While I do recognize that you've already given your okay on this action, It sounded very begrudging. I have gone to detail here, in part, to ease your mind, at least a little, about my intentions. I am not trying to be a bully here, that is not my nature. I have no problem putting a dab statement at the top, but I'm not sure where it would point, as most of the content here is actually part of several other articles. Pointing it to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a> is okay, but <i>that</i> term will be used in the opening paragraph of the article and, possibly, a couple more times in the body, as <i>alternative school</i> is a type thereof.

<dd>I disagree. The articles need to be worked on a little more, but an alternative school and an alternative high school are a larger, more general topic about the schools generally and more specific topic about the high schools. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMacMan_b672.html" title="User:MrMacMan">MrMacMan</a> 23:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Alright so 3 people participated in a discussion about a possible merger and then the article gets redirected? I think it was a bit premature so I changed it back. I tend to agree they overlap a pretty significant degree, but lets see if that is a common perception before 'merging' it.

<dd>What would be the argument for keeping two separate articles? Wouldn't it make more sense to merge them and if it turns out that the high school section becomes highly differentiated - then make it a separate article. Seems like it should never have been a separate article in the first place. <a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENposs_32e4.html" title="User:Nposs">Nposs</a> 22:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
