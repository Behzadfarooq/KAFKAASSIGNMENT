<h2><span class="mw-headline">RV More of Snowspinner's Vandalism -- Discussion</span></h2>
<p>I have notice that <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a>'s recently vandalized several of my edits. I would like somebody to inform Snowspinner that vandalizism on Wikipedia is NOT permitted. I have reversed his vandalizism with the following edit summaries.</p>
<dl>
<dd>RV Snowspinner's Vandalism: The CamMenu template was deleted in TvD, not the infoboxes for the branches of AM articles. Nothing was manually recreated. Absolutely nothing!!!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RV Snowspinner's Vandalism: The CamMenu template was deleted in TvD. Infoboxes such as this have NOT been replaced by categories!!! Absolutely NOT!!!! This is a brand new infobox.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RV More of Snowspinner's Vandalism: This article has existed since April 2004. The time has past for making this type of radical change, just becuase you feel like vandalizing articles today.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RV More of Snowspinner's Vandalism: Snowspinner has committed a number of clearly document acts of deliberate vandalism. I wont let this article be another one of them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, I expect that more edit summaries will be necessary as Snowspinner's Vandalism continues.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have documented the goals and accomplishments of my recent editing activities on my talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:John_Gohde&amp;oldid=10225464#Status_of_Project_on_Alternative_Medicine_Tasks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:John_Gohde&amp;oldid=10225464#Status_of_Project_on_Alternative_Medicine_Tasks" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. And, currently am working on a write up as to why cateogories have NOT replace project infoboxes. I believe that I will finish it today.</p>
<p>I added this brand new infobox on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> a couple of weeks ago [(<b>03:05, 4 Feb 2005 John Gohde (Adding the Project on Alternative Medicine, very active Wikiproject, infobox.</b>)] in order to very publicly announce my new editing activities that have re-activated the project on alternative medicine. As <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> is a very public article being watched by a number of administrators and editors, I was waiting for a response to my edits. I have received none to date. In fact <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">User:Geni</a> has actually restored my edits there. Since, I received no rejection of <b>any</b> of my edits at <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> I have moved on to other areas and articles. I have yet to restore any infobox that was deleted by anybody. I do however plan on restoring a few project boxes that were wrongfully deleted by User:FoxFire and perhaps others, now an Adm, in the last phase of my editing activities.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no plans on re-adding CamMenu or any of the other wrongfully deleted project <b>templates</b> back to any of the articles, where they have have been deleted by somebody else.</p>
<p>I will of course continue to reverse any edit that is clearly vandalism because their assertions are factually incorrect and totally divorced from reality. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 19:41, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The CAM navigation boxes were deleted. Coming up with new CAM navigation boxes in a form where they now can't be deleted by a vote is not an acceptable solution. Furthermore, your infobox amounts to a link to a definition and a category link. This is not a useful infobox. These boxes have no place on articles. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 19:44, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Furthermore, your infobox amounts to a link to a definition and a category link.</b>&#160;??? Our infoboxes for the branches of AM articles classify the them several different ways. The hyperlinks merely provide additional optional information about our classification of that article. In other words, it explains our classification. You have deleted the CAM navigation template. Are you objecting to the recent addition of the CAM Article Index link to the category on alternative medicine or our classifications per NCCAM guidelines? -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 17:02, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, only the template Template:CamMenu was deleted. And, that template was a sub-part of the project's infoboxes in most cases. There were a few exceptions, like <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a>. And, as noted the new infobox that was placed in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> is in fact a brand new design that has been clearly here since Feb 4. It has clearly been acceptable to a number of editors and Adms who had voiced prior objections to the old template that was deleted months ago. Categories have clearly failed to replace project infoxboxes. And, as noted before your objections have no basis in fact or in reality. I will now complete my other write up beforing continuing reverting your vandalism of my edits, except for <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> which I will continue to revert. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 20:00, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think the thinktank tag was removed inappropriately (and frankly it was done for suspect reasons ... people find the templates useful and that the "policy" as currently phrased simply does not reflect current practice and does not have consensus approval. ... the fact of the matter is that many of the templates on Wikipedia:Navigational templates are popular and in wide use." Futhermore, User:Snowspinne states today point blank: "I'm at least willing to accept that it may not be policy.

<dd>The line between policy and guideline is minor, but as I understand it, or at least, as I used it above was that a policy is something enforced. That is to say, repeated violation of no personal attacks, any violation of the 3RR, things like that, you get banned for it. This is more in line with something in the manual of style. Nobody is going to get banned for creating a template that doesn't mesh with the guidelines. The template is just going to be removed, because it's not in the proper style for them. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:46, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Our Boxes are in Full Compliance</span></h3>
<p>As previously stated, all of the project on alternative medicine's branches of AM infoboxes are in full compliance with <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a> for no other reason than this guideline clearlys does not cover infoboxes. An infobox is quite different from an article series box.</p>
<p><i>"An infobox on Wikipedia is a consistently-formatted table which is present in articles with a common subject (An infobox is a generalization of a taxobox (from taxonomy) which summarizes information for an organism or group of organisms)."</i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Wikipedia%7EInfobox_113a.html" title="Wikipedia:Infobox">Wikipedia:Infobox</a> And, see our large branches of AM infobox at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infobox#Alternative_Medicine" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infobox#Alternative_Medicine" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Our large branches of AM infoboxes primarily exists to summarize information for a given branch of AM and for related branches of AM.</p>
<p>Second, our new box with a direct link to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_medicine_6932.html" title="Category:Alternative medicine">Category:Alternative medicine</a>, such as the one in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> is clearly not an Article series box as defined by that guideline. Our box, what ever you want to call it, is in effect a very visible version of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_medicine_6932.html" title="Category:Alternative medicine">Category:Alternative medicine</a>. IF anything this guideline recommends the use of categories which is precisely what our box uses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to point out that new visitors visit <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> using the default user skin. Using this skin, visitors are more likely to find <a href="../../../a/l/t/Talk%7EAlternative_medicine_d924.html" title="Talk:Alternative medicine">Talk:Alternative medicine</a>, which has a very visible link on the very top of the page and, thus, a direct link to our project pages then they are to find the hidden <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_medicine_6932.html" title="Category:Alternative medicine">Category:Alternative medicine</a> link which is shown on the very bottom of the web page. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 09:07, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Never the less, catagories are the way we, as a wikicommunity, have decided to go. Visitors will very quickly learn to find categories at the bottom of pages, and they will look for them there. An infobox that does nothing more than give info that can be found in categories is therefore redundant. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(The snott rake)</a> 09:46, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The important point being that this specific <b>guideline</b> does not in fact specifically prohibit our box since it is a direct link to a major category. Further, why don't we prohibit all those pictures, graphics, and <b>useless squiggles</b> in Wikipedia articles? I recall that the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iridology.html" title="Iridology">iridology</a> article is choking on graphics!!! This box is quite tiny, and a very reasonable approach to categories. <b>Last, and more importantly, guidelines unlike policy are optional rather than binging.</b> (See <i>Spinmeisters</i> comments above<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alternative_medicine#The_line_between_policy_and_guideline_is_minor" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alternative_medicine#The_line_between_policy_and_guideline_is_minor" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.) -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 11:09, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a> on 13 Feb and on 14 Feb 2005 voluntarily decided for no good reason to destroy the Philosophy of alternative medicine article, one of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject%7EAlternative_Medicine_ce35.html#Core_Project_Articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative Medicine">Core Project Articles</a> of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject%7EAlternative_Medicine_ce35.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative Medicine">Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative_Medicine</a> that was created by this project in April 2004. Snowspinner moved this article to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="List of topics in alternative medicine">List of topics in alternative medicine</a> in a manner that did not maintained the original links to it. In other words, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=List_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=List_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine" rel="nofollow">nothing links to this new article</a>.

I have previously attempted to moved the article back both on 13 Feb and on 14 Feb 2005, but Snowspinner has reversed it back to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="List of topics in alternative medicine">List of topics in alternative medicine</a> <i>sans</i> cross-links. Further, the Philosophy of alternative medicine article is now showing up as a completely different stub article. In other words, there are two articles physically in existence.

<dd>The reason was simple: The article that is now <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="List of topics in alternative medicine">List of topics in alternative medicine</a> was not an article on the philosophy of alternative medicine. It was thus misnamed. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 00:02, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have myself renamed many an article without destroying the cross-links. Further, a few of these core articles were in fact renamed dued to captialization problems without destroying any of the cross-links. Furthermore, the new name is not discriptive (ie, where is the <i>philosophy of alternative medicine</i> in the new title? And, why add a new stub article that uses the old name?). Furthermore, all of the articles in the Buddha project infobox are lists. Are you going to destroy those articles, too? Your explanation is not acceptable as it is totally irrational, in my opinion. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 00:17, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have figured out a quickfix to the mess created by <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a>.

The name of the article now has the word <b>List</b> in it, which presumably is why Snowspinner waited almost one year to change the name. Any more moves with a stub article rather than the standard re-direct will most certainly be contested by me as another case of deliberate vandalism/harrassment.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No, the confusion arises because you are both partly right and partly wrong</span></h2>
<p>Both statements in the disputed paragraph are at least partly wrong, as follows.</p>
<p><i>Many in the scientific community define alternative medicine as any treatment that has not been verified through peer-reviewed, controlled studies.</i> This is simply false. Most in the scientific community do not define alt med that way because it fails to distinguish conventional and alt med, since much of conventional medical practice has not been "verified through controlled studies."</p>
<p><i>This is in contrast with conventional medicine.</i> The real difference between conventional and alt med lies in the nature of the theory and evidence for the practice. Conventional practice is (1) compatible with known scientific facts and theories, and (2) controlled trials are universally accepted as the highest level of evidence of efficacy. In contrast, the practices of alt med are often (1) based on theories incompatible with the rest of our scientific understanding of the physical world, and (2) controlled trials, falsifiable hypotheses, and compatibility with known science are nearly universally rejected as evidence of efficacy or lack thereof by alt med practitioners.</p>

<dd>Regarding <i>"Many in the scientific community define alternative medicine as any treatment that has not been verified through peer-reviewed, controlled studies."</i> I agree that that assertion is false and should be changed.

<dd>My proposal was in the immediately succeeding paragraph. <i>Alternative medicine is distinguishable from conventional, scientific medicine, by one or both (usually both) of the following characteristics:</i></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>it is based on theories incompatible with our current understanding of our current understanding of the material world: biology, chemistry, and/or physics;</li>
<li>its practitioners reject scientific measures of efficacy (controlled experiments, falsifiable hypotheses, refutable prediction) or lack of efficacy, and rarely support scientific investigation of the phenomenon.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the several difficulties of improving this article is Mr Gohde's peculiar insistence upon broadening the definition of alternative medicine to the point of meaninglessness by claiming that it includes noncontroversial aspects of prevention, wellness, and medical care-- sort of like arguing that one should vote Republican instead of Democratic because Republicans are willing to participate in peaceful elections instead of because of what makes Republicans <i>different</i> from Democrats. I don't really blame him for not wanting to defend all the nonsensical aspects of alt med, but his problem is that most doctors don't have any problem with the things he wants to defend (e.g., the value of eating right, or the 99% of modern osteopathic practice that is indistinguishable from conventional medicine) and don't even consider it alt med anymore. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:04, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now, now, let's eschew invidious stereotypes. It is obvious to most people that there are both biological and social dimensions to most diseases. Optimal care pays attention to both dimensions. The OBSSR was set up to support investigation into psychosocial dimensions. It never occurred to me that a psychosocial perspective was alt med. The OBSSR isnt part of NICCAM and isn't hampered by the same obstacles in alt med culture to scientific investigation of the topic. There are only a couple of MDs who have been writing here, and I suspect that we tend to write about what we have the most expertise about. Our medical coverage is very spotty and uneven with a wide range of quality, so don't make too much about our not writing about this-- we haven't written about the NIDDK either.</p>
<p>Furthemore, with respect to the health screening question: the core of medicine and medical practice is the attempt to alleviate illness for an individual patient, not preventive medicine. Preventive medicine has developed fairly recently as an aspect of primary care in the last few decades. Immunizations are probably the most striking success in terms of a preventive treatment administered in the context of an individual doctor-patient relationship. It isn't that doctors don't think it is better to prevent disease than treat it, but that isn't what 99% of us do. An example in my specialty is the recent epidemic of type 2 diabetes in children. The rise appears to be a result of changing cultural practices that have made children less physically active and consuming an unhealthy diet. The best prevention would occur long before the child was referred to me and would consist of a healthy diet and minimal television. It takes an entirely different kind of person, with different training and skills, to work on the social and cultural basis of this problem than it does to treat the diabetes when it appears. There is certainly no conflict between preventing diabetes and treating it--- just like there is no conflict between improving schooling and home environments to prevent crime-- improving schooling and home environments is important but no one expects the police to do it. I have never understood why some alt med proponents think doctors are somehow doing the wrong thing because we treat individual people when they get sick and come to us, instead of somehow preventing something that is not in <i>our</i> power to prevent. Or am I missing the point of your questions? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 04:06, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:49, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Biopsychosocial interventions are just as much a part of alternative medicine as 19th century homeopathy is.

<p>The insult is unwarranted and your assertion is bizarre. If most practitioners, both conventional and alternative, agree that the psychosocial dimension to a patient's health is important, where is the argument? It makes no sense to call the aspects of psychosocial care that are compatible and congruent with science "alternative" if they are supported by everyone. There are, however, specifically alt med forms of psychosocial care, just like there are alt med treatments for diabetes. They are the ones that fall into the definition I offered: they are incompatible with our current scientific understanding and their proponents reject controlled trials as evidence that they work or don't work. An example of a specifically alt med psychosocial treatment is the forehead tapping treatment for trauma. It makes no sense, fits with nothing we know about the way the mind works, and its proponents reject the idea that a controlled trial might demonstrate its lack of efficacy.</p>
<p>As a general point of debate etiquette, it is both annoying and an admission of intellectual and logical bankruptcy when you use the phrase "you people" and proceed to argue against something that your opponent didn't claim.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Benedetti <i>et al.</i> (2003) - Discussion regarding "the placebo effect"</span></h2>
<p>I am not sure this is the best choice of paper to cite as evidence of the efficacy of the placebo effect.</p>
<p>It uses a less conventional definition of the "placebo effect". Specifically, in this paper, conventional medical treatment is given or removed without the knowledge of the patient, and their responses are compared with patients to whom treatment is given or removed with an explanation of what treatment they are undergoing and what results would be expected. Conventional placebo-controlled studies compare the reactions of patients that receive or do not receive treatment, but all believe that they are receiving appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Even in the discussion of the paper, Benedetti <i>et al.</i> note that it "is probably wrong to call placebo effect the difference between open and hidden treatments, since no placebos are given". They also conclude that "the open-hidden approach [which is how they refer to the experimental technique that they present in this paper] might be a valid complement to the classic placebo-controlled studies".</p>
<p>It's certainly an interesting paper, and should be referred to in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a> article, but it might be better if the citation in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> was a traditional placebo-controlled study, in my view. - <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykReeve_0a97.html" title="User:MykReeve">MykReeve</a> 11:56, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, one paper does not, and no one paper will ever, conclude that placebo effects are '<b>always'</b> beneficial, and the paper does not state this at any point. All this paper indicates is that among the sample sets, this definition of the placebo effect was generally observed to be effective.</dd>

<dd>I am not going to descend into an edit war on this subject with <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a>, over his insistence on the use of the word <i>always</i>, and claims that its removal is "crap that tears down rather than builds up this article".

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Would one occurence of the placebo effect being ineffective reduce the significance of this paper, or indeed the placebo effect? Of course not. But it does mean that the word <i>always</i> doesn't apply.

Firstly, Benedetti <i>et al.</i> clearly do not state this in their paper. And, secondly, no scientific paper would make such a claim. Are there really no examples of the placebo effect not being observed in the case of an individual? If there is even a single one, then the word "always" does not apply. This, as stated above, does not affect the significance of either the paper's findings, or the validity of the placebo effect as a signficant phenomenon.</dd>

<dd>You obviously have not thought through this. The really funny thing about this whole totally unnecessary affair is that the original version was simply defining the placebo effect. To state that the use of <b>always</b> is incorrect is to state that you believe that in alternative medicine the placebo effect does not work. And, is tantamount to not attributing any successes in alternative medicine to the placebo effect.

<dd>John, that’s a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_alternative.html" title="False alternative">false alternative</a>. The alternative is not a choice between the placebo effect existing or alternative medicine being effective. The reason most AM treatment is ineffective is because the placebo effect exists. Regarding your most recent addition: “While a patient is being treated, however, the patient's knowledge of treatment, otherwise known as the placebo effect, is beneficial.” First of all, “the patient’s knowledge of treatment” is NOT the definition of “placebo effect”. Secondly, the placebo effect MAY be beneficial to a patient receiving treatment, but not always. It is certainly not beneficial for a patient to spend thousands of dollars on some treatment when they could have received the same results with a sugar pill costing pennies. --<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 10:27, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Advocate of AM says things can't be measured</span></h3>
<p>Personally as a licensed practitioner of an "alternative medicine", Chinese Medicine in my case, I find this article to be biased and ill informed. Using Chinese Medicine as an example I would like to point out the Alternative medicine is not in conflict with Western Drug Based medicine, and it has 2,000 years of scholarly discussion to support it's theories. The fact that many things can NOT be measured by blinded studies, and placebo controlled experiments does not negate their existence. Example - LOVE. I have yet to hear about a compassion meter, but no serious healer would deny the importance of compassion to the process of healing. --Jeffrey Goodman 03:55, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You must be a humor writer, attempting to show why certain alternative medicine advocates are silly. It would be dangerously irresponsible to explicitly deny the proven use of the scientific method, and instead use wishful thinking about "LOVE" and other non-testable and non-measurable phenomenon to "heal" one's patients. This "technique" always leads to people becoming sicker, or even dying, and that is no joke. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Chinese traditional medicine does <i>not</i> have 2,000 years of critical scholarly discussion. That kind of extremist claim is akin to the claim made by religious fundamentalists that the Bible, Quran or other scripture is useful for predicting modern scientific and medical discoveries. Sure, I understand why some people get so wrapped up in their cultural or religious worldviews, and worship the "ultimate widsom" of their ancient, wiser ancestors. They imagine that everything of worth that can be discovered is already in their culture's ancient texts - even thought those ancient writers themselves made no such claim. This tendency is not uncommon, and can be found among Jews, Muslims, Christians, adherents of traditional Chinese belief systems, etc. But understanding this common psychological tendency doesn't make the error any less dangerous. Relying on the religious-cultural teachings of the ancient Chinese, or of the ancient whomevers, to treat actual diseases can make people sick, prevent them from getting proper medical care, and has in fact led to death. This is well documented. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Writing attacks against studying whether or not a therapy actually works (i.e. controlled studies) shows that one acutally is not interested in helping a patient. If that was the goal, then why would certain alternative health advocates be so terrified of a fair and open test of their proposed treatments? Their attacks on testing their treatments betrays their real agenda: They want to feel like they possess some "ultimate truth", and see everyone else as the heretic who must be defeated. This isn't medicine, nor is it alternative medicine. It is simply a different form of religious fundamentalism, one that causes medical damage - and in extreme cases, even death. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 13:43, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2 things - I did not say things cannot be measured -I said things which can be measured by "scientific" means are not the only things which are real. Second Chinese medicine does have a longer larger body of scholarly discussion than those who are involved in this "psuedo scientific medical" ranting seem to be knowledgeable about. I detect there is some fundamentalism here and I have no reason to fight with people whose minds are clearly set to see things in such good vs evil ways. I am not interested in struggles with persons who would characterise me as a "humor writer' etc. So I think I check in on this article in a year or so to see if there is something I can contribute. Jeffrey Goodman</p>
<dl>
<dd>When it comes to treating a disease, we must deal with things that can be measured by scientific means. Anything in the physical universe in which we live is measurable by physical means. Anything else is supernatural or a religious miracle. It confuses the issue to talk about measuring "love" or anything like that. While I know that love is "real" (I am in love with someone) I also know that this love is actually a neural and hormonal state within my brain. It is not some extra "force" or "power", as many New-Agers imagine, that can be used to treat or heal disease. Of course - as mainstream medical science acknowledges - the love that one gives and receives may significantly affect one's mental state. As mainstream science acknowledges, one's mental state can have a real effect on one's body. The fascinating science of the mind-body connection has been a slowly growing part of conventional science for a generation now, and the pace of research on this useful topic is only increasing. In this sense much of which was once considered alternative has now become mainstream. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>Which I changed to the following in April 2004.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a> is a problem <b>only</b> when conducting research. When it comes to actually treating patients the placebo effect always benefits the patient (Benedetti <i>et al.</i> 2003).

<dl>
<dd>This is today's version:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When a patient benefits from alternative medical treatment, the benefit can be accounted for by a number of different factors: the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a>, the treatment itself, or from a combination of both. Hence, the placebo effect is really only a problem when conducting research, because when a patient benefits from it, it is obviously a positive factor that aids a patient's recovery. Furthermore, the <i>"close interaction of the health care provider with his or her patient is likely to enhance the perception of the treatment that is being performed."</i>(Benedetti et al. 2003). Alternative medicine strives to capitalize on this effect, while medical doctors generally consider the placebo effect only to be a negative factor that should be minimized during treatment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This will need to be changed. The following reasons come to mind: 1) The assertion that "the treatment itself" may benefit the recipient of an alternative treatment is a matter of opinion. 2)The assertion that "the placebo effect is really only a problem when conducting research" is a matter of opinion. The placebo effect is a conclusion reached by research, not a problem to research. 3)The assertion that the placebo effect is "obviously a positive factor that aids a patient's recovery" is a matter of opinion. This is simply not an absolute in every context. 4)The Benedetti quote is provided without specific context or reference to mislead the reader. 5)The assertion that "medical doctors generally consider the placebo effect only to be a negative factor that should be minimized during treatment" is false. Medical doctors often use the placebo effect to their advantage when and where applicable. --<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 16:33, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>there is more legitimacy to one than the other; this is in violation of basic precepts of modern medicine and science, which acknowledge that the state of the art is still very primitive.</li>
<li>All conventional medicine comes from peer-reviewed, golden standard studies. That's not accurate - much if not most of medical care comes from clinical experience, which may or may not find confirmation through studies. Further, there is lots of experimental medicine within conventional medicine that requires further study</li>
<li>That it's a shortcoming of "alternative" medicine that there is a shortage of studies. The truth is that funding is much more difficult to obtain for such treatments because of the economics of the health industry.</li>

<dd>Changing physician to medical doctor? I have better things to do with my time. I believe that <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">User:Larry Sanger</a> published an article on this type of editing at the end of last year. I am going to take a walk in the sunshine.

<p>Leifern writes "All conventional medicine comes from peer-reviewed, golden standard studies. That's not accurate - much if not most of medical care comes from clinical experience, which may or may not find confirmation through studies. Further, there is lots of experimental medicine within conventional medicine that requires further study."</p>
<dl>
<dd>But isn't this further study precisely what differentiates conventional medicine from alternative medicine. Physicians, scientists and medical doctors actually do studies of new therapies and drugs. It takes time and money to set up peer-reviewed studies, especially if you want a large, double-blind peer-review, but the point is that the setting up and carrying out of such studies is the defining line between alternative medicine and conventional medicine. In fact, alternative medicine <i>by definition</i> is the set of techniques which are practiced by people who cannot offer any controlled, peer-reviewed studies, and usually refuse to do so. On those rare occasions when someone says that their alternative medical technique has been studied by a number of groups in controlled experiments, then at this point the technique ceases to be alternative. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that most adherents of alternative medicine sadly see themselves at war with science and medicine. The converse, however, is not true. Scientists and doctors don't really care at all whether a technique is labelled "alternative" or not. They only care about "Is this real, or just a placebo effect." As such, medical doctors and scientists <i>constantly</i> test techniques that you may be thinking of as "alternative". For instance, the medical properties of the Pacific Yew tree were confirmed by the discovery of the anti-cancer drug <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxol.html" title="Taxol">Taxol</a>, and it was mainstream science in peer-reviewed journals that showed the effectiveness of biofeedback in a number of situations. Hundreds of drugs now used by mainstream doctors were at one time "alternative" remedies. I am not aware of any bias that mainstream science has towards testing claims put forth by adherents of alternative medicine. The only bias I am aware of is that adherents of alternative medicine demand that we accept their claims without proof. I believe that the article describes this accurately and in accord with <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 01:34, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not as if "adherents to alternative medicine" reject double-blind studies, either. But as anyone who has been close to clinical studies will confirm, they are very difficult to design and execute; and even when they're done well, the results are constantly questioned. On top of that, most trials only measure long-term effects. Long-term effects, causality of adverse events, etc., all contribute to a great deal of uncertainty about "conventional medicine." I am not sure if there is a single definition of "conventional" and "alternative" medicine, unless you're dealing with extreme examples on both ends. In the meantime, this article should be recognizable to people on both sides of the debate, as it were. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 01:49, 2005 Apr 20 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, here is some disagreement, but then agreement: Unfortunately, most adherents of alternative medicine <i>do reject</i> double blind studies. That is precisely why their methods are "alternative". Think of all the crystal healing claims, crystal power claims, pyramid power claims, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iridology.html" title="Iridology">iridology</a>, rhinocerous horn elixirs, and "energy-charged" water therapies. None of the people promoting these therapies have anything to do with any form of blind studies or scientific peer review. In fact, they often rage against science in general.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in what way are you defining "alternative"? It seems to me that the subject you are writing about is very different from the content of most alternative medicine articles on Wikipedia. You seem to be writing more on proto-medicine, on new techniques that have not yet been fully evaluted by multiple double-blind studies. Well, you would be correct. There are a lot of medical techniques out there that are not pseudoscience, but are also not yet proven or disproven. It takes many people many years to fully test new therapies, especially when effects are subtle, or take years to realize. Some within conventional medicine are too quick to dismiss new thinking. (They are correct not to blindly accept new claims; <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_skepticism.html" title="Scientific skepticism">scientific skepticism</a> is healthy. But some move from scientific skepticism to cynicism, which is not scientific.)</p>
<p>Leifern's comments bring me to a problem that I have had with this specific article for some time. <i>There is no such technique as "alternative medicine".</i> Similarly, there is no such technique as "conventional medicine". It makes little sense to have an article arguing data for or against "alternative medicine", as a whole, in the same way it makes little sense to have an article arguing data for or against "conventional medicine". When we go to a hospital to treat asthma, does the doctor order "One unit of medicine for the patient!" Nope. The doctor orders a specific drug, to be given in a specific fashion. Well, one can have an article analyzing evidence for and against any one given approach. The same is true for the very wide set of therapies and treatments that are considered "alternative".</p>
<p>Thus, maybe this article should remove all sections on data for or against alternative medicine. We can have a list of links to alternative medicine topics, each of which can be evaluted individually within their own article. This article could concentrate on defining the term: Who uses this term, and how do they use it? Thoughts? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:27, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that is an excellent idea! How do we put it to a vote?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The validity of any particular therapy, whether "alternative" or "conventional", should stand or fall by its own merits... not by generalized support or criticism for the broader category. In and of themselves, "alternative" and "conventional" medicine have no merits. Although it may be possible to <i>briefly</i> state generalized support and criticism of the broader categories (e.g. <i>"Critics of alternative medicine generally cite issues of safety and efficacy among <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_alternative_medicine_techniques.html" title="List of alternative medicine techniques">the various therapies</a>."</i>), the current state of this article is a mess because it keeps getting expanded by details that have more relevance to articles about the individual therapies. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 04:48, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Edwardian, the good news is that we do not need to put this proposal to a vote. We aren't changing the topic of the article. We would only be removing information that is not really relevant to this specific article. Instead, we would direct people to articles where such specific information would better be incorporated. Generally when we do change the content of an article like this it is best to discuss it on the Talk pages first. Since in the past week no one has had any problem with it, we can start making such changes right away. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 18:29, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's do it! I do think we will still need to include a <b>brief</b> statement of why some turn to alternative therapies and why others reject them, but much of this can go. I think we should start by weeding out the information in the Criticism section so that those in favor of alternative medical therapies can see we are cleaning our own house first. Should we archive this and discuss what's next? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 19:22, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that any particular therapy can be evaluated on its individual merits. Beyond that, however, there are definite differences in overall approach between what's loosely called "alternative" and what's loosely called "conventional" or "orthodox". We can usefully explain those differences, and the arguments for and against each general approach. This article shouldn't try to get into the pros and cons of particular therapies. By and large, though, it doesn't. It's useful to mention in passing that the scientific establishment rejects some alternative therapies, like homeopathy, as a violation of the laws of physics. That point is elaborated in the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> article, along with homeopaths' responses to the argument. For this article, the passing mention of the issue is useful as an illustration of this type of dispute. In sum, I think the article as it now stands handles these issues fairly well. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 03:17, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
