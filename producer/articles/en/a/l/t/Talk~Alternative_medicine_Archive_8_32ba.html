<h2><span class="mw-headline">We need something on the history of the classification "Alternative medicine"</span></h2>
<p>The following was posted to my talk page by User:68.236.3.21. I'm posting it here for discussion. I don't personally agree with the idea of giving Mr-Natural-Health apoplexy, by the way. But I <i>do</i> agree we need something on the history of the term "alternative medicine." - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:59, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>It may also be described as "diagnosis, treatment, or therapy which can be provided legally by persons who are not licensed to diagnose and treat illness" — although practitioners are frequently so licensed.</i></p>
<p>I offer you a fuller explication of the point to use as you see fit:</p>
<p>Much of alternative medicine might accurately be described as medicine practiced by persons not licensed to practice medicine. Most states and legal jurisdictions provide licensure of those legally permitted to practice medicine, usually defined as the diagnosis and treatment of disease, usually by prescribing drugs or performing surgery. The laws were originally enacted to prevent inadequately trained practitioners or those using theories and ideas considered of no value from holding themselves out as physicians. In the US, before licensure laws, homeopaths, naturopaths, and many other practitioners of what would now be considered "alternative medicine" held themselves out to the public as physicians. To some extent this legal distinction still provides a valid perspective on the whole field, at least partly explaining a number of phenomena. Here are two examples of phenomena that arise at least in part from the licensing laws or their history:</p>
<p>1. If you look at the websites, books, advertising literature, and products sold by many if not most alt med practitioners, you will find notices to the effect that their device, advice, product, or treatment “is not intended for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.” Much chiropractic literature for much of the last few decades explicitly claimed to be treating subluxations, not disease, to avoid being prosecuted for “practicing medicine without a license.” It simply illustrates my point that the disavowal is usually is contradicted by the explicit or implicit claims made by the same practitioner or product.</p>
<p>2. The same phenomena perhaps tainted some treatment methods for real physicians: “if someone else could do it without a license, it can’t be worth as much to the patient as something only I can do.” This is obviously an exaggeration, but I suspect had and has some validity as an explanation for some of the resistance to the less outre’ alt med ideas. In other words, I was trying to make the point that much of what defines and characterizes alt med and especially the hostility between the alt med practitioners and real physicians arises from these social and legal constraints. I think it is a fairly important aspect of the whole topic.</p>
<p>3. A related point, which we didn’t even get to, and will really give MNH apoplexy, is the definition of “natural.” If you watch the alt med claims and advertising you slowly realize that the only thing that all the treatments described as “natural” have in common is that they can be administered, sold, or advocated without a license to practice medicine. There is no other sense of the word as broadly applicable to all the bizarre, loony, artificial, and often synthetic or factory-made alt med products and practices that are claimed to be “natural.”</p>
<p>When MNH first denied the original sentence, which is fairly objectively supportable, I thought he was doing so on the basis that “medicine” shouldn’t be defined as narrowly as the licensure laws do. However, he quickly demonstrated that his opposition was far less intelligible, defensible, or discussable. I don’t know if heidimo understands that this was the original point of the sentence, or would concede it if she did. I suspect she might, unless she is simply too invested in opposing it. I have to agree with her that when MNH appended “although practitioners are frequently so licensed” it rendered the sentence confused if not nonsensical without further clarification. Does the clause refer to licensed physicians prescribing alt med treatments or does it claim that a naturopath or massage or chiropractic license is the same as a license to practice medicine, or did he mean something I can’t even guess?</p>
<p>You may repaint this with HMS and sail it as you wish, and perhaps even remove it from this harbor, as I wish to remain a noncombatant if not neutral in sympathy. - User:68.236.3.21</p>

I say that the references to cbt do not belong in this article, as it is a main branch of psychology, not a fringe method, and to class it as alternative would require one to put all methods of psychology into this document. I shall wait a couple of days for comments, and then remove the reference in this article as well as in <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_Therapy_8c7e.html" title="Cognitive Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>- <a href="../../../x/g/k/User%7EXgkkp_7557.html" title="User:Xgkkp">Xgkkp</a> 16:17, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - the archives are there for searching. Searching the archives will reveal only one or two references to the word "cognitive", and both are brief comments as part of a different discussion. Also, will you pay attention to the sign at the top of the page that says "Talk:" - this is a talk page, to discuss topics. I <i>did not</i> just edit the main page. And changing title headings<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AAlternative_medicine&amp;diff=3988131&amp;oldid=3988032" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AAlternative_medicine&amp;diff=3988131&amp;oldid=3988032" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> seems overly inflammatory to me.

I propose removing the paragraph <i>"Psychologists provide alternative medical services when they use biofeedback, hypnotherapy, or cognitive behavior therapy to treat a medical condition. A relatively new field in psychology is health psychology."</i> (In section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine#Branches_of_alternative_medicine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine#Branches_of_alternative_medicine" rel="nofollow">Branches of alternative medicine</a>), given it seems out of place with the lists, and also apart from <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_therapy.html" title="Cognitive therapy">Cognitive therapy</a> (which the general consensus seems to agree doesn't belong) and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_psychology.html" title="Health psychology">health psychology</a> (I don't know enough about this to decide if it is AM or not), are already listed in the previous block. So, I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_psychology.html" title="Health psychology">Health psychology</a> to the 'Other branches' list below it</li>
<li>Remove the paragraph: <i>"Psychologists provide alternative medical services when they use biofeedback, hypnotherapy, or cognitive behavior therapy to treat a medical condition. A relatively new field in psychology is health psychology."</i></li>

<dd>With due respect, Xgkkp, I believe that John is correct, although he hasn't taken much trouble to explain. I read that paragraph to mean that cognitive behavior therapy is considered alternative medicine when it is used to treat a <i>physical illness</i> as opposed to its usual, noncontroversial use in treating psychological disorder. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 01:11, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Right, good, someone actually making a proper argument against the idea. (and I believe 'hasn't taken much trouble' is an understatement!) - I read it to mean that Cognitive therapy was an alternative medicine. Perhaps it need re-phrasing, but in any case I think it seems out of place in between lists of alternative medicine treatments. And you must agree, at least, that biofeedback and hypnotherapy don't need to be there as they are in the list about 5 lines above too. perhaps something like <i>Cognitive therapy can also be used as an alternative medicine when used to treat a physical injury instead of it's usual use in treating psychological disorders</i> (and move it to the end of that section, out of the way of the lists?) - <a href="../../../x/g/k/User%7EXgkkp_7557.html" title="User:Xgkkp">Xgkkp</a> 01:56, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, this is the problem, and the reason there is a dispute. Your idea of resolved seems to be "I get my own way", or pushing the blame onto other people, and unless that changes, I don't see this article being unprotected any time soon. The few times that you do engage in discussion on talk pages, it seems like you are more interested in throwing personal insults than serious discussion. If you can accept that perhaps your edits can be wrong <i>sometimes</i> (You do also make valuable contributions sometimes), then I'm sure things can be worked out without the AC having to take more serious action. Try and present an argument, rather than resorting to "quoting" hearsay, like: <i>As everyone knows, RK likes to vandalize alternative medicine.</i> - statements like that are never going to help anything.

<dd>I don't do things <i>before</i> I think of them! (Sorry I'm not a timelord). I don't think you understand the situation here MNH. Let me spell it out to you. The article is currently protected on RK's version. If you want your support section back in, you have to stop arguing about things like when I <i>could</i> have created a temporary page and start actually making edits to that temporary page. <i>If</i> nearly everyone agrees that your edits are good <i>then</i> I will add them back into the article. I won't unprotect it, I'll edit a protected page. This means RK (or anyone) will not be able to revert. This is an unusual step, I don't think anyone has proposed this type of solution to an edit war before, and since admins can be desyopped for editing a protected page not without some personal risk. However I am quite prepared to do it, provided I get agreement. So you have a choice. Either you make the edits to the temp page, discuss them with all corncerned, get agreement, and get what you want back in the main article, or you don't make any edits, don't discuss the article and have the main article page stay at RK's version for as long as it takes.

However, I am also not a victim, in the respect that from the beginning I have been prepared to discuss the changes I wanted <b>before, not after</b> making them. Perhaps on articles like this, if <b>everyone</b> worked through it with that method there would be less revert/edit wars, and the page needn't be protected, though the discussion needs to be serious, not just personal attacks and presenting 'proof' as a personal attack. Also note that changes can still be made by the admins, previewed through the temporary page . Several potentially valuable changes have already been made to the temp page, and I remain optimistic that they will be integrated into the main article in the future. - <a href="../../../x/g/k/User%7EXgkkp_7557.html" title="User:Xgkkp">Xgkkp</a> 20:30, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>John I am going to ignore your condition that RK <i>has</i> to participate. I cannot <i>force</i> him to participate in this process if he doesn't want to. However if he chooses not to then he gets no say in how the article looks because it's protected. So it is in his interest too. As for the page being uprotected in a few days, I think that very unlikely. You'd have to find an admin willing to do that for you,(any admin worth their salt will read this page first). So let's get going on reaching a satisfactory compromise. Since it's the support section that you are objecting to most, I propose we start with that. I've copied the section from the article prior the RK's edit into the talk page of the temp article. I suggest you take a look and incorporate what you want back into the article. Everyone else, please take a look, if you happy say so on the talk page, or here. If your not happy make any changes you think are needed. I'll give it a couple of days, and assuming it's all settled I'll edit the real article.</p>
<p>One last note, I think it best if I do not edit the temp article myself at all. Just to protect myself from any accusations of wrong doing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 21:36, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to add - it is longstanding policy that anyone can request verification for any part of an article. John - it is not your place to tell RK to support his deletions, the onus is on you to show that they belong. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 21:49, Jun 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I most certainly do not have to defend every line of text currently existing in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a>, if somebody from out of nowhere arbitrarily decides to delete large chunks of text. That is what reverts are for. Reverts are made all the time. There is a 3 revert rule a day you know. Large deletions of text automatically calls for a revert, IMHO.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nor, am I required to waste huge amounts of time talkimg with editors who are only capable of posting unsupported garbage to articles because they erroneously think that <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> gives them a right to trash topics that they think is <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">quackery</a>.

I have followed through, while RK has yet to. Everybody else on this thread is violating Wikipedia guidelines by treating this talk page as a newsgroup, IMHO. That especially applies to TK who should kindly get lost and mind her own business. I am here ready to discuss with RK, but he is not. That is the only point that counts, here.</dd>

<dd>You're actually wrong on that one - per <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, the support section should not <i>provide</i> support - it should list <i>common arguments in support</i>.

<dd>He is also wrong about himself and RK being the only parties to the dispute. Wikipedia is a collaborative project, <i>everyone</i> gets to have a say. Plus the three revert rule is to prevent excessive revert wars, it is not there to say "it's ok to make three reverts a day" more like "it is certainly not ok to make more than three revers a day".As for wasting time, i would argue that discussing whether you will or not waste time actually takes longer than making the edits to the temp article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 10:47, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Instead, I "Vote" for the version from before MNH's recent edits.

<dd>Well, if it is all the same to you, if it is going to be a group effort then I might as well wait until the article is unprotected. Currently, I am working on a major addition to my website that will consist of a presentation of alternative medicine as history during 19th century Europe and America. You know stuff that is based on historical fact, rather than hot air. You guys should feel free to continue editing this article in a never ending spiral of circular editing. Personally, I have better things to do than work on this nonsense. I mean really! Changing the levels of indention so that support paragraphs wont actually appear to be support?
