<dd>This seems to be contradictory - complementary medicine can't <i>also</i> be alternative medicine.

<p>[This link] was removed from the article by user Steth, with the justification "Rmv private link seeking donations of highly marginalizing, editorialized, subjective opinion "articles" by ex-psychiatrist not trained in any of the fields criticized". A brief overview on the page, however, shows that for example the Acupuncture article has plentiful references to well-renowned journals. It's tough for me to judge if the information is biased or lacking in any of the respects that Steth mentioned, though. Could anyone check, and re-add the link if justifiable?

<p>Despite <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a> in trying to make this page more accessable, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=88189758&amp;oldid=87771842" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=88189758&amp;oldid=87771842" rel="nofollow">edit</a> was reverted. Apparently, I have to achieve consensus before I can alter the page. Well, here's my point:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intro states that there are proponents of evidence-based medicine who don't distinguish between conventional and alternative medicine.</li>
<li>There is then a rambling section called "Alternative definition" which is centered around Richard Dawkin's quote on alternative medicine, and is substantively the same as what the "proponents of evidence-based medicine" say.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't believe we need this "alternative definition" section, as it simply repeats what the lead section has to say. Furthermore, as there are plenty of medical doctors to reference for this position, we don't need a populist non-medical doctor such as Dawkins. Finally, I think such a contentious criticism of alternative medicine should be taken out of the lead section altogether.</p>
<p>So, may I put my edit back?</p>

<hr />
<p>Strange, that most of the information on definitions in this section is from opponents to alternative medicine. This section should have instead information about distinguishing alt med from mainstream or allopathic med, with several different takes on the matter.</p>
<p>There should be another section discussing the issues of validity and evidence, as it applies to both CAM and conventional med. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by V.B.

<dd>Most of the section is basically a critique (or more like, a dismissal) of alternative medicine as invalid. If that's what you want here, then I think it should be so labeled to alert the reader to its nature. But it seems to me, that in an entry on "alternative medicine", sypporters ought to have a right of rebuttal, to say the least. <small>—V.B. 01:28, 3 March 2007 (UTC)V.B.</small></dd>

<dd><small>I reviewed every statement in the article under consideration and came to the conclusion that nothing was worth including - either because it was already in this article, or because the material did not meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policies. For your edification, here is my reasoning:</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>The term is very debated within the scientific arena, since it has been mainly used in public health discourse (mostly among physicians and sociologists) only in US and UK during the last decades.</i></small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>Other continental European scientific communities -- with even a much longer history in traditional medicine or herbal medicine (such us Germany or France)-- do not know this term, neither do they use it.</i></small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>I agree that "alternative medicine", "complementary medicine" and CAM are recent neologisms to describe a wide range of techniques, many of which are several centuries old and come from around the world. A reference to a dictionary which has tried to find the earliest printed reference would be a good thing. However, the above text is not acceptable for providing such a history section. It doesn't give verifiable facts, nor references. It's just a rant. I've tried to find references to the first usages of the terms, but I've come up blank. I will check with an OED subscriber later today. But until someone can find a verifiable source of the history of the terms, it's not a good idea to put it into the article.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>The National Institute of Health in the US defines "Complemntary and Alternative Medicine" (CAM) as "a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine".</i></small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Already in the article. It's also wrongly attributed - the NIH themselves don't define CAM like that, their NCCAM division do.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>The main problem that most scientists have with this terminology is that the CAM definition is not sufficiently culturally senstive, since what is "alternative" and/or "complementary" towards a pre-existing medical tradition/school can be very different in different cultures of the world. Paradoxically, industrial "pharmaceuticals" could also be seen as CAMs within the context of traditional medicine/traditional healers in Africa or even among Traditional Chinese Medicine.</i></small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>"Most scientists" is an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Attributing_and_substantiating_biased_statements" title="WP:NPOV">unattributed claim</a>, or "<a href="../../../e/i/n/User%7EEinsidler_Some_argue_910c.html" title="User:Einsidler/Some argue">some argue</a>" by any other name. This paragraph is simply an attack on the definition, not grounded in verifiable references. It reads to me like original research.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>Moreover, the list of what is considered to be CAM can change continually, as those therapies that are proven to be safe and effective become adopted into conventional health care and as new approaches to health care emerge.</i></small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Already in the article.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>According to the NIH (National Institutes of Health): 1. complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine. An example of a complementary therapy is using aromatherapy to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery; 2. alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a conventional doctor. A less extreme example would be choosing an echinacea medicine from a naturopath, for hayfever, rather than an NSAID pharmaceutical or conventional doctor recommendation/prescription.</i></small></dd>

<dl>
<dd><small>It does, and that's what the prominent "NCCAM classifications" link and list in the introductory boxout shows. I don't like the "Terms and concepts" article, as it's not really in the Wikipedia style, but fixing that is a job for another day - unless you'd like to do it. I propose a "NCCAM classifications of alternative medicines" article, with the five classifications and lists of what CAM techniques fall under that. Nethertheless, I don't think the NCCAM classications need to be brought into this article any more than the boxout already provides.</small></dd>

<dd><small><i>CAM is often erroneously confused in Western countries with traditional medicine.</i></small></dd>

<dl>
<dd><small>This is another unattributed claim. I also think it's incorrect. CAM is an umbrella term for anything outside Western medical orthodoxy (or rather, anything which doesn't currently have proven efficacy). "Traditional medicine" is more vaguely defined than CAM. Traditional medicine overlaps with CAM, in that some traditional medicines (by which I'm defining as "invented before the 20th century") are still used today, marketed as CAM because of unproven efficacy - such as acupuncture, herbal remedies - and some traditional medicines are not still used today - such as bloodletting. There are also traditional medicines that are part of medical orthodoxy. Draw yourself a <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venn_diagram.html" title="Venn diagram">Venn diagram</a> as an exercise. So there is a subset of traditional medicine that <i>is</i> CAM, not an "erroneous confusion".</small></dd>

<p>I linked to this article from "essential oils" and was unfortunately only slightly surprised to come to the end of a long page and realize that it said very little about alternative medicine but a lot about its critics. The only unique information in this article is found in the first three paragraphs. Everything after the Table of Contents is just repeat after repeat of the same tired vituperative claptrap that old Dawkins bore has been bleating about for years. Come on, now. One good paragraph would have been plenty about doubts concerning the efficacy of alternative therapies, and to have actually described one or two of these therapies would not have gone amiss, either. Either this article needs drastic revision (i.e., starting from scratch), or it needs to be retitled "Criticisms of Alternative Medicine" or something like that. By the way, I took a look through a few of these talk pages, and while it is true that "allopathic medicine" is often used to describe somewhat deprecatorily what I will delicately call "mainstream medicine as practiced in the majority of healthcare facilities in the United States of America and as featured on such popular television programs as E.R., St. Elsewhere, and Grey's Anatomy, excepting certain episodes" by many practitioners and advocates of alternative therapies, by the same token "alternative medicine" is used in this article as a pejorative description of anything else. I bet when most people come here looking for information on "alternative medicine" they want information on traditional, complementary (or yes, possibly actually alternative) therapies because what is scientifically tested is not always enough - and it would be nice is they found it. Yes, the scientific method is a fantastic tool for discerning the safety and efficacy of a technique/substance/whatever, but using this tool is often costly, beyond the capabilities of most, and most importantly, time-consuming. Not everyone has time to wait.</p>

<dd>Good intentions do not just brush away bad results. The whole page stinks of supporting Alternative Medicine. The part regarding "support" for it is laughable. Conventional Medicine also recommends having a healthy lifestyle, but it won't go into religion/spirituality. We have yet to prove spirits, souls, gods, etc. exist. That's why Conventional Medicine doesn't embrace unproven thought. Honestly, the track record of Alt med is quite shakey at best. It is nothing but second fiddle to real medicine that does tests, verifies its findings amongst itself, and strives for tight tolerances regarding safety and effectiveness. That has yet to be said of Alt-Med. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMac428_797d.html" title="User:Mac428">Big Mac</a> 21:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if the article falls somewhere between McLanahan and Big Mac, it must be about right. I have to say, though, Mac, as someone who has little or no interest in Alt Med, your claim that "Conventional Medicine doesn't embrace unproven thought" is a bit of a stretch! There are countless examples of treatments that were embraced by the Conv Med establishment for years, only to be reversed later. I remember hearing MDs trashing flavinoids, anti-oxidants etc. back in the 60s and 70s. And conventional medicine's embrace of acetominaphen over aspirin tells you all you need to know to understand what drives conventional medicine, er, medi$ine. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> | <a href="../../../m/w/a/User_talk%7EMwanner_db45.html" title="User talk:Mwanner">Talk</a> 21:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've been here longer than me? Does the year you were banned count in the time? None of these conversations are "private." Have your read the article on cryonics you reference? No, quite obviously not. The idea that I suggest cryonics as the "longevity method of choice" is of course misrepresentation. I'm by no means confident that cryonics will work for <i>anybody</i>, let alone <i>everybody</i> who tries it. Even among cryonicists, dying and being cryopreserved is viewed as the second-worst thing that can possibly happen to you (guess what the worst thing is?). Every other longevity method is preferable to being cryopreserved, and cryonics is an option to consider only after every other method has failed, and you have been pronounced dead and your society is now planning to burn you up, or stick you in a hole in the ground to decay. Which is your privilege if that floats your boat, but in that situation it's hardly your place to crow about your success, and suggest that I'm silly to try something else.

<dd>"good medicine" and "bad medicine" is obviously POV. Also, just because something hasn't (yet) been proven doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't work, and doesn't necessarily mean it's harmful. Lack of proof doesn't objectively make something into "bad medicine".

<dd>No, definitely not, although some articles about EBM often confuse the issue. The "gold standard" for a compound (multiple randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled studies) obviously isn't an appropriate standard for surgery. The article <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-Based_Medicine_e1ed.html" title="Evidence-Based Medicine">Evidence-Based Medicine</a> has some good material about levels of evidence. cheers, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 03:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note to self: This article is approaching a train-wreck and I must find the time to re-write it. Note to others: I intend to re-write this article into something a bit more coherent. I haven't time at present. However, here's a useful tidbit that I was going to use in my rewrite:</p>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition) cites the earliest print reference to "alternative medicine" as this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1983 Brit. Med. Jrnl. 30 July 307/1 One of the few growth industries in contemporary Britain is alternative medicine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The use of alternative meaning "purporting to represent a preferable or equally acceptable alternative to that in general use or sanctioned by the establishment, as alternative (i.e. non-nuclear) energy, medicine, radio, etc." from 1970 at the earliest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The OED 2nd ed. doesn't have any citation for "complementary medicine". 81.178.213.18 15:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds great - I look forward to seeing the new version. I would have done it myself, but I don't feel that I know the subject well enough! <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELottiotta_28e5.html" title="User:Lottiotta">Lottie</a> 12:17, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added a cleanup tag, and removed the following from the article:</p>
<p><b>Medicina Alternativa</b> The Alma-Alta declaration defines its strategy as "Health for All by 2000 A.D." through <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_health_care.html" title="Primary health care">primary health care</a>.

Primary health care has been described as "essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially accepted methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and the families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that a community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self reliance and self determination". Subsequently, the Alma-Alta declaration outlined that primary health care is based on training and scientific orientation provided to health care workers including physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliary and community workers and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_medicine.html" title="Traditional medicine">traditional medical</a> practitioners. Therefore, Medicina Alternativa has established guidelines and regulations outlining the code of ethics that <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healers.html" title="Healers">healers</a> are expected to follow consequent to their training, certification and membership of Medicina Alternativa.</p>
