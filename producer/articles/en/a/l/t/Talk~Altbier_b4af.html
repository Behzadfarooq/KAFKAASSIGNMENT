<p>Altbiers are made outside Germany. This is verifiable. Here's the thing -- it is not NPOV to point that out, and I don't see how it could be. The question is, is it made in any other country than the US? A UK alt would be worthy of mention as well. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 23:38, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you see no difference between "altbier" and "in the style of altbier"? I do. In this article, as well as many, many others about foreign beers, the article often begins: "this is the beer of xxx. It is yyyy. In the US...."). I suggest you read this to understand my objection to this habit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Anglo-American_focus" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Anglo-American_focus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Anglo-American_focus</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 07:22, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we maybe need a third-party mediator here. How exactly would one go about this? And incidentally, I don't know that there is always a meaningful difference -- if a beer is made in Vermont or Alaska according to a Düsseldorf recipe, using a known altbier yeast, is it not an altbier? The only beer I can think of where that distinction applies is Kölsch, which name is legally protected under German law and international treaty. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 08:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've read the FAQ link I posted, I don't understand why you still have a question. On your other point, I think we tend to look at this differently: I am not so much concerned with the law as with the impression it gives, especially among readers who have come here with little knowledge to begin with. If they see that an alt, for example, is brewed primarily in a certain region in Germany, but then see equal weight given to an "alt" brewed in the US, they can perhaps come to the logical conclusion that the two are essentially the same and why bother coming to Germany (where, as you probably know, it is served by gravity directly from casks, not from bottles) when they can just run down to the local beer emporium and pick up a bottle? That, I contend, is seriously misinforming the reader.</p>
<p>Mind, I am not saying that the American alt is a bad beer, just that it is different. And I would say the same for any beer brewed outside the specific region because, as you know, local water plays a major role in the taste of a beer. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 09:56, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There has been a long and thorough discussion of this topic on the beer project page. I brought it up there for two reasons: 1. the people who read that page are the people who contribute to the beer project and 2. this was not an issue specifically about altbier, but an issue that affects all non-US beer pages. We have reached a consensus: we will add to the article a sentence (or more) saying that this type of beer is brewed in other countries and attempt to list all those countries and we will replace the bjcp style links with a translation of a guide written and published by the German Brewers Association (Deutscher Brauer Bund). The majority of the editors feel that the bjcp is unreliable. I assume you are not pleased to read this, however, this is the consensus of the beer contributors. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 09:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, you assume incorrectly. While I still think the BJCP guidelines should be included, the DBB guidelines should take primacy. I think that's a perfectly fair compromise. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 20:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well, I'm happy to hear that. As I said, the consensus is that the bjcp is unreliable. I fully agree with that consensus. This is an encyclopedia and accurate information is key. Including bjcp guidelines, compromise or not, runs counter to this goal. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 21:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, I hope the latest change is acceptable. I've put information on Dutch and US altbiers in one paragraph (separate from German examples) at the end of the regional section and included information on example brands from the US to complement the Dutch example. One question I do have though -- the book I have on Altbier history and recipes claims that Grolsch Amber is a Dutch altbier as well. Is this in fact true? Because if so I'd like to include it as another example brand. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 00:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, I want to tell you that I appreciate the tone of your message. It is much better than some of your fellow American homebrewers. OK, now to your questions. First of all, I can find no evidence that Grolsch Amber Ale is anything other than a special beer made for the American market. I also see no evidence that it is an alt, so I will remove it. Now, the consensus on examples is that they should be "notable", which, AFAIK, is also the policy of WP. I would also point out the inconsistency of what you have written: "most notably in the Netherlands and the United States" and then "in the US, Alt style beer is something of a rarity". You have also left out the other countries that brew altbier. In general, we will list the beer below and not in the main body of the article. Since I see no evidence that the American beers you named are notable, I will remove them. I hope, from your message, that you are genuinely interested in helping. I am very glad to hear that.

<li>Haikupoet, if you have a book that calls Grolsch Amber an alt, please cite it as a the source. — <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoethean_f9d1.html" title="User talk:Goethean">ॐ</a> 15:52, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Certainly. <i>Classic Beer Styles Series:Altbier</i> by Horst Dornbusch, Brewers Publications.

<li>At least in English. I've actually got about 3/4 of the series -- they vary wildly in style. The Altbier book is one of the better ones, but I wouldn't cite the Stout book unless it was for a scholarly paper -- way too technical for anyone who doesn't work at Anheuser-Busch. For the most part, though, they're written for both professional and amateur audiences. (Incidentally, I think the BYO article is quite relevant as it gives a description of the process involved in making alt.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 16:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have posted an RfC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/History_and_geography" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/History_and_geography" rel="nofollow">here</a> in hopes of getting third-party comments to build a consensus on the issue of American sources and examples.

<p>I am the primary other party here. While I think Haikupoet framed the RFC in an even-handed manner, I believe that the <b>key</b> element of the dispute is missing. The issue is not solely whether US POV is valid or not, it is that US POV is the <b>only one</b> given (aside from the local) despite the fact that other countries are also involved in the same activity. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 09:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then isn't the solution simply to add other sources, rather than delete US sources? If this really is the issue, then please settle it by beefing this article up with additional sources. Beer is topical, and what a Wikipedia should be a great place to come for accurate and current information. Maybe add a "this article needs expanded tag," also add a references section to the bottom so the single reference is spelled out. While there are only US sources, add a note that there are only US sources, I believe there is even a tag for that, then remove it when the article is more international.</dd>

<p>I'm not sure this belongs in the Altbier article, as from what little I can determine it seems to be more a cousin of the alt family than a member per se. It does seem to be a real style invented in Dortmund, an ale that underwent a very long lactic fermentation process to take on a bit of sour character (one of the links above compares it to Berliner weisse in that regard). Commercial examples seem to be few and far between, and the only one that seems to be readily verifiable is the American example in the second link. I think maybe a separate article? (This would be a great time to pull out some European sources on the subject, Mikebe and Patto1ro...) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 07:20, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I haven't checked Gutenberg yet though -- a copy in their text format would be easier to work with for our purposes. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 01:11, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Of course, I hope you both realise that Patto1ro has copies of all the books and either he or I could translate the German. Are we refusing to do this because we are being childish? No, we are doing this because our views of European beer (and, I might add, we are both European) are treated with such disrespect by several of the editors here, and, I should add, we were personally treated with disrespect as well. You might thank those responsible for the disrespect for putting you in this situation, which would be much more constructive than calling us "childish." <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 09:30, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Right now, though, Patto1ro has taken a stance indicating he/she is the one on the board willing to take some responsibility for his/her behaviour and move on to a more creative atmosphere--not acting the least bit childish. If you don't wish to contribute to the article, there is nothing anyone can do, or should even try, to compel you to do so. It's time to honor Patto1ro's maturity in taking the initiative by offering the first white flag, by working, with those who wish to contribute, to find a way this article can be usable, informative, and accurate. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:55, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
