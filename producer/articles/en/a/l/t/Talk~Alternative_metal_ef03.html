<p>Why do I get the feeling that this was written by a Mike Patton fanboy? Please also note that Jane's Addiction began gaining public/critical notice several years before the grunge wave did.</p>
<p><br />
Is this even a real genre?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, this is most definetly not a real genre of metal. I have never seen this genre mentioned before in any respectable metal publication or website. This does not seem to be written by a Mike Patton fanboy so much as it was written by a resentful <a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a> fan who sought another way to salvage the loss of credibility of their favorite bands as legitimate metal bands, such as <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipknot_%28band%29.html" title="Slipknot (band)">Slipknot</a>, on the Slipknot and nu-metal pages, and concocted this phony genre out of thin air as a means of keeping their favored bands within the much-coveted sphere of metal music, who THEN drew upon Patton's work to reinforce this genre. If anything, Mike Patton's music is either a) not metal at all in some cases, b) avant-garde metal, or b) each project is different, with <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantomas.html" title="Fantomas">Fantomas</a> being black metal, his <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dillinger_Escape_Plan_654d.html" title="Dillinger Escape Plan">Dillinger</a> work being <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore</a>, etc. In any case, this entire article's wording smacks undeniably of the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meaningless_statement.html" title="Meaningless statement">Meaningless statement</a> fallacy, from the Wikipedia article I now quote an example:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
A statement in argumentation may be considered meaningless because it draws a distinction without a 
difference, that is, asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a way to distinguish 
among them. For instance, the claim, "Pornography is different from erotica, but not in any particular 
way I can explain," may be considered to draw a distinction that makes no difference.
</pre>
<p>In light of that and the more than suspicious fact that this genre has never appeared anywhere else in any credible metal publication or the metal community at all, this article is a definite candidate for deletion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is a valid term, one that critics and music publications frequently use to describe these bands under a loose approach. Allmusic.com, for instance, uses "Alternative metal" as a genre. The reason it doesn't appear often in metal terminology is because it's used more to describe bands from the perspective of an alternative rock fanbase, rather than a metal one. WesleyDodds 04:22, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then it should be regarded as an offshoot of alternative music and not of metal, but by all appearances, the approach taken here seems to have been one of treating this as a subgenre of metal when it isn't.</p>

<p>If any bands should make the list it's the post-metal bands (bands like Isis, Cult of Luna, Pelican...) and some of the progressive metal bands (like Opeth and Mastodon) that don't have significant elements of Black Metal or rely on 70s jam elements (like Dream Theater) and that they're active in the 21st century. Bands like The Dillinger Escape Plan should also make the list without any doubts. And calling SOAD, Deftones and RATM nu-metal is just too fucking ignorant, to be honest. RATM played Funk-Metal and SOAD is a fusion of at least ten genres and don't have anything at all to do with Korn or Slipknot. Deftones might make the nu-metal classification, but they break away as easily, being art-rock and electronica at the same time.Revan ltrl 20:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thats a lot to type without really saying anything. Are you seriously suggesting that Opeth (Progressive Death Metal) should be on a list of alternative metal bands because they don't have any elements of black metal or prog (although of course they have both)?! Opeth isn't a silly fake, alt. metal band by any standards. And YES RATM have MUCH in common with Korn and Slipknot.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Talk%7EAlternative_metal_ef03.html" title="Edit section: Deletion?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Deletion?</span></h2>
<p>I personally have never seen or heard of this 'subgenre' of metal ever before, in any publication, or from any person. I've been frequenting metal forums all across the internet for some time now and this article really doesn't seem to be a real term... Nevermind accurate. It may have been used in some publications by fans of alternative rock, but again, I've never seen it... And a genre of music created by fans of a different genre? This article definitely seems to be an attempt to change the definition of <a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a> to a metal subgenre without using the proper article... Possibly because they already tried? The best this page does to define the subgenre it's claiming to talk about is:</p>
<p>'As with most rock music genres, alternative metal has proved somewhat difficult to define. Some fans and musicians have firm ideas of genre and sub-genre, while others reject such notions as useless or limiting. Influence from many other genres is common in alternative metal.</p>
<p>The term is very loosely defined, but is usually used to describe artists playing a style of metal which is considered either unique or difficult to define.'</p>
<p>There are several problems with this definition, in my mind. First of all, the genre is called 'alternative metal', yet the author describes it as a rock music genre. I understand that metal came from rock music, but it has progressed in a very different direction and I don't see how 'alternative metal' can be a subgenre of rock (even though, with the bands listed, it is more accurate) while being called alternative metal. Would it not just be alternative rock?</p>
<p>Secondly, how on earth does that statement define a genre? All it says is it can't be defined. It seems that almost anything can be alternative metal, if you wanted. All it has to be is unique or difficult to define. <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opeth.html" title="Opeth">Opeth</a> has both melodic death and progressive metal elements... Does that make them alternative metal too? What about <a href="../../../d/e/s/Despised_Icon_90fd.html" title="Despised Icon">Despised Icon</a>? They draw from death metal and hardcore/metalcore. Me hitting a washtub and screaming would be considered unique and difficult to define too. Does that make them all alternative metal now? A *lot* of bands in metal that have nothing in common with each other could easily be lumped together under these vague guidelines. This article, to me, seems to be using <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a>, using the bands to define the genre and then taking that genre and using it to define the bands, never really getting anywhere. I think because of this, this article is a serious candidate for deletion. If not deletion, this article needs to actually *define* a real subgenre of music (And decide which genre of music it belongs to. The author seems to want to claim it is a subgenre of metal, while calling it a subgenre of rock). Right now, it's wasted space no matter how you look at it. 139.142.23.159</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you stated, heavy metal came from rock music. In fact, it is still considered rock music. Thus alternative metal would be a sub-style of a style, much like Oi! or crust would be considered subsets of punk rock.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What you are missing is that it is a fusion genre, and is listed accordingly in both the metal and alternative rock templates. It's not just a random group of metal bands that are left-of center; these bands share in common a background in punk or alternative rock scenes. For example, White Zombie used to be noise rock in the vein of Sonic Youth, Helmet's approach was influenced by Page Hamilton's time in Band of Susans and and draws a link between post-hardcore and nu-metal, Jane's Addiction was part of the same alternative scene as RHCP and Faith No More and mixed several genres (including goth, folk, psychedelia, and others besides metal), Alice in Chains and Soundgarden were grunge bands who played up their metal influences, RATM draws as much influence form hardcore punk and Gang of Four as they do from Zeppelin-ish heavy metal, and so on. I agree this article can be written better; equal time sould be given to the metal and alternative sides of the form. But please, don't simply disregard it because it doesn't conform to a viewpoint of metal genres. WesleyDodds 09:45, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If this article is to be kept, then it should be directly merged into the Nu Metal article with Rap Metal, as this page is neithe informative, encyclopedic, or NPOV. If by the end of the week this article is still here, i will start proposed merging of metal articles that split hair myself, for lack of a user with better english skills doing it. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 17:22, 6 December 2005 (UTC) <a name="I_fail_to_see..." id="I_fail_to_see..."></a></p>

<p>I fail to see how there can be such a thing as "alternative metal" when the whole idea of metal is that it is alternative, whatever sub-genre is comes from. Clearly this false sub-genre either needs deletion or mergence with Nu-Metal.</p>
<p>As a metalhead, I am ashamed to be associated with nu metallers today. They are clueless and idiotic and believing that band such as Slipknot are original when GWAR for instance did it all so long before Slipknot. I'm sure others will agree that the future of metal is doomed if cretins such as todays "nu-metallers" are to be handed the reings.</p>

<p>Ok, am I the only one offended by that statement!? What the fuck is your problem man?! I'm not even sure how to begin to respond to that! I like Slipknot, Disturbed and a few other "nu-metal" bands, I like their music, I also like death, doom and thrash metal and I fail to see how that makes me "clueless", "idiotic" or "a cretin". If you don't like it then don't fucking listen to it!</p>
<p>As for alternative metal. Heavy metal is a genre of music that evolved from rock, nothing more. Alternative metal refers to adding newer influences to tradional metal. Its a sub-genre of metal, just like every other metal sub-genre. Get a life man!</p>

<p>I don't think they should be merged either. Nu-metal can be considered a descendant or sub-style of alternative metal. Both terms are used quite frequently, and apart from the late 90's they refer to completely different approaches. By the way, I'm still editing both pages. I'm just a little held up because for some reason I can't cut or paste text in any sort of edit window (including Wikipedia) WesleyDodds 00:35, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They are still overlapping, and still repeating each other. Your edits are making no difference other than to make them overlap, and repeat each other more. Yes, both terms are used. Alternative Metal is the name used by Nu Metal fans, who dislike the term Nu Metal due to the negativity associated with it. I will wait to see what AJ does with the articles, and then when they are done, if they still overlap drastically, and repeat each other, i shall merge them per what Wikipedia policys say. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 06:50, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now that is a gross generalization and is not a valid argument. And while I respect and encourage your right to disagree, it would be more efficient if you pointed out where the articles overlap and if possible, fix them or calrify points. Additionally, your proposal for a merge ignores the fact that while alternative metal and nu metal overlap and are related, they are not synonymous. For example, a hip-hop influence is not present in all nu metal bands, and much less in alternative metal bands, among other musical traits, so merging them together not only ignore athe distinctions between them, but it would also make it difficult for anyone wanting to read about one or the other seperately. We have articles for Black Metal and Nazi Black Metal, Indie and Alternative, Protopunk and punk rock, jangle pop and Paisley Underground, Grunge and post-grunge, and many other minute divisions of related genres. That does not mean they belong on the same page. And I have still yet to see anyone else agree to a merge. WesleyDodds 01:45, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a gross generelization, but one most all of the metal community of the world will repeat after me. No, not all Nu Metal has Alternative Rock influence, not all Nu Metal has Hip Hop influence. But then again, not all Death Metal has Thrash Metal influence. And not all Death Metal has Black Metal influence.</dd>

<p>they are pretty similiar... <a href="../../../j/w/l/User%7EJwlx_e0a4.html" title="User:Jwlx">Jwlx</a> Seriously... there's so many bands... genre categorizations are stupid enough as they are and you certainly can't capture them all under the single "Nu Metal" heading. I don't see why overlapping is a problem. Of course there are gonna be similarities between sub-genres.

<dd>Youve just repeated what Progressive Metal is. As Dream Theater and Symphony X are both Progressive Metal bands.</dd>

<dd>Secondly, if its a genre, give me a musical definition of it, rather than random traits and bands copied from other articles about other genres. As it stands, this genre is a fusion between Alternative Rock, and Metal. Thats all well and good, except most all the bands that fit here, are Nu Metal bands. Almost all the description given here, has been of Nu Metal bands.</dd>

<dd>I thought alternative meant a mix of alternative and metal, which basically is progressive metal, because alternative such as Pixies, Mars Volta, Smashing Pumpkins, is defined by the difference between it and normal rock/pop, such as time changes, wide dynamics so it has an "alternative" song structure, but Nu Metal is in no way alternative it should just be Nu metal becuase calling it alternative metal is an insult to the alternative genre Nu metal is not about making great original music as all music should be, but more about pleasing crowds and making money, alternative is different not so they sell records, but just being creative in their approach to music making, beacause music is an art and all art should stem from cretivity and express what message you are trying to portray in an alternative manner, but Nu metal is not art it is just money making. The Alternative Metal Genre should not exisit because Nu metal is not alternative. Nu metal is for all those twelve year olds who want to think they like real metal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Progressive Metal is Progressive Metal. You dont redefine names based on bands you do and do not like. Also, you have just been etremely Neoglistic. Alternative Metal is basically the forepart of Nu Metal, before its name changed and before the new batch of bands that got high critical acclaim. I also suggest you read the article on what Nu Metal is, and what Alternative Rock is. Not all Nu Metal bands are out to make money, many Nu Metal bands have made no money, and im sure you wouldnt know any of them. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 03:26, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rage are in no way Industrial, they don't use synth or drum machine at all - that's insane. But no, RATM and SOAD are not nu-metal. Pretty much, that's summed up by their proper use of solos, which don't feature in nu-metal almost as a rule. But there are other elements - political activism, considerable talent, absence of turntables, using real metal riffs, and having a hardcore/metalcore influence most nu-metal bands would shy away from. RATM are <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk-metal.html" title="Funk-metal">funk-metal</a>: They fit the descriptor perfectly, and they predate nu-metal by years (Nu-metal really started with Korn, who started after RATM were already popular, and it didn't get popular until the mid-late 90s, whereas RATM were big even during the Gringe era). SOAD are Avant-garde metal.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, to define "Alternative Metal": It's a blanket term. It includes any metal with a pronounced "alternative" (eg: not traditionally associated with metal) influence: Industrial metal, Funk metal, Nu-metal, etc, and also includes the Avant-garde metal and prog bands, like Dream Theater, Opeth, Tool and the like. As was said in the Nu-metal talk page:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>* One usage of the term refers to bands within the Nu Metal genre, that forsake large quantities of Hip Hop influence and instead draw influence from Metal Genres and Alternative Rock Genres. A similar name to define between Nu Metal bands that use heavy hip hop influence is 'Rap Metal'. * The second usage of the term is relative to metal bands that do unorthodox things in their music, normally not akin to metal genres. These bands are also known as Avantgarde metal bands.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know what he means with the first usage, anyway. I hear "hard nu-metal" bands described as "alternative metal" all the time. Ünloco are called "alt-metal" by their label, I believe.</dd>

<p>I've never heard anyone refer to this genre, but I get the point and I think it should stay seperate, I might take out the metal genre box and put the alternative one in it's place.

<dd>I changed them back, because it straddles the line between metal and alternative; therefore there's the metal box at the top and the alternative footer at the bottom of the page to cover both bases.

<p>After reading Ian Christe's book, the division bewteen alternative metal and nu metal appears to be thus: Alternative metal mainly refers to more eclectic metal bands during the reign of alternative rock, while nu metal is a more uniform movement largely coming out of the decline of alternative rock. That distinction is strong enough to argue against a merge. WesleyDodds 02:46, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Given the number of people who have responded to the subject now, I think we should remove the merger tags on both articles.

<dd>I agree too - keep them separate. I would rather see an honest approach to Nu Metal and to Alt. Metal (it really <i>is</i> commercialised, how often do you hear Tool, Primus or Mr Bungle on mainstream radio? Less than Linkin Park? Thought so.), I'd also like to see Rapcore redirect to Rap Metal (not the other way round, since this currently propagates the ridiculous music press' tendency to invent genre tags like <i>post-funk-grind-melt-deathcore</i> (my own example...) as they desperately try to make new (faceless?) bands sound fresh. If the Definition part of Nu metal was reworked into an <b>ORIGINS</b> section, preceded/followed by a clear <b>definition</b> statement that Nu Metal bands fill the void between the mostly unique-sounding Alt. Metal bands with a kind of unified, perhaps even formulaic approach to angsty rock, that might work.</dd>

<dd>This way people who love RATM, Fear Factory, SOAD, Tool, Helmet, and the other great-and-good pioneers on the Alt. Metal page won't get so offended all the time, and fans of those-who-came-later like Linkin Park and American Head Charge might actually be able to see that their idols do actually sound <i>somewhere between</i> some of these pioneers, and really aren't carrying any truly unique sound of their own.</dd>

<p>This is just a thought maybe to expand upon, especially regarding WesleyDodds reference to Ian Christe's book, to help pin down a timeline for this genre. I haven't read the book but it seems to me that most of the time when people, especially people in music press refer to the popularity of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_rock.html" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a> in the 90's, they are more or less refering to <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge.html" title="Grunge">grunge</a>'s popularity, which has a more defined sort of rise/decline. I think that <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_metal.html" title="Alternative metal">alternative metal</a> probably exists parallel to <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge.html" title="Grunge">grunge</a> (and crosses over a bit) for the sake of pinning down a timeline. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxcap_8e01.html" title="User:Maxcap">maxcap</a> 19:16, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>...I would maintain that Alternative Metal (with its list of key bands) is a better page to retain, with nu- and rap- metal redirecting here. Perhaps then a decent chronology could be constructed which details a kind of family tree showing relationships such as</p>
<ul>
<li>from Ministry to Static-X</li>
<li>from RATM to SOAD</li>
<li>from RATM to Limp Bizkit</li>
<li>from Biohazard to American Head Charge (or whoever, Biohazard's debut had the "no instruments used" thing but AHC play their own, I know...)</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea, just use the power of a timeline to say "look people, <i>these</i> really did come first, there are <i>these</i> common threads we can follow, and <i>these</i> recent sleevenotes really do credit the earlier stuff, so why do you insist that bands from 1998 'invented the whole sound' or whatever the argument is today?"</p>
<p>Then we might have one decent article that reads like an essay on the evolution of non-thrash, non-death, non-gothic rock/metal from 1986 to 2006. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkewer_4c14.html" title="User:Skewer">Skewer</a> 14:46, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we did merge, that's the type of resolution I would back. However, I have two main objections that incline me to vote to keep them separate pages: space and sources. Combining them into one article might make it too large and we'd have to break it up into smaller pieces anyway. And as it stands the availability of sources does not create a clear history between the two. Creating lines of evolution would involve too much independent analysis on our part that might skirt dangerously towards POV. WesleyDodds 03:16, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, curses to your flawless logic!&#160;:) I see the POV potential there, unless we could use just sleevenotes as a resource, that might work, but that's a major project in itself. How about a situation where we use an Alternative Metal/Evolution subpage, to house this kind of section - i.e.
<ul>
<li>Define Alt Metal</li>
<li>Explain Nu Metal name a bit</li>
<li>Briefly point out timeline issues (Helmet started in 80s, Slipknot started yesterday-ish...)</li>
<li>Link to subpage "To demonstrate the relationship between Alternative Metal and the Nu Metal that is more often played and promoted in the mainstream media"</li>
<li>then carry on as usual with the good stuff&#160;:)</li>

<dd>I still think it's infinitely more applicable and convenient to just keep them separate articles. Because, when it comes down to it, the terms are meant largely to refer to two different eras.

<dd>Now your making the same argument as i am about Metal Music and Heavy Metal. This article lists the History of Nu Metal without definaing Alternative Metal other than to repeat Progressive Metal, which the history is nothing to do with. The term Alternaive Metal is basically used seemingly to mean 'Un Commercilized Nu Metal'. Splitting the Nu Metal article into History and Defination is cause to do the the same with all articles. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 21:11, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nu metal isn't strictly defined, either. I'm basically just transcribing what other people wrote on the subject, and there is a distinction made bewteen the two. And no one ever called alternative metal "uncommericalized metal". The neologism rule applies if we have coined the term ourselves (which we haven't), it does not show up often in searches (it shows up quite often) and the term is not useful in Wikipedia (it has been used frequently in other articles, and the subject has been integrated into these articles in order to add to the description of these articles).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>@Leyasu: Alt. metal isn't being defined as uncommercialized nu-metal, that would imply that the 2 are direct peers, doing slightly different things. Check the list, I can't see a band there that has been around less than a decade or so; they (mostly) broke the mould when they were fresh, and they (mostly) haven't been emulated directly, hence <i>alternative</i>. I would question Jane's Addiction and Alice in Chains as being more rock than metal, but it's all getting tied in knots without me adding to the problem!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think AJ is right to draw time-based parallels between alt metal and the are of alt rock, and I think he is right to want nu- and alt-metal as 2 things, I just think he's right... (he agreed with me once so he's great). We can all see a need for rewriting or editing the 2 articles, so let's plan together how best to avoid repeated info and make the 2 obviously separate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would support (and help write) a fresh alt. metal approach, where for the few bands listed we stick in a section called <b>What sets Alt. Metal bands apart from Nu Metal?</b>, then give each a level 3 header, and write a few lines saying</dd>

<dd>"Formed in 1989, Helmet brought a hard edge to music popular amongst skaters and other stoner (?) subcultures, popularising synchopated rhythms and drop-D tuned guitars as they created their trademark stammering riffs. They did not abandon the rock/metal tradition of guitar solos, though Page Hamilton's discordant and chaotic interludes broke many established rules of what a solo should contain. They temporarily disbanded during the peak of nu-metal (1998-2004) but later reformed with their familiar sound intact.

When a band sounds unlike even its closest influences, we have "alternative", but when a band sounds like a mix of its peers (from Machine Head to Papa Roach) I'd not call it alternative - and if the best label we have is nu-metal, then so be it.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Cue the flamewar from Machine Head fans that don't see the lineage with Slayer/Pantera etc...&#160;:(</dd>

<p>If Alternative Metal is a cross-genre reference, which is what you imply in what you have said, then alls i wish is that it is listed that way. Remembering, that all of about 3 bands on that list dont sound like several others, and all of about 3 bands on that list arent listed on other genres, that actually describe the bands music.</p>
<ul>
<li>'Alternative Metal is a term used by some Metal fans to describe bands from across genres that do things that are not typical to the genre they are from. Alternate uses of the term also include reference to Alternative Rock bands that use a large quantity of metal influence in their music, leading their music to be a more metallic version of Alternative Rock. The term is used loosely, and the bands most commonly grouped in this style are bands from throught the 90's belonging to the Alternative Rock and Nu Metal scenes, amongst Progressive Metal bands and is often another name given to Avantgarde Metal bands.'</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like that, and i can be happy, at least that describes what the term actually is!</p>
<p>Its not the best opening paragraph in the world, but it gives an example of what i mean. All-in-all, the thing needs to be merged into Nu Metal in reference to meaning Nu Metal bands before the Commercilisation of Nu Metal, or, it needs to define exactly what it is WITHOUT repeating 3487240398 other articles (Sarcasm intended). <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 11:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think what's causing a considerable amount of confusion here is the usage of the word "alternative". You've got one crowd using the 90's marketing term "alternative" who wants to merge, versus one crowd using the older usage of "alternative" which is pretty much a synonym of what is called "indie" today, who don't want the merge (me included).</dd>

<dd>The article cites <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_No_More_71ac.html" title="Faith No More">Faith No More</a> as a good example.

<ul>
<li>Alternative metal is a cross-genre term used to describe metal bands and metal influenced bands, which some fans consider to be unique or experimental, as well as bands of the nu metal genre that lack hop hop influence.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That means, its not a genre. And genres of metal are not genres of Alternative Metal. It means its a term used to group Nu Metal bands that use minimum to no Hip Hop influence, and bands from various other genres that do things that are not typically standard of the genre they are in. It also makes reference to Alternative Rock bands whom use a lot of metal influence in their music. Thus, a near complete rewrite of the page is needed, unless it is in fact my original assertion, and that is a name used by fans of Nu Metal bands, to differentiate between Nu Metal bands with hip-hop influence, and those without.</dd>

<dd>Ok, that's more direct and helpful.

<p>If anyone wants to replicate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Genealogy_cuban_music.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Genealogy_cuban_music.png" rel="nofollow">this</a> for Alt, Nu, or why not <i>all</i> of "Metal", be my guest. Until then, I can't accept anyone's self-opinion along the lines of <i>"Ive studied genres long enough to know what they are, i dont need lecturing by anyone on their opinions when fact dictates otherwise"</i>. Sorry to pick on that post specifically, but none of us here can expect the others to have blind trust in such statements.</p>
<p>My point is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bands listed on Alt. Metal are not nu metal, not "Nu Metal bands before the Commercilisation of Nu Metal" (check the dates!), they are just "something else"</li>
<li>The multitude of bands in the nu metal "genre" cannot really be classed as <i>Alternative</i> Metal, simply because they constitute a noticeable portion of current metal music (hence not-so-alternative).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any decent encyclopaedic resolution is going to take time, effort and cooperation. Having seen how this is going, I'm becoming disinclined to contribute much beyond spelling/grammar/punctuation proofreading, though if anyone else is working on a rewrite I urge you to follow WP guidelines, <b><a href="../../../b/b/_/Wp%7Ebb.html" title="Wp:bb">be bold</a></b> and replace the whole mess with 2 better pages. And to whoever <i>doesn't</i> write those pages, <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">WP:COOL</a>&#160;:)</p>
<p>I don't see anything wrong with keeping Alt Metal small or making it a huge "who's who", and the Nu Metal page could benefit from just about anything (starting with no two pics from any one band...). But I'm not into flamewars, I'd rather see respectful and constructive dialog than sarcastic and demanding posts.

<dd>The way I see things (and this might be overly simplified, admittedly) is:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>alt metal is to grunge, as nu metal is to post grunge</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>You see the problem arrisses in that most people dont see how 'just something else' is a fact, when you give no reasoning. Just like you made a comment about my statement, its only fair that i ask 'How are they not Nu Metal when they share the same musical propertys? How are they 'something else' when they fit the description of Nu Metal?'. Wesley already knows that the genre needs a description, otherwise its violating the policy about drawing a distinction without drawing a distinction. Alls i ask for, as so the article isnt deleted, is that it has a defination. Otherwise its effectivly just a list that goes on about the progenitorial history of Nu Metal. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 18:48, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not the first time I've had to say this. <b>The bands on the Alt Metal page do not all share the same musical properties as Nu Metal.</b> Primus have been using, at times, cello bows on electric instruments, 6-string fretless basses, 11/8 timing and no nu-metal-alike lyrical themes <i>at all</i>, for almost 20 years. They are in no way Nu Metal. OK, Mudvayne use 11/8, 17/8 etc, but I personally think grouping them with Linkin Park is a bit of a slur... But, if the consensus is they are nu-Metal, I'll go with it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also just because Helmet used Drop-D tuning doesn't mean they were/are Nu Metal, since genres exist along a timeline, not just based on style. Try painting a neo-classical scene - nobody will call it neo-classical because you're too late for that boat. Similarly (sticking with the art comparison) styles do not just appear, they morph through each other (e.g. Baroque&gt;Rococo&gt;Neo-Classicism), with pioneers helping out along the way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you want reasoning, there it is. Many of the Alt Metal bands existed outside of the Nu Metal timeframe, and many of them sound nothing like Nu Metal, and even the disputed ones (Tool are a prime example) may have drop-D/drop-c# tuning but their whole approach (10 minute long music videos, no rapping, no youth-aimed angst) separates them from Nu-Metal. When the Nu-Metal term was coined in the 90s, anyone from before that time is surely exempt by default.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've not checked, but if there is a page covering something like "alternative art", it would likely hold info on artists who - for example - painted using their own head of hair as a brush, or threw canvasses under shower heads spewing soup, or something equally unlikely to be copied.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps your understanding of genres is being hindered by a lack of in-depth knowledge about certain bands? That's not a slur - good genre analysis is needed - but if you are assuming rather than researching at any stage, your input becomes flawed. That's why I'm not writing for particle physics pages, I have no idea where to start.

<p>Agreed here too, I think we're close enough to a definition (either as a genre or just as a blanket term) to work from here, fingers crossed <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkewer_4c14.html" title="User:Skewer">Skewer</a> 14:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the articles are staying separate now - as I believe they should be - I want to know where the Opeth references are! If any band's music can be seen as a combination of metal and other, "alternative" genres, surely they can be. They have, at various times, acoustic rock, free jazz, prog, and big band influences.

<dd>Heya! I've got to let you know that this article has <i>nothing</i> to do with whether or not any of the bands cited are considered "true" metal, in fact I wouldn't call a single one of the bands listed as metal. I'll go even further and say that if a band is considered "true-metal" it doesn't belong, except if listed as an influence to one of the bands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, I feel the term is sort of silly. But it survived AfD. The criteria used to refine it is Ian Christe book 's (listed as a source in the article). The defining trait (sort of) is that the bands are influenced by 80's <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_rock.html" title="Indie rock">indie rock</a> and metal and gained noteriety concurrently with grunge, and pretty much died with it. The bands that I personally question on the list are Korn, and the Deftones, but I see the the reasoning behind their inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Ultimately I think that the list is going to have to go, to keep this from being a repository of questioned bands</b></li>
<li><b>I feel that that an Alt metal genre box will need to be created to replace the haevy metal box to (hopefully) cut down on confusion. (grunge needs to be added as a fusion genre in the metal genre box as well, IMHO)</b></li>

<dd>It didn't die with grunge. Marilyn Manson, after all, became highly successful as grunge began to decline. And some consider nu metal a subset of alternative metal if not the succesor to it, so obviously some bands overlap in genres. Which is why Korn and the Deftones are listed; Korn debuted their first record in 1994, before nu metal even existed as a concept (making them contemporaries initially with the likes of Tool, RATM, Marilyn Manson, NIN, etc.), and the Deftones started around the same time and incorporate <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_pop.html" title="Dream pop">dream pop</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoegaze.html" title="Shoegaze">shoegaze</a> influences. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">User:WesleyDodds</a> 05:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Either way. Manson, RATM, NIN, Deftones and Korn are all Nu Metal. Progenitors, yes. Nu Metal, yes. Cross Genre? Maybe, in some cases.

<dd>And Nine Inch Nails? Oh, hell no. NIN had been in the public eye since the first Lollapalooza in 1991. Metalheads and alt-rock fans claim the band equally. They're also the public face of what most people consider <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_music.html" title="Industrial music">industrial music</a>. You're British right? I believe our separate cultural experiences is what is causing a lot of the problems behind addressing who is and who isn't considered nu metal.

<dd>Thanks for that AJ, I am also in the UK and just came back to these pages, almost choking on the thought. RATM (circa 1991) can't be classified in a late-90s phenomenon, and I was waiting for the release of NIN's <i>Broken</i> EP in '91, having had PHM for 2 years. Even Trent was bemused to get a rock award for work on Broken...</dd>

<dd>Cultural differences may play a part in some areas but I concur that NIN are miles from metal, let alone nu-metal, and as a Godflesh fan I only just group NIN with Industrial. As I've said before, it's our clammering for labels that creates genres, not some unassailable link between bands. And on that note, I <i>would</i> call some of Marilyn Manson's work nu-metal (disposable teens, fight song, anyone?) but again he's changed with the tides to release what he, or his audience, wanted at the time. But NIN? Nu-Metal? Wounds again like an afficinado of <i>some</i> genres having a slightly skewed view of <i>some</i> bands...</dd>

<dd>As far as the discussion went, Grunge was not part of the Metal community. It took influence from early Heavy Metal, but has nothing to do on the whole with Metal Music, thus its removel. Also was discussed the fact that only a small portion of Grunge bands took influence from Heavy Metal bands, and that was that. Fusion Genres are a direct combination of two genres (Ie: NU Metal, Gothic-Doom, Metalcore, Symphonic Black Metal) etc. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 23:52, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you know anything at all about genre classification, you know NIN aren't nu-metal. Come <i>on</i>. You may as well say Primus are grunge. RATM, Marilyn Manson and NIN aren't nu-metal, and Deftones have done plenty of non-nu-metal work recently.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And, not saying that alternative metal bands have to be true metal; but Opeth are always mentioned there, and that proves their metal influence. If "alternative metal" has less to do with alternative influences and more with alternative <i>rock</i> influences, Manson probably shouldn't be there. Same with a few others; Primus seem mostly funk and thrash-influenced to me. They're even mentioned as being described as "thrash-funk" on their wiki.</p>
<p>And finally, on Grunge, it certainly has heavy metal influence, and was described as "Heavy metal played with the punk DIY ethic" or something similar. If nu-metal is in fusion genres, I think Grunge should be.--<a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar">Switch</a> 16:24, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Kittie should be included on the list of alt-metal bands. I've added them.</p>
<p>Love them (or in all probability, given the general 'accepted' opinion) absolutely fucking detest every last element of them, I think their sound is too far removed from any other genre to be put into any other box other than alt-metal.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a> doesn't fit them as they don't make sufficient use of hip-hop or industrial elements, there's no fusion betweeen genres going on. They've got the simple metal elements - guitarists, bassist, vocalist, drummer. There isn't any polishing up or adding of beats and electronic elements going on in the studio (except for a tiny, tiny odd addition here and there). Listen to <i>Spit</i> and you'll see what I'm getting at. Their style is one vaguely, vaguely similar to (please don't miss the point of this comparison, I'm not comparing how good the two bands are or anything) a really simple <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slayer.html" title="Slayer">Slayer</a>. No solos or anything, just simple metal riffs and a pissed-off attitude.</p>
<p>They've got the distortion but lack the technicality for thrash / death metal.</p>
<p>So alt-metal it is. I know it's easy to just say 'Kittie = shit. nu-metal' but I really can't see a good case for them being nu-metal, as this genre requires a some influence from other genres like electronica / hip-hop etc. outside metal and Kittie haven't really done that - they've simplified their <i>metal</i> influences (such as SOAD, Napalm Death, Today Is The Day) into something they can play. Alt-metal nicely catches them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You overlook the following points.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The band's composition is all Alternative Rock based, using influences from Heavy Metal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bands sound is normally far more rock sounding, or reminiscent of Nu Metal than it is of metal in general.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The bands' vocals are typical of nu-metal? In that they are screamed? Well so do vocalists from death / thrash metal. The lyrical themes are typical of nu-metal, but I see a lot of similarity between nu-metal lyrics and the lyrical themes of ALL metal. This 'angsty nu-metal crap' thing is a real misconception. Almost ALL genres of metal have bands with angsty lyrics.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Give me 5 rock bands with a similar sound to Kittie. I don't think you can. I think Kittie's sound is reminiscent of early SOAD, who are certified alt-metal in the list.</dd>

<dd>In response to each other your comments. You made a rash claim, ignoring specific points that did not suit you, or forgetting to look at them. Thus, i reminded you of them, and reminded you to look at all the facts before you make rash claims.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thrash Metal bands typically do not scream vocals, as most are sung. Death Metal vocals are very different to screaming. Thus, i am quite sure from your statement you dont know what either Thrash Metal or Death Metal is. Nor does all forms of metal have angsty, teenage lyrics. I fail to see how Power Metal/Gothic Metal/Progressive Metal have anything to do with teenage angst.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Youll also note i said they had a Nu Metal sound, which you then point out, by claiming their sound to be similar to Nu Metal bands. Im not bit into Alternative Rock, to know a high amount of bands in the scene, but never the less, i know the musics composition, and Kittie compose alternative rock music as a base for construction. This can be checked im sure, on their website. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 20:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Death Metal vocals are very different to screaming.' Well I'll give you that for a lot of cases. But wtf is Angela Gossow doing, for example? Growling? Screaming?

<dd>I'll admit these genres of metal don't concentrate on angst as much as nu-metal. But angst in certainly not confined to nu-metal at all and if you think it is you are deluding yourself, being selective in your interpretation. In gothic / prog / power metal angst is something like 'poetic and meaningful' and in nu-metal it is 'kiddie shit' to the selective 'true, oh-so experienced in the metal 'scene' unquestionably right metalhead'.</dd>

<dd>"Im not bit into Alternative Rock, to know a high amount of bands in the scene, but never the less, i know the musics composition, and Kittie compose alternative rock music as a base for construction." hand-waving time! Look, Kittie are like SOAD in almost everyway except they scream more and are less technical. They're SOAD-lite. And like SOAD (who are acknowledged as influences in the album sleeve of <i>Spit</i>) they are <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_metal.html" title="Alternative metal">alternative metal</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, one band doesnt define a genre, and taking lyrics out of context doesnt help. Symphonic Metal band Offertorium have a very 'angst' ridden song, which meets what you say fine. Considering the whole point of the song is part of the albums story, to explain the anger of one of the characters, it doesnt help your case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, i didnt say angst was confined to only one genre. I said teenage angst mostly is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Third, Kittie have cited Nu Metal and Alternative Rock bands as influences. Im not saying they aren't Alternative Metal either. As if you had read above, we have already come to accept that Alternative Metal is a two fold term, that refers to Alternative Rock bands that use metal influences, and to Nu Metal bands that pre-date the heavy commercilisation of Nu Metal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Kittie could be considered Alternative Metal. Yes, they are Nu Metal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point originally, was to simply make you look at all the points of every part of your argument, before you make rash claims, not to debate the genre of anyone specific band. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 02:00, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know there has been some, "This band is/isn't that genre," going around in the discussion, but those bands (such as Kittie) are understandable to be debated upon. I feel the need to remove Nine Inch Nails from the article because they are purely rock based, with no metal elements whatsoever. I don't see it fair to mention them with White Zombie, Fear Factory, et cetera. So I'm going to remove them for now but if anyone get's too strung out about it you can put a good reason here and put them back in the article. <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadysway1985_4c3a.html" title="User:Ladysway1985">Ladysway1985</a> 23:57, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's the general opinion of everyone here that a band should be included or discluded from an article like this based on their sound, not popularity. That beind said, I also have a gripe about the absurd mention of the Red Hot Chili Peppers under the Funk Metal section of the article. Again, they're purely rock with no metal at all.

<p>That's pretty much it, yes. "Alternative metal" is a fusion of alternative music and metal, and not what most people would consider "true metal". There is some crossover though - <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_metal.html" title="Industrial metal">Industrial metal</a> is considered a form of alternative metal, and some bands in the genre (such as Fear Factory) are based purely in metal with an industrial influence, and so can be both.

<dd>What SwitChar said.

<p>Industrial metal is not the same as techno-influenced metal. It would be more useful to state that The Prodigy's <i>Music For The Jilted Generation</i> enticed many metal fans with its aggression, and later in the 1990s bands such as Pitchshifter adopted a more techno-based approach.</p>
<p>Industrial metal conjures up Godflesh (who have dipped in and out of techno/dub experiments, I admit), and others such as Headbutt, Ministry (already in article), Throbbing Gristle etc. Why not mention Einsturtzende Neubaten while we're at it?</p>
<p>Labelling NIN as Industrial has always been controversial given Trent's diversity (evil rock/disco/electro in 98, metal in 91, some more industrial tracks in 94... to be <b>very</b> oversimplistic).</p>
<p>I have given up on directly editing some of these pages, since they can be preciously guarded by some users, so I hope this sparks a sensible discussion rather than a flame war. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkewer_4c14.html" title="User:Skewer">Skewer</a> 12:42, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Alternative Metal bands which have a new technique of making rock music in today's nu-generation [2000..onwards] are lately referred as "Nu Metal" Bands. For Example Linkin Park , a metal quinet from Southern California which includes the formula of mixing &amp; mashing of Rock &amp; Rap and glorifying it to hip hop. This band has made progressive rock music [2000..] &amp; has gained huge popularity worldwide."</p>
<p>That is some funny s---. Is it even English? Last time I checked, "quintet" referred to an ensembled of five, not six, and had two t's. Also, "..." had three dots. And Linkin Park as progressive rock...lmao. Anyway, someone needs to rewrite this.</p>

<p>Okay, I'll let that stand. I would think that Tool were merely influenced by the same bands as grunge was, but it's not a big issue so I'll leave it be. ~<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a></sup></b></span> 07:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Grunge was also a musical influence for alt metal (not the only, right) and wrote a big page of music influences for many bands of the next ten years (it was also considered an "alternative" genre for many years). IMHO "prog rock" is wrong, if with this genre you mean bands like Yes, King Crimson etc. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnacht_929d.html" title="User:Connacht">Connacht</a></p>

<dd>Alternative metal started in the early-mid 80s. Apart from some of the later bands like <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_in_Chains_161d.html" title="Alice in Chains">Alice in Chains</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundgarden.html" title="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> it wasn't a major influence, but it did influence those bands so it probably should stay in.</dd>
<dd>I think prog is fine; it's definitely an influence in the experimentational-approach-to-songwriting element, and it was a musical influence on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_e31d.html" title="Red Hot Chili Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus_%28band%29.html" title="Primus (band)">Primus</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool_%28band%29.html" title="Tool (band)">Tool</a> and others as well. ~<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a></sup></b></span> 05:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
