<p>Why is this discussion done in terms of voltage? I realize that ac voltage often accompanies ac current, but seeing as how this is an article about ac current it seems better to just stick to ac current. The math won't be any different, so I just don't see the reason to switch to voltage for calculations.</p>

<dd>The problem, of course, is that the "x" is the Wiki-generated symbol from the "times" markup (shown below). As long as that's the case, I think it should stand as currently written. You could, of course, start lobbying the Wiki software guys for a change (that would affect every usage of "times").</dd>

<p>I changed the usual Teslaphile stuff to give due credit to some of the other critical workers in the field. Look guys, I know you venerate the guy, but the reality is that his contribution to the field, although undoubtedly important, was just one aspect of many advances in electrical engineering at the time. In particular, describing him as the father or inventor of AC makes a good book blurb but is totally unsupportable. Among the critical parts of the infrastructure he didn't invent were: transformers, the AC distribution system, AC generators, or meters. His major practical contribution was AC motors - and the first one he ever built that actually worked, was under contract to Westinghouse. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 13:18, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I updated the sections on power and 3 phase systems, which are hopefully a bit clearer now. Also the section on earths and neutrals which had become a little muddled. The earth is not the same as a neutral. A neutral is used to form a complete circuit in a healthy system, an earth is used to provide a specified path for current during a fault.</p>

<p>The article currently has a lot of stuff that is covered in other articles; three phase, grounding, etc. I think the discussion here could be compacted since details are only a mouse-click away.

<dd>It wasn't standard when I was studying or practising electrical engineering (although that may just indicate how old I am!). A one-side-head horizontal arrow over a symbol was sometimes used to indicate a vector quantity, but most texts used <b>boldface</b> symbols for that. I always used a simple overline in the statistics sense - a mean or average (rms of course). Magnitude was denoted with matrix notation e.g. |z|. Plain symbols were used only for DC. Of course we used e for electromotive force and i for current, which drove the mathematicians nuts because they had totally different meanings for them. To top it off, because i was already in use, we used j for what mathematicians call i. I'm certain we can never find a notation that satisfies everyone, so we have to clearly specify the one that we use, then keep it consistent across related articles. Boldface and || have the advantage that they can be expressed directly within WP - no CSS or PNG required. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnSankey_13f7.html" title="User:JohnSankey">JohnSankey</a> 17:54, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I consider the concepts of electrical current/voltage, resistance/reactance and power to be sufficiently different that they should not be merged, otherwise the combined article will become too long and very difficult to organize clearly. I note that there is inadequate discussion in these articles of non-sinusoidal waveforms, particularly of the substantial 3rd and 5th harmonics generated by the non-linearity of standard power transformers - that would make a combined article even longer. Then there are the square and 2-step waveforms of DC-AC power converters. I recommend keeping these three separate but consistent, with appropriate cross links. As a retired electrical engineer, I could try to start this process, but would do so only when agreement is reached on separation. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnSankey_13f7.html" title="User:JohnSankey">JohnSankey</a> 15:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sorry if I sound negative, but this article/entry (Alternating current) is un-organized, and even though it's extraordinarely short for such an important and vast subject, it feels too long to read.</p>
<p>The consequences of the bad architecture of the entry, is that even contributors have trouble striking the right balance when trying to add relevant information. For example, Nikola Tesla is under-represented, even though he has almost single-handidly produced virtually all the elements of the puzzle necessary for the AC power system (I won't spend time documenting this point, if anyone thinks it's open to dispute, I'm willing). I don't blame it on anyone's agenda, but simply, on the fact that the article is discouraging of contribution. I have tried, anonymously, to correct few of the more evident errors, and am preparing to beef up the body on Steinmetz and Tesla. Still, every time I think of this wikipedia entry, I feel pain in my stomach, so I keep putting off the big work for another day. Old-fool 17:56, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>One way to handle this dilemma is to create an entirely new version of the article. You can initially create it in something like "Alternating Current/new_version", tweak it until it's as you want it, and then open it up for review and collaborative editing. When the article is "fully baked" we can replace the existing article with the new article.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>There is definitely a life-cycle to many Wiki articles:
<ol>
<li>They're initially created terse</li>
<li>Over time, they "accrete" aditional information, often in a somewhat-jumbled way</li>
<li>At some point, somebody takes the initiative and resturctures the whole thing to make all the accreted info flow as a coherent narrative.</li>

<p>I don't know what you mean by power lost = I^2 * R. This is supposed to be the equation for power transmitted, and since V=I*R, power = V*I also. Therefore, I don't see why the power equation explains why current affects power lost and not voltage. Can someone clarify this please?</p>
<p>It depends on which R you are referring to. Power lost is I^2 * R(of the conductor). Power delivered is I^2 * R(of the load). <a href="../../../p/s/t/User%7EPstudier_a309.html" title="User:Pstudier">pstudier</a> 03:55, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do see a problem with formulas however. P=I^2R and P=IV of course, but coupled with introduction of "This implies that in the same wire, if the current is doubled, the power loss will be four times greater", to some readers this might suggest that if the voltage is doubled, the power loss will NOT be four times greater, which is certainly not the case because P=V^2/R too. Something should be done about this, but I am not sure what. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:33, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have to be careful, when you are using P=V^2/R, to specify what V you are referring to. Your statement above suggests that you are talking about the voltage drop across the wire. Doubling this would indeed cause a quadrupling of the power loss. However, the V usually referred to in this context is the transmission voltage. Doubling this causes a quartering, not a quadrupling, of the power loss. I'm reluctant to explain this in the article because it would just add confusion where there is presently simplicity. However, I'm open to ideas. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 17:09, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To a degree a reasonable point, but modern electrical systems was first developed in the US and then introduced in Europe, so I think the writer is unwittingly formulating it from a historical point of view. More importantly, Wiki shouldn't claim "general acceptance" (opinion) unless it really is so. As best as I can tell from some surfing and reading, the details of the 50-vs-60 HZ developments in the US vs Germany is to a large degree veiled in the mists of history around the previous turn of the century. And the "adapt to metric" theory for 50 Hz appears to be more of a postrationalization (as is the similar claim that 60 Hz makes it easy to have a synchronized clock showing the correct time, which is contradicted by the fact that the patent for such a clock post-dates the 60 Hz decision by decades). What is known is that 50 Hz was decided on by AEG in Germany, which drove the development of electrical power in Europe, and 60 Hz was decided on by Tesla and the Westinghouse team (Stillwell, Shallenberger, Schmid, and Scott). As far as I can tell, that is what is *known*, the rest is theory. I'll update accordingly.--<a href="../../../p/s/m/User%7EPsm_ea92.html" title="User:Psm">Psm</a> 20:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>60Hz may also have been chosen as it would make for more convinent gearing ratios in electric clocks.

<dd><i>An alternating current (AC) is an electrical current where the magnitude and direction of the current varies cyclically, as opposed to direct current, where the direction of the current stays constant.</i> seems wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only difference between AC and DC is that AC alternate between positive and negative values as DC always stay positive...You can have a perfect sine wave which stay on positive values as a DC current. So the form of the wave as nothing to do with DC or AC. You can also have pulsed waves that can be AC. Magnitude have nothing to do here...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the author of the statement "You can have a perfect sine wave which stay (sic) on positive values..." wasn't thinking clearly. What must have been meant is that one can have a current that is a perfect sine wave (which, by definition, has positive and negative values) superimposed on a direct (constant) current. A time varying current that is always positive or always negative is not, strictly speaking, DC. It is easy to show that such a time varying current is composed of a direct (constant) current plus one or more alternating currents. For example, the current defined by the following:</dd>

<p><br />
When you are mixing two currents it's sure you can't tell at this moment whether its DC or AC because its both but usually the DC will be use to transport AC and then be divided again by a coil and/or capacitors. The result will be a positive sine-wave and a alternating sine-wave.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that we've got to the bottom of this definition yet. There doesn't seem to be a consensus of the meaning of "AC". Here are some examples of the various meanings:
<ul>
<li><i>Chambers Dictionary of Science &amp; Technology</i> says that (i) it alternates in direction, (ii) it has a constant period of alternation and (iii) the normal waveform is a sinusoid.</li>
<li>McGraw Hill <i>Illustrated Dictionary of Electronics</i> gives alternation of polarity as the only criterion, but implies with the use of the word "frequency" that the period should be constant. It does not mention a sinusoid.</li>
<li>Horowitz &amp; Hill's <i>The Art of Electronics</i> doesn't attempt a definition, but says that DC signals don't change in time and AC signals do.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I think we should say "AC is any current that repeatedly reverses direction so that its long-term average is zero. Unless the shape of the waveform is specified, it is usually assumed to be a sine wave." --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 09:59, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to know exactly what happens with the three holes in an outlet. Since voltage is a difference, and a circuit must be closed to receive it, does only one of the leads vary, or both, in opposite phases from each other? If the latter, does that mean connecting the same terminal from two different outlets produces no current? If the former, does that mean one of the terminals has no power? Does the ground terminal connect directly to the ground or a building's structure, as opposed to running through a power cable?<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadmuthahubbard_cebe.html" title="User:Badmuthahubbard">Badmuthahubbard</a> 20:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The neutral/cold wire is grounded and the live/hot wire varies. You could say that the neutral wire 'has no power', in the sense that if you touch it you <i>probably</i> won't get a serious shock; but when you complete the circuit by plugging in a load, it carries just as much power as the live wire. The ground wire goes to a local ground in the building. It is there for safety, and normally carries no power. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 20:48, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
