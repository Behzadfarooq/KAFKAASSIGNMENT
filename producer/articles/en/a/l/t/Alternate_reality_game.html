<p>An <b>alternate reality game</b> (<b>ARG</b>) is an interactive <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrative.html" title="Narrative">narrative</a> that uses the real world as a platform, often involving multiple media and game elements, to tell a story that may be affected by participants' ideas or actions.</p>
<p>The form is typified by intense player involvement with a story that takes place in real-time and evolves according to participants' responses, and characters that are actively controlled by the game's designers, as opposed to being controlled by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> as in a computer or console <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a>. Players interact directly with characters in the game, solve plot-based challenges and puzzles, and often work together with a community to analyze the story and coordinate real-life and online activities. ARGs generally use multiple <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multimedia.html" title="Multimedia">media</a> (such as telephones, email, and mail) but rely on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> as the central binding medium.</p>
<p>ARGs are growing in popularity, with new games appearing regularly and an increasing amount of experimentation with new models and subgenres. They tend to be free to play, with costs absorbed either through supporting products (e.g. collectible puzzle cards fund <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perplex_City_ad06.html" title="Perplex City">Perplex City</a>) or through promotional relationships with existing products (e.g. <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_love_bees.html" title="I love bees">I love bees</a> was a promotion for <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Experience_b649.html" title="Lost Experience">Lost Experience</a> promoted the television show <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>). However, pay-to-play models are not unheard of.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Defining alternate reality gaming">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Defining alternate reality gaming</span></h2>
<p>There is a great deal of debate about how to define the term "alternate reality game" and what should be included or excluded by the definition. Unfiction founder Sean Stacey has suggested that the best way to define the genre was <i>not</i> to define it, and instead locate each game on three axes (ruleset, authorship and coherence) in a sphere of "chaotic fiction" that would include works such as the <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> and street games like <a href="../../../s/f/z/SFZero_8661.html" title="SFZero">SF0</a> as well.<sup id="_ref-Stacey_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stacey" title="">[1]</a></sup> While addressing all of the various attempts at definitions and arguments for and against them is beyond the scope of this article, defining a few terms unique to ARG parlance, identifying precursors and influences on the development of the genre, and comparing and contrasting ARGs to other similar forms of entertainment may be helpful in aiding understanding of the form.</p>
<p><a name="Unique_terminology" id="Unique_terminology"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Unique terminology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unique terminology</span></h3>
<p>Three terms in particular are essential to understand when discussing ARGs.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Puppetmaster</b> - A <i>puppetmaster</i> is an individual involved in designing and/or running an ARG. Puppetmasters are simultaneously allies and adversaries to the player base, creating obstacles and providing resources for overcoming them in the course of telling the game's story. Puppetmasters generally remain behind the <i>curtain</i> while a game is running.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Curtain</b> - The curtain is generally a metaphor for the separation between the puppetmasters and the players. This can take the traditional form of absolute secrecy regarding the puppetmasters' identities and involvement with the production, or refer merely to the convention that puppetmasters do not communicate directly with players through the game, interacting instead through the characters and the game's design.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>This Is Not A Game (TINAG)</b> - Setting the ARG form apart from other games is the <i>This Is Not A Game</i> aesthetic, which dictates that the game not behave like a game: phone numbers mentioned in the ARG, for example, should actually work, and the game should not provide a overtly-designated playspace or ruleset to the players.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Similarities_and_differences_to_other_forms_of_entertainment" id="Similarities_and_differences_to_other_forms_of_entertainment"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Similarities and differences to other forms of entertainment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Similarities and differences to other forms of entertainment</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_games.html" title="Video games">Computer/console/video games</a></i>. While ARGs generally use the internet as a central binding medium, they are not played exclusively on a computer and usually do not require the use of special software or interfaces. Non-player characters in ARGs are controlled in real-time by the puppetmasters, not computer <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">AI</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_games.html" title="Role-playing games">Role-playing games</a> (RPGs)</i>. The role of the puppetmaster in creating ARG narratives and the puppetmaster's relationship with an ARG's players bears a great deal of similarity to the role of a <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeon_master.html" title="Dungeon master">dungeon master</a> or gamemaster in a role-playing game. However, the role of the players is quite different. Most ARGs do not have any sort of published ruleset -- players discover the rules and the boundaries of the game through trial and error -- and do not require players to assume fictional identities or roleplay beyond feigning belief in the reality of the characters they interact with (even if games where players play 'themselves' are a long standing variant on the genre).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_games.html" title="Massively multiplayer online role-playing games">Massively multiplayer online role-playing games</a> (MMORPGs)</i>. As outlined above with computer games and traditional role-playing games, non-player characters in ARGs are controlled by real people in real time, not by computer AI; ARGs do not generally require special software or interfaces to play; the games do not require players to roleplay or create characters or avatars; and ARGs generally use multiple media and real life in addition to the internet to distribute their narratives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Viral marketing/internet hoaxes</i>. While ARGs are often used as a type of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral marketing</a>, they diverge sharply from the philosophy behind "sponsored consumers" or other viral marketing practices that attempt to trick consumers into believing that planted shills for a product are other independent consumers. Similarly, they also diverge from sites or narratives that genuinely try to convince visitors that they are what they claim to be. Puppetmasters generally leave both subtle and overt clues to the game's fictional nature and boundaries where players can find them (e.g. through clearly fictional names on site registrations) and many ARGs openly flaunt obviously fictional plots. The puppetmasters of the genre's seminal example, the Beast,<sup id="_ref-BeastFAQ_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeastFAQ" title="">[3]</a></sup> made it a point of pride never to pretend to be players in order to solicit publicity or nudge players along, and the Terms of Service of Unfiction, the central community site for the ARG genre, strictly prohibit individuals involved in creating games from posting about them without disclosing their involvement.<sup id="_ref-Stacey2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stacey2" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Influences and precursors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influences and precursors</span></h3>
<p>Due to factors like the curtain, attempts to begin games with "stealth launches" to fulfill the TINAG aesthetic, and the restrictive non-disclosure agreements governing how much information may be revealed by the puppetmasters of promotional games, the design process for many ARGs is often shrouded in secrecy, making it difficult to discern the extent to which they have been influenced by other works. In addition, the cross-media nature of the form allows ARGs to incorporate elements of so many other art forms and works that attempting to identify them all would be a nearly-impossible task.</p>
<p><a name="Possible_inspirations_from_fiction_and_other_art_forms" id="Possible_inspirations_from_fiction_and_other_art_forms"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Possible inspirations from fiction and other art forms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Possible inspirations from fiction and other art forms</span></h4>
<p><a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._K._Chesterton_dbf7.html" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s 1905 <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short story</a> "The Tremendous Adventures of Major Brown" (part of a collection entitled <i>The Club of Queer Trades</i>) seems to predict the ARG concept, as does John Fowles' 1965 novel <i>The Magus</i>. Ludic texts such as the popular <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i> children's novels may also have provided some inspiration. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Gibson_1ff6.html" title="William Gibson">William Gibson</a>'s novel <i>Pattern Recognition</i> includes a recognizable example of a modern ARG, although it was published after the development of the genre began in earnest. Reader-influenced online fiction such as AOL's <i>QuantumLink Serial</i> provides a model that incorporates audience influence into the storytelling in a manner similar to that of ARGs, as do promotional online games like Wizards of the Coast's <i>Webrunner</i> games. Other possible antecedents include performance art and other theatrical forms that attempt to break Brecht's "fourth wall" and directly engage the audience.</p>
<p>Due to the influence the Beast exerted over the form of later ARGs and the willingness of its creators to talk about its development, its sources of inspiration are both particularly relevant to the evolution of the modern ARG and somewhat more verifiable than other possible antecedents. Elan Lee, one of its creative principals, cites the 1997 movie <i>The Game</i> as an inspiration, as well as the Beatles' "Paul Is Dead" phenomenon. Sean Stewart, another of the three principal designers, notes that designing and running an ARG bears some similarities to running an RPG, and the influence of that particular game form is further suggested by the fact that Jordan Weisman, the game's third main designer, was also the founder of leading RPG company FASA. Stewart also noted that the sort of "creative, collaborative, enthusiastic scavengering behavior"<sup id="_ref-Hanas_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hanas" title="">[5]</a></sup> upon which the Beast depended has its antecedents outside the arts: the Beast just "accidentally re-invented Science as pop culture entertainment."<sup id="_ref-Stewart_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stewart" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Basic design principles of ARGs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Basic design principles of ARGs</span></h2>
<p>As the first fully-fledged ARG, the Beast is often cited as the start of the ARG genre.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[7]</a></sup> While it may be argued that it had predecessors which have as much right to the title, none of them rival the Beast in influence over later efforts, much of which can be attributed to two factors in which it was uniquely successful: a distinct set of design assumptions which remained central to most of the ARGs that followed it, and the creation of a community that lasted far beyond the end of the game and produced members eager to emulate it. While many ARGs that came afterward may each have dispensed with one or two of the set of design principles pioneered by the Beast, the use of the body of principles in general remains what defines and identifies ARGs.</p>
<p>ARGs are sometimes described as the first narrative art form native to the internet, because their storytelling relies on the two main activities conducted there: searching for information, and sharing information. The Beast utilized these two activities through a group of design principles that are now treated as givens by many ARGs and similar forms of internet narratives, but at the time the combination was revolutionary.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Storytelling as archaeology</i>. Instead of presenting a chronologically unified, coherent narrative, the designers scattered pieces of the story across the Internet and other media, allowing players to reassemble it, supply connective tissue and determine what it meant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Platformless narrative</i>. The story was not bound to a single medium, but existed independently and used whatever media were available to make itself heard.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Designing for a hive mind</i>. While it might be possible to follow the game individually, the design was directed at a collective of players that shared information and solutions almost instantly, and incorporated individuals possessing almost every conceivable area of expertise. While the game might initially attract a small group of participants, as they came across new challenges, they would reach out and draw in others with the knowledge they needed to overcome the obstacles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>A whisper is sometimes louder than a shout</i>. Rather than openly promoting the game and trying to attract participation by "pushing" it toward potential players, the designers attempted to "pull" players to the story by engaging in over-the-top secrecy (e.g. Microsoft did not acknowledge any connection between the company or the movie and the game, the game did not acknowledge any connection to Microsoft or <i>A.I.</i>, the identities of the designers were a closely-guarded secret even from other Microsoft employees, etc.), having elements of the game "warn" players away from them, and eschewing traditional marketing channels. Designers did not communicate about the game with players or press while it was in play.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The "this is not a game" (TINAG) aesthetic</i>. The game itself did not acknowledge that it was a game. It did not have an acknowledged ruleset for players; as in real-life, they determined the "rules" either through trial and error or by setting their own boundaries. The narrative presented a fully-realized world: any phone number or email address that was mentioned actually worked, and any website acknowledged actually existed. The game took place in real-time and was not replayable. Characters functioned like real people, not game pieces, responded authentically, and were controlled by real people, not by computer AI. Some events involved meetings or live phone calls between players and actors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Real life as a medium</i>. The game used players' lives as a platform. Players were not required to build a character or role-play being someone other than themselves. They might unexpectedly overcome a challenge for the community simply because of the real-life knowledge and background they possessed. Participants were constantly on the lookout for clues embedded in everyday life.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Collaborative storytelling</i>. While the puppetmasters controlled most of the story, they incorporated player content and responded to players' actions, analysis and speculation by adapting the narrative and intentionally left "white space" for the players to fill in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Not a hoax</i>. While the TINAG aesthetic might seem on the surface to be an attempt to make something indistinguishable from real life, there were both subtle and overt metacommunications in place to reveal the game's framework and most of its boundaries. The most obvious was that the story itself took place in the year 2142, and the websites ostensibly existed in the future (visitors to some of the sites would trigger a pop up warning that their browser was obsolete and unrecognized). The designers also limned the borders of the game more subtly, e.g. through the names on the site registrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of design assumptions was to exert enough influence on subsequent entries in the genre that games that deviated from one or more of these principles were often acknowledged by their designers to be a conscious attempt to do something different, rather than a result of a lack of awareness on the part of the designers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Early examples">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early examples</span></h3>
<p>The marketing for the 1999 movie <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blair_Witch_Project_a6fd.html" title="The Blair Witch Project">The Blair Witch Project</a> resembled ARGs in many ways (and some of its makers went on to create the 2005 Audi promotional ARG Art of the Heist), expanding the world of the movie online, adding backstory, and treating the fiction as reality through real-world media such as fliers and a fake documentary on the Sci-Fi Channel. However, perhaps in part due to the subject material and the absence of overt metacommunications that this was fiction, it also resembles an internet hoax or attempt to create an urban legend.</p>
<p>Pervasive play games like the Go Game and the <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia_Game_5877.html" title="Nokia Game">Nokia Game</a> also incorporated many elements similar to ARGs (although they tended to lack the narrative element central to ARGs) and prefigured the public play components of large-scale corporate ARGs like I Love Bees, Art of the Heist and Last Call Poker.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts' <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majestic_%28video_game%29.html" title="Majestic (video game)">Majestic</a> was developed at roughly the same time as the Beast, although it launched after the Beast had concluded. Featuring phone calls, emails and other media that involved players in a multiplatform narrative, the game was eventually cancelled due to lack of players. Factors ranging from the fee required to play to Majestic's unfortunate timing and subject matter in relation to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center to the absence of the TINAG principle (e.g. in-game phone calls were preceded by an announcement that they were part of the game) have been cited to explain its failure.</p>

An early asset list for the project contained 666 files, prompting the game's puppetmasters to dub it "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beast_%28game%29_36ff.html" title="The Beast (game)">the Beast</a>," a name which was later adopted by players.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[11]</a></sup> A large and extremely active fan community called the Cloudmakers formed to analyze and participate in solving the game,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[12]</a></sup> and the combined intellect, tenacity and engagement of the group soon forced the puppetmasters to create new subplots, devise new puzzles, and alter elements of the design to keep ahead of the player base.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[13]</a></sup> Somewhat unusually for a computer-based game, the production engaged equal numbers of male and female participants,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[14]</a></sup> and drew players from a wide spectrum of age groups and backgrounds.</p>
<p>Although the Beast ran for only three months, it prompted the formation of a highly organized and intensely engaged community that remains active<sup id="_ref-Cloudmakers_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cloudmakers" title="">[15]</a></sup> years after the game concluded. Perhaps more significantly, it inspired a number of its participants to create games adapting and expanding the model, extending it from an anomalous one-time occurrence to a new genre of entertainment and allowing the community to grow even after the Beast itself concluded. Members of the Cloudmakers group went on to form ARGN, the primary news source for the genre, and Unfiction, its central community hub, as well as designing the first successful and widely-played indie ARGs, such as LockJaw and Metacortechs, and corporate efforts such as Perplex City.</p>

<p>The years immediately after the Beast saw independent developers who had played it extend the form from a one-time occurrence to a new genre of gaming, and the formation of an ever-growing community devoted to playing, designing and discussing ARGs.</p>
<p><a name="Grassroots_development" id="Grassroots_development"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: Grassroots development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grassroots development</span></h4>
<p>Influenced heavily by the Beast and enthusiastic about the power of collaboration, several <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloudmakers.html" title="Cloudmakers">Cloudmakers</a> came together with the idea that they could create a similar game. The first effort to make an independent Beast-like game, <i>Ravenwatchers</i>, failed,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[16]</a></sup> but another team soon assembled and met with greater success. With very little experience behind them, the group managed, after nine months of development, to create a viable game that was soon seized upon eagerly by the Cloudmakers group and featured in <i>WIRED</i> Magazine.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[17]</a></sup> As players of the Beast, members of the Lockjaw development team were extremely aware of the community playing the game and took steps to encourage the tight bonding of the player base through highly collaborative puzzles, weekly <a href="../../../e/u/c/Euchre.html" title="Euchre">Euchre</a> games, and the inclusion of player personas in the game. While the numbers never rivaled those of The Beast, the game proved both that it was possible for developers to create these games without corporate funding or promotion, and that there was interest in the ARG form beyond a one-time audience for a production on the Beast's scale. Lockjaw marked the start of the ARG as a genre of gaming, rather than simply a one-time occurrence.</p>
<p>Shortly before Lockjaw's conclusion, players discovered a game that seemed to revolve around the movie <i>Minority Report</i>. Despite speculation to the contrary, the game (known as <i>Exocog</i>) was not an official promotion for the film, but an experiment in interactive storytelling by Jim Miller.<sup id="_ref-Miramontes_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miramontes" title="">[18]</a></sup> Inspired by the independent Lockjaw effort, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Szulborski_ec00.html" title="Dave Szulborski">Dave Szulborski</a> introduced <i>ChangeAgents</i>, a spinoff of EA's failed <i>Majestic</i> ARG, to the ARGN audience, then followed it with two additional installments. During this time, Szulborski also created a successful grassroots game not based on the Majestic universe, called Chasing the Wish. Just before the release of the third and the final <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">Matrix</a></i> movie, the team that developed Lockjaw launched <a href="http://www.metacortechs.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.metacortechs.com/" rel="nofollow">Metacortechs</a>, an ARG based on that universe. The fan fiction effort was very successful, reached a larger and more active player base than many professionally produced games, and was at first assumed by many to be an officially-sanctioned promotion for the movie. Metacortechs was followed by an ever-increasing number of grassroots ARGs.</p>
<p>In the wake of these successful, low-budget independent ARGs, an active "grassroots" development community began to evolve within the genre. While the quality of the grassroots games varies wildly, amateur storytellers, web designers, and puzzle creators continue to provide independently-developed ARGs for the active player community.</p>

<p>The term Alternate Reality Gaming was first used by Sean Stacey, one of the moderators of the Lockjaw player community, in the Trail for that game. Stacey and Steve Peters, another of the moderators, created the two websites that have become the central hub of the ARG community: <a href="http://www.argn.com" class="external text" title="http://www.argn.com" rel="nofollow">ARGN</a> and <a href="http://www.unfiction.com" class="external text" title="http://www.unfiction.com" rel="nofollow">UnFiction</a>. Due to their efforts, when Lockjaw ended, the players had a new community resource allowing them to assemble to play the games that were soon to follow. Unfiction now boasts over 13,000 members, and ARGN employs a staff of 15 volunteer writers to report on new games and other topics of interest to the community, as well as producing a weekly netcast.</p>

<p>After the success of the first major entries in the nascent ARG genre, a number of large corporations looked to ARGs to promote both their products, and to add their companies' images by demonstrating their interest in innovative and fan-friendly marketing methods. To create buzz for the launch of the XBox game <i>Halo 2</i>,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[19]</a></sup> Microsoft hired the team that had created the Beast, now operating independently as 42 Entertainment. The result, <i><a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_Bees_a4f1.html" title="I Love Bees">I Love Bees</a></i>, departed radically from the website-hunting and puzzle-solving that had been the focus of the Beast. <i>I Love Bees</i> wove together an interactive narrative set in 2004, and a <i>War Of The Worlds</i>-style radio drama set in the future, the latter of which was broken into 30-60 second segments and broadcast over ringing payphones worldwide.<sup id="_ref-ILB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ILB" title="">[20]</a></sup> The game pushed players outdoors to answer phones, create and submit content, and recruit others, and received as much or more mainstream notice than its predecessor, finding its way onto television during a presidential debate,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[21]</a></sup> and becoming one of the New York Times' catchphrases of 2004.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[22]</a></sup> A slew of imitators,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[24]</a></sup> fan tributes<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[25]</a></sup> and parodies<sup id="_ref-Ilovebeer_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ilovebeer" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Welovebeef_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Welovebeef" title="">[27]</a></sup> followed.</p>
<p>The following spring, Audi launched <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_the_Heist_4981.html" title="The Art of the Heist">The Art of the Heist</a> to promote its new A3. Developed by Haxan Films and GMD Studios (creators of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blair_Witch_Project_a6fd.html" title="The Blair Witch Project">The Blair Witch Project</a>), the Art of the Heist took live events to a new, nearly cinematic level<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[28]</a></sup> and received extensive media placement.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[29]</a></sup> GMD Studios followed up on this success by producing <i>Who is Benjamin Stove?</i>, a promotion for GMC's ethanol campaign.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Roughly a year after <i>I Love Bees</i>, 42 Entertainment produced <i>Last Call Poker,</i> a promotion for Activision's video game <i>Gun</i>. Designed to help modern audiences connect with the Western genre, Last Call Poker centered around a working poker site, held games of "Tombstone Hold 'Em" in cemeteries around the United States -- as well as in at least one digital venue, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>'s own virtual reality cemetery<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[31]</a></sup> -- and sent players to their own local cemeteries to clean up neglected grave sites and perform other tasks.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of 2005, the International Game Developers Association ARG Special Interest Group was formed "to bring together those already designing, building, and running ARGs, in order to share knowledge, experience, and ideas for the future."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Edit section: The rise of the self-supporting ARG">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The rise of the self-supporting ARG</span></h3>
<p>As the genre has grown, there has been increasing interest in exploring models that provide funding for large-scale ARGs that are neither promotions for other products or limited by the generally small budget of grassroots/indie games. The two major trends that have emerged in this area are support through the sale of products related to the game, and fees for participation in the game. A third possible model is one using in-game advertising for other products, as in The LOST Experience, but at this time no large-scale game has attempted to fund itself solely through in-game advertising.</p>
<p>The first major attempt (other than EA's failed <i>Majestic</i>) to create a self-supporting ARG was <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perplex_City_ad06.html" title="Perplex City">Perplex City</a>, which launched in 2005 after a year's worth of teasers. The ARG offered a $200,000 prize to the first player to locate the buried Receda Cube and was funded by the sale of puzzle cards. The first season of the game ended in January 2007, when Andy Darley found the Receda Cube at Wakerly Great Wood in Northamptonshire, UK. <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_Candy_4c78.html" title="Mind Candy">Mind Candy</a>, the production company, has also produced a board game related to the ARG and plans to continue it with a second season beginning March 1, 2007. Whether the model was a success is unknown at this time, although Mind Candy's acceptance of corporate sponsorship and venture capital suggests that the puzzle cards alone are not enough to fully fund the ARG at this time.</p>
<p>In March of 2006, Elan Lee and Dawne Weisman founded edoc laundry, a company designed to produce ARGs using clothes as the primary platform. Consumers decipher the codes hidden within the garments and input the results into the game's main website to reveal pieces of a story about the murder of a band manager.</p>
<p>Reviving the pay-to-play model, Studio Cypher launched the first chapter of its "multiplayer novel" in May of 2006. Each "chapter" is a mini-ARG for which participants who pay the $10 registration fee receive earlier access to information and greater opportunities to interact with characters than non-paying participants. VirtuQuest, a well-known corporate team, also attempted a pay-to-play model with <i>Township Heights</i> later in the year, but despite initial enthusiasm on the part of the ARG community, the game was not well-received due to the design team's public use of players' real names without obtaining their permission, and the perception that their funding practices were questionable.</p>
<p>In June of 2006, Catching the Wish launched from an in-game website about comic books based on its predecessor, 2003's Chasing the Wish. 42 Entertainment released <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathy%27s_book.html" title="Cathy's book">Cathy's Book</a></i>, by Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman, in October 2006, shifting the central medium of this ARG from the internet to the printed page. The young-adult novel contains an "evidence packet" and expands its universe through websites and working phone numbers, but is also a stand-alone novel that essentially functions as an individually-playable ARG. Neither the cost of creating the book nor sales figures are available (although it made both American<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[33]</a></sup> and British bestseller lists) to determine whether the project was successfully self-funded.</p>
<p>It is difficult to judge the efficacy of self-funded ARG models at this time, but it seems likely that exploration of ways to fund large-scale ARGs without using them as marketing for other products will continue as the genre grows.</p>

<p>2006 produced less large-scale corporate ARGs than past years, but the ARG form continued to spread and be adapted for promotional uses, as an increasing number of TV shows and movies extended their universes onto the internet through such means as character blogs and ARG-like puzzle trails, and as an increasing number of independent/grassroots games launched, with varying levels of success.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[34]</a></sup> <i><a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a></i>, a popular series of videos on <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, relinquished an unprecedented amount of control to its audience by recognizing a fan-created game as the "official" ARG.</p>
<p>2007 got off to a strong start immediately, with Microsoft's <i><a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanishing_Point_%28alternate_reality_game%29_3099.html" title="Vanishing Point (alternate reality game)">Vanishing Point</a></i> to promote the launch of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Vista_dc35.html" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a>. The game was designed by 42 Entertainment and, due in part to many large-scale real world events, such as a lavish show at the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellagio_%28hotel_and_casino%29.html#Fountains" title="Bellagio (hotel and casino)">Bellagio Fountain</a> in Las Vegas as well as a prizes of a trip into space<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[35]</a></sup> and having a winner's name engraved on all AMD Athlon 64 FX chips for a certain period of time,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[36]</a></sup> received large media attention.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[37]</a></sup> It was followed almost immediately by a promotion, also rumored to be a 42 Entertainment production, for the release of the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Inch_Nails_f615.html" title="Nine Inch Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> album <i><a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_Zero_%28album%29_d9a7.html" title="Year Zero (album)">Year Zero</a></i>, in which fans discovered leaked songs on <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thumb_drive.html" title="Thumb drive">thumb drives</a> in washrooms at concerts,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[38]</a></sup> as well as clues to <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_Zero_%28alternate_reality_game%29_6778.html" title="Year Zero (alternate reality game)">websites</a> that describe a dystopian future. <i>Monster Hunter Club</i>, a promotion for the U.S. release of the movie <i>The Host,</i> launched by sending action figures and other items to prominent members of the ARG community.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[39]</a></sup> <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perplex_City_ad06.html" title="Perplex City">Perplex City</a> concluded its first season by awarding a $200,000 prize to a player who found the game's missing cube.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[40]</a></sup> They plan to continue the ARG into a second "season" under the name <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perplex_City_Stories_82ae.html" title="Perplex City Stories">Perplex City Stories</a>, although they have said that there will not be a large grand prize this time around. <sup id="_ref-PXC2_prize_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PXC2_prize" title="">[41]</a></sup> Meigeist, produced by a new professional puppetmaster team, garnered a great deal of community attention and affection with a light, humorous storyline and numerous references to past ARGs.</p>

<p>Even before the development of the ARG genre, television sought to extend the reality of its shows onto the web with websites that treated the world as real, rather than discussing it as fiction. An early example was Fox's Freakylinks, developed by <a href="../../../h/a/x/Haxan.html" title="Haxan">Haxan</a>/GMD Studios, creators of the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_Witch_Project_53bd.html" title="Blair Witch Project">Blair Witch Project</a>, who would later go on to develop the well-known ARGs <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_the_Heist_4981.html" title="The Art of the Heist">The Art of the Heist</a> and Who Is Benjamin Stove. Freakylinks employed a website designed to look like it had been created by amateur paranormal enthusiasts to generate internet interest in the show, which gathered a cult following but was canceled after 13 episodes.<sup id="_ref-Freakylinks_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Freakylinks" title="">[42]</a></sup> In September 2002, following a successful initial foray into ARG-like territory with 2001's <i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alias_%28TV_series%29_465c.html" title="Alias (TV series)">Alias</a></i> web game,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[43]</a></sup> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> brought alternate reality gaming more definitively to the television screen with the show <i><a href="../../../p/u/s/Push%2C_Nevada_91ea.html" title="Push, Nevada">Push, Nevada</a></i>.

When advertising the show, they advertised the city instead, with billboards, news reports, company sponsors, and other realistic life-intruding forms.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[44]</a></sup> During each episode of the show, highly cryptic clues would be revealed on screen, while other hidden clues could be found on the city's website. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled mid-season, and all of the remaining clues were released to the public. Clever watchers eventually figured out that the show would still be paying out its $1 million prize during <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i>. The last clue was revealed during <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-time.html" title="Half-time">half-time</a>, prompting those fortunate enough to have solved the puzzle to call a telephone number.

Clues and stories from the series sent players online to stop a bioterrorist attack.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, the TV tie-in ARG began to come into its own when there was a surge of ARGs that extended the worlds of related television shows onto the internet and into the real world. As with <i><a href="../../../p/u/s/Push%2C_Nevada_91ea.html" title="Push, Nevada">Push, Nevada</a></i>, ABC led the way, launching three TV tie-in ARGs in 2006: <i>KyleXY</i>,<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[47]</a></sup> Ocular Effect (for the show <i>Fallen</i>)<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[48]</a></sup> and The LOST Experience (for the show <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">LOST</a></i>).<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[49]</a></sup> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> joined with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> in the UK and Australia's <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Channel 7</a> in promoting a revamped web site for <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanso_Foundation_0db5.html" title="Hanso Foundation">The Hanso Foundation</a>.
