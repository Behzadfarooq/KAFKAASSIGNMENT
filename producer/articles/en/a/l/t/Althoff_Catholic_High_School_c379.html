<p>In 1960, Albert R. Zuroweste, the Bishop of Belleville, met with lay leaders of the Belleville area concerning conditions existing at the Cathedral High School for boys and the Academy of Notre Dame for girls. Since both schools were overcrowded, it was decided that new coed facilities must be provided for the influx of students from the Catholic grade schools. Thus, Althoff Catholic High School came into existence.</p>
<p>Situated on a 37.5 acre tract fronting 5401 West Main Street, Belleville, it was dedicated on August 30, 1964, and named in honor of the previous Bishop, Henry Althoff. The new high school opened its doors on September 3, 1964. Since that time Althoff has graduated 7221 students including 915 Illinois State Scholars, 73 National Merit commended Students (top 5% in nation), and 22 National Merit Finalists (top 1% in the nation).Two students have been honored with the National Achievement Scholarship of Negro Students. Althoff continues its tradition of excellence to this week.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/t/Althoff_Catholic_High_School_c379.html" title="Edit section: Sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>
<p>The Althoff Boys Basketball team made an unprecedented run in the '06-'07 season. They made it all the way to sectionals.</p>
<p>The Boys Volleyball team began the '07 season on a high note, showing strong potential for going on to the state championship. Captained by Dylan Kinsella, the team continues on path to victory. Josh Massey warms the bench for the team and is little or no help at all.</p>
<p>The Althoff Girls Tennis team is one of the more notable programs of the school. The 2006 season was very successful under the coaching of Dan Strobo. Seniors Katy Dragich, Mary Morton and Chelsea Thompson led the way of being the most talented and best looking players. Mary Morton was unstoppable playing singles and the famous Dragich-Thompson duo had a victorious year.</p>
<p>The track team, though small, is a mighty force. It features a bevy of fast-footed people like JC and Kash-Money.</p>

<p>- Chris Buchheit (senior) is the premier stage performer at Althoff Catholic High School. He has held various lead roles in many performances including Atticus Finch in <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_45a9.html" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>. On a side note, he is also one of the best looking actors to grace the stage of Heritage Hall as well as Salutitorian.</p>

<p>- Allison Kauling (senior) is probably even more talented than Chris (especially in singing/ dancing). She is one of the strangest people one could ever meet, but also one of the funniest. She is the Class Clown of the class of '07.</p>
<p>- Shannon McCarkel (senior) is a talented actress who mostly excels in the field of dance (as well as seduction). She plans on majoring in design and is very excited about college.</p>
<p>- Jon Schmidt (junior) has been in more plays than any other cast member. He is a very talented young actor. Brother of the famed Chris Schmidt, Jon has easily lifted himself from his brother's shadow and made quite a name for himself.</p>
<p>- Sarah Lantry (sophomore) has the least experience of this spring's cast, yet she can still hold her own. She is the sister of Brian Lantry of Althoff's Boys Volleyball team.</p>

<p>Gary Schuline taught at Althoff for 40 years, retiring in 2004. Not only did he teach honors history, but he also spent 39 years coaching students on the football field. He owns an 80-acre farm in Missouri where he resides with his wife, Ann. He also enjoys spending time with their two sons and, in his spare time, likes woodworking and making furniture. He was also a founding member of the <i>Morning Meeting</i>.</p>
<p>James Young is Althoff's resident maintneance man. He has worked diligently at Althoff for the past 11 years. Though his is one of the less recognized jobs at the school, Jim has always found it rewarding. From installing ceiling fans to replacing floor tiles, Jim's job is to "fix whatever breaks." He is the president of the <i>Morning Meeting</i> where he drinks morning coffee and gossips with other faculty. The deer sausage that he makes tastes so good after a hard day of work.</p>
<p>Dorthy Mueller is a favorite in the Math department. After 12 years, whe still loves teaching at Althoff. Though she admittedly may be losing her mind, students don't seem to mind. Not only does she know how to do math well, she knows how to help students understand it. She is always willing to help students understand better, but only if they ask. She is always willing to lend out her calculator, but should you clear her programs, beware the wrath of Dot! When Dot is not teaching she enjoys hanging out with her grandchildren, cheese-its, and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.</p>
