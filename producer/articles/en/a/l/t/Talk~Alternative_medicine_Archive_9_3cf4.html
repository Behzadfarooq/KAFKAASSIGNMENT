<dd>Dan, you are very confused, please follow the link and read the original article. (A) The ADL article <b>is</b> about Israel Shahak and others who engage in anti-Semitic quote mining. Why do you keep denying this? Go back and read the entire article. (B) Why are you using the strawman argument of saying "he has been accused of misinterpreting Jewish law, when he does not interpet Jewish law, he reports other's interpretations". That's childish. How would feel if I rewrote Wikipedia articles on race relations and Nergos with the most vile, bigoted, infantile and stupid speech from a handful of black rappers and self-hating blacks? That's possible, but this kind of racist quote-mining to make an entire ethnic look bad is a violation of intellectual integrity. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:03, Jul 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, both RK in combination with TK have managed to bamboozle themselves. For the first time, I actually read the section on contemporary use of alternative medicine section and spotted a <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm" class="external text" title="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm" rel="nofollow">NCCAM survey</a> that I was not aware of. It is 20 pages of public domain data that is precisely what I need to write an alternative medicine section on a number of conventional medicine articles, various diets, etc., etc. etc. I now have the facts to that supports my global definition of CAM. Thanks once again, TK! I would never have spotted this valuable survey without your help.

I still have to work on CAM diets, mega-vitamin therapy, vitamin supplements and natural products. Scores of lost articles have been found, perhaps close to 100 in all, thanks to TK.

<dd>I agree, I feel the group version is much better. I'm tempted to do a revert (as per MNH's policy: <i>"Large deletions of text automatically calls for a revert, IMHO."</i> (see above)) so that people can work on the page from before, but I won't. Instead, I "Vote" for the version from before MNH's recent edits. Though, on second thoughts, maybe it <i>would</i> be better to wipe the page and start again from scrath, as a collaborative group project. - <a href="../../../x/g/k/User%7EXgkkp_7557.html" title="User:Xgkkp">Xgkkp</a> 17:06, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if it is all the same to you, if it is going to be a group effort then I might as well wait until the article is unprotected. Currently, I am working on a major addition to my website that will consist of a presentation of alternative medicine as history during 19th century Europe and America. You know stuff that is based on historical fact, rather than hot air. You guys should feel free to continue editing this article in a never ending spiral of circular editing. Personally, I have better things to do than work on this nonsense. I mean really! Changing the levels of indention so that support paragraphs wont actually appear to be support? I find that a rather screwy waste of time. -- [[User:Mr-Natural-Health|John Gohde | <a href="../../../m/r/-/User_talk%7EMr-Natural-Health_a72f.html" title="User talk:Mr-Natural-Health">Talk</a>]] 17:34, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, one way or the other there will be an admin having her admin actions being reviewed. It is not Wikipedian to keep articles protected. And,not only will I request that this page be unprotected I will have something new to complain about. RK trashed both althernative medicine and TCM exactly like he did the last time. RK has been in Talk:TCM, but not here to discuss his edit. Therefore, this page will be unprotected.

As for requesting the page to be unprotected you are free to request whatever you like; however to state "this page will be unprotected" seems a little premature. You have to find an admin willing to do it first. As for RK, like I said before I cannot <i>force</i> him to edit, just as i cannot force you. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 09:15, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>things are quiet on the labour floor... well I was feeling sympathetic towards MNH (he's like that drunk that keeps getting beaten up - its not really his fault he's that abrasive) and was going to try and make the current temp article a bit smoother and more reasonable, but having seen his latest edit which appears to be just back to how he wants it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine%2Ftemp&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4068760" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine%2Ftemp&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4068760" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I could no longer be bothered. All versions I've seen are unbalanced but there is <i>fantastic</i> material here to make an article to be <i>really proud of</i>.

<li>The lean version is too lean - too many references to not enough text. But the previous version is thoroughly unbalanced between criticism and support. We shouldn't need to split it like that into pro and anti - we should be able to just present the facts as they exist, without the article being a recapitulation of the "I'm right" "No, I'm right" battles that are inevitable on the talk pages. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EALargeElk_ecec.html" title="User:ALargeElk"></a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EALargeElk_ecec.html" title="User:ALargeElk">ALargeElk</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EALargeElk_4392.html" title="User talk:ALargeElk">Talk</a> 09:39, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>John what do you think about going back to the older version mentioned below and working from there? Clearly any new information added since then would need to go back in, but the layout, the tone etc could remain the same.

<p>I've been looking over the article as it was in the past. It wasn't always so pro and anti. MykReeve did a major rewrite some months ago to try and present a more balanced view. Several people edited that vesion until it looked like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;oldid=2930969" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;oldid=2930969" rel="nofollow">this</a>but unfortunately it deteriorated into the current form afterwards.

<dd>I can't agree with you there john. If we cut down the text to your version people will try to expand the article by adding stuff. An article called alternative medicine should discuss alternative medicine. People doing a web search for alternative medicine will find this article first. They may not go on to other pages in the same category. So this page should give a pretty comprehensive overview ofthe topic.</dd>

<li>It's too minimal. I don't understand what the objection is to having a "pro" and "con" section. You can't sensibly write an article on this subject that doesn't even mention the placebo effect. Obviously, though, you can't mention the placebo effect (a major issue raised by those hostile to CAM) yet omit major issues raised by proponents of CAM. Therefore, as a practical matter, the article has to report both sides of the dispute, even if that does produce something of a "yes it is" - "no it isn't" tone. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 03:06, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">James</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>There's no particular reason for a dmoz link to be included in this or most other articles. It doesn't (necessarily) add much more value to an article than linking to a Google search on the article's title and calling it "Search Google for ... ".</li>
<li>A significant number of the dmoz links in current articles are despammed ebook2u links. They weren't added to Wikipedia in good faith [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copies" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copies" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copies</a></li>

<li>That link survived for almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=2327470&amp;oldid=2319601" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=2327470&amp;oldid=2319601" rel="nofollow">5 months</a> as ebook2u spam and no-one seemed to misunderstand its link text: "Alternative Medicine Information". Why is "Alternative Medicine Directory" so much more confusing?</li>
<li>Not everyone knows what dmoz is but most people seem to know what a directory is, given that the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_500" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_500" rel="nofollow">most popular site on the web</a> is a <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">directory</a>.</li>
<li>All web pages are "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4351657" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Alternative_medicine&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4351657" rel="nofollow">collections of links</a>". If you believe that such words as "directory" or "dmoz" overestimate the cluefulness of Wikipedia readers, it strikes me that "collection of links" errs in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>There are at least 30 other Wikipedia pages that assume the user either knows or doesn't care that "dmoz", "directory" and "Open Directory Project" refer to "collections of links". Do you plan to fix those pages as well?</li>
<li>Should we also change all those IMDb links variously annotated as "IMDB page for ... ", "IMDb entry for... ", "IMDb filmography" to "collection of film links"? After all, not everyone knows what <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a> is.</li>

<p>My response:</p>
<ol>
<li>I agree with you about not putting a dmoz link on everything in sight. With this particular article, however, <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Health/Alternative/" class="external text" title="http://www.dmoz.org/Health/Alternative/" rel="nofollow">the dmoz link</a> is valuable because "alternative medicine" covers so many different treatments. A Google search for that phrase won't produce a set of references nicely organized by subtopic, which is provided by the dmoz page.</li>
<li>The origin of the link doesn't matter. There's a lot of valuable stuff in Wikipedia that wasn't added in good faith, but to promote someone's agenda.</li>
<li>I didn't add the parenthetical because of the change from "information" to "directory." My reason was rather the belief that it's a service to the readers to give them an idea of what they'll find at an external link. They'll normally assume they'll find some additional substantive content they can read; they should be notified if it's just links, or isn't in English, etc.</li>
<li>In this context, a "directory" could well be a list of alternative medicine practitioners by state.</li>
<li>You're right that most web sites do include links. The difference is that they also have some text, which a reader pursuing a link from this article might want to read. The point about noting this site as a collection of links is that it has essentially no other information.</li>
<li>No, I have no such plan. I added two parentheses and three words to <i>this</i> article because I was working on <i>this</i> article. The issue is whether the change is an improvement here, not whether there are numerous other improvements someone could make to numerous other articles. Wikipedia will never be completed.</li>
<li>An IMDb link doesn't need explanation under the philosophy I detailed above. Clicking on a link to IMDb does get you more information about the subject, which is what the reader would generally expect from an external link. An IMDb entry isn't just a collection of links. (It's also better known than dmoz, especially to someone who's at an article about a film.)</li>

<p>I'll defer reverting in case you want to continue the discussion. After all the turmoil over this page, we certainly don't want to get in an edit war over something like this! <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 20:49, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, and thanks for giving me enough time to work out that you're right&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I've added a new version which I hope is acceptable.</p>
<p>In the spirit of this article's illustrious martial history, I've listed a bunch of forthright objections to your points above, even though I agree with you and hope we've reached a consensus&#160;:-) They're really objections to the "collection of links" wording rather than to your underlying point.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fair enough.</li>
<li>They weren't added to promote an agenda, which I agree is no (intrinsically) bad thing; they were added to drive traffic to a commercial site. There's a difference between POV and spam.</li>
<li>I agree with your reasoning, which is precisely why I think the description should be technically correct. "Collection of links" (or "just links") could refer to <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.robotwisdom.com/" rel="nofollow">Robot Wisdom</a>, a <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2004-06/threads.html" class="external text" title="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2004-06/threads.html" rel="nofollow">discussion thread</a>, or a porn <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_farm.html" title="Link farm">link farm</a>. In addition, it doesn't do justice to the carefully (manually) classified, hierarchically organized <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_directory.html" title="Web directory">Web directory</a> concept at all. It's as likely to discourage a surfer who might benefit from the link as it is to protect one whose time (or bandwidth) would otherwise be squandered.</li>
<li>Given that that's precisely what the <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Health/Alternative/Practitioners/" class="external text" title="http://www.dmoz.org/Health/Alternative/Practitioners/" rel="nofollow">third link</a> on the page points to I doubt there'd be much confusion. The word "directory" wasn't chosen randomly.</li>
<li>That makes it sound like it's links all the way down, link-farm stylee. Of course, that's not the case. Click on any of the top-level links and you'll find the text you crave.</li>
<li>We could all implement experimental micro-policies (which is what I consider that annotation to be - a kind of subtitle for the surfing-impaired, a disability we don't usually, as far as I know, impute to our gentle readers), but without consensus I don't see how one could expect them to avoid being reverted back to the prevailing norm. I suppose I asked because I imagine that if you undertook such a task, you might meet some resistance in other quarters, perhaps from people able to express the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy better than me. Then again, you might be garlanded with laurels and greeted with rapturous rounds of applause&#160;:-) Just to be clear: I don't have any problem with the idea of a link being annotated in cases where the target is, as you say, written in a foreign language, or a PDF, or where the title alone doesn't reveal much, or where the site is virulently POV or not worksafe or whatever. I just don't think this link falls into the <i>special treatment</i> category any more than the other dmoz links.</li>
<li>Fair enough. But Yahoo is better known than any other site in the solar system and displays these words prominently on its front page: "Web Site Directory - Sites organized by subject". It doesn't say: "Web Site Directory (collection of links) - Sites organized by subject". If it did, I think it would arouse no small degree of inadvertent mirth. In the context of the web, people know what a directory is.</li>

<p>I can live with your version. As for your other comments, I've had much experience in volunteer organizations before ever discovering Wikipedia. The most important rule for a volunteer to remember is: "Never expect gratitude." If I somehow find myself being "garlanded with laurels and greeted with rapturous rounds of applause," fine, but I ain't holdin' my breath. &#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 03:13, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
