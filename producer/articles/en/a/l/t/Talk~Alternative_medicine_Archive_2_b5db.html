<h2><span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p><i>Alternative medicine is a very broad term for any method that seeks to prevent or heal disease through methods that have not yet been proven to work by peer-reviewed scientific studies. Any method that claims to provide healing without a literature of such studies is outside the mainstream of conventional medical practice.</i></p>
<p>This is wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>Historically, medicine was not backed by peer reviewed scientific studies, though some of it was backed by science, but it was not alternative medicine</li>
<li>Some convention medicine is experimental, and thus not backed by peer reviewed scientific studies, but it is not alternative medicine. This is particularly the case for unusual or emergency cases.</li>
<li>Some conventional medicine is decidedly non-proven. Off the top of my head, the treatment of the UK's <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_and_mouth.html" title="Foot and mouth">foot and mouth</a> epidemic is a good example: it was a one-off event with certain unique circumstances, and the reaction was largely made up on the hoof, pun intended. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 17:20, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, Martin, the original statement is correct. It is you who is mistaken. This article does <i>not</i> state that all of medicine historically has been peer-reviewed. I do not know where you are getting that from. Rather, this article is talking mostly about the present, the 20th and 21st century. In the 21st century, mainstream conventional medicine is based on peer-reviewed scientific studies. Claims to the contrary are false. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you are confused about the difference between quakcery and scientific experimentation. For instance, you claim "Some convention medicine is experimental, and thus not backed by peer reviewed scientific studies, but it is not alternative medicine." This is very confused. No one says that an emergency medical treatment of an individual is "alternative medicine". Mainstream science is based on techniques and medications whose effectiveness has been verified by multiple peer-reviewed experiments. Treatement of any given individual person, by definition, cannot be run as a peer-reviewed experiment. That is madness. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 21:55, Dec 7, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But I think you (RK) are too "scientific peer review" oriented. On the other hand, your <i>outside the mainstream of conventional medical practice</i> might not suport an statistical study if you take into account the number of Eastern and African people using "not-scientifically-peer-reviewed-medicine". Stating that needs quite a careful statistical study. Of course unless one assumes "medicine is what Western doctors apply to their patients".</dd>
<dd>Notice that <i>I am not saying that peer review is unnecessary</i>. I am saying that medicine (think please think of psychiatry............) in Western Countries is not <i>the only medicine</i> in the world, by far and large. <a href="../../../p/f/o/User%7EPfortuny_f17f.html" title="User:Pfortuny">Pfortuny</a> 22:29, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand what you are saying; as you correctly infer, the debate here is between what some call "Western" medicine, and anything else. However, so-called "western" medicine is not "western" at all. It is merely anything that is peer-reviewed. It is used by whites, blacks, asians, Jews, Hispanics, Indians, etc. It used in China, America, Chile, Korea, Egypt and Norway. There is nothing western about this form of medicine. Perhaps it should be called "Post-enlightenment" medicine, because the idea that doctors should have to prove their abilities and techniques is a relatively recent idea. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:42, Dec 7, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that looks quite more proper, as long as one does not take "enlightenment" as the source of truth. I used the term "Western" (which as you say is improper) in order to eliminate any "more-true-than-other" claim from the <i>name</i>. Notice also that Alternative Medicine is often used in Western Countries as well&#160;:). The fact that it is not <i>peer-reviewed</i> does not mean it is harmful/useless/untrue/unhealing... <a href="../../../p/f/o/User%7EPfortuny_f17f.html" title="User:Pfortuny">Pfortuny</a> 09:11, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that mainstream conventional medicine is <i>based on</i> science. However, I do not believe a useful <i>definition</i> of conventional medicine is whether it has been <i>proven</i> (whatever that means) by <i>peer reviewed scientific studies. Rather, there are a range of factors, which I might enumerate as:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Degree of scientific basis (not just peer reviewed studies, but basis in general).</li>
<li>Degree of reliance on the placebo effect.</li>
<li>Degree to which emphasis is on ammeliorating suffering rather than curing illness.</li>
<li>Degree to which emphasis is on promoting wellness compared to treating illness.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ol>
<p>I agree with you that treatment of individuals cannot be run as peer reviewed science: that's my point. For example, the seperation of adult Siamese twins is very complex, and the procedures involved are unique to each case. While the procedures are <i>based on</i> science, at root, it is not true to say that they are proven by peer reviewed scientific studies - that's too strong. And, as noted in the para below on evidence-based medicine, up until comparatively recently much of medicine was not directly based on scientific evidence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Every major technique and medication used in conventional medicine really is backed by peer-reviewed studies. That is just a fact. Individual operations in individual people, of course, cannot have any such studies; statistics, by their nature, do not exist for single cases of anything. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Another example: there is ongoing debate within medicine as to whether regular screening is effective in reducing breast cancer rates. There have been many studies, and last I heard, scientists <i>didn't know</i>. But breast cancer screening is <b>not</b> alternative medicine! It's based on science, but not <i>proven by</i> science - or at least, not yet. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 00:39, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree totally. I would say that the reason these techniques are science (and not alternative medicine) is because they are being studied in controlled tests, and the results of these studies constantly undergo peer-review. In contrast, the vast majority of alternative health providers never engage in such studies, and actually ignore the results of such studies when they do exist. They have a religious faith in the efficacy of their treatments. Most alternative health providers never say "Oops. We were wrong; let's stop this treatment because it doesn't work". That attitude is indicative of quackery. In contrast, medical doctors in mainstream science often show a willingness to change their minds about treatments, if new evidence shows that a change of mind is called for. The example you cite is an excellent of example of this. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 21:46, Dec 9, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, would you agree with me that while "alternative" medicine is (perhaps substantially) less firmly grounded in science than conventional medicine, this is not what <i>defines</i> it? My feeling is the definition of "alternative" medicine lies chiefly in its acceptance by the mainstream medical community - and the correlation with scientific rigour is a <i>consequence</i> of that, rather than the definition <i>in and of itself</i>. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:26, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the following vague and useless claims:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some proponents of alternative medicine dispute the degree to which conventional medical practices are scientifically justified. Although many aspects of conventional medicine such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antibiotics.html" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asepsis.html" title="Asepsis">asepsis</a>, and the use of clinical trials to evaluate new medications and surgical techniques are science-based, many conventional medical practices persist from pre-scientific medical traditions. Many of these practices were never evaluated scientifically before the rise of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-based_medicine.html" title="Evidence-based medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> (EBM), which did not actually appear until the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> with the McMaster Medical School in Canada that used a clinical learning strategy that would eventually develop, via further work at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and the establishment of the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, into modern evidence-based medicine. Researchers in this area have shown that such practices as yearly physical examinations provide no measurable benefit to many patients.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, this entire paragraph boils down to saying that "many conventional medical practices persist from pre-scientific medical traditions". Precisely what practices are these? And so what? Is this implication that everything humans ever did before the development of modern science is wrong? Or that everything humans ever did before the development of modern science is right? This is all just vague innuendo designed to cast doubt on medicine without any facts or specific arguments. Even more illogically, it implies that if some practice in modern medicine is not justified, then alternative medicine somehow <i>is</i> justified. This just has no logic. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>Social critic Ivan Ilich believes that Western and alternative medical practices are generally equally effective, for two reasons. First, Western practices are more effective at dealing with illnesses caused by microbes, whereas alternative practices are more effective at dealing with illnesses that are psychosomatic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't disagree with the content of this statement...but it is merely a round-about way of stating the "western" point of view. If this is correct, then Ilich admits that alternative medicine only works if the problem is mostly in your head, but when there is some real bacteria, fungus or virus, then you need real conventional medicine. Well, sure. What western scientist would disagree? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>Ilich holds that Western and alternative practices are equally effective at dealing with illnesses that are self-limiting.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand; he claims it as positive when alternative medicine cures something that he admits would go away by itself? How could this be seen as support any part of alternative medicine. It looks to me like he was criticising it and debunking it, but trying to say it in a fashion that wouldn't upset alternative health believers. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:52, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you can recover from a self-limiting illness quickly or slowly, and it can be painful or pleasant, and you can be more or less inactive during convalesence.

<p>Im am upset that RK and many other people are dismissing "alternative medicine" as a wacko and unbased practice. It is an ancient practice and is frequently used to complement a conventional medicinal treatment. It sometimes works when mainstream medicine fails, although a lot of times mainstream medicine is the only choice. It isn't always used as a cure. Many times, such procedures as accupuncture is administered to successfully relieve pain without side effects that many modern medicines have. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandros_406d.html" title="User:Alexandros">Alexandros</a> 00:27, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think RK's specific point is right: we can't assert "It sometimes works when mainstream medicine fails" - rather, we would have to attribute that point of view to a named advocate. In terms of evidence, I suggest that the best place for detailed evidence for (and against) individual techniques (whether alternative or conventional) is on the relevant articles - it's yet another case where the best thing to resolve disagreement is to go to a higher level of detail. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 18:13, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

There is nothing ridiculous about common knowledge, provided of course you happen to track health research 365 days of the year like I have done for two years.

<dd>Neither of the below citations make this claim. All they say is there are some controlled studies which show that acupuncture has some real pain control benefits. Great! Most scientists would not dispute this; neither would I! However, we dispute the mystical claims about acupuncture manipulating Qi, or that acupuncture can literally cure diseases. As this article states, mainstream science is open to exploring alternative medicine claims by controlled, peer-reviewed studies. Anything that is repeatedly verified by many scientists and doctors in such a scientific fashion isn't even "alternative" anymore; it is becoming conventional. If you rely on peer-reviewed studies (as you cite below) then you are rejecting the advocacy of new-age alternative medicine, and are actually embracing so-called "Western" medicine!

<dd>If a concept exists, then that concept can be critiqued. Simple as that. You can choose between it either existing and being critiqued, or it not existing. I actually prefer the non-existence of the concept since it is extremely vague and popularity and/or main-stream status is not usefull in determining the efficacy of medical treatment. But alas, the concept does exist.

<dd>OK, looks like we semi-agree on it just being place-holder.

The point you are trying to make is already addressed in part in the sentence "Criticisms of alternative medicine are complicated by the wide variety of alternative medical practices. Often, critics focus on a single practice, and argue that its failures generalize to the field as a whole." Maybe you would like to add to that without resorting to stupid polemic equations like "howling at the moon".

<p>What precisely is wrong with:</p>
<p>"Ironically, support even comes from critics of alternative medicine. These critics are in effect making the claim that conventional medicine has and is in the process of assimilating alternative methods of treatments that have been proven to have worked from the various branches of alternative medicine.</p>
<p>Another way of stating this argument in support of alternative medicine comes from the definitions of complementary and integrative medicine. The boundary lines between alternative and mainstream medicine does in fact change over time. Methods once considered alternative may later be adopted by conventional medicine as physicians gradually incorporate alternative methods of treatment in their conventional medical practices."</p>

<dd><i>"The boundary lines between alternative and mainstream medicine does has changed over time.

<li>Without intending to step on any toes in what is obviously a long-running debate, I cannot see why there should be a section on the support for Alternative Medicine in this article. It is not in keeping with the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia. By this token, should philosophical, moralistic or political articles also have sections explaining why proponents support those stances? Should a section on democracy include a section explaining why it is a plausible alternative to other political systems?<br />
<br />
It also seems to me that items 1 and 3 in this section are not genuine support for alternative medicine, but rebuttals to criticisms. If the section to provide support for alternative medicine is to remain in Wikipedia, I think that the items within it should not include responses to criticism, or that the title should be altered to reflect this. Similarly, 8 is not true support of alternative medicine, since government body funding of research work into these fields does not necessarily mean that the techniques are valid or worthwhile, merely that they need more rigorous investigation to prove that they are efficacious (<i>Our mission is to support rigorous research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), to train researchers in CAM, and to disseminate information to the public and professionals on which CAM modalities work, which do not, and why</i> - from <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/about/aboutnccam/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://nccam.nih.gov/about/aboutnccam/index.htm" rel="nofollow">NCCAM's website</a>).

<li>It was decided long ago that <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> must include two sections: one on criticisms and one on support. The only reason that you are objecting to the section on Support is because it is making the opposition look stupid, IMHO. Why don't you improve the criticism section. It is making the opposition look pretty bad. The other sections of this article are quite poorly written. The last sentence in the definition paragraph is still wrong / poorly written. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">Mr-Natural-Health</a> 15:07, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>With respect, do not try to second guess me. You will note that I haven't stated an opinion either for or against Alternative Medicine, and I wouldn't say that my comments have been particularly negative or detrimental towards it. My main reasons for posting are that;<br />
<br />
a) I don't believe that any entry in an encyclopedia should need a section in its defence, regardless of how widely-criticised it is, and<br />
<br />
b) the "support" provided here contains some items which do not consistute support for Alternative Medicine, and therefore do not merit inclusion here. (For example, the existence of NCCAM could as easily be interpreted as a Government project to prove that most alternative medicines produce insubstantial or inconsistent results, as a Government project to support scientific research into these fields).<br />
<br />
I resent the implication that you know my opinion - for the record, I have no interest in seeing Alternative medicine unfairly criticised, but similarly, I have no desire to see it unnecessarily or inaccurately defended. By this token, I don't believe that either Criticisms or Support for Alternative medicine have any place in this article. It does strike me that the Criticism section is more consistent with the NPOV policy, since the arguments for and against most items in that section are succinctly expressed in a reasonably balanced manner.<br />
<br />
I am still unclear about your decision to excise references to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allopathic_medicine.html" title="Allopathic medicine">allopathic medicine</a> to the opening paragraph - this is a term that is used by some alternative medicine practioners, regardless of your personal belief, and therefore is as deserving of mention in the opening section of this article as the reference to "complimentary medicine". I take exception to the Danhicks's use of the word "erroneously", since this aspect is unproven, and constitutes his POV. But it is certainly not a POV that some alternative medicine practioners refer to "conventional medicine" as "allopathic medicine", so that element of the paragraph deserves to stay. Such a statement is fully in keeping with item 3 of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#What_is_the_neutral_point_of_view.3F" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> policy. -- <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykReeve_0a97.html" title="User:MykReeve">MykReeve</a> 15:33, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In response to your 1st paragraph, "It was decided long ago that <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> must include two sections: one on criticisms and one on support" by people other than me. I suggest that you re-read the first sentence in the support section. Arguments that tend to support the general concept of alternative medicine means exactly that. I believe that every argument presented has at least one reference from a third party to support it. Many of them have more than one reference. Not one position stated in the criticism section is supported as far as I am aware of.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In response to your second paragraph, allopathy has NOTHING to do with AM, period. Want to comment about Allopathy than put it in the Alopathic medicine article. It certainly does not belong in the definition paragraph. You don't define something by adding: "Oh by the way did you know that ... "This article is about alternative medicine. Therefore, anything expressed that belittles AM or the practitioners thereof is POV in my opinion. You do not write an unbaised article on AM by criticizing it or its practitioners.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only reason that funding is in this article is that the opposition brought it up. Supporters responded by proving the opposition to be wrong. AM exists and there are in fact sources of funding for AM research. No point removing something that will only be added back next week when the opposition will once again claim that a lack of funding for research is somehow a major argument against AM. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">Mr-Natural-Health</a> 23:41, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>No point removing something that will only be added back next week when the opposition will once again claim that a lack of funding for research is somehow a major argument against AM</i>" - which is precisely why this whole mess of having both Criticisms and Support for the subject shouldn't be present in an encyclopedic article. My point is that articles shouldn't exist to be battlegrounds between opposition and proposition - normal encyclopedias are not written this way, so there's no reason that Wikipedia should be. Articles should NOT be written from the POV of either a proponent or an opponent to the subject - so "<i>anything expressed that belittles AM or the practitioners thereof</i>" would be POV, but by that argument, so would "<i>anything expressed that <b>promotes</b> AM or the practice thereof</i>". An AM article should express points of view impartially.<br />
<br />
Having read much of the discussion that has occurred on this article, I can understand why several users have given up trying to debate with you, to the detriment of many peoples' Wikipedia experiences, and this article in particular. I will leave you to edit this article to your own devices, since you clearly do not want any others to contribute to it, unless they are prepared to agree with your own POV.<br />
<br />
You keep speaking of wishing that someone would "improve" the Criticisms section, but it seems to me that what you mean by this is that you merely wish it to be altered so that it constitutes opposition to AM, rather than being balanced - as an encyclopedic article should be. You will, of course, take a different stance, and you are entitled to do so, as it suits your biased view of what constitutes a POV. Best wishes for future amendments. -- <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykReeve_0a97.html" title="User:MykReeve">MykReeve</a> 00:47, 6 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr Natural Health mistakenly put the following in the section for support of alternative medicine:</p>
<p><i>The final response to the above criticisms is that the opposition primarily assumes that alternative medicine works by <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic.html" title="Magic">magic</a> and equates all branches of alternative medicine with quackery and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_fraud.html" title="Health fraud">health fraud</a>. Professionalized alternative medicine no more works by magic than do prescription medications possess magical curative powers. Quackery and health fraud is a legal matter where the law should be allowed to take its course. The opposition turns a blind eye to health fraud committed by conventional medicine. The list of very questionable conventional medical practices is quite long and includes such things as conventional hospitals soliciting the public to get expensive and totally unnecessary body scans, hormone replacement therapy, and annual mammograms.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing in this paragraph offers any support for alternative medicine! Didn't anyone notice this? Further, it is just a rant against most of western medicine, made by a man who claims that doctors murdered his parent with chemotheraphy. This is not, to say the least, encyclopedia quality material, let alone NPOV. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Social critic Ivan Illich believes that Western and alternative medical practices are generally equally effective, for two reasons. First, Western practices are more effective at dealing with illnesses caused by microbes, whereas alternative practices are more effective at dealing with illnesses that are psychosomatic. Illich holds that Western and alternative practices are equally effective at dealing with illnesses that are self-limiting. (Illich 1976) In other words, Illich has suggested that conventional medicine treats illnesses that the human body would heal naturally all by itself without any form of treatment.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, nothing in this paragraph offers any data which supports alternative medicine. Again, didn't anyone notice? Any most importantly, MNH dishonestly mis-states Illich's position; in fact, Illich is clearly suggesting that it is <i>alternative</i> medicine which can only treat an illness which would go away by itself. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> Jan 6, 2004</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Adherents of alternative medicine claim that they only want to heal people; they have no interest in money or publicity. Thus they see no need to offer proof, and refuse to demonstrate their effectiveness in the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, how is this presenting data which supports all of, or even any of, alternative medicine? This is just more of MNH's POV rants. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<i>Some alternative treatment methods have been shown to be effective.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh? This vague claim, without any citations, is proof? Not even close.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Edzard Ernst writes in the Medical Journal of Australia that: "</i>About half the general population in developed countries uses complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Yet many conventional healthcare professionals refuse to take CAM seriously.</p>

<dd>Millions of people believe that Satan exists. How is this proof of Satan? Millions of people believe that eating cheese cures gout? How is this proof or support of this people? Millions of people used to believe in elves and trolls. Does this count as support for elves and trolls?

</dl>
<p><i>A search on PubMed reveals that there are over 370,000 research papers classified as alternative medicine published since 1966 in the National Library of Medicine database (such as Kleijnen 1991, Linde 1997, Michalsen 2003, Gonsalkorale 2003, and Berga 2003). There are no publicly available statistics on exactly how many of these studies were controlled or double-blind peer-reviewed experiments. They were, however, all published in research journals recognized by Medline.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh? No one denies that many scientists have written papers which mention alternative medicine. And these peer-reviewed, controlled studies show that alternative medicine doesn't work! <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:15, Jan 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>In another argument, the question of the effectiveness of various techniques used by practitioners of alternative medicine has to be considered independently for each method, as well as for each medical condition or disease treated. When exploring the individual branches of alternative medicine four questions need to be answered. The answers to these questions will reveal whether or not each branch of alternative medicine is mostly <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">quackery</a> or something that the public should seriously consider using.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, nothing in this paragraph offers any data which supports alternative medicine. Again, didn't anyone notice? These are just MNH's personal musings, and it contains no support, let alone proof. This is getting ridiculous. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>HEre MNH proves that some organization is spending a lot of money on the subject. Ok...and some organizations also spend money on God, Satan and even on Dungeons and Dragons. So what? How does this <i>support</i> the claims of alternative medicine proponents?

<p><i>Some of the strongest support for the value of clinical experience in alternative medicine comes from conventional physicians who have voiced their criticisms of evidence-based medicine (Tonelli 2001, Downing 2003). These physicians while arguing about their need to apply population evidence to the patient standing before them are in effect supporting the value of eclectic branches of alternative medicine which place great value upon the clinical experience of the practitioner.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>So we have anecdotes with no proof, and that somehow overturns evidence and proof? This by you is support?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The boundary lines between alternative and mainstream medicine have changed over time. Methods once considered alternative have later been adopted by conventional medicine as physicians gradually incorporate effective branches of alternative medicine of treatment in their conventional medical practices. Supporters of alternative methods suggest that much of what is currently called alternative medicine will be similarly assimilated by the mainstream in the future.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Soryy, but you missed the point. These studies have also <i>disproven</i> the vast majority of alternative medicine technqiues. For those techniques which were proven in controlled, peer-reviewed studies, these are <i>not</i> alternative by any definition of the word. Your argument literally ends with "Maybe someday, someone will prove that my beliefs are true." This is <i>not</i> support of alternative medicine. It is only wishful thinking. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>An argument can be made that it is not so much a question of proving what is right about alternative medicine, but rather in pointing out what is specifically wrong with conventional medicine....</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, no support, but just an anti-science POV rant from MNH.</dd>

<p>RK has once again has decided to singled handedly destroy the work of several people that took several weeks of discussions to create in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>. I have supported with numerous references and citations every argument made in support of alternative medicine. RK has not supported a single one of his obviously POV comments.

Alternative medicine currents suffers from the antics of RK and others who are unable to deal with the reality of alternative medicine. RK has been totally unable to articulate and support with references a rational argument against alternative medicine. Why doesn't RK try to clean up <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_Sciences_1059.html" title="Health Sciences">Health Sciences</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">Medicine</a> rather than constantly work at destroying <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>? -- 12.77.6.54 15:12, 6 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
