<p>There are a couple of reasons I removed the Humbolpedia.com link. Mainly, I removed it because the link has been spammed in the past, having been added to a ton of Humboldt County articles without linking to a page that is specifically about the article subject. The <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> guideline says that links should be about the article subject, not just generally related.</p>
<p>The IP address that added the link has only made 4 edits, all to add the Humbolpedia.com link, so it seemed link further "link spamming" to me that was meant to further Humbolpedia.com and not to improve Wikipedia. When I removed these links the first time around, the IP that had added them had also done nothing but add Humbolpedia.com links, so I felt that it was nothing more than an attempt to increase their search engine rank. It might be different if it was done by a user or IP that had actually added real content to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 04:58, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have an interest in understanding what to name the subsections for geographic area that I am editing history sections. For instance, for some geographic areas there will be three subsections: pre european, european arrival, and recent history. My question is to find some heading that is agreed upon that is a better discription than "pre eureopean." I gave the first section the title of "First Nation," but in reading around I have discovered that "first nation" is a term used for Canadians not current day U.S. lands. So. The place was what it was and was not considered "pre eureopean" by the people who lived there in that time. I don't like a title that says "pre" anything. Many place's history sections have a pre-some-date or pre-some-hisorical-reference-person's-name and this referencing really bothers me. Is there a standard already? Thanks!--<a href="../../../a/l/9/User%7EAl95521_9009.html" title="User:Al95521">al95521</a> 05:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the term "Pre-Contact" is most common, but if you don't want to use that, First Nation and American-Indian are too general to be very helpful. You might try figuring out exactly which people lived there, and use their name for the section. I'm not totally clear on your question though, so maybe a more specific example would help? - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemightyquill_3f8e.html" title="User:Themightyquill">TheMightyQuill</a> 07:19, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thankyou for the wikicookie - I have eaten it with delight&#160;:). With the adoption - you can ask me any questions about Wikipedia you like, best to ask on my <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_f0fa.html" title="User:Lethaniol">talk page</a>, and I will usually reply on your talk page here. Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I read that adoptees graduate at some point. Is there a formal process of learning the basics? I have done a bit now so hopefully my questions won't be too prosaic - perhaps I kid myself.
<ul>
<li>No this is not a formal process - though it can be if you want it to be. Generally you ask whatever questions you like e.g. how do I do this, why did that user say that, can you review some work I did. When you and I feel confident that you have grasped all the basics and more then you can graduate, though will always be able to answer questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why me - did my edits win you over, or are you just nice to everyone?
<ul>
<li>I offer adoption to a lot of users, and do not generally check people's edits unless there is reason to. I generally browse through <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a> and pick at random. In your case I was grabed by the quirky comment on your user page <i>how long before graduation?</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have a question about a kind of "meet other wikipedians" in your community idea. Is there a way to search for common interests or editors by geographical area? I'm in a rural area and would like to have a real life, not just digital. Um, I think I just figured it out. I had to open another tab and found the "search in namespace" area.
<ul>
<li>The quickest way to to use this [[<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Category</a>:<a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_94a6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a>]], which will allow you to browse through users by self-declared interests. Also if there is a particular <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_f31e.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject">Wikipedia:Wikiproject</a> you are interested in - like minded individuals will gravitate there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have too many questions. Do I post them to your page or my page?
<ul>
<li>As said above best to post them on my userpage - no matter how many. If later we get into in depth discussions on certain issues than we can create a sub page of your user page to discuss on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do I know my number of edits. The summary only show edits in groups of 50. A numbered list or a total would be helpful.
<ul>
<li>First of all, when checking contributions you can increase the number seen from 20 to 500, and cycle through older edits all the way back to when you started. For example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Al95521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Al95521" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> lists all your edits. Also you click on the % tab to access a number of stats or use the following edit counter which is very good <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate" class="external autonumber" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a way to count number of added edit characters, or number of deleted edit characters?
<ul>
<li>When you check your watchlist (<a href="../../../w/a/t/Help%7EWatching_pages_162c.html" title="Help:Watching pages">Help:Watching pages</a> there will be + number in green (=the amount of bytes added) or - number in red (=the amount of bytes removed). This does not directly respond to number of characters edited, and is cumulative, but if you watch an article then you will get an idea of how much info was added/removed in the last edit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a way to determine your effectiveness as an editor as in the edits that have stuck verses been rewritten?
<ul>
<li>This is irrelevant - some very experienced editors who fight the creation of new inappropriate pages deleted will see a lot of their edits also deleted when the article is. Also just because someone reverts/changes your edits, does not make you a bad editor. Currently there is no way of checking this either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a spell check?
<ul>
<li>No but you can use your browser to help out instead. I am not sure about Internet Explorer, which I hate, as I use <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> which has the add-ons for dictionaries for all major languages - see <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?cat=68&amp;app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=E" class="external autonumber" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?cat=68&amp;app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=E" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - very useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a way to see the origin of a particular phase in a long article or an article with a long history? Say I want to see when something was written without having to go through the long process of checking every edit. Is there a faster way?
<ul>
<li>I do not think so, if something was written and then deleted in an article, you will have to go through the edits to find that info - will check this because what you ask would be a very useful tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I edit from an anonymous work station and I'd like to sign my user name. I tried to add Al95521 and then I tried to add Talk:Al95521 but they did not work. What is the correct code?
<ul>
<li>The easiest way is to sign in and use ~~~~, if not you can use [[User:Al95521]] ~~~~~ or [[User talk:Al95521]] ~~~~~. Note 4 x ~ will sign with name and date, 5 x 16:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC) will sign with just date. Also read up at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheatsheet_7916.html" title="Wikipedia:Cheatsheet">Wikipedia:Cheatsheet</a> for other useful syntax code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll stop here but I have a lot more questions. Thanks again! - Keep on asking, these are good questions. Cheers <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethaniol_eabe.html" title="User talk:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 16:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) <a href="http://humguide.com/" class="external text" title="http://humguide.com/" rel="nofollow">HumGuide - Find anything in Humboldt County</a>: For this website, I may have been a little hasty with my deletion.</p>
<p>My general guide for evaluating 'community guide' websites such as 'humguide' is whether they do at least as good as doing a search in Yahoo! Local or Google Local. Unfortunately, almost every community guide website that I've looked at has been about highlighting their paying weblinks, and so they fail miserably when compared to the big search engines. The other comparison that I often make is whether the websites do as good or better than the local chamber of commerce website. As crappy as many CoC websites are, most community guide websites also fail that comparison.</p>
<p>For the part of the humguide website that is their directory of businesses, which is what I first looked at, I rated the website as pretty unsatisfactory (come on, there has to be more than three accountants in all of Humboldt County!). On the other hand, I went back and looked at the media section. That appeared to be fairly complete, with brief, but informative annotation. That last part is the sort of 'value-added' information that sets it apart from what you'll get from Yahoo! Local.</p>
<p>For now, it looks like the humguide is worthwhile. On the other hand, if the Humbolpedia wiki continues to developer, it should become a much better guide to Humboldt County that the humguide is.</p>
<p>2) <a href="http://humboldtsearch.com/" class="external text" title="http://humboldtsearch.com/" rel="nofollow">Humboldt County Travel Guide</a>: This website had 'spammed' several Wikipedia articles on cities in Humboldt County. For any external link, there has to be information of value to the Wikipedia reader who wants to learn more about the topic of the article. I rated the website as close to worthless. For example, compare their article on Petrolia to the Wikipedia's article.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://humboldtsearch.com/cityinfo-city_name-Petrolia.htm" class="external free" title="http://humboldtsearch.com/cityinfo-city_name-Petrolia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://humboldtsearch.com/cityinfo-city_name-Petrolia.htm</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrolia%2C_California" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrolia%2C_California" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrolia%2C_California</a></li>
</ul>
<p>3) <a href="http://san-francisco-pictures.com/gallery/Lost-Coast-Eureka-Ferndale/" class="external text" title="http://san-francisco-pictures.com/gallery/Lost-Coast-Eureka-Ferndale/" rel="nofollow">Humboldt County in Pictures</a>: This is another website that had 'spammed' a several articles on San Francisco and Northern California. My evaluation of the website was that it had a few nice pictures, and a bunch of so-so photos, with absolutely no explanation about any of the photos other than the photo title. That makes the photos almost useless unless you already know the area.</p>
<p>I'm going to add the humguide website back into the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humboldt_County%2C_California_0714.html" title="Humboldt County, California">Humboldt County, California</a> article (but with a better description of the website—you certainly can't find <u><i>everything</i></u> in Humboldt County on the website). I stand my my evaluation of the other two website, and believe that they both fail the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">External links</a> policy. <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green">Blank</font></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F88017">Verse</font></a></i> 08:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"How is an external site evaluated?"</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first step is to looks at the Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Policies and guidelines</a> that might apply. For external links, that would include the pages on <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EExternal_links_ce44.html" title="WP:External links">External links</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">Spam</a>, as well as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What the Wikipedia is not</a> (specifically, the Wikipedia is NOT a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linkfarm.html" title="Linkfarm">linkfarm</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You should also keep in mind that the Wikipedia is a general <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> with a worldwide readership. Finally, you should <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">Use common sense</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For an example of using common sense: External links should be to websites or webpages that would help the general Wikipedia reader learn more about the topic of the Wikipedia article. That means that links that would only be of interest to the residents of a local community should not be added as an external link for that community. Links for local social service agencies are commonly added to articles on communities, but those are inappropriate, because they are only of interest to the local residents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>People keep adding links for churches to articles on communities, but in almost all cases those are inappropriate. For <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> churches (such as the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Cathedral_6dbd.html" title="Crystal Cathedral">Crystal Cathedral</a>), they would have their own article, and the link for that church would be in that article. The only time that I can see a link to a church as being appropriate would be when that church was an important part of that community. In that case, the church should be mentioned in the article, and the link would go to a webpage on the church's website that covers the history of the church. In that case, the link is used as a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">reference</a>, and not as an external link. One example of this might be discussing the role of the Latter-day Saints in the development of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Bernardino%2C_California_01b6.html" title="San Bernardino, California">San Bernardino, California</a>. For another example: The <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacienda_Heights%2C_California_4876.html" title="Hacienda Heights, California">Hacienda Heights, California</a> article currently doesn't include a discussion of the strong local opposition to the construction of the very large <a href="../../../h/s/i/Hsi_Lai_Temple_1d2a.html" title="Hsi Lai Temple">Hsi Lai Temple</a> in the middle of a primarily residential community. If that information gets added, a link to the Temple's website giving their position would be an appropriate reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To get a better feel for how external links are evaluated, you should take a look at the talk pages for the various policy and guideline pages, such as <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EExternal_links_4b9d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:External links">Wikipedia talk:External links</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpam_7973.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Spam">Wikipedia talk:Spam</a> (and the archive pages for the talk pages).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another way to get a feel for external links is to look at where the policy seems to have failed, or is being ignored. Look, for example, at the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linkfarm.html" title="Linkfarm">linkfarm</a> that currently exists at <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html#External_links" title="Cover version">Cover version#External links</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've also given above the reasoning that I used to evaluate the three specific external links that you questioned the deletion of. I hope that this answers your question. <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green">Blank</font></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F88017">Verse</font></a></i> 03:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Have looked into this issue (have even signed up for the ClustrMap service) - but I think this service will not work on Wikipedia pages.</p>
<p>A quick google search shows only one entry in Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+ClustrMaps&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+ClustrMaps&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and this is a link a ClustrMap for an external site.</p>
<p>I believe the way Wikipedia works is that it only uses html code as applicable to writing articles. So in this case when you cut and paste in the code from Clustrmaps - as you are not editing the core html source code and so it will not work. So I do not think you will be able to get this to work for your user page.</p>
<p>If you want to take this further I suggest asking questions at: <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Wikipedia:Help desk</a>.</p>

<p>The statement that the Minor theater is the oldest continuously operated theater is not true. My grandfather operated the Alto Freight and Express shipping company out of an unused Minor Theater for a period of time in the 1940s. The claim that it has been continuously operated cannot be substantiated because it is not true. It was a marketing ploy by the Minor Theater company. Odd that they made the claim some years back...had my family laughing. IF you want to claim something that is propaganda then feel free. But please site one of the so-called sources you refer to.

<dd>"Aside from a few temporary closures, the Minor continued to operate continuously until 1960. It reopened in 1972 after major renovation by the Minor Theater Corp." ...This from an interview and article with the actual company printed in November 2000 in the highly respected Northcoast Journal <a href="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/012700/cover0127.html" class="external free" title="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/012700/cover0127.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.northcoastjournal.com/012700/cover0127.html</a></dd>
<dd>As anyone can see the theater, having been closed and reopened in 1972, cannot possibly have the claim of the "longest continuously operted theater" that was placed here in the article. Again this is all about accuracy...right? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorcalal_116d.html" title="User:Norcalal">Norcalal</a> 12:34, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
