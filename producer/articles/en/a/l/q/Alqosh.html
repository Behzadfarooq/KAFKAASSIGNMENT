<p><b>Alqosh</b> or <b>Alqush</b> (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_language.html" title="Assyrian language">Assyrian</a>:<big><big><b>ܐܠܩܘܫ</b></big></big> ) is one of the most famous <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_homeland.html" title="Assyrian homeland">Assyrian</a> cities in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. It is located 30 km to the north of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a>, and the name <i>Alqosh</i> is of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> origin and means <i>The God of Righteousness</i><a href="http://www.betnahrain.net/AssyriaLand/1alqosh.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.betnahrain.net/AssyriaLand/1alqosh.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Alqush has adorned Alqush Mountain (Bayhidhra Mountain) for more than twenty five centuries. The town glowingly reigns over <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineveh.html" title="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>'s northern plateau known for its fertile soil and extends southward across the other Chaldean-Assyrian towns, such as, Telassqopa (<a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Skuf_fcd7.html" title="Tel Skuf">Tel Skuf</a>), <a href="../../../b/a/q/Baqofah.html" title="Baqofah">Baqofah</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batnaya.html" title="Batnaya">Batnaya</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Keppe_60eb.html" title="Tel Keppe">Tel Keppe</a> till it reaches the great <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineveh.html" title="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> walls. Alqush traces its history back into the ancient <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_empire.html" title="Assyrian empire">Assyrian empire</a> and perhaps even further back into history. Indeed, the earliest mention of Alqush appears in <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sennacherib.html" title="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a>'s era 750 B.C. as evidenced by the mural inside Sennacherib's palace that was discovered in Tel Qwenjeq (Qwenjeq Hill) in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a>. Behind this mural, the phrase "This rock was brought from Alqush’s Mountain" is carved. Furthermore, a number of sites within Alqush still carry pure Assyrian names, for example, <i>Sainna</i> Neighborhood means the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a> Neighborhood and <i>Bee Sinnat</i> is a plain area south of Alqush. Within approximately three kilometers, to the west of Alqush, lies the well known ruin of Shayro Meliktha which is marked in the Iraqi ruins Map as a <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple.html" title="Temple">temple</a> carrying a carving of Sennachareb's picture aiming an arrow from his <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_%28weapon%29.html" title="Bow (weapon)">bow</a>. Alqush's stone dwellings are spread along its mountainous slopes up to the tip of its plateau. They share similar decorations with all other colonies within the Nineveh plains, except for the construction that recently swamped its borders, especially in the southern part of the colony to reflect the contemporary nature of building applications in the form of cement, bricks and other materials. Alqush is divided into 4 quarters: Sainna quarter to the west, Qasha quarter to the east, O’do quarter to the north, and Khatetha quarter to the south.</p>

Famous monastery</div>

</div>
<p>A number of sites remain important in the deep minds of Alqushnayes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gu’ppa D’Mmaya (cave of water) located to the north.</li>
<li>Gu’ppa Ssmoqa (the red cave) located to the north.</li>
<li>Gu’ppetha D’Toomin (small cave of Toomin) located to the north, and Toomin may be a proper name.</li>
<li>Gu’ppa D’ Magoar Gama (the Thunderous cave) located to the northeastern.</li>
<li>Shweetha D’Gannaweh (Sleeping bed of the Robbers) is a hill located to the north. Some of the experts interested in Alqush's history believe that Shweetha D’Ganaweh was a site for the Assyrian god Sىin.</li>
<li>Rommta D’Jwannqeh (Mound of the Youths) located to the northwestern.</li>
<li>Khoosha (the Container) located to the northwestern.</li>
<li>Raoolla D’Mmaya (The valley of water) located to the west.</li>
<li>Gu’ppa D’Hattarein (cave of Cotton’s Carders) located. In Syriac Hattarein is a plural for the word Hattara that means cotton’s carders; it was also called Khtertta and the Mosul dwellers used to call it the Khatoora and it is taken from Syriac language. The word Hatterein may have another connotation.</li>
<li>Kerrma D’Raysha (The Peak's vineyard), in the past the vineyard was located at the peak of the mountain.</li>
<li>Besqeen, an old orchard located behind Alqush Mountain in a rough trail valley. Three families own this orchard: Bendaq Youhana, Kkmikha Dman family, and Shabio Mdallow family. It resembles the remains of a Monastery that was erected some 10 centuries ago. The inhabitants of Alqush knew the orchard as full of fruits and vegetables and water. Up until the thirties of the twentieth century, Jebrail Youhana worked in the orchard. The name Besqeen is a plural Syriac that means water pond.</li>
<li>Galeeya D’Qasha Hanna (Priest Hanna's Valley) located to the north.</li>
<li>Tellsha derived from (Toullsha) which is a material used in spreading and covering. This place may have been used by Nader Shah, the Persian ruler, as a rest area when he invaded the region in 1732 and 1742 A.D.</li>
<li>Galeeya D’Dayra or Galeeya D’Qadeesha (valley of the Saints or Valley of the Monastery the), a valley leading to Rabban Hermizd monastery located in the northeastern corner of Alqush. It is an old monastery that can be traced back to the time when Arab Muslim started to invade the region in 636 A.D. Till recently, the monastery was housed by its monks who preferred to worship within its vast expanse and labor in its orchards and farms.</li>
<li>Towards the plain side opposite to this site, Virgin Mary's monastery (Guardian of the Plants) is situated, which was built in 1856 A.D. It is a huge monastery where the friar life still exists. The Guardian of the Plants monastery was named Ishtar, the gods of love, fertility, and abundance for the Babylonians.</li>
<li>Galeeya Dnerba D’Deyoeh (erroneously pronounced as Neer D’Dayoeh), the valley of Devils, located to the east of Rabban Hermizd Monastery.</li>
<li>Gu’ppetha D’Hllwi(D’Hllabi), a place for milking sheep.</li>
<li>Gu’ppetha D’Rrabi Rabba, a Small Cave of High Priest(teacher).</li>

<p>Conflicting opinions appear pertaining to the name Alqosh. Some believe it derives from the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_language.html" title="Assyrian language">Assyrian language</a> and the word Alqushtti, which means "My god is my arrow". Others interpret it as Alqushtta, the god of justice. Yet some others believe it comes from Alqush, the red bird. Some contend it belongs to the name AalQoun, father of <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahum.html" title="Nahum">Nahum</a> the Alqushian, one of the Old Testament prophets whose tomb still rests in Alqush today.</p>
<p><a name="Prophet_Nahum_and_Alqosh" id="Prophet_Nahum_and_Alqosh"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/q/Alqosh.html" title="Edit section: Prophet Nahum and Alqosh">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prophet Nahum and Alqosh</span></h3>
<p>AalQoun father of Nahum was the son of a <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> family among thousands whom the Assyrian king Shelmenassar V who reigned between 727-722 BC brought to Alqosh. These Hebrews lived in <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">peace</a> with the Alqoshniye and even became <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets.html" title="Prophets">prophets</a> such as Biblical Nahum. The interpretation that seems most logical relies on Marotha, the Alqusheian Wiseman from three centuries ago who asserted that the name Alqush is derives from Sىin, the god known as Siin meaning the greatest god. Its site was located at Shweetha D’Gannaweh, a hill at the north of Alqush. In this respect, Marotha relays what his ancestors have stated that those living in <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineveh.html" title="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> would visit Alqush every <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akitu.html" title="Akitu">Akitu</a> (the Assyrian New Year) to replay the <a href="../../../e/n/u/Enuma_Elish_fd47.html" title="Enuma Elish">Enuma Elish</a> which is the Sumerian Epic of Creation. They then would have a religious ceremony in honor of the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_god.html" title="Moon god">moon god</a> <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">Sin</a> and the image or icon of the god would be carried in a procession on their way back to Nineveh passing through the old Nineveh Alqush road. However, to its south another agricultural area known as Bee Siinnat is clearly derived from the word Siin. Forty days later the inhabitants of Nineveh would return the statue or icon of the god to its original place in Alqush. Based on the foregoing, we believe that the name Alqush is taken from the Assyrian or earlier Sumerian name for god Siin/Alqush. Some Sumerologist claim that <a href="../../../i/n/a/Inanna.html" title="Inanna">Inanna</a> the Sumerian goddess of love and war was also the offspring of the moon god <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">Sin</a> or as he is originally called <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanna.html" title="Nanna">Nanna</a>. Alqoshniye are still awaiting the day when excavations in the said hill, Shweetha D’Gannaweh, will unravel new landmarks that attest the place's Assyrian or perhaps even earlier identity.</p>
<p><a href="../../../z/e/c/Zecharia_Sitchin_9958.html" title="Zecharia Sitchin">Zecharia Sitchin</a> Sumerologist indeed mentions the mountainous region flanking the two great rivers in his book "The Stairway to Heaven" as the place Biblical <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a> called <a href="../../../u/t/n/Utnapishtim.html" title="Utnapishtim">Utnapishtim</a> in the <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian language</a> and called <a href="../../../z/i/u/Ziusudra.html" title="Ziusudra">Ziusudra</a> in the earlier Sumerian language (the language the original Epic of the Deluge was written in) was chosen by <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elohim.html" title="Elohim">Elohim</a> out of all peoples in the world and brought to live with his family in the North of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, Alqush was a place for worshiping whether for Assyrian god El-Qustu or <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> when Hebrew peoples were brought by the Assyrian army during the eight and ninth century BC. However, with the spread of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christianity</a>, Alqush was among the first Mesopotamian to accept the new faith as their own. According to the memoirs of Mar Mikha of Nohadra (Dohouk) when he visited the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> in 441 AD he was welcomed by priests of a church built on the ruins of the temple of Alqush's ancient god Siin.

<p>Before that all of the inhabitants of Alqush, like their brothers in other <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean.html" title="Chaldean">Chaldean</a> city's and towns, followed the <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestorian.html" title="Nestorian">Nestorian</a> faith of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_East_bbc4.html" title="Church of the East">Church of the East</a>.

<dd>Nine hours north of Mosul on the mountain of Beth Edri is one of the most ancient Chaldean abbeys. It was founded around the end of the 6th century by Rabban Hormizd, disciple of Rabban Bar Edta. It flourished until the 10th century. At the beginning of the 15th century the Nestorian patriarchs moved their residence there, since there were no longer any Christians in Baghdad. The <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombs.html" title="Tombs">tombs</a> of 9 such patriarchs from 1504-1804 can be found there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the end of the 18th century, the convent was abandoned. A man named Gabriel Dambo repaired it. He had been one of the richest merchants of Mardin. Renouncing his wealth, he became a monk in Alqosh in order to live in the convent. He encountered numerous difficulties with the patriarchal family which he overcame with patience and confidence in God. He thus attracted a number of disciples who followed with him the rule of St. Anthony.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Dambo was murdered in 1832 by the soldiers of Mohammed Pasha, the Kurdish emir of Rawandouz. These had revolted against the Ottoman government and gone on a spree of pillage and massacre (see the note at the end of codex 94).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a> of the convent of Rabban Hormizd was rich in Syriac manuscripts. In 1828 many of these manuscripts were looted and broken up by Moussa Pasha, who had imitated the emir of Rawandouz in revolting against the Turk. In 1868 147 volumes, manuscript and printed, suffered the same treatment from Ismael Pasha, the successor of Moussa Pasha. Most of the manuscripts now (1906) in the convent have been acquired and brought here since 1842."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Addai Scher visited the library in 1902 and took notes on each manuscript, although not noting the size or number of pages in every case.</p>
<p>Fr. William F. Maccomber tells us that, as late as January 1966, the last professional scribe at Alqoš, the Deacon Pawlos Qaša, was still at work copying manuscripts.</p>
<p>The collection of manuscripts is of very great importance for the study of Syriac literature, and mss. from it feature in almost every discussion of Syriac texts.</p>

<p>Since Alqosh housed the abbey of Rabban Hirmizd which was used as the Seat for several patriarchs of the Chaldean Church it attracted the attention of several Muslim governors of its surrounding areas. In 1743 Alqush became a victim to the destructive acts of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Persian</a> sovereign Nader Shah. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testimony.html" title="Testimony">testimony</a> written in a letter by the Priest Habash Bin Jomaa from 1746, he describes, "..first they attacked <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karamles.html" title="Karamles">Karamles</a> and stole its peoples valuables and kidnapped many of its children and women. They then did the same to the inhabitants of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartella.html" title="Bartella">Bartella</a> they killed many of her men, stole their valuables, and also kidnapped its children and women. They did the same to the people of Tel Keppe and Alqush, however, many of those two neighboring villages took refuge at the Monastery of Rabban Hirmizd. There they were surrounded by the soldiers of Nader Shah who attacked them like a pack of hungry wolves attacking helpless sheep. Their they committed horrendous crimes that I just don't have the stomach to describe!"</p>
<p>In 1828, Alqush was attacked by the army of Mosa Pasha, the governor of Amadeya, who was instigated by some of his Muslim subjects to attack the Rabban Hirmizd Monastery which he did. His army arrested and imprisoned several monks and priests and caused tremendous damage to the monastery.</p>
<p>In 1832, Alqush was attacked again by the Kurdish Governor of <a href="../../../r/o/w/Rowanduz.html" title="Rowanduz">Rowanduz</a>, nicknamed "Merkor" whose hatred of Christians and Assyrians is well known. He killed over 400 of its inhabitants. Merkor attacked Elqosh again on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">15 March</a> 1833 and killed another 172 of its men ", not counting children, women, and strangers.." (according to church records).</p>
<p>In 1840, Alqush was once again attacked by the brother of Merkor, Rasoul Beg, who surrounded it for several months after which he put on fire the Rabban Hirmizd Monastery and stole over 500 of its valuable books.</p>

<p>According to the latest statistics, Alqush's population reaches over 15,000. Alqush's population at one point was over 20,000, during the 1960s and perhaps an even higher population in the beginning.... Many immigrated outside the country in huge numbers as from the mid seventies and up until present. It is estimated that at least 40,000 Alqushnaye/Elkoshites immigrants ant their 2nd and 3rd generations now live in the city of <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>.</p>
<p>The Alqoshniye (Elkoshites) speak <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac.html" title="Syriac">Syriac</a>, a dialect of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, the ancient language spoken by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_of_Nazareth_2b3e.html" title="Jesus of Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. The Aramaic language is their first language, but <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> is their unofficial official language and some of them are fluent in <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish.html" title="Kurdish">Kurdish</a> as well. There are many Alqoshniye who speak over five languages since they have become travelers of the world. When Elkoshniye migrate to the west, they teach their children the Alqoshi dialect of Aramaic rather than Arabic in order to keep the language and the dialect alive.</p>
<p>The popular clothing for men is identical to that of the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurdish</a> peoples. It is believed that the men of Alqush adopted this clothing at the end of the 19th century as they gradually abandoned their historic clothing which was long pants and "zaboon". Instead of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turban.html" title="Turban">turban</a>, they would throw braids. Their features and clothing brings them close to their Assyrian or even Sumerian forefathers and practices, just like the people of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinjar.html" title="Sinjar">Sinjar</a> who still adhere to the same dress to the present time. Alqoshniye come in beautiful shapes and sizes, big green and even blue knowing eyes and even blond hair.</p>
<p>As for women, their clothings originality extends to the history of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (Bet Nahreen). Some signs of the Hatra's kingdom clearly appear in the Poosheya that adorns the head and in the Mazer worn by the women. The Assyrian signs in the Alqushian female would appear in the long braids made of wool that extend to her ankle after connecting it to the woman's original braids. The Alqushean women exaggerated wearing golden and silver ornaments around their neck and ear and in her Poosheya that used to cover her head, that was decorated with colorful beads. The forehead was surrounded with a golden belt that skirts this Poosheya front the front side whereas black strings dangle from both sides. The skirted part of various colors and decorations would cover the woman's body from the front after it hangs from the shoulder to extend to the two knees.</p>

The efforts of priests and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacons.html" title="Deacons">deacons</a> who stressed teaching the Aramaic language and its literature and many of them left their writings. Their names glow like the comforting <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a> of the moon. Some of those names are:</p>
<ul>

The school taught topics in Arabic till the fourth grade and it gradually improved to offer six-year education. The Alqushean graduates of the elementary school were forced to pursue their education for the intermediate and secondary school in Baghdad, Mosul, Dehuk, and even Telkeppeh. After the national revolution of 1958, the first intermediate school in Alqush was established. Currently, Alqush houses the following schools:</p>
<ul>

<p>Most of Alqush inhabitants worked in the un-irrigated agriculture since olden days and relied on the fertile plains to the south protecting the city on the parameters of the village to have the necessary agricultural products like grain, wheat, beans and summer products such as cantaloupe and cucumber. Farmers followed old non-technological methods in their farming for several centuries, and their livelihood was always threatened due to nature's betrayal in situations of lack of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain.html" title="Rain">rain</a> or plant epidemic such as soona and grasshoppers.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the sixties, Alqush was introduced to agricultural machinery such as tractors, harvester-threshers (reapers), in addition to methods of treating and curing plant epidemic. However, irrigation means were and still are missing in the area, and farming still relies on rain. Currently, farms belong to the government and are deputized to their owners to use them after they were completely owned by their rightful owners.</p>
<p>Besides these huge lands, grapevines spread all over the village and produce various types of grapes, among which are the black grapes that are well known in the northern region. Some of those who are interested in the history of El Qosh believe that there were over two hundred vines in the village. Below are names of some of these vines:</p>
<p>Kerrmanneh D’Deyrra, Kerrma D’Rrheyqah, Kerrma D’Be Jemma, Kerrma D’Be Jaoroo, Kerrma D’Be Jejoo Rayes, Kerrma D’Be Sadeq Rayes, Kerrma D’Be Houbentta, Kerrma D’Be Zorra, Kerrma D’Be Ptooza, Kerrma D’Be Qoodda, Kerrma D’Be Peeyous Chiekho, Kerrma D’Be Mogeena Zorri, Kerrma D’Be Tayzee, Kerma D’ Reysha, Kerma D’Be Kottrra, Kerma D’Be Selow Be Dayy, Kerma D’Be Sayddah, Kerma D’Be Yaqou Gorjee, Kerma D’Be Mercous Pouleth, Kerma D’Be Shemaa’on, Kerma D’Be Benna, Kerma D’Be Yako Zorra etc.</p>
