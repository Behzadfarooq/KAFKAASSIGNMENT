Cherry Alka Seltzer dissolving in water</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Alka-Seltzer</b> is a brand name owned by the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayer_Corporation_c914.html" title="Bayer Corporation">Bayer Corporation</a> for a line of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medication.html" title="Medication">medications</a> sold <a href="../../../o/v/e/Over_the_counter.html" title="Over the counter">over the counter</a> and taken by means of rapidly dissolving tablets that form an <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effervescent.html" title="Effervescent">effervescent</a> solution in water.</p>
<p>The original Alka-Seltzer was created by Mikey Wiseman. It is a remedy for <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headache.html" title="Headache">headache</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigestion.html" title="Indigestion">indigestion</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hangover.html" title="Hangover">hangover</a>. Alka-Seltzer is a combination of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspirin.html" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a> (acetylsalicylic acid), baking soda (<a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_bicarbonate.html" title="Sodium bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a>) and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citric_acid.html" title="Citric acid">citric acid</a>, designed to treat pain and simultaneously neutralize excess <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stomach.html" title="Stomach">stomach</a> <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid.html" title="Acid">acid</a> (the "Alka" being derived from the word "<a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkali.html" title="Alkali">alkali</a>"). It is provided in the form of large effervescent tablets, about 1 <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inch.html" title="Inch">inch</a> (25 <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millimetre.html" title="Millimetre">mm</a>) in diameter, which are dissolved (two at a time for the usual adult dosage) in a glass of water. As the tablets dissolve, the acid and bicarbonate react vigorously producing <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> gas (hence the "<a href="../../../s/e/l/Seltzer.html" title="Seltzer">Seltzer</a>"), which also produces enough agitation to allow the active ingredients to dissolve readily. The patient then ingests the resulting solution.</p>
<p>The product has been extensively <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertised</a> since the beginning of the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a> era in the U.S. It was formerly marketed as something of a cure-all; at one time its ads even suggested taking it for "the blahs." Subsequent regulation has taken into consideration that aspirin is a relatively powerful drug which is not tolerated by everyone and should not generally be taken at all by children or adolescents due to its linkage to <a href="../../../r/e/y/Reye%27s_syndrome.html" title="Reye's syndrome">Reye's syndrome</a>; the product is no longer marketed in this fashion.</p>
<p>The product has suffered a decline in popularity in the U.S. in recent decades; there are apparently several factors involved in this.</p>
<ul>
<li>The increasing medical awareness of the U.S. general public, most of whom now realize that it is not advisable to take a multi-symptom treatment product unless one has all of the symptoms that it treats (i.e., in Alka-Seltzer's case, a headache simultaneous with an upset stomach.)</li>
<li>A general trend away in the U.S. from aspirin-based products to those based on other pain relievers, notably <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetaminophen.html" title="Acetaminophen">acetaminophen</a> and <a href="../../../i/b/u/Ibuprofen.html" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>.</li>
<li>The product is believed to have a bland, chalky taste, rather off-putting to some; in recent decades flavored versions have been available as a concession to that fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>At one time the product was available in both long glass tubes and foil packets; the latter is the primary way the product is provided today, with two tablets in each packet.</p>

<p>As the sale of the original product has declined, Bayer HealthCare (formerly Miles Laboratories) has put the famous brand onto newer products, such as the <i>Alka-Seltzer Plus</i> line of remedies for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_cold.html" title="Common cold">common cold</a>. Some of the newer products are now neither effervescent nor aspirin-based. This is because the billions of dollars building the brand through advertising are still yielding benefits; many Americans still remember <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_phrase.html" title="Catch phrase">catch phrases</a> from its ads such as "I can't believe I ate the <i>whole</i> thing!", "Mamma mia, that's-a <i>spicy</i> <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatball.html" title="Meatball">meatball</a>-a!", "Try it, you'll <i>like</i> it!" and "Plop Plop Fizz Fizz, oh what a relief it is!"; a similar slogan in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> referred to the "plunk plunk <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">fizz-ics</a>".</p>
<p>In late <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Alka Seltzer re-introduced the "I can't believe I ate the whole thing" ad with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Boyle_a192.html" title="Peter Boyle">Peter Boyle</a>, apparently "in character" as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Barone_d60f.html" title="Frank Barone">Frank Barone</a> from the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>–<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> TV <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> <i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Loves_Raymond_2d09.html" title="Everybody Loves Raymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></i> (his TV wife, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Roberts_9d65.html" title="Doris Roberts">Doris Roberts</a> as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Barone_ff41.html" title="Marie Barone">Marie Barone</a>, appeared alongside Boyle in some of these commercials).</p>
<p>On March 28, 2006, Alka-Seltzer celebrated its 75th anniversary with a world record setting buffet at the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_Hilton_108d.html" title="Las Vegas Hilton">Las Vegas Hilton</a>. Over 500 dishes were featured at the buffet. The event was hosted by <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Griffin_e174.html" title="Kathy Griffin">Kathy Griffin</a> and was featured in the final episode of the second season of the Bravo reality show <a href="../../../l/i/f/Kathy_Griffin%7E_Life_on_The_D-List_e3ed.html" title="Kathy Griffin: Life on The D-List">Kathy Griffin: Life on The D-List</a>. In late 2006, Griffin appeared in another re-introduced Alka-Seltzer ad, the "Try it, you'll <i>like</i> it!" spot.</p>
<p>Another well known icon was the "Speedy" character (an American advertising icon created by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Pal_3661.html" title="George Pal">George Pal</a>) who was either a little boy or an <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf.html" title="Elf">elf</a> (opinions vary) whose body was primarily one Alka-Seltzer tablet while he wore another as a hat; he proclaimed Alka-Seltzer's virtues and sang the "Plop plop fizz fizz" song in his high, squeaky voice (provided by voice actor <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Beals_6319.html" title="Dick Beals">Dick Beals</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Raft_0de7.html" title="George Raft">George Raft</a> starred in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> Alka-Seltzer commercial "The Unfinished Lunch." It consists of Raft incarcerated and in the prison lunchroom. He takes a bite of the awful prison food and recoils back. Suddenly he bangs his cup on the steel table loudly in the lunchroom. It ripple effects throughout the room. He starts intoning "Alka Seltzer, Alka Seltzer..." Soon, the other hundreds of inmates do the same. The commercial is regarded as a "classic", mostly because the product is never seen, and the brand name is the only word spoken. It is reminiscent of the old radio ad for a similar product, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromo-Seltzer_5022.html" title="Bromo-Seltzer">Bromo-Seltzer</a>, with its "freight train" rhythmic repetition of the product's name.</li>
<li>Alka-Seltzer had a series of commercials during the mid <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> which utilized a song called "Whatever Shape Your Stomach's In," which was recorded by the <a href="../../../t/-/b/T-Bones_c761.html" title="T-Bones">T-Bones</a> and was released as a single which became a hit in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>. The ads were unique in that they featured only the mid-sections (no faces) of people of all shapes and sizes.</li>
<li>Another highly regarded Alka-Seltzer commercial is one from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> in which an actor (he's referred to as "Jack") is mimicking an Italian accent and trying to film a commercial for the fictional product "Magdalini's Meatballs" and constantly has to eat a meatball and then say "Mamma mia, that's-a <i>spicy</i> <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatball.html" title="Meatball">meatball</a>-a!" because of take after take getting ruined by some comedic trial or another. "Jack" has eaten so many meatballs near the commercial's end that it's Alka Seltzer to the rescue. Finally, with his stomach settled, the take goes perfectly, except at the very end the door on the stove falls off. The director (off-camera) is heard to sigh and then say, "OK, let's break for lunch." The commercial is regarded as one of the most classic commercials in history.</li>
<li>Another Alka-Seltzer commercial from the same era is one concerning "The ultimate businessman's lunch". Seeking "revenge" on his underlings for former bad suggestions, "The Boss" [aka "Mr. J.G.", played by character actor <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Frome_b5ed.html" title="Milton Frome">Milton Frome</a> ] is taking his "boys" out to lunch in the most out-of-the-way place imaginable. In this instance they are seen trudging through the snow in a howling windstorm towards their destination, a Chinese restaurant in the mountains of Tibet. Once inside the restaurant and removing their parkas, J.G. and the boys are greeted by the proprietor, "Moo Chee" [a thinly veiled reference to other oriental food], played by character actor and voice artist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Miller_%28actor%29_789a.html" title="Marvin Miller (actor)">Marvin Miller</a> [best-known for playing Michael Anthony, personal assistant to John Beresford Tipton [III] on the 1950's TV series "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Millionaire_da06.html" title="The Millionaire">The Millionaire</a>", and the voice of "Robby the Robot" in the 1950's film <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbidden_Planet_398e.html" title="Forbidden Planet">Forbidden Planet</a></i> ]. Moo Chee directs them into the dining room where J.G. orders all the food, including roast yak in a special hot sauce followed by "chocolate moose". One of the boys complains "but J.G., that's a French dessert!". J.G. responds "No, this is a real moose!" followed quickly by Moo Chee chiming in "with special hot chocolate sauce!" [as in hot peppers]. In the next scene J.G. and the boys are eating and getting sick, when in comes Moo Chee announcing "Important phone call for Mr. J.G.!" In the next scene, the hung-up telephone is seen [just a prop in the ruse to get away from the boys], and J.G. is finishing his Alka-Seltzer, thanking Moo Chee for his timely "rescue" from the awful food. Relieved, the boss returns to the now-empty dining room with Moo Chee. "Where are the boys?" asks J.G. The final remark is by Moo Chee "Maybe they too have important phone call, Mr. J.G." All of this detail is conveyed in a 30-second spot.</li>
