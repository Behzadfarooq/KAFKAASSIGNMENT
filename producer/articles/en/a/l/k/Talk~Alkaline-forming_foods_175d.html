	    <p>One way or another, there is something wrong with this page.</p>
<p>If it is just documenting the pH of various foods, then it is not accurate to say in general that alkaline foods reduce acidity in the body, and then to contrast them with the listed acidic foods. What is important to disorders like <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acidosis.html" title="Acidosis">acidosis</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkalosis.html" title="Alkalosis">alkalosis</a> is the so-called <i>residue</i> of the food. If it is documenting residues, however, then it is wrong about citrus fruits, which do have pH less than 7, but are generally reported as having alkaline residue.</p>
<p>However, I'm afraid I don't know enough about the subject to write anything detailed, or to judge the basis for all of this in dietary science. Can anyone help? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnebyone_4a94.html" title="User:Onebyone">Onebyone</a> 00:43, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took out some pretty disputable and objectively incorrect information. Unfortunately I think theres still some falsehoods in 'Effect of foods on pH balance' and 'Role of digestion' left. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkarp_9606.html" title="User:Johnkarp">Johnkarp</a> 10:24, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I searched PubMed and the journals at the UIUC library, and I couldn't find any reference to 'alkaline-forming foods' or measurement of this.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the entire idea is only used in Nutripathy. Maybe this article content should be moved to <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutripathy.html" title="Nutripathy">Nutripathy</a>?</p>

<p>I added a POV banner because this article has a clear bias toward the idea that people can change their "body pH" by eating certain foods. I think this page deserves to exist, if only because of the all-to-common infomercials that hock this idea. Medicine has known for decades that there is no such thing as acid-forming or alkaline-forming foods, except where urine is concerned. Acidic foods cause acidic urine, alkaline foods cause alkaline urine. Neither has an effect whatsoever on blood or body pH, so this whole idea is quackery. Like I said, though, the page needs to exist if only to inform the misinformed. There are people who claim and may even believe that "alkalinizing the body" can cure cancer. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECKelly_f4a0.html" title="User:CKelly">ZZYZX</a> 10:36, September 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that this page has no reason to exist. Most of it is pseudoscience, and at the very least should be labeled as such. I don't know how to get the ball rolling, but I'm in favor of deletion. Also, someone removed my POV notice. If you're going to do that, you need to at least give us a reason why it doesn't apply. Most of what this article has no basis in science. I'm adding the POV notice back, and adding this page to my watchlist. I'd feel better if we were to just delete this page and redirect it to naturopathy or something like that. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECKelly_f4a0.html" title="User:CKelly">ZZYZX</a> 04:13, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just got here from the NPOV community portal... Just so you know my bias, I have worked at a natural foods store and done much research in food science.</p>
<p>I think this article is incomplete in its understanding of foods effect on the body, but there is a presentation of the subject that is more accurate that will most likely satisfy both parties:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The body needs to have a balanced ph.</li>
<li>In order to maintain homeostasis the body uses buffers to keep ph within a very narrow range.</li>
<li>The body uses particular vitamins and minerals for buffering.</li>
<li>Buffering takes priority and if there is a given nutrient that is needed for, say, bone strength and for buffering at the same time, the body will use it for the immediate essential need to buffer.</li>
<li>If there is a diet that both causes the body to need extensive buffering and doesn't supply the necessary nutrients to both carry out this function and carry out other needed functions, then the body will eventually be lacking in some needed nutrients.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's a good part of the argument. It's late, I'm not going to look up which specific nutrients are pulled for buffer use, or anything else that needs to be looked up for this article. At least not right now. The information is readily available. I learned a good bit of it in BIO 101. I only wrote this to defend it against being labeled as pseudoscience, though in its current writing I suppose it actually is. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambaJan_e449.html" title="User:LambaJan">LambaJan</a> 06:06, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't work at a natural health food store, I avoided Biology and took Earth Science class to study plate-tectonics in grades 11 &amp; 12 because I didn't want to have to dissect an insect, let alone a frog. As a matter of fact I studied film after I graduated and to this day the closest I have ever come to even thinking about Alkaline was when I bought my first fish tank at Petcetera a couple of months ago and had to create the perfect environment for my adorable little Aquatic Frogs. I had no idea that the PH Balance of the water and it's Acid and Alkaline levels would be the matter of life and death for my little guys. With my childlike innocence (lets forget for a moment that I am actually 24) I sorta thought you could just toss them in any water as long as it was fresh and had a bubbler, boy was I wrong...no I didn't kill them, but I could have easily if the clerk hadn't been so helpful and I hadn't been so darn resourceful. Wikipedia got me started on my little educational venture into understanding the importance of water chemistry, PH, Yin &amp; Yang etc etc. and then I started thinking...if I (being a human being and all) am made up mostly of water is it possible that like my little aquatic frog friends I require a perfect Alkaline Acid balance to survive? Obviously we are far more complicated as humans with very different systems yadda yadda, but still we are both living creatures aren't we? Anyway before you know it this question led to another which led to another which eventually led me to here...Alkaline Forming Foods and more specifically-this Editing Talk section and I must say (yes my ramble will soon have a point) I am shocked that people are actually writing that the page should be deleted! Or that fellow Wikipedia users are suggesting that articles that they may deem to be full of "quackery" should not even be written about...and if they are should be changed here and there and have this and that added, that is rediculous! An encyclopedia is "a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically" it is not a platform for censorship! I say write about or define any subject matter you wish to, aim to be fully accurate but if that can't be the case due to lack of sufficient scientific studies/data mention that somehow (which was done in the alkaline foods case) and pat yourself on the back for a job well done, even if at the end of the day all you have done is satisfied some un-alkaline educated girl like me who simply got to thinking a little too deeply about her froggies.Midol Girl 14:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a somewhat more extensive education than high school biology, or BIO 101, and I'm going to merge what I can to nutripathy and make this page a redirect.
