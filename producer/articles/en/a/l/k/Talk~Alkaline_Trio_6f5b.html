<p>I stumbled upon this song on the net by chance. I don't know the band, but what are the credits for this song on the album? The melody in the piano introduction is a blatant rip-off of Rachmaninoff's First Suite for 2 pianos, op. 5 (second movement). --JFS 21:33, 18 August 2006 (UTC) Where would one go about hearing a clip of that?

<p>While technically accurate, saying Matt practices Satanism isn't ENTIRELY true, as he said in an interview he simply was a member just to freak people out/piss them off. Give me your thoughts, and possibly revise the first paragraph.</p>
<p>I am changing it to "reportedly practice", feel free to change that. I've read the interviews where Matt claims to tell people he's a Satanist just to piss people off, too. <a href="../../../i/m/f/User%7EIMFromKathlene_8158.html" title="User:IMFromKathlene">IMFromKathlene</a> 02:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alkaline Trio is one of my favorite bands, but there's one song that I'd really like to know. It's on the "DEEP RED" video on Crimson. It starts playing at about 5:15 minutes. I think it might be one of the songs that was originally intended to be on Crimson, but later dropped. Does anyone know what this song is called?</p>

<p>Before these guys were known nationally, they were known in Chicago as the band from Elgin. Maybe they should be described as being from Elgin (where there was a big punk scene) rather than Chicago.</p>

<dd>'ve heard worse "pop punk," but I think there's a stereotype of any punk band that goes into the mainstream must be labeled "pop punk." It's really all a matter of opinion. Frankly, I like who I like and I don't give a rats ass who calls them a sell out. Punk rock is dangerous territory for debates, though, people are always ready to throw down over defense/offense of whatever band. I've seen more passive debates over the State of Israel! <a href="../../../p/o/i/User%7EPoisonouslizzie_1ba3.html" title="User:Poisonouslizzie">Poisonouslizzie</a> 19:00, 2 February 2006 (UTC) &lt;--- P.S.

<dd>AFAIK NOFX, Rancid, Bad Religion are pretty "mainstream" (well... sort of, as a hell a lot of people know em) but I've never heard anyone call them pop punk. Anyway, Alkaline Trio ain't emo. Maybe light punk or something. Nowadays the word "emo" is associated too much with people who cut themselves ("I wish my lawn was emo so it would cut itself" etc) so... coming to my conclusion... IMHO it's the best to keep the "punk rock" there and not scare people away by calling them emo. --<a href="../../../h/j/v/User%7EHJV_25e2.html" title="User:HJV">HJV</a> 03:50, 24 February 2006 (UTC) <b>END</b></dd>

<p>To the person above me. I think you forget the original meaning of emo. I think it should be listed in the genre under punk, but not in the paragraph. Maybe we could put like Emo(ealrier albums) or something.</p>
<p><br />
All music has some sort of emotion in it, which makes the term "emo" significant to all forms and genres of music. I hate it when people argue about stuff like that. Secondly...just because something is melodic does not mean you have to directly label something "pop-insert genre here". "Pop" was intially just short for popular, as in popular music...Alkaline Trio aren't really that popular yet. If we all must catergarize them....why not just leave it at "melodic punk", and thats it. --69.204.107.78 15:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)katie</p>
<p>Alkiline Would Not Be Any Close To Pop Punk Or Any Punk Catagory...Alternative, But Not Punk...Lets Put Them In A New Catagory..."Gloom Rock"...Its Not Emo, And It Fits Their Image.-Rubot...8/10/06"END"</p>
<p>I somewhat agree with Rubot, but only in the sense that their music isn't really punk, and fits more under the Emo category. The problem is that to many people don't really know what Emo is, and assign Pop-Punk (My Chemical Romance, The Used) bands and Screamo/Post-Hardcore (Fugazi, Silverstien, Aiden) bands as Emo. I mostly assign Emo to bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Texas is the Reason, and, to a lesser degree, Death Cab for Cutie and Jimmy Eat World, based on song content. Basically, if we place Alkaline Trio as Emo, it will mess with the scene kid's MTV-based reality, but its a closer truth than placing them as Punk. - Mitch Strand ... 11/7/06</p>
<p>Alkaline Trio isn´t punk rock at all. They are pop-punk/emo.</p>

<p>In the discussion of "From Here to Infirmary," I'm certain they made a video for "Private Eye." It was a collection of live videos... I'm almost entirely sure it got play on MTV2. But, I'm not 100 percent sure about that. I'd like to add that, so if anybody is sure of which station played it.. I think that should be added.</p>
<p>Also, I'm moving the line up about the Mike Felumlee / Derek Grant switch into the 2000-2003 category. Grant joined in 2002 and played with Alkaline Trio for the 2002 Warped Tour, and also on the fall tour of that same year.</p>

I saw a live video for Private Eye on Kerrang!, thats what got me into them in the first place. It's on their website if you want to watch it. - Rob 11/04/06</p>
<p>Yes, there's a video for "Private Eye". It's a compilation video, taken from live concerts and the such. I beleive Atom Willard, the current crummer for The Offspring and Angels and Airwaves, is the only drummer in the music video.</p>

<p>I've removed the recently added 'emo' reference in the opening line. By saying <i>punk rock and emo band</i> it implies they are two seperate genres, where as they are plainly not. Emo-punk is a sub-genre of punk. Please do not re-add it to the opening paragraph again.</p>
<p>However, it may be interesting to include a short section on the difficulty involved in classifying Alk3. We could include some references. What do people think? Welshy 14:23, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Categorizing music is nearly pointless. Modern popular music doesn't usually fit into any one solid and definable genre. There are only several major divisions in music that I feel are relevant: Rock &amp; Roll, Classic Rock, Punk, Techno, Classical(which can be further and <i>accurately</i> described by the time period that it was composed), Big Band, Ska, and arguably a few others. Outside of that you can classify it personally: Rock music that I like, Punk music that I hate, Techno that sucks....etc. At the rate that people are creating categories you will have to soon justify categorizing "Alkaline Trio" as "Gloom Punk with bald bassist and guitarist with 'Song' tattooed across his fingers emo". "Alkaline Trio" has a Rock and Punk type sound, to split hairs past this point will only cause people to argue. - Ch33zm0ng3r 06:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you count alcohol and tobacco from their Asian Man days (their greatest), yeah I guess so. However, on songs like "Continental", there's an obvious reference to heroin.

<p>The band was listed as punk rock. If you are familiar with the punk rock genre, it is clear that Alkaline Trio is not punk rock, and any influence the punk movement had on the band is minimal. The closest classification that I could determine was Post Punk, a genre that emulates punk's general formula but is marked by slower tempos and softer spoken vocals. CDDB also lists Alkaline Trio as post punk. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolutus_a252.html" title="User:Solutus">Solutus</a> 06:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Artist Direct: punk</li>
<li>iTunes: included in "Emo iTunes Essentials" (the songs Message from Kathlene, Rooftops, Time to Waste)</li>
<li>Rhapsody: This Chicago band owes more to the shifting rhythms, undulating crunchy guitars and sung/shouted vocals of emo than to influences of hardcore punk</li>
<li>Aversion: modern-day punk, indie rock</li>
<li>All Music Guide: emotion-fueled, angst-ridden, dark pop-punk (bio) Smart, bright, punk-derived pop (crimson review)</li>
<li>Metacritic music: rock, alternative</li>
<li>Stylus (Crimson review): They are the stand-outs of a genre that two years ago I wanted to name “Margeracore” as an industry standard. It’s a genre where the pop sensibilities of the chart friendliest side of emo get mixed in with Vans-sporting sk8 rock, and so you have the distillation of black nail-varnished teenage guitar-me-do in 2005. Except Alkaline Trio aren’t chasing any zeitgeists here: they’ve been standing in this place since 1997. They’ve just been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up with them.</li>
<li>Lost at Sea: pop-punk (review of Maybe I'll Catch Fire) 4-chord evil punk rock Chicago gone West sounds (review of Good Mourning)</li>
<li>PopMatters: horror punk (review of Crimson)</li>
<li>The A.V. Club: pop-punk (Crimson review)</li>
<li>Jam!: pop-punk (Good Mourning review)</li>
<li>NME: Skate-punk, Thrashcore (Private Eye review) Punk, rock (From Here to Infirmary review)</li>
<li>Piero Scaruffi: punk (earlier albums) punk-pop (Crimson)</li>

<dd>I think that punk rock should definitely be mentioned, because punk-pop and punk revival are sub genres of punk, so they can be covered under the punk rock genre. They same goes for horror punk and skate punk I also think that alt rock should be included as that is a separate genre of music. I think that emo could also be included if you provide the all music guide as a source. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidJJJ_edc7.html" title="User:DavidJJJ">DavidJJJ</a> 20:41, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On their MySpace page, the band (or their label and publicists) describe its genre as punk. I think enough other sources have also used that term, for us to give them the benefit of the doubt and keep the article saying "punk rock" as it does currently (and just use the one term there to keep things simple). My reading of the sources is that critics are increasingly using the term <i>pop-punk</i> to describe their more recent work, especially with <i>Crimson</i>. So I think it is fair to have "pop-punk" in the infobox, as it also currently does. Adding extra genres in the infobox does not take away from the flow of the article. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Erik_7aea.html" title="User:Paul Erik">Paul Erik</a> 17:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
