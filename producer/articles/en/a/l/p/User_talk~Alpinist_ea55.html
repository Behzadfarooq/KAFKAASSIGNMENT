	    <p>Hi Alpinist, I've been following your work on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_disorder.html" title="Conversion disorder">Conversion disorder</a> page. I've got a question I'm hoping you can clear up for me. If your position is correct, and conversion disorder doesn't exist, what article should there be for the long list of patients who arrive in clinic with obvious motor symptoms which have no obvious cause? I agree in some cases that means we just haven't looked hard enough, but would you accept that for at least some of these individuals there is a psychological cause? --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 13:19, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the term should be functional (as in of unidentified aetiology).</p>
<p>I think the current statistics are 50% turn out to be MS 10% psychological 40% no idea (David Bateman).</p>
<p>Hi Alpinist, thanks for your response. This is exactly the kind of information I was hoping for. I think the individual journey of each patient is highly variable but the important thing is that we should be instilling hope from the get-go. To go from being wheelchair-bound to fully able to do star jumps is an incredible improvement, and one that I want to bring to out clinic. Can I ask you to start Functional neurological deficit? I hope it will form the basis of a debate which I hope to be able to inform with some research. I'd like to get something started in London later on this year to find out more. All the best, --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 09:00, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Simon, is that Hurst piece a book or an article? Nothing on Amazon... --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 11:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the reference. Turns out we have a copy in one of our libraries, I'll pull it up this week. Yes the article needs some more attention, I thought I'd leave you to work on it for a few weeks before barging in with any input though! --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 12:50, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Alpinist, I'm not sure the full revert was the best thing for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_disorder.html" title="Conversion disorder">conversion disorder</a> as it's now lost a lot of information that was factually true. For example, regardless of whether or not you agree with it, the DSM-IV criteria were set out there and that is the basis on which conversion disorder is diagnosed. If there is something specific about Charcot I think you should correct it but cite a reference. I'm going to dive in and try and integrate your two pieces on this, but only in the spirit of a 3rd(ish) party and certainly not in an authoritative way!--<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 12:46, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback =) --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 20:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Alpinist, I've put WalkerTexasRngr's contributions back up to see if any other editors wish to work on them over the next few days. I think there's no harm in leaving them up there for a few weeks to ferment and get better with others' input. I'm not quite sure the hodge-podge I put together can be considered a consensus! It was more like "take one sentence from column A, one from column B, simmer for 30 minutes, and "save page"... BTW we're starting to get somewhere with a functional neurological deficit service in London, will let you know how it goes... --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 21:25, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Simon, thanks for the message. This is particularly interesting seeing as we're soon going to have the clinic set up. It's going to be called the "functional neurology clinic" and will run from King's. I've expressed an interest as being a researcher, doing info leaflets, and running a website for them. If there are some people you think I should talk to that would be very helpful.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>Could I ask you to consider these comments in reference to your revision?</p>
<ul>
<li>"As a dissociative disorder in DSM-IV it should be viewed with caution." - <i>At first glance this strikes me as being POV. Perhaps reword to something like "critics who refute the concept of dissociative disorders hold that..."?</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Frederick Crews stated that dissociation is the perfect psychoanalytic-style vehicle for creation of a pseudoscience, since there is no way to disprove its existence and recovered memories never need be tested by comparing them with conscious memories. After all, if children dissociate themselves from the experience, one could not expect them to have any memories of the event. <i>Two things here; first of all without the use of quotation marks I can not tell which part Frederick Crews has said and which part you have stated. Secondly is there any chance you could find a source for this quote?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for your contributions on this article.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Simon, more dilligent work I see. Just so I can track down the quotes and references you're using, would you mind putting links to sources in your edits? If you scroll down to some of the later bits you can see how, it's basically just putting square brackets around a web link and the wiki does the rest.</p>

<p>Hi Simon, I must admit I hadn't heard of that, I presume it's this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome</a>&#160;?</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about the references, I am slowly churning through them, in fact I might have another stab at it today. I don't know if you saw the other bits that I did, I've tried to clarify why conversion/dissociation get confused (DSM-IV vs ICD10). I'll check the site out later too. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 09:04, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Read your site; very pretty! What software are you using? There was an interesting talk by Richard Kanaan, who is leading on our functional neurology clinic, last week at the BNPA. The short version is a patient with functional weakness in the right arm had decreased blood flow in the corresponding area of their motor cortex when asked to recall a traumatic memory that preceded the onset of weakness. I'll ask if he can send you something. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 09:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
