<dd>Ok, I'll give you <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Addams_7ba8.html" title="Jane Addams">Jane Addams</a> as the first honorary member. But I still have a time accepting <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Roosevelt_a44d.html" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> as being a full member in the traditional sense. I mean, she married at age 20. Did she even go to college?--<a href="../../../s/v/t/User%7ESVTCobra_8aba.html" title="User:SVTCobra">SVTCobra</a> 00:18, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Believe what you wish; however as a member of this sorority, I know what I know. You wrote that you "have a time accepting" that the former first lady was "a full member in the traditional sense." However, the first post simply asks "is that right," that she was a member. I am not sure what you mean by "full member," though. She was an honorary member, but that does not mean that she simply received a certificate and a handshake. She is a member. Whether she joined as an undergrad., grad., pledged, or joined under the new process, she is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. Whether she went to college or not is another issue. But, since she is noted to be an honorary member, that indicates that she did not join as what you may mean by a "full member in the traditional sense." Also, just in case you come across this tidbit, you can verify the membership of the former U.S. V.P. who was an honorary member of a historically Black fraternity! -- <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvid_reader_646d.html" title="User:Avid reader">Avid reader</a> 18:43, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I meant to say "hard time accepting" not just "time accepting". But that is beside the point. I wasn't the one posing the original question.

<p>Shown below:</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of our ever-growing community .</p>
<p>Also Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. strives to reach the Five National Targets as set forth by our Supreme Basileus, Dr. Norma S. White. Each of these targets are described in detail below:</p>
<p><b>Target 1: Education</b></p>
<p>Our goal is QUALITY EDUCATION for all. This target will focus on A.K.A., the acronym for "AKA KIDS ALERT." We feel that A.K.A. KIDS must enjoy and excel in learning. Parents of A.K.A. KIDS must be involved in the education of their children - A.K.A. KIDS must become responsible adults. IVY AKAdemy will continue to serve as the umbrella for all educational training and human resource development experiences provided by local chapters and will stress reading, writing, speaking, listening, mathematics, science and technology. PIMS - Partnership in Mathematics and Science will remain a viable segment of the program to be implemented at the chapter level. Summer Regional PIMS Camps will be encouraged.</p>
<p><b>Target 2: Health</b></p>
<p>Healthy bodies make healthy minds; therefore, we must encourage youth and adults to take good care of themselves, eat well, exercise and enjoy good physical and mental health. Parents must be inspired to help their children make healthy choices. This program target will focus on health issues that disproportionately affect minority populations, especially African Americans, as well as health issues specified in the President's Race Initiatives. The Alpha Kappa Alpha Health Net will be developed.</p>
<p><b>Target 3: The Black Family</b></p>
<p>The world we seek in the new millennium is one where a child's need for time with his or her parents is a top priority; where family's togetherness is prized; where family ties are reestablished; where parents consider the well-being of their children; and where homelessness does not exist. This program will focus on issues that divide the black family, at-risk youth, family values for middle and high school youth and AKA Coat Day for homeless families. "ON-TRACK" is the Signature Program for this administration.</p>
<p><b>Target 4: Economic Empowerment</b></p>
<p>We can only prosper if we are prepared for the work force, if we get the high paying jobs, and if we promote black businesses. It is important that the Black community gain empowerment. Ownership remains the key to wealth and power in America. We must arm African Americans with the information and encouragement they need to become successful entrepreneurs. This program will focus on financial planning and management, employment, entrepreneurship in the 21st Century and Black Dollar Days.</p>
<p><b>Target 5: The Arts</b></p>
<p>Alpha Kappa Alpha, throughout her rich heritage, has continually focused her attention on the arts. In many of our schools, the arts are no longer included in the curriculum. Alpha Kappa Alpha can fill this void, for we know that the arts can improve the quality of life for all mankind. The arts can be a meaningful vehicle for communication and education. Therefore, we must continue to heighten awareness of the arts, support arts education, promote potential artists, augment appreciation of the arts, and make the arts available to a larger public. This program will promote Chapter Summer Arts Programs and arts performances at conferences. It will also recognize African Americans in the arts.</p>

<p>Please tell me why we need to place the sorority's executive directors on the page, when no other NPHC fratnernity/sorority has them listed? Website "copying" pages are not allowed. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541">Bearly541</a> 17:08, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's executive directors included, Carey B. Maddox-Preston 1948 - 1974,Anne Mitchem-Davis 1974 - 1980,Earnestine G. McNealey 1980 - 1985,Barbara A. McKinzie 1985 - 1987,Nan D. Johnson 1987 - 1988,Alison Harris Alexander 1989 - 1996,Emma Lilly Henderson 1997 - 1998,Carey B. Maddox-Preston 1998 - 1999,Betty N. James 1999 - Present.</p>
<p><br />
A listing isn't a copy. Each organization is different and has a different history. As Iota Phi Theta doesn't have a hazing section and Alpha Phi Alpha does. What is wrong with having a listing of the executive directors? This information is verifiable and applicable to the organization. I'll place it back in and edit the look. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 17:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What does listing Executive Directors have to do with the organization? I can see if one of the directors were significant to the organization, like Patricia Roberts Harris.

<dd>First of all, <i>all</i> Howard University women DID NOT found Alpha Kappa Alpha. That's false information you are placing on the page which should be reverted on site. We know you NinjaNubian/KuntaKenta/or whoever you think you are today. Second, quit taking out information without discussing it on the discussion page. If you or your IPs do it again, you will be reported to AIV instantly. Third, the sophomores of 1910 were honor students and did not take part of initiation ceremonies. I have told you that time and time again. Please get some sense, quit being so closed minded, and listen to what people are trying to tell you, unless you want to be banned for Wikipedia <b>for good</b>. Right now, you are headed towards that direction...<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541">Bearly541</a> 00:05, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

who is kuntakenta? that's a lil' racist don't you think? AKA has a different kind of history then lets say alpha phi alpha.. Have you ever heard of pretty girls wear 20 pearls? If so then you would know that it has to do with their incorporaters and those whom help make the sorority what it is today. You can correct things by looking at the national website <a href="http://aka1908.org/" class="external free" title="http://aka1908.org/" rel="nofollow">http://aka1908.org/</a>, but it is far more important then the paragraph you continuously place in about ethel and george lyle... quoted by skip mason!!! <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 01:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>there is actually a debate going on right now if you read above. Per Wiki policy, deletion and discussion is considered to be acceptable. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BRD" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BRD" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BRD</a> The BOLD, revert, discuss cycle is a method for reaching consensus on any wiki with revision control</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, that's a guideline, NOT a policy. There's an enormous difference. Second, in this specific instance, you deleted boldly, and you were reverted. The next step according to the guideline you keep citing is to discuss, but your next step has been to revert the reversion and THEN discuss. From <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>:
<dl>
<dd>1. Boldly make the desired change to the page.</dd>
<dd>2. Wait until someone reverts your change or makes another substantial edit. <b>DO NOT Revert back!</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, if this is the guideline you wish to follow, how do you defend your actions when they clearly violate the directive to NOT revert back? | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:42, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I move that we eliminate the entire section of name lists - founders, sophomores, executive director - as excessive detail (see <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a>).

<dd>Founders are very important to organizations. I think we should move executive director, but incorporated past presidents because presidents are above executive directors. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541">Bearly541</a> 05:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So we keep the first list of founders, eliminate the executive directors list - how about the list of, say, "sophomores" who were just invited to join but didn't play a role in the founding? If some of those names were wikilinked and worthy of their own articles, I wouldn't see an issue, but long lists of names of obscure people usually don't belong in Wikipedia articles. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 14:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The sophomores of 1910 are a part of the "Twenty Pearls" (founders) of the organization. <a href="http://www.aka1908.com/past/" class="external free" title="http://www.aka1908.com/past/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aka1908.com/past/</a> AKA's website says that they are important in the foundation of the organization. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541">Bearly541</a> 03:18, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, let me play devil's advocate. The organization says they're important, but are they important in a Wikipedia sense? Would it be best to provide that link in an External Links section, but only to list a few of the names in the article? It just looks clumsy to me, and I think we should find a reasonable way to condense the section. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 03:59, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should eliminate the Executive Directors and keep the founders. Although the Executive Directors are important for the organization, the Founders (20 pearls) are fundamental because they are the ones which founded the organization and were instrumental in setting up the rules. I might do a short bio on the founders later when the article is unprotected. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541">Bearly541</a> 00:55, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
