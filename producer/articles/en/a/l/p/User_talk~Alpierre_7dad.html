	    <p><b>Golf in a Nutshell</b> Considered by many as a Scottish invention, Golf is an outdoor sport where each player has to play his own small ball into a hole using various types of clubs. As defined in the Rules of Golf: "The Game of Golf consists in playing a ball from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules."</p>
<p>Scholars suggest that this game is much akin to the modern field hockey originating in Netherlands where a game of positioning a small ball inside a hole in the ground using "golf clubs" was played in the 17th century.</p>
<p>Golf is played by holes. Most golf courses consist of 9 or 18 holes. (The "19th hole" is the bar at the club house.) For the shortest holes a good player requires only one stroke to hit the ball to the green. On longer holes, the green is too far away to reach it with the first stroke, so that one or more strokes are played from the fairway (where the grass is cut so low that most balls can be easily played) or from the rough (uncut grass or ground not prepared at all).</p>
<p>Many holes include hazards, namely bunkers (or sand traps), from which the ball is more difficult to play than from grass, and water hazards (lakes, ponds, rivers, etc). Special rules apply to playing balls that come to rest in a hazard which make it highly undesirable to play a ball into one. For example, a player must not touch the ground in a hazard with a club prior to playing a ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in a water hazard may be played as it lies or may be replaced by dropping another ball outside the water, but a penalty is incurred in the latter case.</p>
<p>Every hole is classified by its par. The par of a hole is defined by the distance from tee to green. Typical values for a par three hole range from 130 to 230 yards (120-210 m), a par four hole from 300 to 475 yards (275-435 m), and a par five hole from 450 to 600 yards (410-550 m). Par is also the theoretical number of strokes that an expert golfer should require for playing the ball into any given hole. The expert golfer is expected to reach the green in two strokes under par (in regulation) and then use two putts to get the ball into the hole. Many 18-hole courses have approximately four par-three, ten par-four, and four par-five holes. The total par of a 18-hole course is usually around 72.</p>
<p>Most golf courses maintain additional facilities that are not part of the course itself like practice range -- usually with practice greens, bunkers, and a driving area (where long shots can be practiced). There may even be a practice course (which is often easier to play or shorter than other golf courses).</p>
<p>Every game of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A round typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. On a nine-hole course, a standard round consists of two successive nine-hole rounds.</p>
<p>Players usually walk (or sometimes drive) over the course in groups of two, three, or four, sometimes accompanied by caddies who carry the players' equipment and assist in playing. Each player has to play one ball from the tee to the hole. Once every player has brought a ball into play, it is always the player whose ball is the farthest from the hole who is to play next. When all players of a group have completed the hole, that player who scored best on that hole has the honor, i.e. the right and duty to tee off first on the next.</p>
<p>To hit the ball, the club is swung at the motionless ball on the ground (or wherever it has come to rest) from a side-stance. Many golf shots make the ball travel through the air (carry) and roll out for some more distance (roll). This is typically the case with tee shots (drives) and fairway shots. When playing over shorter distances around the green, high approach shots (pitches) may be used where the ball rolls very little, stopping more or less where it hits the ground, or low approach shots (chips) where the ball makes a shallow flight and then rolls out on the green. On the green itself, putts are played where the ball does not leave the ground at all.</p>
<p>Golf scores for amateurs are usually calculated using a handicap system. Such a system allows players of different proficiency to play against each other on equal terms. While there are many variations in detail, all handicap system are based on calculating an individual player's playing ability from his or her recent history of golf rounds. A player's handicap is (very roughly) equal to the average number of strokes that he or she plays above the par of a course. Thus, a player who constantly plays a 100 on a par-72 course will have a handicap of 100 - 72 = 28. An expert golfer who plays a course in par (scratch golfer) will have a handicap of 0.</p>
<p>The four biggest tournaments in professional golf are called "majors" and they are played at roughly the same time every year -- The Masters, U.S. Open, Open Championship (British Open) and PGA Championship</p>
<p>Jack Nicklaus, who is widely regarded as the best golfer of all time, has won 18 majors. Tiger Woods, who is possibly the only contender to Nicklaus' record has won 8 majors, all before the age of 27. Tiger has also come the closest to winning all four majors in one year (known as a "grand slam") when he won the U.S. Open, British Open, and the PGA Championship in 2000, and then the Masters in 2001.</p>
<p>Grandeur dreams, many say, are etched from humble beginnings. Tiger Woods-wannabees can now be elated with golf in a nutshell.</p>
<p><b>Golf Courses in the Philippines</b></p>
<p>The Luisita Golf and Country Club, designed by renowned architect Robert Trent Jones Sr. This 18-hole championship course has been recently renovated so you can enjoy it in any weather, all year round. There are water areas all around coupled with great landscapping which is breathtaking. It's quite an easy course if you're not although wind is sometimes a factor. It is listed in Golf Magazines' Top 100 Golf Courses in the World. The Golf course is open to guests of <a href="http://www.centralparkhotel-tarlac.com/golf.php" class="external text" title="http://www.centralparkhotel-tarlac.com/golf.php" rel="nofollow">Central Park Hotel</a>.</p>
<p>Getting There</p>
<p>LUISITA GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB is situated in the heart in of Tarlac City, Tarlac and is included in the Central Luzon Development Program. It is strategically accessible to the following major economic points: Clark Field, Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Poro Point, and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.</p>
<p>Clark Field is 30 minutes away from Luisita. Subic Bay Freeport Zone, with its existing international airport, is also two hours away. The seaports of Manila and Poro Point, and Baguio are also two hours away.</p>
<p>Central Park Hotel is besides the Luisita golf course, giving visitors a clear view of the fairways.</p>
<p>Available are all day land transports via the North Expressway and a public railway in the estate. In addition, a shuttle service going around the estate will be instituted to facilitate easier access within the compound.</p>
