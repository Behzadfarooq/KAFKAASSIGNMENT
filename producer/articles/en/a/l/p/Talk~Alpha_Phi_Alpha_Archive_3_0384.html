<p>Are you sure that Congressman Charles Diggs was an Alpha?</p>
<p>Also, in the Alpha history book copyrighted 1981, Ralph Bunche was referred to as a non-member. Bunche died in 1971. If he was an Alpha, he would have been mentioned in the Charles Welsey history book as a member.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Both names were mentioned in the Alpha Centennial Documentary. The documentary is linked in the External links section of the article. I did search the web and found this link which indicate Bunche was member <a href="http://www.living-library.com/FreedomTour/AlphaPhiAlpha.html" class="external text" title="http://www.living-library.com/FreedomTour/AlphaPhiAlpha.html" rel="nofollow">Bunche</a>. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 04:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Charles Diggs is listed in Part 4, between 8:30-8:45 minute mark. I will try to locate the reference to Bunche on another day, but the link above notes his membership. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 06:30, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I just thought he was not an Alpha because in the history book it states, "Ralph Bunche was the first nonmember to receive ... award." That event probably occurred before he became an Alpha.</p>
<p>But yes, he is more than likely an Alpha if he is mentioned in the documentary because the documentary is more updated than the history book.</p>

<dd>Ralph Bunche name is mentioned in Part 6, between the 12:00-12:15 time stamp. Danny Davis is speaking and says Alpha must continue producing the MLK King's, the Ralph Bunche's, etc. Please listen and verify. Also, I do appreciate the time spent to read and ensure the article is correct and I hope you will continue.

   <b>Hello Skip Mason,</b> 
</pre>
<p><b>I am not a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, but I am a frequent contributor to numerous Black Greek letter organization articles on www.wikipedia.org</b></p>
<p><b>On wikipedia.org we are having an ongoing discussion about whether Ralph Bunche was an Alpha or not. The link below represents part of this discussion:</b></p>

   <b>Hi Jason,</b> 
</pre>
<p><b>Sorry for the delay. No Ralph Bunche was not an Alpha. I have always known him to be affiliated with Omega Psi Phi.</b></p>
<p><b>Skip Mason</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>These are actual copies of the e-mails, I only deleted my last name and e-mail address from these messages.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The authenticity of these e-mails can be verified by contacting him at (skipmason1906@aol.com).</p>
<p>Although Skip Mason said that Ralph Bunche was affiliated with Omega Psi Phi in the e-mail, Dr. Bunche was not affiliated with Omega Psi Phi either. Many believe he was an Omega because he won the Omega Citizen of the Year Award in 1948. But he was not in any college fraternity.</p>

<dd>I see no issue with it. The sentence makes it clear that the information comes from the organization itself, as does the citation.

<p>Well, are there any where else that can verify these claims? 60% of black doctors? 75% of black lawyers? and others in the United States? That would assume that at least 60% of black doctors and 75% of black lawyers are men. It just seems to be very far fetched. Looking on wikipedia reliable sources it states <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Company_and_organization_websites" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Company_and_organization_websites" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>: "Partisan and extremist websites The websites and publications of political parties and religious groups should be treated with caution, although bias is not in itself a reason to declare a source unreliable. Organizations or individuals that are widely acknowledged as extremist — such as Stormfront or the Socialist Workers Party — should not be used as sources, except in articles about themselves; that is, they may be used as primary sources but not as secondary ones. They should be used with caution and should be supported by other sources. Company and organization websites Caution should be used when using company or organization websites as sources. Although the company or organization is a good source of information on itself, it has an obvious bias. The American Association of Widget Manufacturers is interested in promoting widgets, so be careful not to rely on it exclusively if other reliable sources are available, in order to maintain a neutral point of view. Exercise particular care when using such a website as a source if the company or organization is a controversial one." The claim came from an Alpha Phi Alpha website, and I am simply asking for verification somewhere else. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatChimp_ed52.html" title="User:GreatChimp">GreatChimp</a> 16:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see that as a reasonable position. We're not talking about a partisan or extremist organization, and there's nothing outrageous about their claim. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 17:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The second portion of the link of which I posted stated, "<b>Company and organization websites</b> Caution should be used when using company or organization websites as sources. <i>Although the company or organization is a good source of information on itself, it has an obvious bias</i>. The American Association of Widget Manufacturers is interested in promoting widgets, so be careful not to rely on it exclusively if other reliable sources are available, in order to maintain a neutral point of view. Exercise particular care when using such a website as a source if the company or organization is a controversial one." The claim made in the website presents an obvious bias. The statement that Alpha Phi Alpha has 75% of black lawyers can be said to be false when statistics show that there are 17450 black male lawyers and 16415 black female lawyers. Black males do not make up 75% of black lawyers so how can Alpha Phi Alpha claim to have 75% of Black lawyers if it is exclusively a male organization <a href="http://www.abanet.org/minorities/links/2000census.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abanet.org/minorities/links/2000census.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<dd>I read it the first time; there's no need to quote chapter and verse repeatedly. But since you are, let me do the same: "The American Association of Widget Manufacturers is interested in promoting widgets, so be careful not to rely on it exclusively <i>if other reliable sources are available</i>..." You have yet to present another source, or any evidence that the claims made about membership are false. (It was evident to me that the 75% claim referred to MALE lawyers.) I don't see any issue with repeating APhiA's claims about its membership, as long as the claims are attributed properly. Asking for a government source sets a completely unreasonable standard. If you have an unbiased third-party source that can show contradictory evidence, let's see it. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:50, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The link provided no where states that they were speaking of male lawyers. It stated black lawyers. I believe the American Bar Association is a strong enough entity to serve to disprove the claim. All I am asking for is a source for the high percentage claims of professional membership. They include, government, newspaper, polling, independent magazines.

See <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_forces.html" title="Armed forces">Armed forces</a> regarding branches of service. It's only necessary to capitalize the first word "Armed" when it is used at the beginning of a sentence. Thanks anyway for for efforts in proof-reading, I do appeciate all the input.

<p>sorry, wrong link. not major, as i don't believe it is a hard and fast rule outside of the GPO. when specifically refering to the US branches of service (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) as an organization, AF is capitalized, as opposed to describing the military. for ex: Department of Defense: Military Establishment; Armed Forces; All-Volunteer Forces; but armed services. U.S. Navy: the Navy; the Marine Corps; Navy (Naval) Establishment; Navy officer; but naval shipyard; naval officer; naval station, etc.(<a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chap03.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chap03.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> at 3.17.) like i said, minor. though if this is what it has come to in proofreading, it speaks to a clearly high level of editing w/in the article! -<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotam_8f37.html" title="User:Robotam">Robotam</a> 16:45, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The first black college fraternity is often rumored to be Sigma Pi Phi, founded in 1904. But this is a misnomer. Sigma Pi Phi was founded in 1904 as an organization for professionals and college graduates and NOT for black college students." --- from <a href="http://www.munualphas.com/part4.html" class="external free" title="http://www.munualphas.com/part4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.munualphas.com/part4.html</a> footnote 75</p>
<p>as written on the article "Sigma Pi Phi, founded in 1904, is also considered to be the first, although many argue this is a misnomer. Sigma Pi Phi was founded as an organization for professionals and college graduates and not as an organization of black college students.[75] " This section as written misinterpretes the citation. 64.12.7.141 22:19, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't locate anywhere that states that Sigma Pi Phi is a college fraternity. Alpha Phi Alpha is a college fraternity and more (graduate and professional). I was attempting a clean up. 64.12.7.141 22:22, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The section is called "black fraternal movement" Sigma Pi Phi holds a place. I do think it should change to black greek movement since AKA's are brought up as well. 64.12.7.141 22:41, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It would also clear up as to why Alpha Phi Alpha is the first intercollegiate black fraternity, and not the first collegiate black fraternity or first black fraternity.64.12.7.141 22:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with MrDarcy. Sigma Pi PHi was only mentioned because the above IP user (MKF) had college chapters. I will remove the references and this should remove the question of "misnomer" since we've established it has no college chapgers. --<a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 07:10, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This was not agreed upon. It was agreed to take this to the talk section until a resolution was reached. In addition, the black greek movement would undoubtedly include Sigma Pi Phi, Kappa Alpha Nu, Omega Psi Phi, and others. 207.200.122.102 10:58, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Secondly, regardless of whether or not college chapters exist it is a recognized fraternity. AKA is a recognized sorority and has as a result been listed. 207.200.122.102 11:03, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>MrDarcy is correct, this article is about a college fraternity as are the other organizations mentioned, not Sigma Pi Phi.

<dd>If this article is about a college fraternity, why are AKA's mentioned? Alpha Phi Alpha isn't just a college fraternity. It includes college, but has graduate members as well. It has inducted members who never attended college &amp; inducts honorary members. Take a look at the changes made before reverting.

<dd>Upon review, Skip Mason is quoted as stating "Sigma Pi Phi had the foresight to eliminate undergraduate members many years ago, in their infancy."<a href="http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm30.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm30.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. So at one point Sigma Pi Phi was a collegiate organization and does deserve inclusion. 64.12.7.132 15:52, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again you mistate the facts and waste the time of other editors. Mr. Mason is posting <i>AN INTERESTING LETTER FROM A MEMBER OF KAPPA ALPHA PSI</i> who disagrees with Mason topic on "revisionist fraternities", and so it's the Kappa you are quoting. Mr. Mason's correct quote is: <b>Sigma Pi Phi is not treated in any of the fraternity history books, simply because it was never founded to be a collegiate-based organization</b> and <b>Alpha Phi Alpha still remains, unless otherwise proven, the first fraternity for college-trained African-American men</b>.</dd>

Now, when you thought he said something that supported your view, you rushed back to wikipedia "faster than a bat out of hell" to say "Upon Futher Review", since Mason believes as I do, he should be considerd an unbiased and neutral authority and final arbiter on this topic. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a>02:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Putting in clarifications was all that was asked for. Regardless of whether someone is a member of one fraternity or another doesn't take away from the fact that they can make a positive contribution. Just as you post on other fraternity or sorority pages on this site. Sigma Pi Phi was removed for whatever reason. The page was also protected. So I guess with no discussion taking place or an agreement made an opinion was forced. Unusual considering it was asked to be brought to the talk section. Alpha Phi Alpha remains the first intercollegiate (mor e than one chapter) fraternity for African Americans. There has been more than enough articles published to rebuke the statement that it is the first fraternity for college trained men. That frat, is denial. 172.190.222.79 04:40, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sigma Pi Phi was removed based on what MrDarcy said above, and what Mason said <b>Sigma Pi Phi is not treated in any of the fraternity history books, simply because it was never founded to be a collegiate-based organization</b>. MrDarcy instincts were correct and its agrees with Mason. Two neutral sources: MrDarcy said he only brought this for discussion because although he had no idea what you were referring but was curious just to hear what you had to say, and Mason statements were without knowledge of this discussion. Three parties, (Mason, MrDarcy, Ccson) and all 9 NPCH orgs don't address Sigma Pi Phi and that's why it doesn't need to be in this article.

<dd>If you review the archives of this talk, you'll see that you have been placated in the past when editors have engaged in several other exhaustive discussions about Alpha's status and "first", and your case was rejected on several occassions. The same ole rhetoric about alpha having grad chapters so it not a college org, it has honorary members some of who didn't attend college, is Alpha a prototype, was Ethel influnced by her husband, etc. There's nothing new here, again please review prior discussion<b>s</b> and perhpas you will understand why the current article has been approved by the general wikipedia community and why the Admin has chosen to not involed other editors in this unnecessary exercise.

<p>No one is arguing that APHIA is a college org, but what shouldn't be argued is that it is more than a college org. Many caucasian fraternities don't do anything after college (no honoraries or grad chapters). Thus they are simply.... a college org. I am not making a case. I'm discussing and clarifying. I have yet to find it on the AKA website that they were influenced by Alpha's in their creation. In fact, I only see it on Mr. Mason's website (whom is an Alpha). He states that there is a lot of research confirming that there was an influence. This influence though is hard to find. It's honestly as proveable as Sigma Pi Phi influencing the creation of Alpha Phi Alpha. I honestly never received any notice of any banning. Perhaps you are confused. 172.190.222.79 04:40, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many university do more than educate, they are research centers and teaching centers, etc. that doesn't take away the fact they are there to primarily to educate students. You say "many caucasion", that's not all and Alpha did not invent the idea of a graduate chapter, plus the article indicates when the first grad chapter was created, so any reader can determine (not even determine) it clearly states there are graduates chapters. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> (<a href="../../../c/c/s/User_talk%7ECcson_5c93.html" title="User talk:Ccson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccson_3ce0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccson">contribs</a>) 16:15, 23 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>
