<p>Now, I hate to be a bother about this. But if The Lost Podcast with Jay and Jack doesnt meet A7, you my friend have a lot of AfDs to create. Under theCategory: Audio podcasts you may find one or two more podcasts that are 'not notable enough for an encylopedia.' personally, i feel if they're published they're notable enough, hence why someone created The Infobox for Podcasts. Just thought I'd let you know, cheers! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon">Ganfon</a> 02:22, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would appreciate it if you reigned in the sarcasm. A7 is a speedy deletion criteria, and does not require me to create an afd. I will review the other podcasts you have suggested. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 02:50, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please look at the history of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Aqueduct_32f6.html" title="Template:Infobox Aqueduct">Template:Infobox_Aqueduct</a>. I created this and it worked. Then, with the history claiming to be me, it got filled with "top-forty" junk, causing everything I wrote, that used that template, to put that junk on the screen. I never put that junk into the template, yet the history says that I did. This is NotGood(tm). --<a href="../../../l/y/m/User%7ELymanSchool_162b.html" title="User:LymanSchool">LymanSchool</a> 01:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm really, really confused about what you're saying. It looks fine to me. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 19:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's <b>GONE!</b> There was (left in the history), a large amount of text from some top-forty (Casey Casum) listings that had been pre-pended to the template. This was <b>real</b> because it positively screwed up everything that used the aqueduct template. Each of the articles ended up with the erroneous top-forty listing at its beginning! Of course, I reverted the template back to its last working version. However, the history with its corrupt text in the beginning remained. When I reviewed the history, it looked as though I was the one, which added the text, which was not true. This is what I complained about. Now there is no bad text in the history, and no evidence that anything bad happened. It's positively weird!! --<a href="../../../l/y/m/User%7ELymanSchool_162b.html" title="User:LymanSchool">LymanSchool</a> 13:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article, Reel Horror Podcast, was deleted as a failure of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A7, which specifically states that an article must assert the notability of its subject.

<p>Alphachimp, I understand that deletion of this site was speedy due to the fact that it was not notable or something or another. I was wondering if there is a guideline for wikipedia that would list the rules for the inclusion of podcasts. I would think that a podcast that receives a substantial number of hits would qualify as notable. I can understand that the bio on the page delated was "not notable" enough for inclusion but this show like other podcasts (i.e., pacificcoasthellway, keith and the girl, shadow falls) are notable. Does a podcast need to include a print media reference to be substantiated?</p>
<p>Basically . . . the word "notable" is a little vauge and I was wondering if you could expand on it?</p>
<p>Thank you in advace, --Laetus007 01:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The deletion was not for the lack of notability. It was for the lack of an assertion of notability (if you had made an assertion, I would have nominated it for deletion). <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A7 says that you just need to claim that it is notable. That said, I am willing to restore the article if you can claim notability for me.

<p>I know as a general rule one must have 500 mainspace edits to qualify to use AWB, however I would like to ask for reconsideration -- I have over 1200 total edits (of which 315 are in the mainspace) over a period of two years. As my edit stats show, I prefer to discuss via talk before making changes, and often let others craft consensus-driven changes instead of jumping in myself (easier to remain objective).

<p>Alphachimp</p>
<p>I really don't think this matter has been given proper consideration. My understanding is that the reason for deletion is that the arguments for retention were not strong enough. However, Len from Jawbone ("Nobbyknees" I believe) and others made some excellent comments and arguments and pointed you in the direction of several notable sources that have mentioned Jawbone. Apparently, however, sources such as the British Broadcasting Corporation and one of the largest computer publishers in the world don't meet your criteria of what is a notable source. It would be hard to find one more notable that the BBC...</p>
<p>My point is that YOU did not properly answer these arguments, other than refer people back to the guidelines, without specifically stating why their arguments were not valid. How can this be democratic. It reinforces the commonly held view that you had already made your mind up to delete before the debate.</p>
<p>Forgive me, but your consideration of this issue has a decidely superiority-complex feel about it. YOU apparently are the sole arbiter and essentially, if an article does not meet your criteria, it is canned. Your user name in itself presumably is intended to represent the fact that you are the sole arbiter, which is fine if that is what floats your boat, but don't get upset if people comment regarding the name.</p>
<p>I assumed Wikipedia existed to increase the knowledge base, and encourage real people to contribute regarding current issues and activities, such as podcasting,however if the policy is to only include articles that YOU decide are notable, surely that will diminish the knowledge and take us down a rather Fascist way of viewing knowledge.</p>
<p>I urge you to reconsider. Waynefromtheuk 14:16, 11 December 2006 (UTC)Waynefromtheuk</p>

<dd>I'm not quite sure how you intend for me to respond to this one. You're accusing me of being a fascist, not properly answering questions, and having a superiority complex. You go on to attack my username. After all that, you "urge me to reconsider". Wow, that was one heck of a persuasive argument. You say that there is a "commonly held view that you had already made your mind up to delete before the debate". Um........yes. I nominated the article for deletion. Hence, I argue for my point. I'm not really sure how much more clear I can be.</dd>
<dd>If you wish to contribute productively to wikipedia, try doing something other than just attacking a user. You'll find it's a lot more rewarding and productive, and does far more to benefit society.

<p>I fail to see how removing Jawbone helps the users of Wikipedia. For example, users might want to search for information on a very popular and notable (quoted multiple times in other well knwon media sources, like the BBC) podcast, but your actions have denied them that facility.</p>
<p>OK, attacking your name was wrong, and I apologise, but, as for the Fascist comment, read this, from Wikipedia. If the cap fits...; <i>"The dictatorship of Adolf Hitler largely suppressed freedom of the press through Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry. As the Ministry's name implies, propaganda did not carry the negative connotations that it does today (or did in the Allied countries); how-to manuals were openly distributed by that same ministry explaining the craft of effective propaganda. The Ministry also acted as a central control-point for all media, issuing orders as to what stories could be run and what stories would be suppressed".</i></p>
<p>I personally think that supressing information on the basis of what you believe is right is a very bad idea and I am frankly amazed that there is no-one in Wikipedia's management and editorial control process agreed to this deletion when the person arguing for deletion failed to respond properly to the valid arguments/defences.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that you have again failed to do this. No doubt you will say there is no point now that you have got the result you intended.</p>
<p>It is worth quoting again from Wikipedia's entry on "encyclopedia", which is part of the sites tagline "The Free Encyclopedia";</p>
<p><i>"An encyclopedia, encyclopaedia or (archaically) encyclopædia,[1] is a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge"</i></p>
<p>Clearly "all branches of knowledge" are not included.Waynefromtheuk 23:25, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that an encyclopedia contains information about all branches of knowledge does not mean that that encyclopedia contains information about all things. In fact, one of the marks of a good encyclopedia is that it is able to rationally decide one those things that are sufficiently notable (I doubt you're concerned about my dog, but if wikipedia is to be truly exhaustive, he should be included as well). Wikipedia is a user-driven collaboration. It is unique in the sense that nearly all decisions and effort are contributed by volunteers working without compensation (such as me--consider that before calling me fascist).</dd>
<dd>I encourage you to express yourself through your blog, your podcast, or any other written or oral means. It's certainly great that our society finds outlets to express themselves. Unfortunately, not all of these outlets (like most podcasts), are sufficiently notable to merit inclusion in Wikipedia. That doesn't preclude their notability later on, but, at least right now, they don't meet our standards. The outcome of the AfD discussion, whether one agrees with it or not, was endorsed by wikipedia "management". I'm not really sure what you and Len are hoping to achieve by going after me on the Jawbone site and here. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 01:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to clarify, I have not spoken to Len and in fact believe he would not support my stance as he probably feels that being in Wikipedia or not will not greatly affect his life, though I think Wikipedia is less worthy as a result.

<p>Concerning AWB, I stopped that line of editing as soon as I received the first message to my talk page.

I learn from trial and error very quickly, so this won't happen again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About my AWB request</span></h2>
<p>Hi Alphachimp, I had made a request for AWB and followed closely the results and thought I was approved. Yet, after having tried and failed to install the file (I do have net framework 2), I am not sure if I was indeed approved. Here is the edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAutoWikiBrowser%2FCheckPage&amp;diff=91610156&amp;oldid=91609628" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAutoWikiBrowser%2FCheckPage&amp;diff=91610156&amp;oldid=91609628" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but there are 5 names crossed out and your comment is <i>3 approved, 1 denied</i>. Could it be you forgot me? Should I apply again? <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> 00:21, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are approved. I screwed up a few approvals by adding a space after the username, but I don't appear to have done that for you. Check out <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_CheckPage_526f.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage">Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage</a>. My assumption is that this has something to do with the failed AWB installation. Even if you're not approved, AWB will still install. It simply checks after each time you log in. If your name is not approved, AWB won't edit. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><i>Alphachimp</i></a> 06:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I signed up with the name TheWhiteAfrican, which you promptly blocked indefinitely. You even restricted my talk page, which is a very irrational thing to do considering that you didn't even provide me with a reason for blocking my account. After reading through the username terms, I still cannot see how it oversteps the username rules. The only reason how it might've been confused, is because you thought it was offensive towareds a racial group? But have you considered that since I am white, yet from africa, the username could have been intended as a personal statement. You have to be pretty twisted to relate the name "TheWhiteAfrican" in any way with some white segregation nonsense. So either provide me with a proper reason why my username should be blocked, or give it back to me. The administrators are here to make wikipedia better, not to abuse their administrative rights and restrict whoever they want to. EternalZenith 20:59, 24 December 2006 (UTC)EternalZenith</p>

<dd>You were blocked because your name implied <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>, which could be offensive to some editors. Another editor reported your account as offensive on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, so the judgment was not simply mine. Your talk page was not protected (if it was, something would be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User_talk:TheWhiteAfrican" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User_talk:TheWhiteAfrican" rel="nofollow">this log</a>), so I have no idea what you're talking about.

<p>I reverted multiple forms of vandalism on this page to only find that it has been vandalized twice since I had done so (reverted once by you and another by me). I don't live there (or have ever been there), but for a town of only 9,000, it sure gets a lot of vandalism.</p>
<p>I'm curious as to why it recieves so much vadalism.... I've been wondering if its a group of friends or just one or two people because the vandalism is pretty similar and its usually in the "Notable Residents".

<dd>I'd rather not semi-protect the page this early, but I do agree that the short-term trend of vandalism is a bit alarming. I'm guessing that you're right. It's probably a group of several schoolchildren determined to vandalize the article. I'd suggest watchlisting the article (I only caught it because I was watching the recent changes feed) and reporting/reverting/proposing for protection on <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> (or here, I guess).

<dd>People are very quick to forget that much of what is done around this site is done by people who actively choose to give up article editing in favor of keeping the site running so others can edit articles. "[A]ccounts that do nothing to contribute to our articles" does not specify "except the ones doing all the thankless jobs that keep them too busy to edit articles, like being Board members, or developers, or arbitrators, or a hundred other things"; it paints everyone who isn't an article contributor with the same brush. It's very disheartening to see yourself disparaged in this way, and it happens far too often. The jobs we non-article-editors do are thankless enough without having others put us down for making the choice to do them instead of spellchecking <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicks.html" title="Vicks">VapoRub</a>. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 05:32, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had looked over some of his previous edits and he seems to be fond of making jokes about bodily functions. Also, that combined with the sick image vandalism that had just been added to the Ford article, regarding the same body area, (I am not accusing him of that vandalism), seemed to indicated that he was making a joke about that. That combined with the fact that he kept adding the content I would call that vandalism. Considering the profile of the Ford article and the number of people around the world who are probably coming to wikipedia for information about Ford, I think it is not an overreaction. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 07:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jawbone deletion appeal</span></h2>
<p>It was very disappointing that the deletion was endorsed without anyone responding to a very valid point about the notability or not of a top 20 newsppaper in the USA. The whole process appeared to be a waste of time as no-one at Wikipedia seemed interested in objectivity and, to reinforce the view that this was a pre-ordained deletion based on factors other than notability, the old "insult the objectors" trick was deployed, calling people "Meatpuppets", rather than responding to valid arguments.</p>
<p>Very sad. And rather indicative of the tactics deployed in the early 30's to quell dissent.</p>
<p>Waynefromtheuk 23:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I, on the other hand, was extremely pleased with the fair and reasonable decision made in response to the overwhelming community consensus supporting the deletion decision. It's truly a proud day to be a Wikipedian. Again, I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to achieve with posting here. Perhaps you could inform me. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp.</b></span></a> 23:38, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Community" presumably means fellow Wikipedians? I don't think a single person outside of your Wikipedia world could describe this process as being fair and reasonable, unless your Wiki Dictionary includes in that description ignoring clear evidence of notability, ignoring fair questions and insulting those who make arguments without dealing with their points.</p>
<p>What am i achieving? Nothing probably because you just don't get it, but my conscience will be clear. A proud day to be a Wikipedian? Do you have any idea how Orwellian that sounds?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot requests</span></h2>
<p>How do you request your bot to do commands. I posted something similar at <a href="../../../r/f/b/WP%7ERFBOT_2557.html" title="WP:RFBOT">WP:RFBOT</a>, but I will explain again for clarity. As per a new changeover of templates, I want my bot to replace NYCS templates with a new universal template. For example, if a template reads {{NYCS 7}}, then I want my bot to replace it with {{NYCS service|7}}. If the template reads {{NYCS 7 rush}}, then I want my bot to replace it with {{NYCS service|7|&lt;7&gt;}}. If {{NYCS time}} follows, for example: {{NYCS 5}} followed by {{NYCS time|234}}, then I want my bot to replace it with {{NYCS service|5||234}}. If a rush template comes before {{NYCS time}}, for example: {{NYCS 7 rush}} followed by {{NYCS time|1a2a3c}}, then I want my bot to replace it with {{NYCS service|7|&lt;7&gt;|1a2a3c}}. Also, for the shuttle services, I want my bot to replace {{NYCS S 42nd}} with {{NYCS service|S - 42nd Street Shuttle|S}}, {{NYCS S Franklin}} with {{NYCS service|S - Franklin Avenue Shuttle|S}}, and {{NYCS S Rockaway}} with {{NYCS service|S - Rockaway Park Shuttle|S}}. So how do I do this? --<a href="../../../i/m/d/User%7EImdanumber1_f130.html" title="User:Imdanumber1"><font color="green"><b>Imdanumber</b></font><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></a> <small>( <a href="../../../i/m/d/User_talk%7EImdanumber1_9f8f.html" title="User talk:Imdanumber1">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Imdanumber1_7c24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Imdanumber1">contribs</a>)</small> 00:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, the first two were relatively simple.

That <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_Expression_9de7.html" title="Regular Expression">regex</a> should do it. Shoot me an email and I'll send you the AWB *.xml file. The last 2 need more clarification. I don't think that the last task is possible (automatically), because it requires a huge amount of name changing (e.g. S Franklin to S - Franklin Avenue Shuttle). It might just be easier for you to do that by hand. Still, show me some examples in context. As for #3, I'd need to see an example in context. I really don't understand what you're saying.</dd>

<p>Hi Alphachimp. Many thanks for considering the restoration of the pipesdrums Magazine submission. pipesdrums is the evolution of the 20-year-old Piper &amp; Drummer print magazine that had served the world competing piping and drumming community of approximately 75,000, according to a recent estimate conducted by the National Piping Centre in Glasgow, Scotland. Piper &amp; Drummer Online (the previous name of pipesdrums) is cited as a source in numerous scholarly works, including Dr. William Donaldson's seminal work, The Highland Pipe and Scottish Society. The online magazine is read by the world piping and drumming community, and it is the largest online repository in the world on articles on piping and drumming. The magazine has been emulated by more recent publications, including thre aforementioned National Piping Centre's "Piping Today" and the Eastern United States Pipe Band Association's "Voice." Pipesdrums has also been ongoing fodder for stories in, among other media outlets, BBC Radio Scotland, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scotsman_5f9c.html" title="The Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>, and the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Herald_5f6e.html" title="Glasgow Herald">Glasgow Herald</a>. newspaper Thanks again. --74.99.242.222 22:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)--Aberthoff 00:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ben Jackson (electronic sports player) on deletion review</span></h2>
<p>An editor has asked for a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Ben_Jackson_.28electronic_sports_player.29" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jackson_%28electronic_sports_player%29_d1cf.html" title="Ben Jackson (electronic sports player)">Ben Jackson (electronic sports player)</a>.

<p>Thanks for your response, but I was wondering how Ben Jackson fails WP:BIO when other people who receive considerably less coverage such as Daigo Umehara, <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Budde_5cee.html" title="Kai Budde">Kai Budde</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Buehler_90dd.html" title="Randy Buehler">Randy Buehler</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Williams_%28card_player%29_98ff.html" title="David Williams (card player)">David Williams (card player)</a> are kept. Also a prime example of a person who was kept based on receiving coverage from "multiple non-trivial independent sources" is <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Hoang_ba9c.html" title="Ken Hoang">Ken Hoang</a> see his <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ken_Hoang_d509.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ken Hoang">AfD</a>.

Melee</a> (a game that is considerably less popular than <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a>). In fact this page became so famous that the article itself was cited in a news article: <a href="http://www.thephoenix.com/Article.aspx?id=28078&amp;page=5" class="external free" title="http://www.thephoenix.com/Article.aspx?id=28078&amp;page=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.thephoenix.com/Article.aspx?id=28078&amp;page=5</a></p>

<dd>I'd encourage you to nominate any other of those articles for deletion. There seem to be some fairly prime targets. As for this article, my decision was made based on the obvious consensus of the other editors involved in the discussion. It doesn't seem unreasonable to evaluate the opinions of 6 editors over a single, albeit vocal minority. All of that doesn't even respond to your arguments...but a more appropriate place to respond would probably be the DRV you've decided to bring against me. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp.</b></span></a> 07:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great. As I said, debates differ and administrative decisions differ. There aren't any two scenarios that can be honestly and fairly compared and said to establish a substantive basis for such a decision. As for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, it seems somewhat idiotic to respond here with an active DRV against my decision. CPL (I believe it's CPL, correct me if I'm wrong) is not a fully professional league, whatever they might say (yes, I know what it stands for). Ben Jackson is not "widely recognized", nor is his "professional sport". Further, most members of his team are not worthy of articles. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp.</b></span></a> 07:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for another response esp with a DRV going, but you told me to correct you if you are wrong. CPL is a fully recognized and the oldest professional and technically the largest electronic sports league. However they have nothing to do with this DRV. Ben Jackson is involved with MLG not CPL. CPL dropped video games in 2005 since they decided to focus entirely on computer gaming (Counter-strike, Painkiller, Quake, etc.) Today MLG is the largest and professional recognized video gaming league dedicated to video games only. You are fully correct in the fact that the other members of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Carbon_0255.html" title="Team Carbon">Team Carbon</a> are not notable enough to have their own articles since they have had no notable achievements individually. However, Ben Jackson unlike his team members, has had notable achievements outside of his team performance. He is currently the national (unofficially world) champion of both the 2005 and 2006 season of MLG Halo 2 FFA/1v1 (starts out as a Free-For-All tournament and then the top finishers play 1v1 for best individual player). So I ask you again, with this new information do you not agree that he merits his own article? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 07:53, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Redirects are really easy to do. Use the #R link at the top of the edit window. You can easily view the redirects for each article by clicking "What links here" at the left side of the screen. I hope that helps.

<p>Hi there. I just found out there is an updated user box called the <i>"Bisexuality series"</i>.

<p>A local historian (Kirk) had been slowly putting together an historic sketch of East New Market, Maryland on wikipedia. Being able to use Wikipedia to put his work online and save it for posterity gave him motivation despite his many challenges. He is ill and has limited means. He has to borrow computer time from friends and the local library. He wanted to share what he knows before it is lost to history. On December 26, you deleted everything he was working on. A previous wiki editor added links to Massachusetts (confused MD with MA). I edited these MA links and some other errors, but was letting him work on the article as he was able. The deletion was very disconcerting for him and he likely will not continue his work.
