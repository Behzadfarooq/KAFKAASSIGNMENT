<h2><span class="mw-headline">Help!</span></h2>
<p>Someone please remind me of why I volunteer free time helping keep this site clean. I've been getting raked over the damned coals by two users who are screaming because I deleted their articles...which had no text. Just taxoboxes. One now has (drum roll, please) a single sentence. More time has been spent on my talk page by these two than on the articles. I made myself a promise: Add at least one new article a week, clean up at least one article per day. Been doing exactly that; I've had <i>two</i> "Did You Know?" mentions in the past week. Anyway, just venting. Might take another brief wikivacation soon. Quietly and with no drama. &#160;:) - Lucky 6.9 07:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you, O Chimp. You are wise and I am just plain pooped. Pleased to say that one of the "taxoboxes" has returned as a nice short article. If I sign on tomorrow, I'll likely do some editing instead of NPP. 'Night! - Lucky 6.9 07:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing like being called "niggah" from the guy that invented the flux capacitor, eh? &#160;:)) Another one tagged and bagged before shutdown! Woo-hoo! - Lucky 6.9 07:27, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, nice. Yes, we know we're doing our jobs when that happens! I look at it as a badge of honor, but you'd think the knuckle-dragging nimrod would have had the decency to spell my user name correctly! Thanks for watching my back. - Lucky 6.9 07:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Been meaning to do that...thanks for the tip! My pages look a little bit bland and that's a great way to stay off NPP. By the way, I just got another ration of you-know-what. Someone tagged it, I bagged it, I got screamed at by a user with three prior edits. Some fun! - Lucky 6.9 07:39, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was...? I must be losing my mind; I din't know I'd done any monobook edits beyond some I'd done at other wikis. Oy. - Lucky 6.9 07:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On an AFD page, you said to me <i>I'm really troubled by the idea of "documenting the nonsense". If the article is nonsense, as you suggest, wouldn't it be appropriate to just WP:CSD:G1 it and move on?</i> I reply here, since that discussion is closed, and I didn't see it before.</p>
<p>We have no business judging what is nonsense. It's my <i>opinion</i> that the theory underlying the article was nonsense. That is no reason not to discuss neutrally the facts of the matter. A neutral discussion should let others, who may not be sure because of spotty information, see that it is nonsense as well. In that, it serves a useful purpose. In fact, I was in large part led to that opinion by reading the article, though I had heard mentions of the theory before.</p>
<p>An analogy if I may, it is my opinion that the claims of the Swift Vets regarding John Kerry's Bronze Star are also sheer nonsense. That's no reason to avoid an article on the topic, as it was notable. The relevant article neutrally lays out the claims and the evidence. I think it would lead any reasonable reader to their own conclusion that the Swift Vet claims were highly suspect in that matter. In that it serves a useful purpose, by providing a central and neutral repository of information.</p>
<p>The key question is whether a topic is notable. In my opinion the "controlled demolition" hypothesis is, in that a great many people seem to believe it as evidenced by the article sources.</p>

<dd>If I felt the article was complete patent nonsense (CSD G1), I would have deleted it in the middle of the AfD and we would be rid of it. That statement was a bit of an exaggeration. As for the article, it's true that we have a place in documenting phenomena and widespread opinions, but this crackpot theory was not verifiable, not significant... (you can read the pages and pages of arguments in the AfD, I didn't particularly feel like involving myself then, and I don't feel like it now).</dd>

<dd>I don't care then or now about that article either. I only responded out of courtesy, since my position "troubled" you. You've either totally misunderstood or misrepresented my point.

See how far you get with any of those. Note here that your expressed concern about my position was <i>nonsense</i> of the underlying theory, not on anything else. At any rate, I don't care to debate you. But, if you don't welcome a reply, and you seemed rather irritated by getting one, then don't comment on me in the first place. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 06:07, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I noticed you are changing the templates to by-date versions, I think it would be nice to integrate this directly into AWB, as these templates are very common, I have done this with the other by-date templates (part of the "auto tag" option), and it does stop the backlog building up quite well. Could you let me know what regexes you are using? thanks. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 09:56, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hello! I see that you received approval for this bot activity <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Alphachimpbot8_92ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Alphachimpbot8">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Alphachimpbot8</a>. It would have been nice if you'd initiated a discussion at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template_talk%7EMerge_e00f.html" title="Template talk:Merge">Template talk:Merge</a> (a far more visible forum, and one in which this has general idea has been discussed in the past).</p>
<p>I don't object to the concept of tidying the categories, but established consensus strongly favors keeping these templates as small as possible. (Unlike cleanup tags, they aren't intended to imply that something is wrong with the article). There's no need to double the template's size by including the date there.</p>
<p>Also, some of the specific design elements warrant discussion. You <b>really</b> should have left the article title as the first parameter. Pushing it to the second position accomplishes nothing other than significantly increasing the likelihood of accidental misuse.</p>
<p>I understand the logic behind pushing the "discuss" parameter to the third position (given the fact that it's optional, much newer, and used much less commonly), but a more practical option is to add the date link to the existing templates as an optional named parameter ("date"). This would allow people to continue using the same templates with the same syntax (with the addition of the "date" parameter if/when they become familiar with it). Your bot could then append the date when it isn't manually inserted. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 20:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your comments. I started off very slowly, posted in all the obvious forums I knew for feedback, and received nothing other than strong support.

<dd>I'll change the templates, but only after significant discussion and consensus occurs.

<dd>I understand, and I realize that you've acted in good faith.

That's where these discussions normally occur, and various people who have helped to develop the merger tag system (including me) watch the page.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to wait for comments on my setup, but I don't see why anyone would object (given the fact that it provides identical functionality while maintaining the existing templates and syntax in a backwardly compatible manner). In fact, if the entire concept were to be rejected by the community, the templates could be reverted without even re-editing the articles. The "date" parameter would simply do nothing.</dd>

<dd>I'd prefer you respond on my talk page. As I said before, I really did everything in my power to attempt to generate discussion before making the edits. My new templates were patterned <b>directly</b> off of {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-date_744c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-date">Cleanup-date</a>}}, which we use in the cleanup category. It seemed only reasonable to extend the same logic to the merge templates. You've got to realize that I'm only trying to help out here. It's a bit frustrating to receive such a negative response when I'm doing something that's obviously in good faith.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm not accusing you of acting in bad faith. You had a good idea, but there's a better way to implement it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In general, it's vastly preferable to maintain long-standing template syntax. ({{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-date_744c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-date">Cleanup-date</a>}} was designed in such a manner that using it in the same fashion as {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} still mostly worked.) The merger tags have been around for years, so changing the syntax in a manner that breaks the old format is not the wisest course of action.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, the "date" functionality has been integrated into {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} as an optional parameter, and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-date_744c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-date">cleanup-date</a>}} is to be deprecated whenever someone gets around to it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It should be noted that in over 8500 edits with the bot, yours was the only negative comment I received. Everyone else was either ambivalent or appreciative. I was somewhat surprised to receive that response. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="OrangeRed">alpha</font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp">(talk)</a></sup> 01:00, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right now is fine by me. As I said, there's no possible harm.

You wouldn't need to deploy the bot again, as it won't be changing anything that affects the existing functionality.)</dd>

<dd>To be clear, this is the appropriate syntax: {{merge|Other article|date=September 2006}}</dd>
<dd>If the "discuss" parameter is present, it should look like this: {{merge|Other article|Talk:Discussion location|date=September 2006}}</dd>
<dd>No matter what, the bot simply needs to append <b>|date=September 2006</b> immediately before the closing curly brackets. And of course, this will work with {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}}.</dd>

<p>When you have a moment, can you take a look at this user? His entire edit history, going back about a week, is made up of posting linkspam (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stevend06" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stevend06" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stevend06</a>). I have just spent the last little while reverting or removing all of his edits, but he needs a very serious warning or block to discourage a repeat of this. A fellow editor, named WesleyDodds, had to revert his edits four times over the course of 3 or 4 days, as Steven kept reinserting the deleted spam in the same article. He is, simply put, a menace. Thanks, as always, for your time and attention. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 04:23, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I've posted a warning on his talk. It wouldn't be fair for me to block him, given that nobody has formally warned him. In the future, once you've discovered a pattern such as this, warn the user (I find {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam_0bb2.html" title="Template:Spam">spam</a>}} -&gt; {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam4_3560.html" title="Template:Spam4">spam4</a>}} helpful). If the pattern persists after the warnings, just post on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Let me know (or AIV) if you have any further problems with the user.

<p>'01:40, 1 October 2006 Alphachimp (Talk | contribs) deleted "Wentworthville Tamil Study Centre" (WP:CSD A7: "article is about a web site, blog, online forum, webcomic, podcast, or similar web content that does not assert the importance or historical significance of its subject")'</p>
<p>For you put <b>Wentworthville Tamil Study Centre</b> for deletion. Of course the article needed a brushing up which I don't disagree, it didn't cite its sources and it did not not have enough information. I am a begginer as a wikipedia user and I would just like to ask if you could put the article just the way it was so I can edit some things and not some but major stuff. Also this school is a real school. I have no doubt about that and it is not about a web site, blog, online forum, webcomic, podcast, or similar web content. It is not about web content and nowhere close. It is a real school commencing on the weekend and also I do agree that the article did not assert the importance or historical significance of its subject but all that will be changed. I hope it is possible for you to do that. Also how come it has been deleted so quickly in less than five days? Thanks for reading my comment and I hope all goes well. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPendotigers_80bb.html" title="User:Pendotigers">Pendotigers</a> 10:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding this 48 hour block. I'm curious what it takes to get a permanent block. This IP consistently vandalizes pages, wasting the time of others. The sheer volume of vandalism incidents on the talk page plus a quick review of "contributions" shows constant vandalism. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 14:53, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True, there has been a ton of vandalism. Indefinitely blocking an IP address requires serious consideration of the possible impact and ramifications of such a decision. We've got to worry about collateral damage, whether the IP is shared, or static, etc. It's probably not a decision we would make (off the top of my head I only know of 3 IPs that are blocked indef for vandalism). Generally we increment blocks. 24 hours was the first. Expect the next to be 1 week, then a month, then 6 months, and so on and so forth. Just keep reporting the user. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 15:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about that. I guess I should read up more on this kind of thing. I'm sure you will understand that I was trying to make my article has correct as I possibly could. I originally named the page "Zhou Tong (Shaolin Abbot)", but I've only find one source that says he was an abbot. The other 99% states he was just a monk. I therefore totally rewrote the article and changed its heading. What is the proper way of "renaming" or "moving" a page? Next time I will know how to do it the correct way. Please post the info on my user page. Thanks again and sorry for the trouble.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Firstly, thanks for being there.</p>
<p>Second, I'm a little confused. I couldn't find out how to create a new article so I tried going down the route of getting Wiki to create one for me by giving it a Search it couldn't find 'Cordwangler' presuming that I'd be able to change the articles name once created.</p>
<p>Mistake! Sorry! Seems my error was deleted csd a7 so you must have dealt with idiots like me before.</p>
<p>I then create a correctly named article through Wiki's How to Create an Article and pasted and save my article in it. All went well briefly then it was deleted csd g11. SPAM!!! I hate the stuff - waste precious hours ridding my poor computer of it so I'm dreadfully sorry if that's what it looked as if I was doing.</p>
<p>My article is genuine. Poor guy suffers from a very common name but is very real - he's spent 30 years making music mainly for kids has recorded over 30 albums with 3 Gold and one Platinum Disk to his name.</p>
<p>I just did a recreate and it seems the article is back.</p>
<p>If not would you please have a look at it and tell me what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<dd>At least for me, there's a lot between a 48 hour and an indefinite. It's quite possible that blocking an IP address will cause a large amount of collateral damage. We generally increment the blocks steadily, but never actually permanently block.

<dd>The fact that he has been blocked should be in some way indicative of the potential quality of his edits. Blocking is not a preventative measure, it's a way of protecting our encyclopedia from damage in progress. True, we increment the blocks, but it's not appropriate to indef an IP in the overwhelming majority of circumstances.

<dd>Right. I don't have the capability to sort into the actual month of tagging. The intention in sorting into cleanup-by-month september was that anyone who wanted to could sort them in later on.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My RfA</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your support in my RfA. I really appreciate it. I think I shall devote my initial use of the tools to new page patrol per your kind invitation. I had a question about it though. What is in greater need in NPP--quick un-tagged deletion of obvious CSD violators, or closing the backlog of other speedy-tagged articles?

<dd>I prefer quick untagged deletion. Two reasons: You don't have to check the page history (although it helps to check what links here) and you don't get any frivilous requests. It's usually very easy to spot the vanity, nonsense, and spam. You make a few enemies, but you're less likely to make disastrous errors. Honestly, you'd be shocked by the number of articles our New Page Patrollers miss on a daily basis. Anyway, that's my opinion. I'd encourage you to copy VoA's admin monobook (it's my monobook actually). It might help a bit.

<p>Hi--I received a note about editing/vandalising the American Civil War page. Iad never even visited that page, let alone edited or vandalised it. I take the accuracy and reputation of Wikipedia very seriously, so the kind of juvenile editing done on that page offends me. However, it was not me. Please check your sources again. Thanks!</p>
<p><br />

<p>I just noticed that the edit incorrectly blamed on me to the American Civil War page was dated July 27, 2006. This is actually impossible. I killed my PowerBook (by spilling a glass of water on it) on April 25, 2006, and it sat dead and unused on a shelf until September 2006 (when I could spare the $1,346 to get it fixed). It wasn't even functioning on the date in question, so obviously it was not used to edit wikipedia.</p>

<p>McGuinness' page was unprotected, though I don't understand why beyond that it's been protected for a while. The dispute still has not been resolved and both sides have neither come to a compromise nor agreement. In additon there's never been a binding judgment on the situation. Should the page be reprotected because as of right now there is no real binding reason to not post the name as a content dispute, due to lack of judgment. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 07:47, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I'm writing on behalf of Camden School for Girls, London. I have recently been notified of some vandalism to the schools entry on this website. We are now concerned that this may have been done internally (perhaps one of our students). Is there any way of finding out who did it (i.e. user name and/or IP address) - The IP address may give us a clue since our school only uses one external address. Also is there a way of making the schools entry as permanently protected so that these things don't happen again? Many thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Hey Alphachimp! I was wondering if you might start personalising your edit summaries a bit when protecting and unprotecting pages to various degrees. I saw that you protected <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cory_Lidle_0a1a.html" title="Cory Lidle">Cory Lidle</a> from being moved, but I couldn't initially tell what was being protected and I actually went to put the semi-protection template on the page before I saw what was being protected. A lot of admins don't use descriptive edit summaries, and I actually unprotected the move function that you reprotected because I misunderstood another admin's edit summary. It might actually just be me being a newish admin, but it seems a bit confusing when the thing that's being protected isn't specifically mentioned.

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, no problem at all. Many of the times, "heavy vandalism from multiple sources" works (this is the default in VoA's JS), but in the cases of articles like that (linked to from main, so I used move protection) I should probably be more descriptive. Hope that helps, I'll try a little bit harder in the future with that. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 19:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, I can't, at least at this juncture. It's not a "high use" template, so it does not qualify for our default full protect, and there has not been sufficient multi-source vandalism (not just one IP) vandalism to justify the protect.

<dd>Yeah. I know. My organization's proxy was blocking the proxy listing site, but I've blocked it (I blocked it earlier for trolling, but I changed it to indef after).

<p>Dear Alpahachimp,</p>
<p>The suppression of truth and the knowledge it provides cheats and defeats the purpose of Wikipedia.. Your removal of my external links on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrology" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrology</a> is unwarranted and totally lacks merit because you did not read all the external links. Fact my website www.bostonschoolofelectrolysis.com/index.php possess one commercial to an electrolysis manufacturer. However the sites listed below possess many commercials and HairFacts - electrolysis medical data and the Electrolysis discussion group is nothing less than over commercialized Google Ad Sense Blogs. At best the knowledge on some of these links are second rate in addition to the fact that 98% of the authors are uneducated non-licensed self proclaimed electrologists. The knowledge that I provide the public is free of charge and far exceeds most professional standards.</p>
<p>Alpahachimp the electrolysis profession has been invaded by uneducated non-licensed hacks claiming to be electrologists, these cutthroats lie, cheat and steal to get their way. However your removal of Americas best and most read Laser Thesis &amp; Dissertation does not make sense. I suggest you read it <a href="http://www.bostonschoolofelectrolysis.com/boston-electrolysis-2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bostonschoolofelectrolysis.com/boston-electrolysis-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bostonschoolofelectrolysis.com/boston-electrolysis-2.html</a>.</p>
<p>Your removal of my external links smacks of Fascist Book Burning and I bring your removal of my external links to the attention of to the executive council of Wikepedia because it apparent that you allow Internet thugs AKA uneducated non-licensed electrologists the privilege of posting their external links yet you have removed my links. Why?</p>
<p>Fact I suggest you visit my site and read my thesis and learn the truth of how my profession that invaded by thugs whose articles and knowledge of electrolysis mislead the public. However try reading my website and you will learn that I stand for for honesty, integrity and ethics.</p>
<p>HOWEVER PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU DID NOT REMOVE THESE BLATANT LINKS WITH BLATANT ADVERTISEMENTS</p>

<p>Hope you're doing alright despite all the recent trolling I see your in your talk history, Chimp. Thanks for all the AIV help, et cetera et cetera; maybe you could help me further sometime by helping me decipher how I'm doing these AWB regexes wrong. Regular expressions can be so infuriating.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bots and approvals</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to once again apologize for my comments on Betacommand's RfA. I'm uniquely aware that the reason you failed to join BAG was probably due to my weak opposition, and I've second guessed myself a number of times over that, including now that I'm wondering if you weren't the better candidate. When I was faced with the vote I wanted to play it safe and I also was still a little unsure, but I've always respected you. Alas, it seems that there is very little activity, but I'm working on a new voting policy for adding new members at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Approvals_group_b90f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Approvals group">Wikipedia talk:Bots/Approvals group</a>. Werdna volunteered and I gave a response similar to that which I'd give anyone: If you want to join BAG, just start commenting on requests for approvals. That's probably the best way to show everyone that you are capable of being a BAG member. In any case, you can always help out drafting the approvals group voting policy if you'd like. The reason I mention this is that once the procedure is ironed out and we go through another voting process, you'd probably make it, especially if you participate in the approvals process. All this assuming that you are still interested. I've looked at your comments and it seems to me that while you don't comment often you do seem to read the requests for approvals. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 00:58, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Notable people"</span></h2>
<p>Hi Alphachimp,</p>
<p>Thank you for your welcome on my first incursion in (English) Wikipedia. I am resorting for the first time to seek assistance from an experienced wikipedia guru in order to ask for counsel and, if appropriate, protection for a page. In the <b>Linares, Chile</b> article, someone added the following entry to the <b>Notable people born in Linares (city and province)</b> entry: "<i>Juan Carlos Enrique Soto, born 1959 in Linares, a child survivor of the Government overthrow of 1973 costing thousands of Chileans their lives</i>". Actually, nobody with this name is notable in Chile, even taking a great stretch of imagination. I respect the background and ordeal of the person of the reference and share the concern of the author of this entry to make this person's name known but I understand a list of notable people should be reserved for people who meet the wikipedia guidelines on this subject and be considered from a neutral point of view as well as based on verifiable information from reliable sources. Therefore, I removed the aforementioned entry.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help,</p>

<p>Just curious. You put 66.211.149.162 on a 1 week vandalism block. Why not longer? The contribution history and talk page indicates a single purpose vandalism account. This IP has NEVER made a single contribution that has NOT been tagged for vandalism, they have been repeatedly warned, and have received prior 1-week blocks. It seems apparent from the evidence that an additional 1-week block will only remove the blatant vandal for, well, 1 week. How often do we have to clean up after this vandal before a longer block. I understand the need for dealing with long-term blocks VERY conservatively, but I was curious if you could steer me to the policy that determines when one is made, and how this IP does not meet the requirements? --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 16:54, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First off, a "vandalism only account" can only refer to an actual account (with a username). We block usernames indefinetely, but we very, very, very rarely do that to an IP. We've got to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> that a block will have a desired effect. There may be people behind that IP (editing with usernames) that are contributing legitimately. Probably not, but maybe. Blocks are typically incremented 2-3 x higher than the last one. His longest prior block was 2 days, and his new one is 1 week. If he returns with vandalism, either myself or another sysop will increment the block steadily. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 17:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, well thanks. I don't like to dabble into WP's policies and politics, but I was curious about the edits. I'm a little sleep deprived so that may be the reason why I noticed the pattern and decided to follow the trail. For the most part the vandalism seems highly peculiar: changing words around or replacing words. I listed it on [[WP:RFI] and on a checkuser page or something of the sort. Anyhow, thanks for help. -- <a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESapphire_74f1.html" title="User:Sapphire">Sapphire</a> 05:01, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi I just recieved an editing warning. Im quite sure I did not edit under any of these headings, the only time i have used this site was for research to do a health project and the only other users of this computer are both over 60 and do nothing but check their e-mail and play pogo games. Do you have any idea how this confusing situation may have occurred or what I can do to ensure it does not happen again? mcbreal@aol.com</p>

<p>I created <a href="../../../w/e/s/Weston_Reservoir_911c.html" title="Weston Reservoir">Weston Reservoir</a> and quite a few other water system articles. An anonymous user (141.154.89.148) keeps making invalid changes to the MWRA overview section. The information presented may seem credible, but has no basis in fact. Further, <a href="../../../m/w/r/MWRA_c32b.html" title="MWRA">MWRA</a>’s system improvements were made with redundancy part of an engineered solution. The anonymous writer kept referring to the use of this redundancy as “emergency” and in one case “extreme emergency.” These editorial comments should not be part of an encyclopedic article. The anonymous writer does not bother to read the information I left, simply sets itself as some sort of expert, and continues to spew undocumented and in most cases completely invalid diatribe.</p>
<p>I reverted some of the previous edits, but I cannot spend too much time undoing the wrong information every day.

<dd>Full protection is not a tool for enforcing an "approved version" of a page. Instead, it's a technique to stop edit warring. You can check out <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROTECT_6d34.html" title="WP:PROTECT">WP:PROTECT</a> for more information.

<p>Dear Alpahchimp,</p>
<p>Regarding Andrea James AKA Pinnochio Of Hairfacts, Hairtell &amp; Tsroadmap</p>
<p>Compulsive lying by Andrea James on Wikipedia is an insult to honesty and her claim that she is graduate from the University if Chicago who majored in Latin and Greek is a cruel hoax, however her biggest whopper is her claim that she has a degree in English from the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>However Andrea James is big on calling people names and slandering them with lies however lets ask Andrea James to prove that she graduated from the University Of Chicago and produce her degree in English with a letter and copy of her Diploma from the University Of Chicago. Additionally her websites use profane language and questionable content with photographs not fit for children under 18 and thats what I call smut. However you should see her in action with with her personal attack on a professors children .[4] of which [5] - now removed - followed with Andrea James issuing a benign apology, though the apology includes further slander and attacks against them posted right on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>However Andrea James lets get back to the truth, stop your compulsive lying and prove what you claim and let see your degree in English from the University of Chicago.</p>

<dd>Eh...I'm not so sure. It's obviously your own judgment (and some sysops do it), but I'm against Full Protection of sysop userpages in most cases. In the last 50 edits, the majority of vandalism appears to be coming from anonymous or new editors. I'd suggest semi-protecting (but if that doesn't work, absolutely use full). Coincidentally, protection would also block bots from editing your page.</dd>

<dd>As one of the people that was heavily involved in that whole incident, what happened was that he created a page, which was deleted for notability, and subsequently became frustrated and started vandalizing. I added a quick note on his unblock notice. I didn't say so there, but after a long discussion with his uncle (see my note), IMHO it looks like it was a momentary loss of temper, and Scooby would probably be a good contributer.

<p>Alphachimpbot suggested a merge of "Simple Church" and "House Church". I replied on <a href="../../../h/o/u/Talk%7EHouse_church_3c54.html" title="Talk:House church">Talk:House_church</a>, please read and take into consideration. I would be against such a merger because the current difference in labeling reflects a difference in values. Oakiebsc 23:03, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd actually agree. Alphachimpbot doesn't actually make the merge tags, it just marks the merge tags into month specific categories. The great thing about wikipedia is that you can change anything...seriously. I'd go ahead and remove the tag.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My approval</span></h2>
<p>Hi! Thank you for my approval to use AWB. I have one question, that you might ignore as I really have a crappy computer filled with viruses and what-not: Did any one ever complain that AWB quits whenever it loads the first page, and suggests its changes?--<a href="../../../b/d/a/User%7EBdamokos_ad2c.html" title="User:Bdamokos">Dami</a> 11:18, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope, I have no such problem. AWB runs using internet explorer, so it's possibly a result of the difficulties with spyware in IE... I'd suggest reformatting if at all possible (or just running a free anti-spyware app like Spybot S+D). <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 23:50, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">24-hour block of User:204.138.9.6</span></h2>
<p>204.138.9.6 is a school IP address. As is customary in such situations, I suggest a much shorter block duration (perhaps three hours). In all likelihood, the responsible individual (probably a bored student) will have moved along by then, and we don't want to prevent other users from the Wellington County Roman Catholic School from editing.</p>
<p>After typing the above, I checked your block log and found that you're instituted a number of very long blocks of IP addresses known to belong to schools. Lacking familiarity with the specific circumstances, I'm not sure that I agree with this practice. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:13, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, Alphachimp, I strongly support your actions in this case and the others; I can see no productive edits from 204.138.9.6. Particularly given the ability to block IP only, this is an effective and appropriate measure. Most of these school IPs are sources of persistent long-term vandalism and do nothing but harm to the project. Any serious contributor at those schools can easily register a user account and avoid being blocked. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 16:18, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, I'm not familiar with the other cases' specific circumstances. I do know that 204.138.9.6 had never been blocked before (so there's no way to know whether a shorter block would be effective).</dd>
<dd>Given the fact that Alphachimp routinely blocks account creation, users of these IP addresses (including some blocked for nearly a year) <i>cannot</i> "easily register a user account." —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this really points to the two philosophies in dealing with educational IP vandalism. Some see it as a more minor problem and give shorter blocks. Others (myself included), give longer, incremented blocks. I've come on every day and seen the same IPs vandalizing over and over. It's true that the 3 hour blocks stop them, but the fact remains that the same kid is probably going to be back tomorrow morning or in 3 hours (which is typically evinced by the contribs). Are we only going to block him for 3 hours the next time? I'd say no. The next block should be longer (double, maybe).</dd>
<dd>As for that particular school, you're welcome to change the block if you want, but I noticed a long pattern of vandalism (check the talk page) for which no blocks had been issued. I didn't see any legitimate additions in my scan of the contributions. I try to make the block length commensurate to the history and severity of the vandalism. 24 hours is somewhat of a standard minimum length for me.</dd>
<dd>As for the long term blocks, those have only been for long term and severe offenders. Honestly, I think these blocks are significantly reducing the amount of school vandalism during the day.</dd>
<dd>Finally, as to the account creation block. I've never really thought about it. I always assumed that those users who had registered previously or at home would be contributing productively (and without appearing in the contributions).</dd>
<dd>Hope that helps. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 23:39, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate that this is a complicated matter (into which you've given a great deal of thought). There is no perfect solution to the very real problem of vandalism from school IP addresses. I certainly don't view this as minor, but I weigh it against the harm caused by blocking good editors who have done nothing wrong. Vandalism can be reverted, but prevented edits might be lost forever.</dd>
<dd>I would feel more comfortable with your long-term blocks if you would permit account creation. (In fact, I advocate such a setup for all AOL users.) Even if no productive anonymous edits have originated from a particular IP address in the past, it's likely that someone will attempt to create a legitimate account in the months ahead. Many people are able to access the Internet only from school, and I hate the thought of turning them away simply because one or more classmates misbehaved.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, few school vandals will bother to register usernames, and additional measures can be taken if and when they do. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 00:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That sounds just fine to me and I'll start doing it for shared IPs. Honestly, I've never allowed account creation before. I just always assumed it was bad. In your experience, do the vandals decide to create accounts to get around the block? My concern is that we wouldn't be able to ID the vandalism as coming from their particular educational IP (obviously checkuser could do it, but that'd be "fishing").</dd>
<dd>By the way, I really do share your opinion about discarding legit edits. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 01:23, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based upon my personal observations, it's fairly uncommon for anonymous vandals to circumvent blocks by registering accounts. (It's difficult to know for certain, but the pattern of vandalism seldom resumes.) It seems that vandals who care enough to register accounts generally do so in the first place. Anonymous vandals—especially school vandals—tend to be casual visitors who don't plan to stick around very long and aren't interested in jumping through hoops. At the first obstacle, they usually give up and find something else to do. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:46, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
