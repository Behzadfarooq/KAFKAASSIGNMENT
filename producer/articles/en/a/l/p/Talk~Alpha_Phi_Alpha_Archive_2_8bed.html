<h2><span class="mw-headline">Paper Bag Test</span></h2>
<p>You guys are probably smarter than me, I just can't figure this out: If this fraternity was founded to help black people (African Americans if you wish), then why would they have a test forbidding entry to anyone with a skin darker than a brown paper bag? Because I don't know what sorts of bags you guys see usually, but if I look at mine. I'd probably fail the test after a few days at the beach. Explanations?</p>

<dd>The supposed test grew out of a reactionary internal racism that exisited in black society for many years. Some say it is still out there. Basically, the closer to white you were, then supposedly you stood higher in "class". A darker skinned person was considered to be closer to the negative stereotypes that were in the popular culture thana light skinned person. There was even a Hudie Leadbetter (<a href="../../../l/e/a/Leadbelly.html" title="Leadbelly">Leadbelly</a>) song lyric about the attitude, "If you're brown, stick around, if you're black, get back, get back, get back," <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/?030303crbo_books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/?030303crbo_books" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<dd>The "paper bag test" was used by certain chapters, and there is no record that this was encouraged or condoned by the national organizationm. These chapters did not invent <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorism.html" title="Colorism">colorism</a>, however; they used personal, cultural and regional criteria in accepting inititates. This form of racism is probably not something the chapters are proud of today, but it was a part of the their history and therefore part of Alpha's hisotry. A careful review of members throughout the 100 year history of the organization will show that there are members of every hue in the human race, therefore; not all chapters employed the "paper bag test". <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 04:43, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The alleged "paper bag test" within the Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha at Howard University is an urban legend promulgated by members of competing fraternities. It is easily disproved by viewing pictures from the chapter's history (showing varied hues of African-American men from very dark to very light), easily available, among other places, at Howard University's Library. The "paper bag test" is often orally cited by other fraternities as a reason for their respective founding, with the "test" often used as rationale or excuse for their own founders supposedly not gaining acceptance into Alpha. The claim has been found dubious even by the historians of other fraternities, who have never thought to include such claims in their history books. The main page speaks to Thurgood Marshall's observation of "the test;" Marshall was not an undergraduate member of Beta Chapter at Howard University which is what some here seem to assume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>please look at the reference provided on the main page number 44 and what is written on the main page. thank you.</p>
<p>"In the selection of candidates for membership, certain chapters had not escaped challenges of racial stereotyping and allegations of colorism. In a biography of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the authors recounted how certain chapters of the fraternity used a "brown paper bag test" and would not consider students whose skin color was darker than the bag.[44] Former General President Belford Lawson, Jr. lamented this attitude and condemned initiation practices of snobbery and exclusivity, and said "Jesus Christ could not make Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity today; they would blackball Him because He was not hot enough".[45]"</p>

Even if someone isn't a member of a certain chapter doesn't mean they didnt witness it!

<p>Straw horse argument, ninja. Indeed, Marshall (and others) saw an ill that was sadly indicative of Black Fraternities and Universities during that time period, and indeed, Alpha (and other fraternities) addressed that wrong, rather than run from it. What was addressed was the false claim that "the howard chapter used the paper bag test." I have a feeling you already knew that, though.</p>
<p>NinjaNubian/MyKungFu, I thougt you were a member of Alpha Phi Alpha as you had posted the APA userbox on your user page. You seem to have an unsatiable desire to bring a bad light to the name of Alpha Phi Alpha.

<p>Where does it state that Alpha Phi Alpha was the prototype organization? If a statement like that is made, i simply want a reference inserted. Especially stating that one chapter was the prototype for other organizations both for men and women. Is there any neutral source that states two of KAY founders were in fact involved with A PHI A. Alpha sources may state yes, but KAY sources simply state that it is based from Alpha Kappa Nu. Neutral meaning not from a noted Alpha i.e. Skip Mason, or a noted Kappa.. Johnny Cochran. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 07:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article referenced by Mr. Mason indicates where his sources are regarding the 2 kappa founders and their tenure at Howard University. You can start by reading the History of Kappa Alpha Psi. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 02:44, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have the book, and according to the book their fraternity is based off of alpha kappa nu. Also just because something is the first, doesn't make it the prototype. I move for a rewording and the erasure of the word prototype. That word in itself is original research. Why? well Alpha Phi Alpha used the paper bag test at howard. Phi Beta Sigma accepted members regardless of their complexion. They are also founded for different reasons. If alpha phi alpha were the prototype of phi beta sigma, phi beta sigma would have similiar founding ideals. You might has well state that Sigma Alpha Mu or Tau Kappa Epsilon are prototypes for Alpha Phi Alpha. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 04:29, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The book is biased and that's the point of Mr. Mason's article that is referenced. According to Mr. Mason, the Kappa history book states two members were involved with another fraternity while students at Howard University. What other fratenity could they be affiliated with between 1907 and 1911, but Alpha Phi Alpha? Also, AKA founder Ethel Hedgeman Lyle has stated she started AKA as a direct result of her boyfriend Mr. Lyle who was a charter member of the Alpha's Beta chapter at howard, so Alpha was the prototype for a sorority. If you read the History section of the article, you will see that the founders wanted to establish a fraternity similar to the white fraternities, but they did not make mention of any specific organization. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 04:38, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why even mention the book if you are later goign to say it is biased? Skip Mason is biased as well, he is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. What other fraternity could they have be affiliated with? Sigma Pi Phi or even Mason's. If there is nothing documented, I propose to remove the wording by saturday 8th unless documented proof can be made. You can state though that Alpha Phi Alpha has been said to be the prototype for Alpha Kappa Alpha, but a reference is needed. All others must have concrete documentation. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 05:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alpha was charted on Howard in 1907. There is no record of Sigma Pi Phi or the Masons as a charted group at Howard in between 1907-1911, or even in 2006. I mentioned the book because you asked for a source that would confirm that 2 Kappa founders were affiliated with Alpha while at Howard; I guess you discovered the sentence in the Kappa book which states 2 members did attend howard, and of course, being the great hisorian of black fraternities, you know that it could only have been Alpha Phi Alpha since Omega Psi Phi, although founded at Howard, Omega was founded after Kappa was, just as the kappas know, but refuse to print that in their history book. I can understand why they would not, but this is an encylopedia with must present a Neutral and Unbiased Point of View. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 05:34, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright alpha was charted in 1907. Who is to say that they are the only fraternity that existed on the campus on during that time. if something can be pointed that it was alpha phi alpha was the prototype specifically then we'll move on. if not remove the word prototype. with phi beta sigma, it is a fact that alpha phi alpha wasn't the prototype for them.. the ideals are totally in oposition (one organization descrimanted based on complexian and the other didn't). thus alpha phi alpha was not the prototype for them. unbiased point of view you are correct. the sentence is biased, and thus should be removed. saturday september 9th is the deadline. thank you. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 05:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It should also be noted that men can no longer be admitted into the fraternity as "honorary". This type of membership ended decades ago and can be found in the fraternity's official history volumes.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if honorary memberships are no longer extended, but it's a matter of opinion whether it needs to be pointed out for every person listed. Each member honorary or not has the same privelges within the organization. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 20:02, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>when an individual is inducted after his death without his consent. i.e. Frederick Douglas. Then it must be duly noted.

<dd>Frederick Douglass membership was approved by the Frederick Douglass Historical and Memorial Society and the society accpeted the shingle on behalf of Mr. Douglass. Think of it as the children of MLK Jr have the rights to accept whatever they want in the names of their father or mother, and the parents left wills attesting to this fact.

it is important to state that Alpha Phi Alpha is an intercollegiate fraternity, possibly it would also be important to note that it accepts members who have never attended college, but have lifelong achievement such as Frederick Douglas and Duke Ellington. Also isn't lionel richie an honorary member? <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 16:50, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My request was that it be noted that honoray membership is <b>no longer</b> a form of membership within Alpha Phi Alpha. I have not stated anything nor debating anything other than such. It ceased to exist decades ago and the national website lists two types of memebrship status for brothers and aspirants: Alumni and College. The history and accomplishments of honoray members is a part of the fraternity's history and <b>should be</b> noted. I'm just asking that it be noted that honorary membership exists no more. I fail to see what's hard to comprehend about this suggestion.</p>
<p>adisalee</p>
<p><br />
Alright, where is the link to support this? Where does it state that Alpha Phi Alpha no longer grants membership on an honorary basis? Along with the fact that there were previously individuals who were honorary, should be a statement assuming what you say is true that Alpha Phi Alpha no longer grants membership on an honorary basis. 150.210.226.5 21:35, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I smell a couple of frauds. adisalee</p>
<p>Where is the page for alpha phi alpha that states the types of membership. I need to link this page as the source for the info. Rather than assuming honorary is no longer granted, I'll indicate the types of membership granted and this can verified by anyone who links to the referenced page. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.34.214.186.html" title="User:67.34.214.186">67.34.214.186</a> 16:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The national website is off-line, but the info in the links I provided are are cut, copied, and pasted from it. This info is available to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iotapsilambda.org/tausigma/membershiptypes.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.iotapsilambda.org/tausigma/membershiptypes.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.iotapsilambda.org/tausigma/membershiptypes.aspx</a> <a href="http://www.iotapsilambda.org/tausigma/membershipprocess.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.iotapsilambda.org/tausigma/membershipprocess.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.iotapsilambda.org/tausigma/membershipprocess.aspx</a></p>
<p>These are the only two ways in which men may be admitted into the fraternity. I'm not deducing (or "assuming", as its been suggested) this info to mean that honorary membership does not exist anymore. IT IS A FACT! Admittance into Alpha Phi Alpha as an honoray member is no longer accepted and you may contact national headquarters or any other chapter (including the chapter to the links I provided) and they will inform you of the same.</p>

<p>No one, at least not me, that what you say is not correct. However; an encyclopedia must have referenced information. You indicated above and I quote <i>This type of membership ended decades ago and can be found in the fraternity's official history volumes</i>. I just asked for the book, chapter and page where this can be found so I can insert the appropriate reference. If I say the color of the rainbow contain red, blue and green, a true statement, but this doesn't mean the other 4 color are no longer valid. An encyclopedia cannot infer, but only state what its source says. Although you may know this to be true, that's considered "orignial research" and not a fact. If the fraternity no longer allows honorary membership, this decision had to be made at a national convention and probably the reason for the decison. I will look at the links you provided, however; can you provide some documentation where the "honorary" status is directly spoken about? BTW-when you want to sign your name, you type 4 "tildes"; this the key to the left of the number 1, key, you must use the shift and tildes, four times as such <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 02:53, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. And I stand corrected about the history volumes. Honorary membership still existed during the recording of the history contained in the volumes. To my knowledge their exists no document available to the public that "clearly and plainly" states that Alpha no longer permits honorary members. Therefore, I understand that's its easy to assume otherwise and also that the abolishment of honorary membership will be difficult to include in this article without "hard" evidence. The only available source is to contact headqurters or a local chapter for clarification about the membership process, as I've already advised, and hear it from the "sphinxes" mouth. No harm done. But for your enjoyment, here's an old thread I found on a message board while searching for a more acceptable form of proof. This is not a realiable source either! It's basically everything (almost) you wanted to know about honorary membership in BGLO's, but was afraid to ask...and its quite hilarious at times!! <a href="http://www.stophazing.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000738" class="external free" title="http://www.stophazing.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000738" rel="nofollow">http://www.stophazing.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000738</a></p>

<p>"OJBECT, internal would be within the membership and there's no record of that. Certain chapters used <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorism.html" title="Colorism">Colorism</a> in accpeting candidates for membership, that would be external, and discussed in detail in the colorism article. BTW-that why they allow links to topics which demand more detail, so an article doesn't become lenghty.

Alright, I move to create a section known as Colorism and Prejudice. Certain chapters? It was used by what is quoted in the article as being the prototype chapter of Alpha phi Alpha, the howard chapter. This article isn't lengthy. There could be a few revisions in other sections that due seem to drag on though. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 05:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
There is also an article on Paul Robeson, but in the main article it speaks of his letter</p>
<p>"In 1946, fraternity brother Paul Robeson, in a Letter to the editor, published in The New York Times, referring to apartheid and South Africa's impending request to annex South-West Africa, a League of Nations mandate, appeals</p>
<p>to my fellow Americans to make known their protest against such conditions to the South African Ministry in Washington; to send to the Council on African Affairs, an expression of support for these grievously oppressed workers in South Africa; to keep the South African situation in mind against the time when General Smuts will come to the United Nations Assembly to demand the annexation of South West Africa, which means more Africans for him to exploit.[25] "</p>
<p>If you're going to start quoting individual accomplisments of members. Then something that directly correlated with Alpha history shoudl be included. Internal Racism within the organization must not be ignored! Move to expand to a section of internal racism, and delete the quorte of Paul Robeson.

<p>what link is this? hazing may occur but during a pledge process, but is mutually exclusive to the pledge process. one doesn't require the other. the hyponatremia incident in texas was exclusive to alpha phi alpha, as is the paper bag test that was used. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 04:29, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>you'r simply rambling on without providing any evidence. first you state it occurs only during pledging, and then as a vehicle towards membership. the types of hazing are the same? what types are there? Hyponathremia is exclusively used by Alpha Phi Alpha as is documented that it is the only case of hazing you using this. As stated earlier, pledging as the main topic, hazing as a sub topic, internal racism as a sub topic, and the paper bag test as smaller sub topic.

100 year isn't really the test of time, but as is the nature of wikipedia, a user driven encyclopedia, information is constantly being added. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 06:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What Bearly is referring to is the "need" of some people to continuously try to discredit this organization by posting "tidbit" half-truths as relevant info about the history, success, aims, and significance of Alpha Phi Alpha. If one didn't know anything about Black culture in general and read the garbage that people try to place in this article you would be led to believe that <i>only</i> Alpha Phi Alpha has dealt with classism, elitism, internal racism/paperbag tests (an early practice of Historical Black Colleges and Universitites, not just APHIA or fraternities), pledging/hazing, and other "scandals". Don't believe what I'm saying? Just view the information <b>and</b> the discussions about the other NPHC organizations. Nobody's been offering up "facts" about their hazing incidents and deaths, financial scandals, internal "isms", etc. For a plethora of reasons, APHIA garners a lot of attention and good old fashion playa hating! adisalee</p>
<p><br />
Paper bag test is already stated in the article, but it is part of a greater topic of internal racism. Other "black" fraternities were founded based on the fact tht they didn't judge members based upon things like classism, elitism, or paper bg tests such as Phi Beta Sigma , <a href="http://www.tamusigmas.org/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamusigmas.org/about/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which states that "each potential member should be judged on his own merits rather than his family background or affluence, without regard for race, nationality, color of skin, or texture of hair" The hazing incidents were mentioned in the other pages, but as is done here, they are erased. Why not give the opportunity to realize that history is history. It isn't what the present organization is, but why deny it?

<dd>the fact that Alpha was orginally limited to any "Negro Male" student is discussed in the Expansion and Consolidation section of the article.

<p>alright, so it's been inter racial since 1945 or so. the united states made slavery illegal since 1869. that doesnt take away from the fact that it existed. internal racism in alpha phi alpha is well documented and referenced in it's history. i strongly move for an internal racism portion for this article unless confounding evidence can show why it didn't or isn't noteworthy. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a> 04:29, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>there nothing to say, once a member, members were not discrimated against because of skin color. The fraternity used Colorism, (discussed in article) in accepting member.

<p>Personal knowledge or primary/first hand knowledge by Wiki Standards cannot be included. Don't you state that hazing occurs within pledging? If so.. there have been many cases of hazing since 1988. Well documented as can be seen by. www.anti-hazing.com It is very possible that one could have personal knowledge of 700 chapters. That is being very naive. Membership intake states a no pledging/no hazing policy, but both still very much occur as can be seen by the website. I move to include pledging and hazing as 2 separate topics on the main page or pledging as one topic, hazing as a sub topic and internal racism as another subtopic.

vernon johns is considered to be the father of the civil right movement.

<dd>I think maybe we should shorten the intro and not name the founders... simply state in some form or mannter that the founders are referred to as the Jewels.

<dd>I don't have a problem removing the list from the intro, however; if you remove the seven names from the intro to shorten, and add a whole section about the founders with pictures, that will only inrease the size of the article, which is not a good thing. Each founder has his own wikipedia page, and a link is provided in the article for anyone who wants to delve futher into the lives of each founder and their respective roles in the fraternity. The category <a href="../../../a/l/p/Category%7EAlpha_Phi_Alpha_founders_1851.html" title="Category:Alpha Phi Alpha founders">category:Alpha Phi Alpha founders</a> contains pictures of the founders and links to their articles. The category is linked in the main article; I will add if it's not. I suggest that you expand the indivdual pages of the founders. I'm sure you've noticed when you edit the entire aticle that it is almost twice the size as normal.</dd>
<dd>I don't think C.C. Poindexter should be included as a founder because he objected to the idea of a "fraternity" and therefore cannot be a founder. If you want his name listed, it should be listed as one of the main persons within the literary club who objected to becoming a fraternity. The history book is clear that he [Poindexter] had no role and wanted nothing to do with becoming a fraternity, and was not a part of the group that organized on December 4, 1906. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 03:36, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>. User NinjaNubian is disputing that members were not pioneers, but had key roles. I provided the reference for the sentence <a href="http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/alpha/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/alpha/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> where the Howard University PBS website states <b>The history of these men is the history of America, and their place in the vanguard of the Civil Rights struggle is unparalleled</b>. It's clear to anyone that Martin Luther King Jr., Thurgood Marshall and Andrew Young were <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vanguard" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:vanguard">vanguard</a> and at the forefront, and not just key players in the civil rights movement. Plus, Alpha members were at the head of the <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/l/SCLC_3936.html" title="SCLC">SCLC</a> and the <a href="../../../n/u/l/NUL_890f.html" title="NUL">NUL</a>. The website NinjaNubian supplies as his reference is a biased site against "hazing", but even if it's not biased, why does it contain text about a fraternity claiming to have members as pioneers. I belive that this text was written just to directly address the sentence in the article since no where else on the web does Alpha claim to have been pioneers. The adjective Pioneer was chosen for this article in place of word "Vanguard" which appeared in the reference. He has created his own statement on a biased website and using those statements as proof of his own opinion.

<p>"Father" would signify a singular role, the sentence in question says Alpha Men, plural, and there can be many who are pioneers, and this isn't limited to members of Alpha. The sentence in the aticle is contained in section "History: 1950-1969", and refers to Alpha Men's role in the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_a2ad.html" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)</a>; please note the years 1955-1968. There is a section in the article "History: 1919-1949", but there is no claim of civil rights campaigns by the fraternity or its memebers during this time period. But, prior to all this, in 1905, before 1920, honorary Alpha member <a href="../../../w/2E/e/W.E.B._Dubois_d111.html" title="W.E.B. Dubois">W.E.B.

<p>What is wrong with "played a key role" Pioneers and vanguard are quite misleading. the Niagra movement (which was heavily assisted with whites) and the NAACP (which was heavily founded with the help of whites) were role players but not central like the <b>father of the civil rights movement vernon johns</b>. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Johns_f152.html" title="Vernon Johns">Vernon Johns</a> is the father of the american civil rights movement, startig it in the 1920's. it ended in 63. thus alpha phi alpha weren't pioneers, but played key roles.</p>
<p><br />
Martin Luther King was an Alpha, Rev. Jesse Jackson is an Omega, and Ralph Alberthy was a Kappa. Malcolm X belonged to a fraternity -- he was a member of the Nation of Islam. Thurgood Marshall was an Alpha. I am not too sure about W.E.B. DuBois...I think he was an Alpha. If you count women, both Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King were honorary AKAs. Dorothy Height was a past YMCA president, Delta Sigma Theta president, Barbara Jordan (Delta) was the first black Congressman from the South as well as Shirley Chisolm (Delta), the first black Congresswoman. Was Medgar Evers a part of an NPHC organization?</p>
<p>this only makes the current statement stronger. 7 others vs maybe 4 alphas</p>

<dd>alpha kappa nu . although kappa alpha psi was named in honor of alpha kappa nu, they are 2 distinct organizations. kappa alpha psi has just as much authority as jimmy carter does in stating the type of organization alpha kappa nu is.

<p>You are right, it has been discussed earlier, as well as on your other pages. See below:</p>
<p>Even if the source didn't misquote the paragraph on Alpha Kappa Nu from "The History of Kappa Alpha Psi (and it does)," it is still a secondary source. The only thing that the author could "research" would be the original source of the quote, which you chose not to use, because it does not fit the argument you choose to make in attacking another organization. that makes it unreliable.</p>
<p>The member of Kappa Alpha Psi interviewed in one of your articles says he joined the organization in 1983, the same year of publication of his organization's published history, which disputes his opinion. I note that you are arguing simultaneously that Kappa Alpha Psi is and is not a valid source of information on Alpha Kappa Nu.<a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=12053" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=12053" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Even though you still are citing secondary (and for the sake of comity, let's assume that they are legitimate secondary sources), Your sources, are very careful (even in misquoting) to use some version of the original phrase "might have been...<i>but</i>[emphasis added]." Now what could be the reason for this? We know from reading the histories of various fraternities, including <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a>, that there was an ongoing discussion on campuses about whether to charter as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternity.html" title="Fraternity">fraternities</a>, social or study <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club.html" title="Club">clubs</a>, or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">societies</a>. This is not a matter of simple semantics, as you have suggested on other pages. At the turn of the century, there were potential repercussions that were very real for African-Americans (or Negroes, if you like) as minorities that thought of organizing as a fraternity on any college campus. For whatever reason, as Kappa Alpha Psi documents their history (being the only original source of documented research on Alpha Kappa Nu), the organization was a <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club.html" title="Club">club</a>. <i><b>This is notwithstanding the fact that you just re-edited their Wikipedia entry to say "fraternity," even though the page's creator (a member of <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Alpha_Psi_d0a0.html" title="Kappa Alpha Psi">Kappa Alpha Psi</a> has previously reverted your same edits.</b></i> Even the picture that you link on the MSN personal webpage shows a picture labeling it a "<a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">Society</a>." Perhaps they intended to later incorporate it as a Fraternity. Perhaps <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_University_4db1.html" title="Indiana University">Indiana University</a> would not yet allow a group of African-Americans to organize as a fraternity. Perhaps they feared racial violence. We don't know why, but for whatever reason, they didn't, and it seems they took pains not to identify themselves as one. That in no way belittles their attempt, in the face of great odds. We can all imagine what they would have done if they had finished organizing, "but there were too few registrants to assure continuing organization."<a href="http://copland.udel.edu/stu-org/nuxinupes/grandchapterhistory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://copland.udel.edu/stu-org/nuxinupes/grandchapterhistory.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> A few years later, in 1911, Kappa Alpha Nu, a forerunner of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, was organized, and has performed admirably ever since. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotam_8f37.html" title="User:Robotam">Robotam</a> 13:49, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You recognize that Alpha Kappa Nu was around in 1903. You also recognize that it is a black organization. There have been many references to show it is a fraternity. Thus why should Alpha Phi Alpha still state "first inter collegeiate black fraternity?"
<dl>
<dd>There's never been a doubt of their existence, but, if you never sought a charter you were never a college organization. Many students organize themselves then and now for playing cards in the student center, going out partying, and volunteering for various causes; that doesn't make them a club, society or fraternity, and the college can't revoke a charter, because one was never issued.</dd>

<dd>This coincides with the Kappa site that the organization was attempting to form, but failed because not enough students returned the following school year. I believe the article you referened says they existed for several years. This means the information is dubious, however; no source indicages they were ever issued a charter as a recognized organization. There is no reason to believe that the Cornell students were aware of AKN when they began meeting in 1905. The Kappa organization indicates the 10 founders were aware of AKN; and possibly named their organization after AKN. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 13:06, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. <b>a local or national organization of male students, primarily for social purposes, usually with secret initiation and rites and a name composed of two or three Greek letters.</b> 2. a group of persons associated by or as if by ties of brotherhood. 3. any group or class of persons having common purposes, interests, etc.: the medical fraternity. 4. an organization of laymen for religious or charitable purposes; sodality. 5. the quality of being brotherly; brotherhood: liberty, equality, and fraternity. 6. the relation of a brother or between brothers.</p>

<dd>Simply having greek letters isn't the factor only in determing if a group is a fraterity, there are six criteria. Each organization must determine they want to bound by a fraternal bound. There is a fraternity call <a href="../../../f/a/r/FarmHouse_5d8e.html" title="FarmHouse">FarmHouse</a>, no greek letter, and just be AKN chose greek letters doesn't make them a fraternity. The organization apparently called themselves a society, much in the way social and literary club that predated Alpha Phi Alhpa was terned a "society", before it's members voted to become a fraternity. The historical phot you posted on the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Kappa_Nu_5cb5.html" title="Alpha Kappa Nu">Alpha Kappa Nu</a> page indicates the group as a "society". The term fraterity was not a new concept in 1903, so it's no mistake that "fraternity" was not used in the caption. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 12:55, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the original Cornell social club was a fraternity, then there would have been no interal fighting and no one would have resigned at the thought of becomeing a fraternity. Just because males organize and choose greek letters doesn't make them a fraternity. the letter Alpha Phi Alpha were chosen even when the group was still a society. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 03:14, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ccson, it appears you may have mistakenly clipped the original wording while editing. Alpha's designation of The Sphinx Magazine has always been as so:</p>
<p><i>The Sphinx Magazine, published in 1914, is the second oldest</i> continuously published <i>black journal in the United States. The oldest one is the NAACP’s Crisis Magazine, which was started by W.E.B. Du Bois, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/alpha/" class="external autonumber" title="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/alpha/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></i> <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotam_8f37.html" title="User:Robotam">Robotam</a> 19:10, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Oldest</b></p>
<p><b>The oldest black journal is actually</b></p>
<p>The oldest black periodical in the world, The Christian Recorder (originally The Christian Herald ), was begun by the AME. The world's oldest black magazine, The AME Review , was also a product of the AME Church (Melton:330-331).</p>

<p>There a couple of things I want to mention:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Robotam, you have copied the information directly from the cornell site and that's a copyright violation. I'm going to restore for now the original text, which simply omitted the "continuously published Journal". I will add that part and supply your reference, which by the wau is currently listed as footnote 5. the name of the footnote is "conrell-library", and so you only needed to enter &lt; ref name=cornell-library /&gt; since it is listed before this reference. You can take a look once I make the change.</li>
<li>NinjaNubian, there appears to be validity that there are other jounals that predate the Sphinx. The question is if they have been "Continuously" published, which would refute the statement on the cornell university website. Can you provide evidence to this fact? The current cornell statement would not mention the "Only the NAACP etc. you want removed, but that doesn't mean the statement is false.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<p><br />
Never said the statement is false, I said it's inaccurate. "The Spinx is amongst the oldest black publications still being published today." I think that is good enough. The NAACP also should be removed. Is there any documentation that Spinx is continuously published? Is there a list? that can be viewd. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 02:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>here is yet another journal</p>

<p>The original statement was false because it indicated it [The Sphinx] was the second oldest publication, which is not correct. The current statement in article, sourced by cornell univeristy, and albeit, misstated in the article previously is what we're discussing ,where they indicate <b>The second oldest continuously Published journal</b>". I think it's a stretch to compare a pamphlet of names to a magazine, however; how do you know it's been published continuously. I did review the site, but I didn't notice that statement, can you paste that statement here on the talk page? I find it interesting that you doubt an Ivy league university, but can bounce around on the internet, find a site with dates before 1909, and say, I've never heard of these journals or pamphlet, but here's proof, and I know for a fact they've never missed an issue. 67.34.212.83 13:32, 16 September 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a></p>

<dd>I don't have a POV on this isssue. I've sourced the statement from a reputable and reliable source. In order to disprove it, you must find something that directly contradicts the source. You've only proven that other journals existed before, but you have not proved that those journals were continuously published, which is the qualifying statement. There's a reason why the source makes a point of "continuously published", because they want to qualify the statement so that it is true. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 16:04, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>it states that is has been published continuously. take a better read. it states it includes a list of names, but in no way does it state that that is the only thing it says " includes list of church districts, portraits of clergy, statistics, annual report, reports on mission schools in Africa and schools in US" Even the AME review doesnt state itself to be the first "The world's oldest black magazine, The AME Review , was also a product of the AME Church (Melton:330-331)" It says the oldest</p>

The source used provides no reference, simply states that this is the case. It is written by "Robert L. Harris, Jr., National Historian Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. on13 April 2006" on the cornell library website . I know it may sound good to be the first of some kind, but is amongst the oldest really that bad? The Crises itself wasn't always a magazine as can be viewed by "In his first editorial William Du Bois said that Crisis would "be first and foremost a newspaper", "<a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcrisis.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcrisis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcrisis.htm</a></p>
<p>The crises about page states it is a magazine, periodical, and journal interchangebly, it may be a magazine now, but when it started it was a newspaper. "William Edward Burghardt Du Bois founded THE CRISIS magazine as the premier crusading voice for civil rights. Today, THE CRISIS, one of the oldest black periodicals in America, continues this mission. respected journal of thought, opinion and analysis, the magazine "</p>

<p>The actual reference statement is "The Sphinx Magazine, published in 1914, is the second oldest continuously published black journal in the United States. The oldest one is the NAACP’s Crisis Magazine, which was started by W.E.B. Du Bois, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity."</p>

<p>The Sphinx Magazine, published in 1914 (<b>true</b>)</p>
<p>is the second oldest continuously published black journal in the United States (<b>not verified</b>)</p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>The <b>oldest one is the NAACP’s Crisis Magazine</b>, which was started by W.E.B. Du Bois. (<b>false b/c the NAACP isn't a black magazine</b>)</p>
<p>The problem is that the NAACP isn't a black magazine or a black group. Even Dubious commented on the lack of Blacks in power</p>
<p>"His hot, raking editorials oftentimes lead to battles within the ranks of the Association. Besides this, the NAACP was, at that time, under the leadership of whites, to which DuBois objected.

<p>in the NAACP article on Wikipedia it states:</p>
<p>"The conference resulted in a more viable, influential and diverse organization, where the leadership was predominantly white and heavily Jewish. In fact, at its founding, the NAACP had only one African American on its executive board, DuBois himself, and did not elect a black president until 1975."</p>
<p>for all we know the Spinx can be the first black continously published black magazine. If that was the case simple research could prove it correct. do you now see why it may be better to have amongst the oldest continuously published black journals? thanks for taking the time to read this. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 05:40, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw black people "Black (noun, black or blacks; adjective, black people) is a term that commonly refers to the indigenous peoples of Africa (with the exception of Maghreb Berbers) and their diasporic populations. Black also refers to various non-African, dark-skinned peoples who inhabit Asia and the Pacific"</p>
<p>and african american..</p>
<p><br />
"An African American (also Afro-American, Black American, or simply black) is a member of an ethnic group in the United States whose ancestors, usually in predominant part, were indigenous to sub-saharan Africa"</p>
<p>Yes the fraternity may in fact be intererested in issues that affect people of color, but the fraternity until 1945 was exclusively black/negro.. even the History of Alpha Phi Alpha title included the word negro until 1945. That withstanding, the NAACP was for all colored people in USA... Native Americans, Orientals (who worked on the railroads), Hispanics, Jews, and Blacks... since it's inception.. it was for all people of color. Even the name National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, tells what it does.

<p>Your statement was that the Crisis was not for just for "blacks". I showed you black people would include the groups the NAACP was created for, which would include people for africa. Therefore; the statement in the article is true. Even if the Sphinx target a smaller group of what's considered <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a>, they're still black. I hope the admins review this discussion and see that you have changed your statement about 5 times why the statement is false</p>

<li>1st, The two magazines are not the oldest, saying "is not by the NAACP it is actually the Philadelphia Tribune", until a user pointed out that the reference said "continuously published".</li>
<li>2nd, you bounced around the web and found publications published before 1909 such the Philadelpha Tribuune, until it was pointed out that a reference says "continuoulsy published JOURNAL".</li>
<li>3rd, you suggested the web site for the publications you found were published continuously when you said "it states that is has been published continuously", but after 3 attempts of requesting that you provide that information here, you have not,</li>
<li>4th, then you atached Dubois personally as if that has anything to do with the status of a journal</li>
<li>5th, then you stated the statement regarding "continuously published" [The Sphinx Magazine, published in 1914 (true) is the second oldest continuously published black journal in the United States (not verified)]</li>
<li>6th, your current theory is "<i>The NAACP isn't a black organization, it's an organization that services native americans, jews, hispanics, as well as blacks. The crises isn't a black magazine or journal</i>." Ihave shown that words "negro", "black", etc have evolved over time, and were blanket statements that would include many groups that might be included a single category today. Thats why Hispanics in some demographics now include Mexicans, even though in the past they would have been considered Indians, and why the current politically correct term "African-American" would only apply to blacks of African descent, not all the categories listed in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a>. The word in the source and this article says "black journal", which matches the noun that the magazines might have used almost 100 years ago to describe all people of color.</li>

<p><b>For the record, the sentence</b> <i>is the second oldest continuously published black journal</i>. You have attacked the words <i>second, oldest, continuously, journal and black</i>. I hope the readers of this discussion can see the witch hunt you have engaged, and that you will attack any single word in the sentence to meet your own POV.

<p><br />
Logical arguments develop. As you develop so does everyone else. The meat of the argument has in fact changed, but the statement of <i>is the second oldest continuously published black journal</i> is still incorrect. No where was Dubois attacked personally, that is simply ridiculous. Quoting Dubois based on a website by the Dubois foundation is not an attack. That is simply ridiculous.</p>
<p>As you stated previously, "In order to disprove it, you must find something that directly contradicts the source. " Being that the NAACP isn't a black organization and magazine consequently isn't a black journal the statement is disproved.

<dd>You omitted this sentence when you supplied some of the text from the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> article above; <i>The terms <b><a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro.html" title="Negro">Negro</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../c/o/l/Colored.html" title="Colored">Colored</a></b> also are used occasionally as synonyms for</i> black<i>, but sometimes are considered pejorative</i>. . The "CP" in NAACP stands for Colored People. As I stated above, the adjectives/nouns to descibe people of color have evolved, and one must look at the context of the statement, as opposed to disecting each single word. Since "negro" and "colored" are no longer politically correct words in some environs, a similar word was chosen to convey the samee meaing. Wikipedia, a reputable source, says the word black is a synonym of NAA"Colored"People; therefore the statement is true.

<dd>once again you misinterpret and minsconstrue.

My definiton gives the reason why "colored" and "negro" are no longer used frequently, because they are sometimes are considered <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pejorative" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:pejorative">pejorative</a><i>.

<p><b>You are not the final arbiter on what will and will not be the final content of the article</b>. Minority is not a synonym of any ethnic group, see <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minority" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:minority">minority</a> and it doesn't mention anything about black/jews,colored or whites. The word minority can be used to describe an ethnic groups when they are in the minority. In some cities of America and countries, the non-white population would be considered the minority race. The contributor to the article only has to supply the source of the statement, <b>the proof is on you</b> to prove what the cornell university staff meant by black when they were referring to the target audience of the Crisis. In its simplest form, black is a synonym of colored or negro, and you can't invalidate the source because the word was used in a way that you've never seen it employed. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 18:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Colored People doesnt mean blacks.. during that time there were "yellow" which was asian, red which was native american, "black" which negro, "jews" weren't considered to be white nor caucasion, and "white" which was caucasian.

<dd>I think we can assume that a journal representing the National Association for Colored People" was intended for Colored People. We're having this discussion because you consider the arugment "dubious". Once it's over, by consensus or by a decision of an admin, the matter will be closed.

<dd>The Alpha article just indicates that the journal was founded by a fraternity brother and it predates the Alpha publication. The Alpha article links to The Crisis, so anyone desiring the history of this journal can go their for in depth info. I don't think its a surprise that the NAACP was a militant organization in securing the rights of colored people, but you are welcome to add this statement to the article for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crisis_6822.html" title="The Crisis">The Crisis</a>; just be sure to indicate who made the claim (i.e. Ms. Ovington said Dubois . . .), and provide the reference.</dd>
<dd>The author has chosen to separate "black civil rights" from the rights <b>of all people of color</b>. The author of the Cornell articles includes them in one category. This is what I meant earlier when I said each author can choose to use what synonym they want, and for historical perspective can go back almost 100 years and use a term that's oudated: "colored people", some authors use current venacular and just say 'black people'. The word "black" was not a common term in 1909, so even the author has udpated her choice of words. Again, one must look to the context of the statement and what they are trying to convey, as opposed to saying I wouldn't say it that way. but this author is correct because that's how I would personally make the statement. Can we move forward from this discussion and allow each author choice words? <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 13:25, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think Ms. Ovington was trying to make the distinction you say proves your point. I believe she was pointing out that although Dubois himself was considered "African American" in todays vernacular, that his efforts were concentrated on "all people of color", not just the ethnic group he was a member of. The same statement could be made when speaking of the Jewish leaders of the NAACP, "they sought to improve the conditions of Jews and all other people of color". The NAACP and The Crisis was created for Colored People/Darker Races/Blacks.</dd>

<dd>you seem to assume that in the united states there are blacks and whites. When in fact especially in that time, there are blacks, whites, and native americans. colored is a broad definition. Dubois is a mulatto... half black and half white. your continued assertion that the NAACP is a black organization and the Crisis is a black journal is unfounded and without substantial proof. I've continued to lay fact after fact where it states that neither is true. The NAACP is a multi racial organization and the Crises was founded for blacks and people of all colors. If you can disprove this go ahead.. Please no more silly assertions of what is black and things of that nature. Dubois has no division of races? where do you base this from? Although the Niagra movement is the forerunner of the NAACP it isn't the NAACP and it isn't the Crises. Dubois was the editor and the member of the NAACP he was never head of it. He was pro-segregation in terms of education of black children "In the 1930s, Du Bois found himself in a bitter dispute with Walter White, the head of the NAACP, when Du Bois suddenly penned articles that advocated voluntary segregation, maintaining that black children would receive a better education from black teachers. Du Bois resigned from the editorship of THE CRISIS and the NAACP in 1934.

<p>Vaughn Lowery I agree that Mr. Lowery has done nothing which embodies the goals and ideas of Alpha Phi Alpha that warrant his inclusion from over 175,000 possible. I think NN had other reason for including Lowery, probably some personal characteristic that would embarass the fraternity. There's a lenghty discussion on the Alpha Phi Alpha talk page regarding the inclusion of Barry and Lowery. It was never agreed that they should be included, however; I got tired of the revert war, and Ninjanubian added them. The name was initially in the intro, but I have moved it to its current section. Andrew Young and Maynard Jackson are included in the Intro paragraph as well as the "Membership" section of the article.

<dd>The list in the intro could be there even if there was no list in the article because it mentions names withiin the article. The names within the intro are a compilation of many names, from different sections of the article, that's why it's a summary.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Skip Mason</span></h2>
<p>I'm wondering what makes the contributions of Skip Mason any different from a personal website, opinion article or editorial..</p>
<p>Reading this, I wonder if it really is less objective and more subjective</p>
<p>"As a historian who recognizes that laying a foundation for any period of history, I find their omission inexcusable and without merit. Permit me to share some a few statements (and of course my personal commentary in between) from their books: "</p>

<p>on some of his website pages he states "DISCLAIMER: This page is not affiliated with the National Organization. I am not the Historian of the fraternity, just a brother who is and has always been thirsty for more knowledge on this organization. The information provided has been thoroughly researched and documented and is brought to you with all the fraternal love and spirit I possess. Sources are available upon request.

<p><br />
He's not the fraternity's historian, but he <b>is</b> a historian and the Fraternity's Chairman of Historical Commission. <a href="http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/today/committees.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/today/committees.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/today/committees.html</a> (written by 143.166.226.40 11:00, 30 September 2006)</p>
<p><br />
alright,he is a the chairmen of National Chairmen &amp; Coordinators "Historical Commission Herman Mason", but his website claims the page that is sited is not affiliated with the national organization, it states that all knowledge has been researched, but there is no documentation. The quote listed on the Alpha Phi Alpha page is not NPOV, and can be viewed as being an attack. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 15:41, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Self-published sources (online and paper)</b> See also Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Using online and self-published sources Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources</p>
<p>Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by reliable third-party publications. However, exercise caution: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so.</p>

<p>i move for removal of this statement in it's non neutral pov, by skip mason "As a historian who recognizes that laying a foundation for any period of history, I find their omission inexcusable and without merit."</p>
<p><a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 17:02, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The statement is an opinion, however; in this case, it's not a personal opinion, it's a professional opinion as a learned historian. Mason is fortright in detailing what is fact, personal and/or professional opinion.</p>
<p>Someone has indicated that Mr. Mason's sources are available upon request. This means that any objections to the facts he presents can be challenged directly to Mason. You can't challenge his opinion unless the opinion was stated as "fact". Wikipedia citation policy just requires that you attribute the quote to the person, and place the quoted text within double quotation such Ccson says "I'm disappointed and saddened when editors indulge in abject vandalism and vitriolic attacks against a person". Anyone can quote me on that. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 15:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding documentation, I believe Mason tells the reader exactly where he retrieved the information, for example, <i>In the book The Story of Kappa Alpha Psi by William L. Crump(1983), the following statement is made in the prologue:</i>. There is the source. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 15:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image is used in one article only now. My general thought is that one fair-use image in one relevant article has the best fairness. A fair-use image in too many or no articles is unfair.
