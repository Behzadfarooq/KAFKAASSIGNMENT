<h2><span class="mw-headline">No EXCEPTIONS: Citations are needed</span></h2>

<dd>Wow. I have no idea why he wasn't blocked. I think the strategies and investigations of admins differ. I would have reported him after the 2nd instance of vandalism. He's now blocked. As for a hard and fast formula, I'm not quite sure we can apply one. Every vandal is different in severity. Extremely severe vandals should be reported immediately (image vandalism, for instance), while those saying 'hi' through our articles should get a little bit more lead time. I realize this isn't helping very much. Just make sure they get warned first. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp.</b></span></a> 01:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Eileen. It's easy to create an account. Just follow the link in the top right corner of the screen. Creating an account is easy and requires no personal information. As for creating a page about theories, I would suggest you don't make a page about anything bordering on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and without <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>. A lot of such pages are deleted. Remember that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a free webhost</a> and content (even "useful" content) is often deleted for failing to meet our standards.

<p>Hi, alphachimp, thanks for writing back so quick. I just asked that because I've found a lot of original research around the Talk: Ultimecia page about Rinoa being Ultimecia and it brought in fansites to support it. So I'm going to erase that part of the article I hope no one minds it. That's what got me thinking about it, actually I was thinking about creating that page so people could talk about it. Apparently their are alot of Final Fantasy theories without actual research and I wanted to address this issue on a page (actually a talk page) like what I telling you about where we could discuss this original research and analyze it.</p>
<p>About the Rinoa/Ultimecia theory, could you tell people not to discuss that on Wikipedia? I've read stuff written about it repeatedly and everytime it fails to have significant proof to back it up. Personally, I think it's not true but not everyone agrees. What do you think about it personally? When I've read articles about it they said it's fairly widely known. What's the truth? (In fact I wrote an reply to it using information I found in FF8. Check out Talk: Ultimecia page if your interested. In fact, I found of people wrote complaints like mine on the page itself. I would really appreciate it if you or anyone else gives me feed back.)</p>
<p>I have one last question. I found some people like the official pictures of FF8, but what's wrong with one from in the game itself. Could anyone keep them up their?</p>
<p>PS. I getting an account tomorrow but not before reading your answer. (I didn't realize it was so easy so I'll follow your link:) Thanks again. -Eileen-</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would suggest bringing up the issue of the original research on the talk page before removing the content from the article. People fighting vandalism could take it the wrong way if you just start blanking. It never really is a good start with other editors. I'd really encourage you to talk out such changes (it looks like you're great at that, which is an excellent start as a wikipedia user). I can't really tell people not to discuss a particular theory on wikipedia. Honestly, that type of argument rarely works around here. It's easy, however, to discredit an invalid theory.</dd>
<dd>Official pictures are a sensitive area. <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fairuse</a> permits us to use images only in those cases that there are no alternative free images. There are a multitude of legal and procedural restrictions involving their use on Wikipedia. Of course, in the case of something like a game, they're fairly hard to avoid. I'd encourage you to search for any free media before even thinking about bringing in official pictures.</dd>
<dd>When you do create an account, still feel free to drop by with any questions. I hope I was able to help. Regards, <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp.</b></span></a> 11:53, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, alphachimp, again. I have four questions for you. 1.) When I was talking about the Ultimecia talk page, I was gonna just erase the original research about the Rinoa/Ultimecia theory and make a note to everyone that an encyclopedia doesn't allow this kind of information. Is that acceptable? (That's what I meant about not "talking about the theory"). 2.) If I get an account will that prevent my IP Address from being blocked by other's vandalism? (I wasn't able to create an account for a two days because of this.) 3.) Would you be interested in a Talk: Final Fantasy theories page? 4.) Can you tell me what you personally think of the Rinoa/Ultimecia theory? (I've heard about it alot but I don't know how widespread it is.)</p>
<p>Thanks. -Eileen-</p>
<p>PS. Your user name is really awesome =).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for not responding sooner, Eileen. That's entirely acceptable. Make sure to use a good edit summary, otherwise people might think that you are vandalizing. I would suggest making a note of it on the talk page first. Creating an account will not prevent you from being blocked for others' vandalism unless the block is anon-only (AO). Most IP blocks now are. Anyway, if you're autoblocked (that's what happens when you can't log in with your account), you can always request an unblock using the instructions on the block page. Honestly, I know nothing about FF as a game. I really haven't had time to pursue that genre (or any genre for that matter) of game recently. Seeing as whatever observations I'd offer would be somewhat trite, I'll hold off&#160;:). Hope you don't mind.

<p>Hi, Alphachimp, I have a question for you. I reverted some previous changes on some pictures of FF8 articles and that ticked off some people although I didn't mean to. I still want to keep them through. What do I do? Thanks for the advice on that talk page. If you want you can check my note in the Talk: Ultimecia page, I think its ok. Tell me what you think. I didn't blank the page at all, just erased the original research. -Eileen-</p>

<dd>You might do well checking out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Final_Fantasy_af99.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Final Fantasy">Wikipedia:WikiProject Final Fantasy</a>. They're probably a lot better versed on dealing with the theories and some of the intricacies that I can't address. I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding here (I just realized, actually). You've been removing the theories from the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Talk%7EUltimecia_1860.html" title="Talk:Ultimecia">Talk:Ultimecia</a> page. This is actually quite inflammatory (people don't like having their comments removed)...as talk pages are for discussing the contents of the article. I had just assumed that you were removing text from the article and placing a note on the talk page. I've restored the text. Honestly, I'm not sure there's much you can do about discussion on talk pages. A certain amount of health discussion, whether or not that violates our OR and RS standards, is totally OK. It's the article content that we're truly concerned about. The talk page is really for honing and refining the content of said article. I hope that helps. I realize this is a bit of a reversal on what I previously said, but I didn't actually have a chance to look in depth until now.</dd>

<p>For your 6 month block to 209.18.49.25, would it be possible if you could make it so registered users will be able to edit? Many schools and libraries in the area are using CLIU21's "services." I know that there has been a lot of vandalism coming from that IP, but if you could make it so that registered users could edit there probably wouldn't be much of a problem.

<p>Again, I blew it by entering the message below in the discussion area. You are absolutely right in that I should have read all policies and guidelines before doing anything on Wikipedia. I am new to it and I apologize if I have been disruptive.</p>
<p>You left me a message saying that I have been blocked from editing. What I did was insert external links to www.alternatefuelsworld.com in what appeared to me to be completely appropriate locations. This website is no different from a number of websites available concerning alternate fuels listed in Wikipedia. However, the primers on it are unlike anything else available in one location that I know of. It is primarily informational, and stands, while new, as one of the most complete sources of news and information on alternate fuels on the web. It is correct that I did not completely read Wikipedia's policies before adding these links, but, as far as I can tell, the only thing I did that was against these policies was to place my links at the top of the lists. For this I apologize. It was only done out of convenience not as an attack on anyone. I stand corrected and will, in the future, use the talk sections to suggest links. Again, I didn't realize that that was the correct way to put external links on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocked from editing</span></h2>
<p>You left me a message saying that I have been blocked from editing. What I did was insert external links to www.alternatefuelsworld.com in completely appropriate locations. This website is no different from a number of websites available concerning alternate fuels listed in Wikipedia. The primers on it are unlike anything else available in one location that I know of. It is primarily informational, and stands, while new, as one of the most complete sources of news and information on alternate fuels on the web. It is correct that I did not completely read Wikipedia's policies before adding these links, but, as far as I can tell, the only thing I did that was against these policies was to place my links at the top of the lists. For this I apologize. It was only done out of convenience not as an attack on anyone. I stand corrected and will, in the future, use the talk sections to suggest links. Again, I didn't realize that that was the correct way to put external links on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Thank you --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> Your quite right, you dont know what was on <a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebreicht_7f5d.html" title="User:Lebreicht">Lebreicht</a> thats because it was arbitrarily deleted by user:Alphachimp. But with Respect it's well known that a negative cannot be proved. Therefor your presumption falls on two counts. <a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebreicht_7f5d.html" title="User:Lebreicht">Lebreicht</a> was a well crafted profile. It was created with a great deal of effort both offline and on (mainly off) As to my History within your Wiki, you have no idea what my areas of experience are and therefor cannot tell which pages I regularly view, but that I don't critically slash them about, (thats a negative ofcourse), dosn't mean that I'm not contributing. I varify my facts and even then proceed with caution, (where angels fear to tread!). A current area of expertise is The Mystisism surrounding Rennes Le Chateau, for which I would like to gather a compehensive Encyclopedic reference, whilst at the same time, in parrallel, creating fiction and fantasy from some very fertile sources. With very limited resources I am getting on with this project.

<dd>Both Jim Douglas and Dweller are right, and I'd like to thank them for responding. As the message says above, I'm often off of Wikipedia for extended periods of time -- this was one of them. I don't quite remember how I found your userpage, but I think someone reported you to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> as a user with no edits in encyclopedia space. We do not typically block for this, but I noticed that your userpage was insalvageably incoherent (failing <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> G1...hence the "g1"). We typically delete the userpages of those individuals who appear to be using Wikipedia for free webhosting (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a free webhost</a>). Those users who appear to have a consistent problem with this may be blocked indefinitely. I'm more than willing to give the text of the page to you (it's still in the database), but if you recreate it, it will be deleted immediately and you may be blocked. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 20:38, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A number of editors considered that I wasn't ready for the mop yet and unfortunately the RFA did not succeed (69/26/11).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin Perreault - article deleted</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I see in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_Perreault_ec97.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin Perreault">this AfD</a> you decided to delete the article about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_Perreault_ec97.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin Perreault">Martin Perreault</a>, which I regret, but accept it. I thought to use the approach one of those who preferred deletion suggested. Do you, as an administrator, find it OK, if I redirect Martin Perreault to <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Beauchamp_cd39.html" title="Bianca Beauchamp">Bianca Beauchamp</a>'s article? I believe we showed Mr. Perreault is an accomplished photographer,even you mention that in you final verdict, at this would be IMHO a reasonable compromise.</p>
<p>My second question is to ask you if it's common, that some of the contributors are so personal and attacking. Is there any way to resist this? Because it can annoy other contributors easily especially if they are new and cause they never return. (Just a question of a curious newbie&#160;:-) )</p>

<dd>I understand. The BusinessWeek article will verify the basic details about the show. I don't believe that there are any articles that verify the full listing of show types (Cover Story, Cover to Cover Interviews, etc.) that are listed, but I know some have described a few of the different types. I actually have a few more magazines and newspapers that have done articles on the show, but some of them don't archive their articles online. Can I put a reference to the newspaper/magazine, date, issue number and page number in those cases? Are all the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coverville.html" title="Coverville">Coverville</a> sections under suspect of verification, or is there a section that I can focus on finding the relvant articles to verify?

<dd>It's actually pretty simple. "MT" means "Empty" (referring to the list of IPs and accounts).

<p>Is there a form letter we have for IP administrators regarding vandalism?

<dd>Yup. To be honest, I have never really pursued that angle (despite blocking some very long term and nasty vandals). I have always been a bit concerned about being laughed off when I say "I am a volunteer Wikipedia contributor." Anyway, I would encourage you to investigate it if the vandalism persists.

<p>I'm still a bit confused. Yes, I want my bot to do it, but the first file you e-mailed me opened up in IE. Isn't it supposed to open in a compressed file or whatnot?

<dd>Feel free to ask anything you want. In the unlikely event I (or anyone) doesn't want to respond, that can be said. In this case, checking whether there was an order in place and whether the phone number is valid (see my most recent ANI post) is closer to clerical research than giving legal advice.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editing</span></h2>
<p>I believe that instead of letting anyone edit the pages, anyone who wants to edit a page should forward a message/e-mail to an administrator regarding the edit and article. Therefore, the accuracy will be guaranteed, if the administrator reviews it for accuracy. When I did research projects in school, I wasn't allowed to use WikiPedia because of its inaccuracy rate. WikiPadia provides a wealth of excellent knowledge, and it would be even better and useful if it was completely accurate. PLease consider this thought! Thanks!Zhouf12 23:51, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I've always used {{<a href="../../../v/b/l/Template%7EVblock_7b6e.html" title="Template:Vblock">vblock</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../g/b/l/Template%7EGBlock_0fd4.html" title="Template:GBlock">GBlock</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandalblock_23dd.html" title="Template:Vandalblock">vandalblock</a>}}. I see an equivalent for vblock, but the other two seem to not be there. That's my only (tiny) concern. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 01:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have justified that all 4 photos in there are from the album "The Christmas Collection" and could you please tell me why you removed them? I said remove this one - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CarlosS.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CarlosS.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CarlosS.jpg</a> but it was not removed&#160;; yet you removed 4 photos in the member pages. Why? I replied to ODEN telling him its ok to remove one of the photos which has no link (the link above) but not 4 photos in the Il Divo's member page. May I know by who and how all this decisions were made? Please buy The CHRISTMAS COLLECTION to see the photos in the cover booklet as pages given in that site before you remove them. I have given the justification but did not received any comments from the admin. I believe I deserve some answers or justifications before the photos been removed.- Jay 04:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But, did you read my reply and Robert's statement? Those photos are from the CD cover of THE CHRISTMAS COLLECTION at page 2,3,4 and 5 and I have justified it at each photo pages.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I saw your comment "I'd blacklist them all" in the WikiProject_Spam#SEO_world_championship talk, and would say: yes, my site (earth-globalwarming-awareness2007.com) is listed in this article, and no, I never submitted my URL here nor asked anyone to put my URL in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In this case, someone thought he could help french contestants by spamming Wikipedia with the list of all french pages. It was a bad idea, but a solo initiative: he did not take advice from any webmaster of any of the concerned sites.</p>
<p>Have you ever imagined that a malvolant webmaster could try to harm other competitors pages by getting them blacklisted wherever he can?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion about blocking</span></h2>
<p>Dear Alphachimp,</p>
<p>Sorry we didn't meet under better circumstances. I published some external links that I believe are very useful to <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_Heights%2C_Illinois_0270.html" title="Arlington Heights, Illinois">Arlington Heights, Illinois</a>. These links were repeatedly deleted by Milo the Mindbender. He claimed that the external links were spam. I claim that his acts are vandalism. I strongly feel that they are not spam and that they are very useful to people who follow the links from the Arlington Heights Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>The external links I published forwarded to categories in Arlingtoncards.com, which is a website that has community directories and news information about Arlington Heights. The website is a legitimate website and has been written about in two local newspapers: The Daily Herald and The Post.</p>
<p>According to my website stats, visitors who come from the Wikipedia article become return visitors and don't simply jump off. Since the directory also helps with high school reunions for a high school that is now closed, many people find the information they need because of the Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>When 'Milo' made his deletes he also botched the page because he caused one of the bullet points to start with a pipe instead of a bullet point. I felt I was legitimately repairing vandalism and that 'Milo' was personally attacking me, not trying to prevent spam. If he were trying to prevent spam because of multiple links, he could have at least left one of the links to Arlingtoncards.com. Please be advised that I limited the multiple links to one link to try to be civil, but the sole remaining link to the front page of Arlingtoncards.com was also deleted by 'Milo.'+</p>
<p>'Milo' has also deleted external links on the <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_High_School_%28Arlington_Heights%2C_IL%29_b058.html" title="Arlington High School (Arlington Heights, IL)">Arlington High School (Arlington Heights, IL)</a> that pointed readers to old homecoming pictures and pictures of the now-closed high school. How could this be spam? It is obvious that the references to the high school pictures do not point to anything commercial.</p>
<p>I responded to his threats of having me blocked by posting what I posted. His threats do not promote civility because he is twisting my efforts into accusations of spam to justify his vandalism. Neither do his deletions promote civility ... there is nothing invasive, or offensive or inaccurate about the results of those links that he deleted ... in fact, as I said , they are useful to many visitors. By the way isn't he supposed to edit for the better, not delete? And isn't he supposed to report spamming if he suspects spamming?</p>
<p>Who is really the revertor here? Isn't he the revertor for making the deletions to a state before my contributions? Wasn't I just repairing vandalism?</p>
<p>Also, a one month block seems to be above what the guidelines recommend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personal attacks — Blocks should not normally be used against general incivility or isolated incidents of personal attacks. Again, dynamic IPs: up to 24 hours. AOL IPs and range blocks: about 15 minutes, then 1-3 hours, and 24 at most, to avoid collateral damage. User accounts with persistent violations may be blocked indefinitely. Excessive reverting (3RR) — Generally 24 hours. It is helpful to leave a notice of the block on the user's talk page.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any comments or questions that you have.</p>

See, for one, <a href="../../../a/r/l/Talk%7EArlington_High_School_%28Arlington_Heights%2C_Illinois%29_14b4.html" title="Talk:Arlington High School (Arlington Heights, Illinois)">Talk:Arlington High School (Arlington Heights, Illinois)</a>. Alphachimp, if you have suggestions on how to better communicate Wikipedia policy to this editor, it would be greatly appreciated.

<dd>The attack doesn't seem that strong, but I'd probably agree with you and RKlawton that arlingtoncards.com is not an appropriate site to add. If nothing else, it doesn't directly complement the text of the articles. The argument that you're limiting the free flow of information is somewhat ludicrous. Wikipedia policies are in place to (amongst many other things) prevent the exploitation of our site to drive traffic to other websites. The fact that T54 is citing his traffic logs indicates that, at least on some level, there is promotion involved in this request. As such, I'm inclined to believe that the link should not be included. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 02:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly agree that the personal attack was relatively minor, and I absolutely was not asking you to take any admin action against T54. Very sorry if it sounded that way. I was just letting you know why I reverted the comment.

<p>Do you guys have any idea what babies you sound like? Alphachimp, maybe you missed my question or maybe it is some kind of secret code, but if you can tell me and not have to kill me, would you please tell me <b>what RVT Trolling is</b> ... inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Watching my website statistics means I am carefully checking to make sure the site is delivering what people want. I like to know that when visitors come to the website with a purpose that they are finding what they are looking for. Do the policies of Wikipedia care that visitors are satisfied with what they are looking for, or does this go by the wayside because there are misguided editors and administrators that let big egos focus on clobbering people with policy that focuses on the letter instead of the intent of the 'law.' I get the sense that you all are losing your sense of how the real world works. If I am right, you are all frantically searching your minds for a policy that you can use to block or take some kind of administration action against me like a bunch of fourth graders. I think helping me or having some humility or open mindedness is the last thing on your minds.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support in my recent RfA. I think valid criticisms were raised in areas that I need to work on, so I've withdrawn my name. I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior. Perhaps I may re-explore adminship at some point in the future, but it's a little early to consider that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Heiarchy of Blocks</span></h2>
<p>Hey. I was at first perturbed by the 31 hour block for User:209.146.26.94 that you assigned, but then decided to ramp it down to 'curious.' Is there some level of block escalation that is generally agreed upon for blocking consistent &amp; persistant vandals? In this case, 209.146.26.94 seems to have provided no value in his time since joining us in September 2005, but plenty of work for the vandal patrol. His talk page is moderately filled in (due, in part, I'm sure to people not taking the time to warn...after all, he has plenty already and hasn't stopped). So...why 31 hours following two 24 hour blocks? What would warrant a week-long block, or a month? Or even a softblock of the IP (from anonymous editing)? If there is guidance on this, can you please point me in the right direction, to satisfy my curiosity? I appreciate it. --<a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyteWolfer_61e5.html" title="User:LeyteWolfer">LeyteWolfer</a> 19:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're not blocking IPs to punish them. We're blocking them to prevent them from doing damage to Wikipedia. Short term blocks followed by vandalism demonstrate that an IP may cause damage to Wikipedia...leading to the incrementation of a block. IPs demonstrating long histories of vandalism typically have their blocks incremented. In the case of this IP, I incremented the block to the next available interval (31 hours), which typically prevents vandalism during the next day. I'm sure the next block will be longer. It's not my interest to generate work for the vandalism patrol (most of my work here is spent with countervandalism stuff), but I've also got to look after the potential that someone might legitimately want to edit from that IP.</dd>
<dd>Feel free to check my block log. I think you'll notice that I'm not hesistant in issuing long term blocks...I generally avoid it, however, unless there is a pattern of prior blocks, or a deliberately obscene or offensive personal attack.</dd>
<dd>Coincidentally, it was a softblock. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 19:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the detailed response. When you mention the next available interval (31 hours, in this case)...how does that work? You are limited to your choices? Thirty-one hours isn't an arbitrary (though common) entry, but a 'provided' escalation? Are there any guidance pages to admins that help shape the policy for admins?

<dd>(edit conflicted...response to directly above) on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_59cc.html" title="Special:Blockip">Special:Blockip</a>, there is a dropdown menu with common block lengths, as well as a field for us to add custom lengths.

I guess <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> would be such a page, but most admins just do their own thing as long as it falls within the bounds of reason. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 19:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at my initial comment again, I want to clarify that I'm not intentionally snarky. I am curious as to how admins make the decisions on blocking and I know us RC patrollers can get caught up in the moment (and see victories when a vandal is blocked).

<dd>I was thinking that an indef-soft block (if such a thing exists) would be appropriate for an IP with a long history of vandalism. Such a solution might work well with public primary and secondary schools, though it probably wouldn't work as well for AOL IPs. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:40, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflicted - response to leytewolfer) Haha, no worries. I've done a lot of RC patrol myself, both as an admin and not. I've got to balance the conflicting demands of keeping Wikipedia open for editing and preventing vandalism (key word being preventing, not punishing). I often find myself in the position of having to block 7-8 ips in progression. This only gives me the chance to review several contributions and their block log. I usually make the decision based on those two factors. My monobook shell provides me with convenient links to standard block increments (they're admin only interface), which are 24, 31, 1 week, 1 month, etc (48 is omitted from my monobook). I don't always feel it appropriate to increment from 24-&gt;1 week. This case was one of those. Does that help? <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 19:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
