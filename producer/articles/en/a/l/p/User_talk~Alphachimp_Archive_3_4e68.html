I removed the last batch of AOL IPs since they hadn't been used for the last half hour... most likely the vandal had moved on to other IPs. Please keep reporting them though.

<dd>By the way, the guy who was "sorting" protest warrior's afd was actually removing people's votes. Even if they had voted before, their actual <b>comments</b> and <b>opinions</b> were removed.</dd>

<p>( Not cure If I´m doing that right, but I don´t know how to contact you else ) Digimon: Furimon When first translating the name of Frymon, it was assumed that his name was Furimon, since that would be the direct translation of the Kanji.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding Academic Detailing</span></h2>
<p>Hey. New user to Wikipedia here. I come in peace. I made a place holder article (stub?) for Academic Detailing that was a copy from a scientific journal article (JAMA is the journal.) It was flagged to be deleted because it was copywritten. Based on my very limited understanding of copyright law, I decided to err on the side of caution and take it down, replacing it with (mostly) original text. I don't think that this is vandalism.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the conscientious reply. I'm posting this on both my and your talk page, but it would be a little bit easier if you replied on mine. We can't make "placeholders" for articles that we don't have any content for. A stub would be something like a few sentences long, and that would be just fine.</dd>
<dd>As for copying out of JAMA (I have a little bit of experience with it), it is a copywritten journal. I doubt that they grant the right to reproduce their content. Even so, Wikipedia is not (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) just a collection of source materials.</dd>
<dd>As for the vandalism warning...you removed a speedy deletion notice from the page when you reworded it. It is never, ever acceptable to remove a speedy delete unless you are an administrator or the person that added it.</dd>
<dd>The other warning was for adding redirects to your article.</dd>
<dd>I hope that makes things a little bit more clear. Don't let this scare you off. Wikipedia is a pretty open and nice place. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 17:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">National Post ownership</span></h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia:Five pillars "Wikipedia uses the neutral point-of-view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view; presenting each point of view accurately; providing context for any given point of view, so that readers understand whose view the point represents; and presenting no one point of view as "the truth" or "the best view." It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics."</p>
<p>There are two different opinions on the root cause of the infamous article in the National Post newspaper about "2006 Iranian sumptuary law controversy". Only an official National Post explanation is presented currently on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be beneficial for wikipedia readers to know that "Asper was above anything else an unabashed Zionist and a proud Jew" (according to CBC <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20031007.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20031007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20031007.html</a>)? This information might help to better understand the probable origin of this error. Is such reference to a government owned Canadian media corporation acceptable at Wikipedia?</p>
<p>I am asking these questions because my original modification was removed by Alphachimp: "17:45, 18 June 2006 Alphachimp m (Reverted edits by 216.99.56.17 (talk) to version 56571174 by Trooperscoop using VandalProof) "</p>

<dd>It would be appropriate to do so in a more reasonable context, for instance if you stated "The owners have stated on multiple occasions that their Jewish background plays a significant part in their choice of editorial positions." or something like that. Just inserting the adjective that they are Jewish, however, seems to be both racist and a personal attack. See <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a>, specifically "Using someone's affiliations as a means of dismissing or discrediting their views — regardless of whether said affiliations are mainstream or extreme."</dd>
<dd>I'm not trying to censor your opinion or prevent you from expressing your view. I'm just trying to get it expressed in a more thoughtful and understanding manner.</dd>
<dd>Let me know if you have any questions or problems with what I'm saying. I have mirrored these comments on both my and your talk page, but it would be best if you replied on my talk page.

<p>Hi Alphachimp, is this a politically correct version?</p>

<p>The following Larry Zolf quote might be helpful in understanding the root cause of the infamous "Iranian sumptuary law" publication by the National Post: "Asper was above anything else an unabashed Zionist and a proud Jew. ...

<dd>Looked pretty simple to me. "New user" pops up, starts editing an IP user talk page (dare I guess his IP?), retaliates for latest warning to that IP user, then wanders off and continues edits related to previous edits by (gasp) IP User:82.182.82.20.

<p>Alphachimp, please do me a favor and stay in this Talk page to make this discussion easier to follow (I'll have you on my Watch list). Please read the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> policy. I think you may be confusing it with <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. There are some important distinctions between them. For prod, <i>anyone</i> (anon IP or not) may remove the notice, and it is <i>highly recommended</i> to explain why in the Edit note. If the original prod inserter still believes the deletion is justified, it is his/her prerogative to follow up with an AFD nomination, but <i>never</i> by re-inserting the prod notice. OTOH, with AFD, only Admins may remove it, after some due process, the shortest of which is 'Speedy Keep'. Please note that these are important distinctions, and I have no ax to grind at all with you - you seem to be interested in doing the right thing, which is very much appreciated. If you still think I am wrong after having read the relevant policies, please feel free to follow up.

<ul>
<li>If you mean "does removing a prod without an Edit note" break the <i>recommendation</i> of the desirability of an Edit note, then yes you are right. But forgetting to include an Edit note can be an oversight (remember <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>), and even if someone <i>intentionally</i> leaves no note - that would still not rise to the level of vandalism, which has a fairly high threshold. Two critical things to remember about term 'vandalism': you have to be absolutely convinced the editor <i>in his/her own mind</i> wanted to <i>reduce the quality</i> of the article, and you want to use the term <i>as sparingly as possible</i>, remembering always <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:37, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You always use the wikilink as shown for month, day, year, no matter how many times it's present. This is because the purpose of doing so is not actually to link to something, but to enable people to set their preferences so that the date is displayed in the format they choose. (You can do this in your preferences settings - try it out.) There has been discussion somewhere that this is confusing (as you've found), and then incorrectly encourages people to wikilink partial dates—such as just the year—as a matter of course, which should not be done. Then someone, like <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">User:Rich Farmbrough</a> has to go round de-linking them as here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mel_Kenyon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60167589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mel_Kenyon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60167589" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<p>Excuse me, May I ask you something? Because I have some questions on Wikipedia. Today, I've noticed that there is the sentence at the top of the pages. Like this. Early registration for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimania_2006.html" title="Wikimania 2006">Wikimania 2006</a> is open until July 9. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarships.html" title="Scholarships">Scholarships</a> are available;applications are due by June 28. Could you explain to me what the top means? I'm just curious. So, answer in my talk-page. Please. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel5127_dec3.html" title="User:Daniel5127">*~Daniel~*</a> 04:05, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good question. I checked it out a day or so ago when the message first popped up. Wikimania is an annual conference held by Wikimedia, the parent foundation of Wikipedia. The purpose appears to be to increase relationships and cooperation between members of the different Wiki projects (e.g. Wictionary, Wikipedia, etc.). Early registration helps them to better plan the event...hence the discount. There also appears to be a *massive* discount for active members of Wikipedia (something like 60-70%). As for the scholarships, they cover travel to the event. I'm not sure what the selection criteria is. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AWB clean-up tag on John Rowan (psychologist)</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I saw that a clean-up tag had been inserted into the article I entered on John Rowan(psychologist). I'm new to Wikipedia. Can you tell me what that clean-up tag means. I don't understand what about the article isn't adequate. I notice that the tag has a "June" date - is there a time-sensitive nature to the tag? Thanks, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">SteveWolfer</a> 22:43, 23 June 2006 (UTC) p.s. - shouldn't there be a 'root' page for "John Rowan" where you could chose between a page for John Rowan(congressman) and John Rowan(psychologist)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let me start off by welcoming you to Wikipedia. I hope that you enjoy it here and decide to stay.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The cleanup tag indicates, as it says, that the page needs to be changed to meet Wikipedia standards. You can find an exhaustive list of these standards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_style_guidelines" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_style_guidelines" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The time stamp, as applied by me, is a convention for indicating the age of the cleanup task. Sometimes very old articles for cleanup are prioritized for cleanup. Having these month specific categories also reduces congestion to the general Cleanup category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are completely right about there needing to be a "root" page for the two John Rowans. On wikipedia, this is called a disambiguation page. They're pretty simple to make, and you can find more about them <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">here</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Specifically, the article for John Rowan is lacking in that it doesn't interwiki link (that occurs when you place double brackets around the title of another article within the text of your article), fails to assert notability in accordance with <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>, reads like a list of accomplishments (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), and does not use proper section headings. It's kind of hard to understand these things with words, so it might help to take a look at the <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured Articles</a>. They're a great model to work off of when refining an article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would encourage you not to get discouraged about this. Let me know if you want any help or if you have any further questions. It would be more convenient for you to respond on my talk page. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 23:20, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rightfully, you noticed an image ([[Image:Bruceflex.jpg]]) with an invalid copyright tag nearing it’s deletion date (June 23, 2006). Exercising the <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Be Bold</a> policy, you replaced it with a rightfully sourced image. Screenshots from movies are classified as “Fair Use” under US Copyright Law. Up to this point, I completely support your edits.</dd>
<dd>Soon later you noticed that <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> had reverted your changes. Incorrectly, you chose to engage in a revert war with him, violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. You tracked Revolver’s changes and made reverts like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imjin_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60435635" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imjin_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60435635" rel="nofollow">this</a> to undo his work. This was followed by more reverting, etc.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, Revolver posted 3RR warnings on your talk page. Feeling that these were unjust, you blanked them. DVD-RW, an Admin, reverted your changes. You them blanked his changes and I reverted you, leading to these posts.</dd>
<dd><b>RevolverOcelotX</b></dd>
<dd>Reviewing your talk page, I can see that you have somewhat of a history of violating the 3RR. You seem to have done some tracking of anon guy and are reverting his changes.</dd>
<dd><b>My Opinion</b></dd>
<dd>Anon guy was right to change the picture in the Bruce Lee article. Admittedly, it would have been more diplomatic were it discussed on the talk page 1st. He was completely wrong in reverting Revolver’s changes, wrong in erasing talk page warnings (even if they are unsubstantiated or from a non-neutral party), and especially wrong in engaging in personal attacks. He was also wrong in posting comments by someone else on Revolver’s talk page (extremely misleading).</dd>
<dd>Revolver was wrong in engaging in a revert war on the Bruce Lee article, wrong in engaging in a revert war across other articles (although I feel your edits were good, you should have contacted somebody else), engaging in personal attacks, and especially wrong in modifying anon guy’s comments.</dd>
<dd><b>My Recommendation</b></dd>
<dd>I think the best solution is for you both to leave each other alone. Wikipedia is a pretty big place, so it should not be that hard, especially is anon guy starts using his username.
<dl>
<dd>Do not revert each other’s changes under any circumstances. If it is blatantly false, trust that another user will revert it (or contact another user to revert it).</dd>
<dd>Do not post on each other’s talk pages (especially warnings).</dd>
<dd>Do not engage in personal attacks. I cannot stress this enough.</dd>
<dd>Do not modify each other’s comments.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, as much space as you two can put between each other is better. I’m willing for my talk page to remain a place where you can have open dialogue/argument. Just stop resorting to personal attacks and comment modification. It’s not helping anything. I’ll contact the blocking admin tomorrow to see about getting anon guy’s page unblocked.</dd>
<dd>I hope that helps, guys. You both seem like great, intelligent, editors, and I would hate to see this take you away from this project. Feel free to post any comments or disagreements with my thoughts below (sorry this is so long).</dd>

<p>Alphachimp, you asked for my thoughts. My comment is that the anonymous user is not acting productively but this must always be considered in the context of RevolverOcelotX's equally provocative and uncivil behavior. He uses any opportunity he has to instigate and exacerbate wars, many of which he initiates, over the most trivial of things. The very latest case in point was his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60457604&amp;oldid=60457411" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60457604&amp;oldid=60457411" rel="nofollow">removal</a> of the anon's comments from his talk page on the basis that <i>my</i> comments (which were truncated, but attributed) were posted by the anon, which is a common practice on Wikipedia. So not only does he delete the quote of <i>mine</i>, he deletes the quote of the <i>anon</i>. This is uncivil behavior that only serves to escalate the situation. There is an unfortunate tendency of some users to judge a user much more lenient if they are using a registered name at the moment rather than editing anonymously, but observers and those who must intervene should carefully consider the facts of the dispute rather than simply the visibility of the parties involved. <a href="../../../y/i/n/User%7EYINever_743d.html" title="User:YINever">YINever</a> 07:20, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../y/i/n/User%7EYINever_743d.html" title="User:YINever">YINever</a> is clearly biased against me over content disputes and edit wars in the past and this <b>must</b> be considered in the context of YINever's comments. Now removing the User:71.124.114.26's quote is completely legitimate because User:71.124.114.26 DID NOT make that comment and posting it is extremely misleading. An admin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60440175&amp;oldid=60439993" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60440175&amp;oldid=60439993" rel="nofollow">supported</a> my actions here when User:71.124.114.26 tried to post a similar misleading comment that he DID NOT make. However, I would have restored the comment that User:71.124.114.26 made himself after I had reverted, but User:71.124.114.26 has re-inserted this himself before I had a chance, so this is irrelevant. The "uncivil behavior" that <a href="../../../y/i/n/User%7EYINever_743d.html" title="User:YINever">User:YINever</a> accuses me of is false and this is bias on YINever's part.

<dd>I don't think that it's appropriate to post another user's comment on a talk page, unless it is <b>heavily</b> attributed. It's very important that no user gets the idea that another user has posted something that he has not. The problem with the Wikipedia engine is that it is just too easy to assume that that user actually made that post on that page. Revolver, despite it being innapropriate, I don't think removing the anonymous user's quote using my same text is a good idea. Let someone else do it. Coincidentally, I did have the anonymous vs. registered user thing in mind as I read the contributions. It was just far simpler to look at the contributions from the anonymous side (I looked at both though).</dd>
<dd>I agree with you that the anon user violated the policies on his talk page by removing warnings. That's why it's locked to anonymous editors. For the short term, I would suggest that you both stay away from each other, especially eachother's talk pages and reverting eachother's changes. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 16:06, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Whether or not the Taiwanese are Chinese, I am extremely troubled by the edits going on, particularly on Hustla's talk page. The 3RR was clearly violated by both of you there. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">simple look</a> makes it perfectly clear. NPOV may also have been violated, but 3RR is a much more "hard and fast" rule.</dd>

<dd>Bonafide, it is never acceptable to remove warnings from your talk page. Even when these warnings are clearly false, reverting them is blatant vandalism that frequently results in blocking. Engaging in a revert war in response to warnings reverted is even worse.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Revolver...I hate to say it, but you too have a pattern of inflammatory edits. Reverting someone's changes repeatedly up to the 3RR limit across Wikipedia is highly, highly inflammatory. You did it last night with anon guy and seem to have done it before.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That being said, I think you both have a lot to offer, but you need to be careful with your edits. Reverting someone's changes should really only be done when they are blatant vandalism or mistakes (e.g. page blanking). Engaging in a delibrate pattern of reversions will only serve to create animosity and blocks/bans.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I recommend that you guys do not post on each other's talk pages, particularly warnings. Any existing warnings should <b>stay there</b>. Instead of removing them, place a note as to why you disagree with them, accompanied by links to allow users to easily follow your point. If you have an editing dispute, contact me or another neutral party to take a look. I'd be open to any further questions or comments from either of you, and would encourage you to use my talk page as a neutral place for dialogue.</dd>
