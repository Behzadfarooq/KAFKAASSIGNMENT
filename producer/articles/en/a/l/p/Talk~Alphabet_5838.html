<p>I would find it hard to support the statement that the letters of the alphabet represent (or approximate) <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoneme.html" title="Phoneme">phonemes</a>. In English, due to its historical development, this is hardly the case. There are, supposedly, at least seven phonemes represented by "gh." In Italian, this statement has more validity.</p>
<p>The language ends up being very far from phonetic, but it's evidently organized on such principles. The letters generally have one or two primary sounds associated with them, so that when we see a new word we can usually guess about how it sounds, or transcribe foreign words into English. There are exceptions a lot of the time, but they are still the exceptions rather than the rule, I'd say. Maybe the best way to sum it up is: English is written with the Roman alphabet.&#160;;)</p>
<p>PS - a quick search finds /g/ as in ghost, /gh/ as in doghouse, /f/ as in enough, /p/ as in hiccough, /w/ as in plough, /h/ as in Callaghan, and if you accept them, /k/ as in lough, /θ/ as in Keighley. Also it can show up as part of /ng/ or /ngh/ or as //, as in light. Tolkien used it to represent /γ/, but he was clearly being ridiculous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not ridiculous at all. This is how Swahili and many <s>other</s> transcription systems for languages with that sound (like most Arabic transliterations for example) use the digraph "gh", so that k:g::kh:gh, i.e. "k" has the same relation to "g" (<a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonation.html" title="Phonation">phonation</a>) as "kh" (/x/) has to "gh". In fact, I don't believe there is any other frequently-used way to write that phoneme in the Latin alphabet (excluding IPA). <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Livajo</a> 16:21, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Question: Anybody know what this alphabet is called, and if it's already included:</p>
<p>A Alpha B Bravo C Charlie D Delta E Echo F Foxtrot</p>
<p>Answer: <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nato_phonetic_alphabet.html" title="Nato phonetic alphabet">Nato phonetic alphabet</a>. It is a so-called "phonetic" alphabet, not to be confused with the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>. There are various "phonetic" alphabets of that kind.

<p>I don't think Tolkien was being that ridiculous when choosing "gh" to represent the voiced "kh" or the fricative of "g". A couple other languages do that. Besides, it fits: k voices to g; kh voices to gh. <i>I was kidding - I think it is completely reasonable, far more so than any of the actual options except g+h.</i></p>
<p>If syllabaries cannot have parallelism between sound and symbol (otherwise they would be called <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abugida.html" title="Abugida">abugidas</a>), can alphabets have parallelism between sound and symbol (such as a predictable mutation of the symbol from stop to fricative to nasal to semivowel or from voiced to voiceless)? --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamian_Yerrick_2a18.html" title="User:Damian Yerrick">Damian Yerrick</a></p>

<dd>No, the kana are definitely syllabaries.

<p>How about mentioning the Phoenicians? Their name was adopted for the word "phonetic" and other similar words, much like "alpha" and "beta" for "alphabet".</p>
<p>Also, why is the alphabet ordered "abcdefg..." and not "etoani..." or some other arrangement? From what I have read, the symbols were associated with objects. For instance, A is upsidedown from the original Phoenician symbol which was a line drawing of an ox's head, B ("beta" in Greek, "beth" in Phoenician) was for "house", C came from "gimel" which is "camel" and is a line drawing of a camel's head (Greek letter "Gamma"), and D is for "door", as in the triangular shaped door of a tent (Greek letter "Delta"), and so on. These symbols were grouped according to subject matter presumably to make memorization of the alphabet easier. The first group is for domestic objects. Other groups concerned travel, especially on the sea, or monetary ideas, for some 5(?) groups in all. (Don't recall how many groups and what categories they were.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can tell, the word "phonetic" is unrelated to "Phoenician". The element "phone" means sound or speach, as in "telephone", and has Indo-European roots. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a></dd>

<p>The following from this article seems to me erroneous, or at least incomplete:</p>

<dd>In modern linguistic usage, the term Latin alphabet is usually used to refer to the modern derivations from the alphabet used by the Romans (i.e. the Roman alphabet).</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
       A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
</pre>
<p>"Modern variations from the alphabet used by the Romans" include Norwegian (30 characters), Italian (22 characters), Spanish (29 characters), etc. And, for that matter, I'm pretty sure, the actual "Latin" alphabet had no J, no U, no Y, no Z. Every single article on a character uses this phrase <i>Latin alphabet</i>, but this is nothing but the <i>English alphabet</i>. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> 03:41, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may have some logic on your side - but not all. The important thing is actual use in the field, and in this case, the term latin alphabet is widely used for these 26. The alphabets with more letters which blend into this sets, are called Latin-derived alphabets, see also <a href="../../../a/l/p/Category%7EAlphabetic_writing_systems_99ea.html" title="Category:Alphabetic writing systems">Category:Alphabetic writing systems</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_writing_systems.html" title="List of writing systems">List of writing systems</a>.

<dd>Quite correct. The Latin alphabet has evolved. One can refer to the Latin alphabet meaning characters used only in writing Latin words. But modern Church Latin and legal Latin writing <i>normally</i> distinguishes <i>u</i> from <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> from <i>i</i> and may use <i>w</i> and <i>ø</i> and other characters for spelling of personal names and place names. There are various extended Latin alphabets used for different languages. If I were comparing Norwegian to Russian, I might say that Norwegian is normally written using the Latin alphabet and Russian is normally written using the Cyrillic alphabet. That would usually be good enough. I might more pedantically say that the Norwegian alphabet is an extended form of the old Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet is derived from the original Cyrillic alphabet.</dd>
<dd>There is a tendency in modern discussion to be more precise by using the word <i>script</i> rather than <i>alphabet</i> when referring to styles of characters and to use <i>alphabet</i> to refer to particular sets of letters within that script, to say that the Norwegian alphabet uses the Latin script and the Russian alphabet uses the Cyrillic script. The Unicode standard uses <i>script</i> in this way.</dd>
<dd>The 26-letter alphabet given in this article is indeed the standard English alphabet but it is not <i>only</i> the English alphabet.</dd>
<dd>It is also the French alphabet as taught in French schools (even though <i>k</i> and <i>w</i> are not used in modern spelling of native French words) and it is the German alphabet (<i>ß</i> is not counted as a separate <i>letter</i> and is not used at all in Swiss German). It is also the alphabet used in international standards for codes intended for international use. It is obviously a Latin alphabet in the sense that it is not a Greek alphabet or a Cyrillic alphabet or a runic alphabet or an ogham alphabet or any other kind of alphabet.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The International Phonetic Alphabet is similarly usually classed as a Latin alphabet, even though it includes some Greek characters, because it primarily uses Latin script letter forms or forms obviously derived from Latin script letter forms.</dd>

<dd>If I remember things right, I looked up when I was wondering about this, it was decided to use <i>alphabet</i> over <i>script</i> for articles about writing systems (<a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_alphabet.html" title="Tamil alphabet">Tamil alphabet</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_alphabet.html" title="Hebrew alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a>), because it is the most common term and users would search for it more often.

<dd>I think the edit I've just made should cover <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a>'s quite reasonable comments. It is confusing that "Latin alphabet" can mean both the alphabet in which Latin is written and any variation of that alphabet. That should be explained. One would like a term like "Latinoid alphabet" or "Latinate alphabet" or "Latinish alphabet". I don't really like tagging on that discussion of ligatures and diacritics. But without it some readers are going to quite reasonably start asking about French <i>œ</i> and German <i>ß</i> and about diacritics, questioning the claim that the English, French, and German alphabets are identical.</dd>
<dd><i>Script</i> is indeed a bothersome term which I think is only beginning to work its way into general consciousness in phrases like "Latin script" and "Arabic script". But alphabets can also be written in scripts, for example the Latin alphabet can be written in the Lombardic script, Carolingian script, Uncial script (and various variety scripts within those scripts). We don't have good heirarchical teriminology in English in this area.</dd>

<p>I have recast this section more along the lines of a hypothesis, rather than something widely accepted as fact- unless anyone can demonstrate that this is accepted as rote by academics in the field. I had not previously been familiar with this theory, which at first glance read like something dated and Eurocentric in outlook (though Logan himself apparently takes some pains to deny the Eurocentrism charge, and the implication that Western achievements are superior to non-Western). A quick skim through one of the texts quoted (for some reason, available online in full <a href="http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/JPU_200Y/Logan_Book/Table-of-Contents.html" class="external text" title="http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/JPU_200Y/Logan_Book/Table-of-Contents.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) reveals a few egrarious errors (perhaps casually made, not necessarily fatal to the thesis) such as <i>The Mesoamerican writing system, only four hundred years old at the time the conquistadors arrived in the sixteenth century, is thought to have never evolved beyond its original pictographic/ideographic stage</i>(p.9), and generalisations like <i>It is a fact, however, that Chinese thinking is considerably more concrete and practical and less abstract than Western thought which has been one of the factors that allowed it to contribute as much to world culture as it has...</i>(p.43) which seem to be challengeable to me. I have no objection at all to this theory being documented here, but the content could probably be updated to reflect more precisely what is claimed, and in addition annotate any academic criticisms. Does anyone know of any such critiques? --<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 02:30, 2005 July 26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many of the great advances of Western civ. were Chinese; it was an arbitrary political decision in the Chinese court, plus the unity of China that allowed that decision to be enforced, that was the prime reason that China did not conquer the world beyond Eurasia rather than Europe. Attributing Europe's success to the alphabet or "concrete thinking" is silly; if China had conquered the world, that would be held as evidence that the simplistic alphabet is only suitable for inferior minds. There's another likely explanation for the connection (if there even is a connection): polities on the edge of civilization are diverse and not hampered by bureaucratic inertia, and so it is more likely that one of them will take an advance and run with it. Without a well educated elite to master a logography, they're also more likely to use alphabetic scripts. Coincidence, not cause and effect. To demonstrate this claim would require a good deal of historical investigation, and few departments, let alone individuals, would be up to the task even assuming such evidence has been preserved. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 04:50, 2005 July 26 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a>, I agree with you on every point. The theory as originally presented here seemed manifestly wrong-headed, and in researching Logan's work just now I still find it very unconvincing (although the actual claims made by Logan &amp; his mentor McLuhan are more subtle and less black'n'white than its summary given here). The base idea seems to stem from Innis &amp; McLuhan's theories that the medium of communication has an active (not just passive) contributary part towards the shaping of perception and thought processes ("the medium is the message"). Actually I don't doubt this is true to an extent, but I do doubt that the magnitude and scope of this influence could ever be reliably demonstrated, in isolation from the many other influences. Logan seems to then extend this pop analysis to award alphabetic systems a starring role in the formation of Western thought (whatever that is), alongside codified law, monotheism, abstract science, and deductive logic. His comparisons with non-Western (principally Chinese) "systems of thought" are based on gross generalisations, and omission of contrary views (such as the neat counterexample you have provided, the Hammurabai code). Amusingly, when explaining the result of studies which show that it takes no longer for a child to learn to write in Chinese systems (with many characters to learn) than it does a child to write in an alphabetic system (with few), he claims that this is because Western children are also learning "...the intellectual by-products of the alphabet, such as abstraction, analysis, rationality, and classification" - by implication, Chinese children do not (?!).</p>
<p>I should like to find some notable source which refutes these and other claims, even though their very enunciation should be enough to flag them as ill-formulated and incapable of being demonstrated. --<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 06:51, 2005 July 26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that would be nice. But then the reputable sources probably just ignore stuff like this as not worth their time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your other points, I seriously doubt Chinese children learn to read as quickly as children learning an alphabet. (English is not a good exemplar, how about Spanish, Russian, Hindi, or Korean?) Certainly the time involved is much greater. Also, once people leave school they tend to forget how to write very quickly. Last I heard (10 yrs ago?), the literacy rate in China was about 10% (the standard being able to read a newspaper), while the rate in Cuba was 100%, and knowing how to read did not mean being able to write (I mean not even knowing how to form the characters needed to put words on paper, not how to organize a thesis). <i>However</i>, once you learn, it's much easier to read in Chinese than in Spanish (or so it seems to me). The script is very efficient that way, and we spend most of our time reading rather than writing, if that counts for anything. As only a small fraction of the population could read in any country, the years required to learn probably didn't matter as much as today, with our ideal of universal education. If reading is more efficient in a logographic script, don't you think people might read more? Wouldn't that advance civilization?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But abstraction? Bof. True, segmental scripts don't come as naturally as syllabaries, but a five-year-old can comfortably get the concept long before they're capable of much abstraction or rational thought, so it can't take much. I bet Hindu numerals made a far greater difference to Europe than the alphabet. And I notice people making these claims always seem to throw in monotheism. Do they honestly believe that Yahweh, riding in a storm cloud, breathing fire and throwing thunderbolts, is more abstract than the illusion of reality in Hinduism? Or more advanced morally, when you must convert to what I believe or die? (If fewer gods is more abstract and more advanced, then atheism should be the most advanced of all, but somehow atheistic and tolerant religions like Buddhism don't get top billing.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I grew up with the idea that the Greeks invented the alphabet, and this was one of the greatest acheivements of man. (According to my history books, there were no women before Betsy Ross.) Turns out all they did was be incapable of pronouncing pharyngeal and glottal consonants, so <i>alif</i> etc. ended up starting with a vowel rather than a consonant, which fit their language better. I'm not knocking Greek advances in mathematics and logic, which were fantastic, but the alphabet?? Anyway, it was the Egyptians who invented the alphabet, but it was relegated to uses like <i>zhuyin</i> in Taiwan. I think we should say something to the effect that this idea is unsupported, perhaps unsupportable, and might all be nonsense, like you suggest. Though, like you, I'd be more comfortable if I could present this as something more than my own prejudice. I think it's important to leave the hypothesis (not 'theory', which implies evidence) in, as I feel the article will be more informative with a debunking of it than without it being mentioned at all. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 10:24, 2005 July 26 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed a line in the Spelling section about the Italian language since it said a wrong fact: that there's no word for "to spell" in Italian . There actually is one, "compitare", but for the reason explained in the text , no one seem to know it :) This is the new sentence: The <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian language</a> verb corresponding to 'spell', <i>compitare</i> is unbeknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never nedeed: a correct pronunciation exactly corresponds to a correct <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthography.html" title="Orthography">orthography</a>.</p>

<dd>I suppose if we're going to be specific, we should actually name the letter. My phrase 'one of the long els' is bad style: It sounds specific, but doesn't have much actual content. The identity of the letter didn't seem important to me (people can always look it up on the Devanagari article), so I changed the comment, but please go ahead and specify the letter if you feel it would be of interest.</dd>

<dd>You could also argue that English is not an alphabet because it doesn't have letters for /θ/ or many of its other sounds. But no script is completely phonemic. Classical Greek is the prototype of a true alphabet, and it has unnecessary letters for /ks/ and /ps/, but is also missing letters for /a:/, /i:/, and /y:/. The defining feature of an alphabet is that it is <i>segmental</i> - that is, that it has symbols for consonants and-or vowels rather than syllables or morphemes. English (like Greek) clearly fits that definition. But English (like all other alphabets I know of) is also partially logographic: &amp; (the '27th letter of the alphabet'), %, #, $, @, the numerals, and the letters themselves when used in words like HQ or T-shirt. But the essence of the system is still alphabetic. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 18:40, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I would just like to point the fact that there are no mention of the oriental languages (chinese, japanese, corean,...) in the historic of the main page. Shouldn't we put "Historic of <b>Occidental</b> Alphabet"? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKastorleduc_61e3.html" title="User:Kastorleduc">Kastor</a> 07:28, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

None of the languages you mention uses an alphabet. They are among the languages refered to by the following sentences from the article:<br />
"There are other <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writing_system.html" title="Writing system">systems of writing</a> such as logosyllabic writing, in which each symbol represents a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morpheme.html" title="Morpheme">morpheme</a>, or word or a syllable or places the word within a category, and <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllabary.html" title="Syllabary">syllabaries</a>, in which each symbol represents a <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable.html" title="Syllable">syllable</a>. "<br />
"Some human languages are commonly written by using a combination of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logograms.html" title="Logograms">logograms</a> (which represent <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphemes.html" title="Morphemes">morphemes</a> or <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">words</a>) and syllabograms instead of an alphabet."<br />

<p>I think the section entitled <b>The Alphabet Effect</b> should be moved to its own page, leaving a link in the <b>See also</b> section. There are all kinds of subjects peripherally connected to the concept of an alphabet, but they don't belong on the main page. We could write forever about substitution ciphers, Morse Code, the Braille alphabet and so on. This page should be reserved for material about the alphabet itself, not what it means according to somebody's theory of world history. I didn't add the {{controversial}} tag, but I agree with it. The material should be moved elsewhere. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 16:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
