<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abbreviations.</span></h2>
<p>None of the abbreviations (APO, APhiO, APhiQ, APhiQue, AFW) is actually official with the National Fraternity. While APO is most used, both APhiO and APhiQ/APhiQue are both used by subsets of the active recognized chapters. Howard University's chapter (Zeta Phi) uses APhiQ and is certainly a recognized visited chapter.</p>
<p>AFW, OTOH, as an abbreviation is an artifact of the common symbol font representing Phi as F (which isn't too bad) and Omega as W (which is horrendous). The only reason that it is there is a brother who contributed to wikipedia said there was a survey at the National Convention that asked "What abbreviation does your chapter use?" which had AFW as a choice. Not sure why.</p>

<dd>I would recommend keeping <i>APO</i>, <i>APhio</i>, and <i>APhiQ</i>. <i>AFW</i>, in my opinion, is just plain silly since it's not really a true abbreviation of Alpha Phi Omega at all; it just appears to be some computer geek pointing out the keyboard combinations used to denote APhiO in the symbol font,... But seriously, how many chapters to you see out there using <i>AFW</i> on rush flyers and other documents in the chapter as an abbreviation?!?! <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 18:07, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I was the person who added it, and I agree that AFW is rather odd. But it was definitely one of the options on a survey at the national convention in 2002 that was published in the Lightbearer. I don't know where it came from originally. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 18:52, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I don't doubt that it was one of the options on a survey at a convention (I think I remember the survey, too), just because something appears on a survey of possible abbreviations doesn't make it a notable abbreviation. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 19:46, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't remember the exact numbers, and obviously it wasn't scientific, but I think it had nearly the same percentage return on the survey as did APhiQ. Maybe someone should try to dig up the Lightbearer (that is it's name right?) from that convention and see what the results were. That might lend some credence, or remove it entirely from contention. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 20:01, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, talked to Judy Mitchell about the issue. Her quote on AFW was something like "So far out into Left field as to be rediculous". She says APO is used by the majority of chapters, but that APhiO is used by a reasonable sized minority. APhiQ(ue) is used by the chapters and alumni of the chapters at the Historically Black schools (About a dozen active chapters and probably double that inactive).</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Randy and Judy on this one. "AFW" just simply doesn't belong. Furthermore, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=AFW&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=AFW&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google Search for AFW</a> doesn't reveal anything having anything even remotely to do with Alpha Phi Omega, though it does reveal several meanings of the AFW abbreviation. As far as "Viking" goes, I don't consider that an abbreviation at all, and definitely shouldn't be mentioned with the abbreviations at the top. Maybe it could be mentioned with the all-male chapters, but even that doesn't seem to fit, since the other all-male chapters don't use that terminology. I'd probably put "Viking" in the interesting but non-notable category. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 14:51, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the changes made by bornyesterday. Well, there are **lots** of hits for "Alpha Phi Omega" and AFW in google, but all of them, when you actually look at the page, are actually *greeked* so as to enable the web page writer to include the greek letters in the text. As for "viking", I could see someone writing up a web page for the viking chapters and having an appropriate link from the main Alpha Phi Omega page. Similarly I could see a separate page for APO-Phil.</dd>

<p>I have the Convention Lightbearer issues that had the 'survey results' that included AFW. I took it to be a joke. My experience is that APO and APhiO are both commonly used. Most seem to use APO in writing, but APhiO in speaking. (I write APO, but say 'APhiO'.) It seems a regional thing with APO vs. APhiO. As noted, APQ is used amoung HBCU Chapters, and non-Brothers who come from that tradition. --emb021</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I have yet to see APQ used, APhiQ seems to be what is used by the chapters at HBCUs. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 01:28, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yup. Not that many google hits for APQ other than the headers in that page. Whether "Aye Phi Que" or AyPhiQue or APhiQ or APhiQue depends on where I've seen it, but Jesse will use APhiQ and he is the closest to a touchstone on those chapters and Alumni I've got. Do you have any contacts with any of the MOTRS groups?
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your notes. I really don't have any formal contacts with any APQ or MOTRS groups, other then passing briefly on-line. --<a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmb021_1dab.html" title="User:Emb021">Emb021</a> 20:47, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Largest Fraternity - Bornyesterday's changes.</span></h2>
<p>Is our claim to be the largest Fraternity based on the addition of the approximately half a million brothers in APO-Phil or not? Also, in my opinion, the count of 350 chapters needs to be proceded by the the caveat of in the US, since there are about 150 chapters in APO-Phil, any suggestions here?</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 09:03, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>AFAIK, our claim of being the largest is based on our US numbers. APO-USA has more chapters and more alumni then any other GLO. --emb021</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you have to say Fraternity here, *not* GLO. I took a look at the History Honorary Phi Alpha Theta. They are up to Alpha Lambda Sigma (at least) and I think they letter the same way we do. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 01:31, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeep. I was kinda startled to see my name in a heading. All my edits did was to make the grammar work. Before them, it was a sentence fragment and unclear. The veracity of the information is something that I've been told is true for years. And I've not heard of any other organization claiming the title. - <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 19:28, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, if you google for "Largest Fraternity", Sigma Phi Epsilon comes up fairly often. We do have more charters than they do. Not sure on active chapters, active brothers or total brothers. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 00:04, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">All male chapters</span></h2>
<p>I added a brief comment about the BoD's ruling about all-male chapters in the appropriate section. I felt that it was proper to at least give some notice of the fact that there are all-male chapters is under heavy scrutiny at this time. It may or may not playout so that they have to go coed, but it seems to me that their current status is questionable, and we need to accurately represent that aspect. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 16:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>all-male in what sense? AFAIR, TTU was re-charted recently (since 2000), so they are not allowed to be all-male. If they happened to have lost all their female members, that means they are in trouble with National and need to work to recruite more women. --<a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmb021_1dab.html" title="User:Emb021">Emb021</a> 20:48, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Dillard</span></h3>
<p>I sent to the Section 45 chair and the Region VII director asking whether Dillard is all-male. I'm pretty sure it reactivated post 1986, which means it should be co-ed, but I don't know what's going on there. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 09:09, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chi Upsilon chapter at Dillard was chartered on May 23, 1971, and rechartered on November 5, 1988, according to the national office database. Since they were rechartered in 1988, after 1976, there is no possible way that they can be classified as an all-male chapter. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 15:14, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't the 1976 agreement that kept chapters from coming back all-male, it is National Board policy that was done in 1986. That having been said, Dillard must have rechartered with both Men and Women. However, I do not know whether there are currently any women who are brothers at Dillard, thus the letters I sent to the Regional Director and Sectional Chair. If I haven't gotten email back from either of them by Monday or Tuesday, I'll call the national Office.<a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 19:21, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Deletion of Wabash from all-male list.</span></h3>
<p>After talking it over on email with the Regional Director for the region that includes Wabash College and another APhiO Wikipedian, the concensus among the three of us is to delete Wabash from the list of all-male chapters. This is done in co-ordination with changing the description of the table to include only those chapters at co-education institutions. I know that this deletion has happened a couple of times anonymously, but I think this represents a decision that we can work with. Please post here if you have objections to this change. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 18:15, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thought about it, but not sure. Delta Omicron @ Wabash and Alpha Chi @ MIT (just for an example) are both recruiting from their student bodies without regards to gender. We don't even know if the Delta Omicron chapter by-laws or opinion of their brothers would cause them to pledge and initiate women if the school did go co-ed ten years from now... As for now it doesn't matter. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 13:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Prairie View A&amp;M</span></h3>
<p>At the NVC this past weekend, I had an interesting discussion with the Region VII Director, who talked about Sigma Pi Chapter at Prairie View A&amp;M. She said that the chapter had just initiated their first female member (affectionately referred to as the, "first lady.") and as such is no longer an all-male chapter. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 17:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fascinating. I know the chapter took on a line of 10 this last spring which is more than they have had in a long time, maybe having their "first lady" is part of it. The school's website doesn't help. One document has Alpha Phi Omega listed as a co-ed group, the other as an all-male group, with no indication of which is earlier. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 20:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lamar got added back into the list of all-male chapters. I know they have been all-male in the relatively recent past (2002?) Anyone got any idea if they still are? If it is, then we need to rebalance the two columns since the first is now two schools longer.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mark Dindo S. Gamboa</span></h2>
<p>This individual was recently added/removed from the list. Now, if he's not actually an honorary member, that's good. But if he did become a <i>national</i> honorary member, there's gotta be something to him, right? Does anyone know his story? Being the "first chief scout executive" of the BS-philippines, as he was originally added, sounds like a much bigger deal than being the first student at a school (next edit) or simply <i>a student</i> at a school (next edit). As this addition and subsequent edits were all done by the same IP address, I'm even more confused. Perhaps, since they were the <i>only</i> edits by this IP, it was simply a new user test? I didn't find anything on google about a "mark gamboa," for what it's worth.&#160;—&#160;<a href="../../../v/r/k/User%7EVrkaul_a410.html" title="User:Vrkaul">vijay</a> 12:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I look at the ultimate result. If you look at the first edit, it is an exact copy of Brother West just above him, with the change of name and country. He then changed other things about it until he got what he wanted. Maybe I'm too protective of the page, but anything that I don't understand that isn't properly alphabetized and ends up non-noteworthy gets tossed. Besides, if you look over at BS-Philippines, I didn't see that name in the original founders there. My guess is vandalism. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 16:50, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lists of notable alumni</span></h2>
<p>While the lists of notable alumni &amp; honorary members are notable, they are getting a bit long, to the point where a significant amount of the article about Alpha Phi Omega is just a list of notable alumni &amp; honorary members. In accordance with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">list guidelines</a>, it might be a good idea to separate these out into a separate article or two, linked via a 'see also' section. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 18:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is probably a good idea, as is splitting the list by area of notability. I finally figured out the subconcious (sp?) reason why I haven't been in favor of in the past. I'd rather keep the list of the all-male chapters as far from the top of the article as possible. Hopefully if we add enough history, it won't be as far up... BTW, Since the National Office has given verbal carte blance for the National History book to be used for any fraternity related purpose, I think we can copy it without a problem. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 19:13, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also merged the ICAPO &amp; Philippines sections into the 'organization' section, since it really does deal with the organization of APO at the international level.
