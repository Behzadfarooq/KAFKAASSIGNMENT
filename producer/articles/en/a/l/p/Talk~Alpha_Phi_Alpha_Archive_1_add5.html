<dd>The first African American fraternity was Sigma Pi Phi, founded in 1904.<a href="http://www.sigma-pi-phi.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sigma-pi-phi.net/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Sigma Pi Phi though was not founded to intially to be a collegiate fraternity. At some point prior to 1906 Sigam Pi Phi had some collegiate members, but they passed away and Sigma Pi Phi did not do this again. Sigma Pi Phi is extremely exclusive and secret so it is not well known. Alpha Phi Alpha was the first African American fraternity, which was started on the collegiate level and lasted to the present (supposidly there was one other before 1906, but it did not last long). --<a href="../../../e/h/a/User%7EEhavEliyahu_3f26.html" title="User:EhavEliyahu">EhavEliyahu</a> 00:18, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mike: "Frederick Douglas Born a slave, Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, in Talbot County, Maryland, Frederick Douglass has been called the father of the civil rights movement. He rose through determination, brilliance, and eloquence to shape the American nation. He was an abolitionist, human rights and women's rights activist, orator, author, journalist, publisher, and social reformer. Committed to freedom, Douglass dedicated his life to achieving justice for all Americans, in particular African-Americans, women, and minority groups. He envisioned America as an inclusive nation strengthened by diversity and free of discrimination. Frederick Douglas died on February 20, 1895 at Cedar Hill after attending a women's rights meeting. He became an honorary member of Omega Chapter in 1921, enjoying the distinction of being the only member initiated posthumously. It is also noted that Douglas died before the founding of the Fraternity."

Mike no disrespect but you embaking on some history that has nothing to do with you. You gave the answer to your own qusetion by stating Frederick Douglass became a honorary member. Why would you raise a question you already know the answer to? I'll agree with you to a certain point about history. You are right Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. is not the first black greek letter organization because we are not greek (you wouldn't understand this). However, to you and everyone else we are. Since you say you know history, then you would know that we are the first black collegiate fraternity. Everyone else started off as a social group just as we did. I guess you will be trying to say that you all where first in 1903(once again a social group not a fraternity). Since we are still on history if this was the case why did it only take us a year to be incorporated as a fraternity and you all 8 years (big difference for us not to be first). Also, not to ruffle any feathers about this history that you claim you know but if wasn't for the men of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. you would not be in existance for example a couple of your founders were online to be Alphas (you know who went to Howard), for two you all were founded at Indiana University which members of social group (<b>KAN</b>) sent a letter of intent to became the tenth chapter Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., which just happens to be the <b>K</b>appa chapter of <b>A</b>lpha which called themselves the <b>N</b>ew members(capital letters look familiar doesn't it), and last but not least on this brief history lesson if it wasn't for us writing and signing a check for you all, ask yourself, "Where would you be without Alpha?" P.S. Before you talk about history get your weight up.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hazing</span></h2>
<p>Once again, user Bobbydoop is continuing to use a Tripod article (that ANYONE can set up) as a verifiable source about hazing within the fraternity; that section of the article is also very biased. I have included the fraternity's official anti-hazing statement instead but Bobbydoop continues to use the "anti-hazing" website as a verifiable source when it does not cite verifiable, primary sources. What this guy is doing amounts to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>.Akhenaton06 03:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

can you dispute any of the hazing incidents? huh 06? i doubt it! <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 03:58, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The burden of proof doesn't rest with me, Bobbydoop. If you are making this claim and cite a source, then that source should be 1) verifiable and 2) give primary references. The "anti-hazing" site (a TRIPOD site) does neither. What I provided as an alternative is the fraternity's policy on hazing, while at the same time acknowledging that the organization still struggles with this issue. Not only does the hazing section of the article contain misspelled words (which is a VERY BAD reflection on the fraternity), but it is very biased ("black on black crime"?). I'm sorry if you were denied membership in the organization or have some other issue with the fraternity (and it certainly seems like that, as you have not added a "hazing" section to any other NPHC fraternity articles), but Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a launchpad for your personal vendettas. Akhenaton06 09:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
There is a hazing issue and that seems to be a strong source of verified information. If you contest information please refute it with any kind of source primary or otherwise. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.13.html" title="User:152.163.100.13">152.163.100.13</a> 13:41, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Once again, you conveniently overlook the real issue here. The issue is not about whether hazing exists in the fraternity; it's about the source you cite in regards to this (which is not verifiable, nor does it cite primary sources). Also, I have cited the fraternity's OFFICIAL position on hazing in the hazing section which you conveniently deleted. As I've stated before, Wikipedia is not the place for you to launch personal vendettas against organizations that you have problems with for one reason or another.

<p>bobbydoop's original reference indicates that the first college fraternity for african american men was established in 1906, yet he keeps referring to ALpha Phi Alpha as the second oldest fraternity. this page should reflect what the fraternity official website indicates since it should be considered the leading authority on it's own history and it concurs with what on the link that bobbydoop has listed as a reference.</p>

<p>Boobbydoop, your original reference which you have now removed because it doesn't serve your purpose states that it wasn't until 1906 that the FIRST college fraternity for african american men was established. 67.34.213.68 04:53, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's resolve this</span></h2>
<p>Bobbydoop, why do you consider the state that Alpha Phi Alpha is the first collegiate college fraternity to be incorrect? It's in the reference that you quote and this is synonomous with the Alpha official website.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sigma Pi Phi has college chapters and was founded before A PHI A. A PHI A isn't just college, they take honorary's , graduate, and non college individuals. thus they aren't purely inter collegiate. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 04:24, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And because they take graduates and non college individuals doesn't make A Phi A a professional fratrnity no more than it makes Sigma Pi Phi a collegiate fraternity. it's a professional fraternity with chapter on certain campuses. Do you dispute your own source that the first college fraternity wasn't founded until 1906? Further, Universities routinely give out honoray doctorates and JD degrees to non college persons, that doesn't change their status to anything than what they originally were "a university". same for Alpha Phi Alpha, it's a collegiate fraternity and always has been since 1906. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 04:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Alpha Phi Alpha isn't a university. Sigma Pi Phi and A PHI A are both African american fraternities. I am not saying that A PHI A isn't the first to be founded at a school, i'm saying that it isn't the first Fraternity. I believe that people should know it is the second fraternity for african americans. What i'm saying is true and is verified. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.13.html" title="User:152.163.100.13">152.163.100.13</a> 04:53, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's your personal opinion, not a fact. You can state that on your own website and/or you can add a page for Sigma Pi Phi that it's the oldest fraternity for african amercian men if you have nothing else to occupy yourself. Also, you still haven't addressed the content of your own reference that states Alpha was the first college fratenity. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 05:18, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>1) Sigma Pi Phi was founded by 6 professional men, all of whom had already graduated from college. Alpha Phi Alpha was founded by 7 college students.</li>
<li>2) Sigma Pi Phi's initial purpose was to provide social networks for professional men, not college students. Alpha Phi Alpha was strictly collegiate-based when founded.</li>
<li>3) What proof is there of Sigma Pi Phi having collegiate chapters (once again, Bobbydoop, the burden of proof rests with you)? There is a difference between having college students <i>in</i> the fraternity and having <i>collegiate chapters.</i></li>
<li>4) At any rate, Alpha Phi Alpha was the first fraternity founded <i>for</i> African American college men that successfully spread to other college campuses beyond Cornell. Sigma Pi Phi was founded <i>for</i> professional men. Although each began to expand beyond their initial targeted groups, that doesn't dispute that fact that Alpha Phi Alpha was the FIRST (inter)collegiate fraternity founded FOR African American men.</li>

<p>Alpha Phi Alpha - Sigma Pi Phi. This individual is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. Alpha Phi Alpha was founded in 1906. The fraternity call is 06. That is where Akhenaton06 gets the <b>06</b> in his name. Alpha Phi Alpha many times attempts to make the dubious claim that they are in fact the first African American Fraternity <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/Alpha.Phi.Alpha.td.html" class="external free" title="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/Alpha.Phi.Alpha.td.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/Alpha.Phi.Alpha.td.html</a>, <a href="http://www.tlu.edu/student_life/activities/organizations/greek.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tlu.edu/student_life/activities/organizations/greek.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tlu.edu/student_life/activities/organizations/greek.html</a>, <a href="http://www.stillman.edu/stillman/GreekOrg/apa.html" class="external free" title="http://www.stillman.edu/stillman/GreekOrg/apa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stillman.edu/stillman/GreekOrg/apa.html</a>.

Akhenaton06 is attempting to continue on the dubious type claim that Alpha Phi Alpha is the first black fraternity.

<p>Which all agree that the founding of Sigma Pi Phi is in 1904, 2 years before that of Alpha Phi Alpha. At least 3 of them specifically state that Sigma Pi Phi is the first Black fraternity of any kind nationwide. Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia for the promotion of the truth. By allowing a continued effort to rail road rather then spread knowledge simply undermines the integrity of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I propose since the above individuals aren't protesting the validity of the information of the founding of Sigma Pi Phi, that a compromise be made. Where the wording would be:</p>
<p><b>Sigma Pi Phi is the first fraternity founded by and for African American's nationwide (1904). Alpha Phi Alpha is the first fraternity founded by African Americans at a college (1906).</b></p>
<pre>
This would allow for a clear understanding by any and all readers as well as a balance.
</pre>
<p>this seems to be a fair compromise. can a agreement be made? <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.13.html" title="User:152.163.100.13">152.163.100.13</a> 13:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not an article about Sigma Pi Phi--someone can create this article and use the first suggestion as part of their history. There's nothing wrong or confusing about stating your place or contribution to history--each person would read <i>First Black <b>Collegiate</b> Fraternity</i>. Each fraterntiy page would need to enter the Phi Beta kappa info and Sigma Pi Phi info noted below to make eveyone clear. Each fraternity article should speak for itself, not describe the history of other organizations or how it relates to other organizations. If alpha phi alpha was not the first college fraterntity there might not have been other african american college fraternities. There's a good chance in the early 1900s that the founder of Alpha Phi Alpha had no knowledge of local professional fraternity in Philadelphia when Alpha was founded 2 years later in Ithaca, and thus was not the impetus for Alpha's founding. The fraternity looked at other intercollegiate service fraternities. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 17:06, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I challenge Bobbydoop to find any verifiable, reliable source that claims that Alpha Phi Alpha is the oldest fraternity for African American men. The claim of Alpha Phi Alpha has always been that it is the first <i>intercollegiate</i> fraternity for African American men. As has been stated SEVERAL times, this article is not about Sigma Pi Phi; it is about Alpha Phi Alpha. Akhenaton06 23:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

These sites claim it, A phi A is the oldest. One being Cornell the founding school of A phi A</p>

<p><br />
This travesty of the truth needs to be ensured to be correct. Thus Alpha Phi Alpha should be stated as beign the second oldest fraternity founded by african americans. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.239.149.9.html" title="User:24.239.149.9">24.239.149.9</a> 06:18, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Cornell website listed is a news service and it's only the headline that you disagree with. Contact this news service and have them correct the heading. The first sentence in the article is <i>Alpha Phi Alpha, the nation's first Greek <b>collegiate</b> organization established by black students at Cornell in 1906</i>, and that sentence agrees with the official fraternity website (and probably where the service got the sentence), and what most contributors in wikipedia want printed--the word "collegiate" is what's missing from the headline. Bobbydoop writes several times here that <i>Alpha Phi Alpha many times attempts to make the dubious claim that they are in fact the first African American Fraternity</i>, he conveniently omits the word "collegiate" (to confuse the mediation team and readers), which is included in all contributors text. Alpha Phi Alpha does claim to be <i>the first <b>intercollegiate</b> fraternity established for African American men</i>, notice the bold word "intercollegiate", and this is true. The question here is: "What is false about the first sentence in the cornell article? The question is NOT how someone else would same the same thing differently. (Logic: There are three children, Dick, Jane and Sally. Dick was born first, Jane second. If Jane says she is the first daughter, this is true; she also the middle child and the second child. You can't say if she chooses one over the other this confuses you, so you think she should describe herself in a manner which appeal to each indiviual reader.. 67.34.213.68 16:17, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Lets look at the bold headline. Also lets look at the other websites. Alpha Phi Alpha is the second fraternity founded by African American's. Point blank. Let's not sway from the absolute truth. Let's not attempt to use varies degrees of semantics to give off the appearance of a falsehood. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.239.149.9.html" title="User:24.239.149.9">24.239.149.9</a> 17:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The other websites are Univeristy websites and the content is controlled by that webmaster. Send them an email to correct. the official source for this article should be<a href="http://www.alphaphialpha.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.alphaphialpha.net/" rel="nofollow">Alpha Phi Alpha website</a>, if other sites don't concur, then they should be emailed the official word of the fraternity. 67.34.213.68 03:31, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The bold headline is picked by the editor, not the writer who verified the accuracy of the text, or the people contributing to the entire story. No one is asking that a headline be used as a reference (except bobbydoop). Again, the question is: What is the falsehood in the first sentence of the cornell online news article you reference? Please just answer this question. 67.34.213.68 22:33, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Alpha Phi Alpha has a biased POV for PR reasons. The hazing issue should not be downplayed. Also the question was asked as to whether or not they could find it anywhere that A PHI A was shown to be the first black fraternity. Multiple sources were found for the claim. Now you say "oooh" it's an editor issue or a webmaster issue. Please! That's simply a shotgun defense b/c you can't make a better argument. So please spell university correctly and understand that Alpha Phi Alpha is the second fraternity of it's type. Don't try to use semantics to make yourself seem like the original. It isn't! <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.239.149.9.html" title="User:24.239.149.9">24.239.149.9</a> 20:40, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here should be you answer: The History of Sigma Pi Phi (1954) written by who? The History of Alpha Phi Alpha Written by who? which was he a member of? BOTH. Is Sigma Pi Phi known as the "fraternity" or the Bolle'?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who, above is <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_H._Wesley_03a5.html" title="Charles H. Wesley">Charles H. Wesley</a> and in The History of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first sentence on Page V entitled "Preface to the First Edition", is as follows:</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">agreement</span></h2>
<p>Anyone can create any information and state it as fact. You and I both know that Sigma Pi Phi is the first black fraternity of any kind founded and still surviving in the United states. The Wikipedia page allows for links to be made and is not owned by Alpha Phi Alpha. It is an indendent page. Each fraternity article should present a whole story. Regardless of whether or not Alpha Phi Alpha had a knowledge of another black greek organization doesnt take away from the fact that one existed. Thus this information should either be what the compromise states or should be kept as</p>
<p><b>Alpha Phi Alpha is the second oldest surviving black greek letter organization.</b></p>
<p>This is a stated fact and has been verified numerous times. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.65.html" title="User:205.188.116.65">205.188.116.65</a> 17:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then you need to determine when each fraternity of any kind was created and state whether it was first, second, third, or 305th. What one fraternity is does not mean that another fraternity was not something else. The articles you referenced are not official Alpha Phi Alpha publications and you should contact those sources to correct their information. The fact that the fraternity says they are the First College Fraternity for African American men is true. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 18:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC) ´</p>

<dd>The issue of the first black fraternity is basically a moot point. I have provided layers of evidence and answered the vast majority of their questions and arguments only for them to attempt to pick it apart.

I have provided evidence of this.

If you'd like to the actual first inter collegiate black fraternity that would actually go to Alpha Kappa Nu <a href="http://web.umr.edu/~kapsi/publications/History%20of%20Kappa%20Alpha%20Psi.htm" class="external free" title="http://web.umr.edu/~kapsi/publications/History%20of%20Kappa%20Alpha%20Psi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.umr.edu/~kapsi/publications/History%20of%20Kappa%20Alpha%20Psi.htm</a> which was founded in the year 1903 <a href="http://copland.udel.edu/stu-org/nuxinupes/grandchapterhistory.html" class="external free" title="http://copland.udel.edu/stu-org/nuxinupes/grandchapterhistory.html" rel="nofollow">http://copland.udel.edu/stu-org/nuxinupes/grandchapterhistory.html</a> . So the first inter -collegiate is really a moot point.
<dl>
<dd>In terms of the hazing. It does not exist in all fraternities and sororities. It may not have begun with Alpha Phi Alpha but it permeates the fraternity to the point where it is officially stated that individuals must not do it. There are numerous cases of hazing that specifically involve the fraternity where many have died or become seriously injured <a href="http://www.anti-hazing.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.anti-hazing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anti-hazing.com/</a> . Many are repressed but there are far to many that have become public knowledge. A few of the more heinous cases should be detailed and spoken about if they directly relate to the organization. Thus this should be expanded on. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.239.149.9.html" title="User:24.239.149.9">24.239.149.9</a> 15:58, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bobbydoop is not compromising but offering the same text that is currently in the ariticle, and being disputed. He offer no website that states A-Phi-A is the "second", just his own opinion of what should be printed here. Again, we're not concerned with other sites, just wikipedia. The text "first intercollegiate fraternity for african americans" is not misleading or confusing, and still not refuted by anyone, and verifiable in his own references. Regarding "intercollegiate", the frat is listed in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_student_societies_580e.html" title="Category:United States student societies">Category:United States student societies</a>, but, the text is referring the historical account that it was the "first intercollegiate greek-letter fraternity for african amercian men when it was founded in 1906". So to address his concern, perhaps the <b>comprise</b> can be <b>first intercollegiate fraternity for african amercians when established in 1906</b>. The <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Alpha_Psi_d0a0.html" title="Kappa Alpha Psi">Kappa Alpha Psi</a> article here and their official website states they were founded in 1911. I guess you're going to change their page now. <b>BTW mediators</b>, the tripod website he referenced has changed again to coincide with his changing theories in the guise of proof. It now contains the sentence "first black college fraternity" I said was removed on Dec 29 and he asked if I read it carefully after it was changed, and now contains a new sentence that "Kappa Alpha Nu was founded in 1903", which was not there before.

Plus, whether they are the same or separate, the link he provides that KAN was first links to a student chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and it states that this organization was a "CLUB", not a "FRATERNITY", there is a difference, that's why they mention it.. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 19:41, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

This came from Wikipedia own website so we are the first and don't forget it. Kappas and others just face it.</p>
<p>The fraternity may have begun in 1903 on the Indiana University campus, but there were too few registrants to assure continuing organization. In that year a club was formed called Alpha Kappa Nu, but the club disappeared after a short time. There is no record of any similar organization at Indiana until the fraternity was founded as Kappa Alpha Nu on the night of January 5, 1911 by ten African-American college students</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pledging</span></h3>
<p>NO Pledging Allowed. Pledging is against the purposes and goals of the Fraternity and has been discontinued as a condition or manner of initiation into the membership of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. It is no longer legal within Alpha Phi Alpha for members to establish a “pledge line” or to require aspirants to the organization to submit to “hazing”. All membership intake activities for the Fraternity are conducted by the National Intake Office and occur in the presence of a National Intake Officer.</p>

<dd>Mediator, look at the article history page when bobbydoop summary indicates his reason for adding the sentence: 00:39, 3 January 2006 24.239.149.9 (necessary to illustrate the false hood claimed of being an inter collegiate organization.). Now he's saying it has nothing to do with being intercollegiate. This guy has no integrity in his own work or words, and spins on a dime in order to get his way. Anyone going to Duke Ellingtons page will see that he never attended college, and this should be removed from the page. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 02:36, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm open to discussion regarding updates to the site that of course must eventually be approved by the cabal mediator. My only concern is that information something that concerns the national fraternity as a majority, not acts that do not represent the fraternity, what it stands for or its goals. I realize that some heinous things have occured, but if only 1 - 10 chapters out 700+ chapters engaged in this activity, it not something representative of the image that should be portrayed. Also this is not a blog where one can type or say anything. This is an encyclopedia, albeit, online, and the content and tone should be neutral so that the message is received by the readers as valid and not left or right sided.</dd>

<p>Bobbydoop is at it again.

<p>Bobbydoop, I read your last reference. This is only one persons experience, but it still does not reflect the views of the national fraterntiy. he states that many brothers were partying in an environment they felt comfortable in. My view from the article is that members may still be struggling for own personal reasons, but I don't see where the fraternity is at fault or where the interviewee indicates an inclusive or exclusive policy regarding homosexuals in this article. We need something more official and by multiple parties. People lead closets live in their professional, personal and civic lives, even though many companies have enacted open policies. Where has alpha phi alpha stated their inclusive or exclusive policy, (i.e. we know the armed forces are on record and this can be documented). the article must be factual, no how someone felt. Also, the first reference that in the article seems to be from an anonymous person, and therefore I must agree unverifiable. One cannot just search the web and say I found something and because it's here, it must be true.<a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 04:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Im inclined to agree with Akenathon06 that the sentence referring to the organizations view on homesexuals be removed because,
<dl>
<dd>1)neither article indicates that APhiA was among the first,</dd>
<dd>2) the first article has no author or name of the person speaking,</dd>
<dd>3)the second reference is one persons view at a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convention" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:convention">boule</a> while he was in Atlanta. I question if this person is an Alpha because Alpha has "Conventions", Omegas have "Boules", and that's not a mistake an Alpha would make. Alpha or whatever Frat he affilites with had nothing to do with his quest to be DL because he apparently led a closeted personal life since he was married which was a voluntary act. The fact that he has come out does not mean that other persons who choose remain DL for their own personal reasons, can fault any organization for this selfish act.</dd>
<dd>4)APhiA has over 700 chapters and initiated over 125,000 member, and neither fratnerity or authorized sub-group has issued a statement to agree with this personal assertion of 2 members.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The view is prevalent in many societies, however, these references are not a factual acount of the fraternity that should be included in an encyclopedia, again, just the experience of 2 of its members.</dd>

there is a struggle and it should be duly noted. there is no auther listed b/c many individuals are stigmatized for being gay. Akhenton06 knows personally the stigma he feels. Many men become apes (alpha pledge term), because they'd like to feel the sting of receiving wood. They want the sweet warm embrace of a fellow man when they "grip". Like Race shouldn't matter, but it does. That's why A PHI A was created, b/c race matters. Homoseuxality shouldn't matter but it does. That's why A Phi A has a struggle with this. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.239.149.9.html" title="User:24.239.149.9">24.239.149.9</a> 04:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that's not better, in fact the second is the reference currently listed in the article that I and akenaton06 have already addressed previously as unverified.
<dl>
<dd>The first reference from darmouth college appears to be something co-sponsored by the college chapter with other groups, there's no indication the chapter originated the idea for the workshop. NO matter who's idea, it shows the students were working providing a service to the community, not an internal struggle with the fraternity or with their own identity, or that any of the members were homosexual. The website is just a poster.</dd>
<dd>This article is about the National Fraternity and its policies, programs, and platform. The National Programs section of the article lists the projects that Alpha promotes nationwide and instructs the local alumni and college chapters to participate in as a statement of what Alpha is concerened about in society. Who someone has a right to marry is not on the Alpha platform and/or something the fraternity is dealing with. The fraternity is dealing with much more compelling issues that affect the nation and our world. There may be chapters near inner city schools that sponsor a talk on Drugs, black-on-black crime, etc, this does not mean that the National Fraternity supports or disagrees with these programs or is even aware that the program existed. Again, this would be 1 chapter out of 700+, and even if you could find 10 more, that doesn't make the topic something that the reader of this historical account of Alpha should walk away with as what Alpha stands for.</dd>
<dd>further, none of these 3 references indicate that Alpha was first in recognizing the issue if it has been recognized at all. The fact that it is addressed by any group would show its stance on Inclusivity, which I would think would be a positive thing.</dd>

</dd>

First of all, there aren't 700 active chapters. There are like 300. Second regardless of whether or not it's national or chapter, it exists and is flagrant. Even if nationals officially states they are against hazing, it occurs at the chapter level. Apparantly they aren't in control of their own organization. Do you deny ever meeting a homosexual member of your frat? Guys on the downlow? You'd lie if you say you didn't. There is a struggle that men have faced. Some of them write it down and have posted it for public knowledge. Now you should simply accept the fact. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.239.149.9.html" title="User:24.239.149.9">24.239.149.9</a> 16:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is about the 100 year history of the fraternity, not simply as it exists in 2006, so one must consider all the contributions that were made by each chapter which has contributed to the rich history of Alpha, and that's where the information has come from. Much thanks to dystopos who is correct in that <b>personal knowledge is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Citing sources may help maintain a neutral and verifiable article.</b> , Your first two references are a personal account of their own view and, furthermore the first reference is not verifiable, the second, not by research, just his personal account after he came out, not because of Alpha, but as he says "my wife busted me".</dd>
<dd>The fact that people live and breathe each day indicates that Alpha has many members of different demographics, some are even handicapped and face other societal issues. These members in any organization or work envirnoment did not go back into the closet after pledging, they were never out of the closet and Alpha has little, and apparently no verifable source to say otherwise.</dd>
<dd>Further, you are now trying to frantically search the web for any meniton of Homesexual and Alpha Phi Alpha in the same page as proof your personal view is correct. I know that you know the difference, and so do you, and others that read this discussion.</dd>
<dd>This disussion is not about <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazing.html" title="Hazing">Hazing</a> nor is it about whether homosexuals exists in the organization. The question is whether your statement <i>Alpha Phi Alpha is amongst the first to accept homosexual, but has struggled with these members</i>. There has been no evidence that shows the fraternity was the first or stuggles with these member. We will talk about the hazing sentence next.</dd>

<p>Someone this discussion has turned into a discussion on HOMOPHOBIA. The discussion is simply whether the one sentence in the current article is supported by valid, neutral evidence and I suggest in my texts above that the evidence does not support that Alpha was first of fraternities to accept, and that the fraterntiy struggles with these members. The sentence that the contributor has been attempting to add to the first paragraph is vandalism. The impetus of why the frat was created was told by the founders, and they did not list sexual bias on the campus of Cornell. It's possible that this was occuring on every campus as well a bias toward handicap students before all of this became <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_incorrect.html" title="Politically incorrect">politically incorrect</a>, but it was not one of the reasons why this frat was established.</p>

<p>links have been provided. Alpha Phi Alpha publically had homosexual members. Unlike many other greeks, thus it is one of the first to accept homosexual members.

<p>The official fraternity website indicates which chapters were established on certain continents, and Asia is listed. The site list Europe, but we know a chapter was established in Frankfurt. as we can assume the fraternity knows where chapters were established, since the charters would have been granted by the national office. We can compromise by changing Vietnam and South Korea to Asia, Again, this article is about the history of the group, not an day-to-day account of what is currently occuring--that's what newspapers are for, encyclopedias are for recording history that has occured in day-to-day life. Can we get contributors to indicated if Asia is acceptable until someone can provide positive proof of a chapter in these countries. The fact that this is not on the internet is not proof of its non-existance, since someone would have to have added this. you can visit the fraternity website at www.alphaphialpha.net to verify.

<p>There still has been no credible reliable, or neutral POV of the orgnaization's issue on homosexuals that need to recorded in an encyclopedia. The Boy Scouts, the Catholic Church, and the repbulican party have issued public statements on their view of this subject. Alpha Phi Alpha has not commented or made a similar statement and so it's misleading to the reader to say what the organization' policy is when they have not addressed the issue in support or against an issue. You provide one website about the paper bag test, and if true, was used by one chapter in D.C., hardly proof positive that this was the policy of the fraternity in whole. One cannot say the republican party support abortions if you could find one chapter or state that endorsed this POV or one catholic church that accepted homesexuals. The view from the national party/church is well documented, and does not have to endlessly search the web as you do for 2 examples to prove their point.

He has also been blocked several times and there are similar problems at remove <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_University%2C_New_York_c583.html" title="St. John's University, New York">St. John's University, New York</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_High_School_of_Science_ac4d.html" title="Bronx High School of Science">Bronx High School of Science</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant_High_School_9363.html" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townsend_Harris_High_School_f349.html" title="Townsend Harris High School">Townsend Harris High School</a>.

look at tfine80 's history. he has a history of reverting. he offers no proof and is the one who has been troublesome. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.86.130.215.html" title="User:69.86.130.215">69.86.130.215</a> 08:51, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please stop making accusations, and instead sit down and try to work this out. Can you provide an outline of the conflict, and your proposed solutions? (Both of you) <a href="../../../o/l/o/User%7EOlorin28_c6cf.html" title="User:Olorin28">Olorin28</a> 00:51, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would be a good idea if all contributors will sign in so we can see who's doing what. User bobbydoop (69.96.130.215) has stated months ago that he forgot his ID and therefore can no longer sign in. Is it possible that Wikipedia can email his password, reset the password, or allow him to create a new ID so that his work can be signed even when at different computers?</p>
<p>I agree with Tfine80, these issues were resolved in the previous dispute by Bonaparte, however; Bobbydoop continues to revert the article to his own liking, even to pages 2 months ago, which is summarily reverting all the new input provided by other contributors. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 03:52, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's no dispute here. This user's contributions are too aggressive, random, and bizarre to process any sort of discussion. His main focus seems to be attacking schools that he doesn't attend. Fortunately, he has eased off lately. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 14:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We now have a new user, Mikeandike, who has joined the revert war to pages 2 months old and accusing me of vandalism for putting page back the way it was, and not letting a 2 month old version control. 67.34.214.218 18:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

i've seen bobbydoop's history.. he has never made that statement. Tfine80 you are a violator of the 3r rule and should summarily cease and decist from this activity. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.207.37.html" title="User:64.131.207.37">64.131.207.37</a> 06:44, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lead paragraph and tone</span></h2>
<p>This article is presented a bit breathlessly, and is currently lacking in encyclopedic <i>tone</i>. For example, from the lead paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 2006, the fraternity entered a Centennial Era – A Period of preparation and mobilization as it celebrates a century of service. Thurgood Marshall, Whitney Young, Jesse Owens and Paul Robeson are among the countless Alpha men who have dedicated their lives to the fraternity’s motto--manly deeds, scholarship, and love for all mankind.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This would be better stated as something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Alpha Phi Alpha has declared 2006 the begining of the "Centennial Era" to celebrate its 100th anniversary.<sup>[cite1]</sup> Among its alumni are Thurgood Marshall<sup>[cite2]</sup>, Whitney Young<sup>[cite3]</sup>, Jesse Owens<sup>[cite4]</sup> and Paul Robeson.<sup>[cite5]</sup></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The first states opinon as fact, e.g. It says that the Centennial Era <i>is</i> a period of preparation and mobilization. It also uses some serious hyperbole, e.g. Are the alumni <i>literally</i> countless? There are quite a few instances in the article of similar stylistic mistakes.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question regarding other Black fraternity histories excluding Alpha Phi Alpha</span></h2>
<p>Being a member of Kappa Alpha Psi, I read about the other Black fraternities omiting Alpha Phi Alpha from their own history books. I must also note when I was spending time in the high school library where I used to teach at, I saw the History of Alpha Phi Alpha on the book shelf in the history section. I curiously read through this book and found out this book is written the same way as my own fraternity history book as well as Omega Psi Phi's and Phi Beta Sigma's history books. It mainly telling the history of Alpha Phi Alpha and only mentioning the other NHPC fraternities and sororites dealing with National Pan-Hellenic Council history only.</p>
<p>So I feel it is unfair to say that this fraternity is saying another fraternity is omiting them out. These books were written by their own fraternity brothers focusing mainly on their organization history and did not add or have to mention other black fraternities to explain if there any rivalries, differences between each organization or focusing who was founded first. So the person who written about the omission cannot be hypocritical until he can explain why Alpha Phi Alpha excluded the other fraternities and sororities from their history? <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErayman64_5ff3.html" title="User:Erayman64">Erayman64</a></p>

<dd>I think you're saying the information is true, and an encyclopedia must record the truth, not individual biased point of views, even if they total three. The author is quoted, menaing "in his opinion", the article is linked for anyone to read, so I think readers can gather their own opinion as you have to his fairness, but the accuracy of the statement is true. The text in Alpha Phi Alpha relates to its history when founded. The other three fraternity's were not in existence, so there would be no need for Alpha to mention them in the context of what the environment was in 1906. Kappa nebulously refers to "another fraternity", and Omega goes all the back to 1776 with Phi Beta Kappa, but not a word about an organization on its own campus as a model or even the impetus for creating an alternative black greek organization. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a></dd>

<p>This really has been discussed to death.</p>
<p>Alpha Phi Alpha IS the first INTER-COLLEGIATE FRATERNITY for African American males!!! The public is very aware (now) of Simga Pi Phi (not a <b>college</b> fraternity), Alpha Kappa Nu <b>SOCIETY</b> (in 1903, and again, NOT a fraternity) as well as Gamma Phi (founded in 1905 at Wilberforce and NOT/NEVER <b>INTER</b>-collegiate.)</p>
<p>Now, feel better?</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>Alpha Kappa Nu was a local fraternity founded by African-American male students that did not last very long on the campus of Indiana University and is no longer in existence regardless of the name of society or fraternity. <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> still deserves the honor as the oldest existing African-American service fraternity. Simga Pi Phi is a professional service organization, not a college fraternity. Erayman64 <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErayman64_5ff3.html" title="User:Erayman64">Erayman64</a></p>
<p><b>LOL at "regardless of the name society or fraternity</b>!" "Black greek 101" by Walter Kimbrough, says it was a "Greek Society" (pg22-23) a precursor to fraternities in a sense...the same way Alpha Phi Alpha was a social study club and APA Literary Society before the vote to become an authentic and legitimate fraternity on December 4, 1906. And the point is that APA was the first <b>inter-collegiate</b> frat for African Americans, which can't be disputed. Also, Alpha Phi Alpha IS NOT a SERVICE fraternity, it's a social fraternity rooted in principles of education and it's <b>main</b> purpose is to benefit its members and the organization itself , and part of that is, naturally, to take care of the environment (community) around you. <b>However, the discussion of what the Divine Nine organizations were, is, and should be are as old as the organizations themselves.</b> I've heard members of Delta Sigma Theta and Phi Beta Sigma argue the point that their respective organizations were founded and established primarily for community service, not social clubs, "study groups", or even fraternities in the traditional sense. Still, high standards for academic excellence as well as a sense of unity (brotherhood/sisterhood) were/are expected of the members. adisalee</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alpha Phi Alpha Crest</span></h2>
<p>You describe the Alpha Phi Alpha crest's symbol as:</p>
<p>Sphinx, Pharaoh and Ape....</p>
<p>Where did you get "Ape" from??</p>

<ul>
<li>I think you're referring to the text in the fraternity infobox. The symbol field is not describing what's depicted in the crest, just as the fraternity flower is not depicted in the crest. These items are requested when this template is used, however; each field stands alone. In fact, the template does not require that a crest be displayed, although most fraternity and sorority articles will show a crest or shield for the organization. You may have noticed the fraternity shield later in the article where I describe what's depicted, but I wasn't attempting to do this for the crest. <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Kappa_Alpha_e54f.html" title="Alpha Kappa Alpha">Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> has Ivy listed as a symbol, but I don't see an Ivy in the crest. <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Alpha_Psi_d0a0.html" title="Kappa Alpha Psi">Kappa Alpha Psi</a> list "Diamond", but there is no Diamond. There are other things (scales, Atlas holding the world, handshake, arm with spear, etc), this doesn't make them symbols because there are depicted, just as if something is not depicted does not mean it's not a symbol. Please look at the Outside links section of the Alpha article, click on Alpha Phi Alpha Iconography, and you're see a section for Apes. You can also search other chapter sites and will see Apes in some form since it is a symbol of the fraternity. Thanks for the question and I hope this helps. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 05:06, 7 July 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a></li>

<p>Hi all - I have a strong objection to the wording of "...founded by blacks." It sounds soooo crude, not just in the racial sense, but as if it is talking about paints or crayons. You must realize that this article will be viewed on July 25 by a worldwide audience who are not aware of American life or mannerisms. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>This Fire Burns Always</b></font></a> 13:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
