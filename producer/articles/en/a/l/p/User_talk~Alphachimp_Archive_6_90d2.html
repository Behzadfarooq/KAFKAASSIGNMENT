<p><small>I've been bumbling along trying to improve and expand some of the Elder Scrolls stubs and articles, but somebody has deleted the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porphyric_hemophilia.html" title="Porphyric hemophilia">Porphyric hemophilia</a> article and redirected the page to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porphyria.html" title="Porphyria">Porphyria</a>; their logic being that since <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porphyric_Hemophilia_6c54.html" title="Porphyric Hemophilia">Porphyric Hemophilia</a> redirects (with a capital H) this one should too. The problem is that the article is about the Elder Scrolls universe and has <i>no</i> relation to the real world disease.</small></p>
<p><small>So, I was wondering how do you revert something like this? Actually, I've yet to work out how to revert anything at all. *scratches head* Also, how would I go about moving this article to a different page with a (Game) or (Elder Scrolls) bit in the title so that this doesn't happen again?</small></p>

<p>Hi. I'm just sending out a message for a new study I will be undertaking soon. It will involve surveys &amp; polls to gather information &amp; trends of editors on Wikipedia &amp; other subjects. The data gathering will involve yourself recieving a questionaire on your talk page for you to fill out. I will then collect your questionaire &amp; combine it with data from other editors. If you would like to be a part of this experiment, or know of someone who does, place a "Yes" or "No" below this message. Remember, it's only for fun &amp; you can choose not to fill out all or parts of your questionaire once they arrive.

<p>An admin placed a semi protect on the page so that new or anonymous users could not edit the page, so the vandal created user ID NinjaNubian. He has begun vandalzing the page again. I have sent him the first warning level. Can you pls monitor and block his ID if he persist.

<p>The same user is vandalizing the article again. He insists on changing words and sentences that promote his own POV. These words and sentences have survived a peer review and Featured Article review. He's accusing me of vandalizing by restoring the information I orginally added. Please review and ask him to stop changing the work of other editors. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 06:13, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not referring to the content discussion on the talk page. He questions the word "swiftly" being used and wants to "later". He doesn't like the sentence "Alpha men were pioneers", because he disagrees that if they are pioneers. I supplied the reference which indicates Alpha men were vanguards (pioneers) and so he continues to change. This word and sentence has been in this article for over 6 months. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 06:32, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, the references he provided conveniently only addresses the issues in this article. He changes the web site and then says its a valid source. We had a resolution discussion back in fall 2005, and that admin determined that the site was unreliable because it changed daily to counter any valid discussions that were oppostie of his. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 06:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I just started up a website called, www.supportgore.org, which has a form in which people can pledge their vote to Al Gore if he chooses to run in 2008. I built this site myself, but consider myself very inexperienced with programming, etc. I noticed that there was one person so far on the pledge list that had an offensive comment, so I looked at the IP address in my database, and then noticed that the same IP address appeared 4 different times in the list. I did a google search and found this, much to my unpleasant surprise. Do you have any suggestions of what I can do? Please respond to: supportgore@gmail.com. Thank You. ~Craig.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. If this is your first time filling out a survey, read this. To fill out a questionaire sheet, simply send me a post <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpawn_Man_cbc1.html" title="User talk:Spawn Man">to my talk page</a>, clearly stating your choice for each answer. For example: For Question 1, you might choose to place on the message, <i>"Q1: A)"</i> or <i>"Question 1: Choice A."</i> etc etc. It's up to you, as long as I get the general jist of what your choices are. You have around 1 week to return a survey sheet, but late entrie's will be accepted.</p>
<p>Remember however, your personal choices may be read whilst they are on my talk page. I will understand if you don't wish to answer some or all of the survey due to this. For this reason I have also placed an <i>"Abstain"</i> choice for each question. Try &amp; answer truthfully, or don't answer at all if you can't.</p>
<p>However, your personal choices will not be expressed on the survey's outcome, instead it will be part of a larger finding, such as <i>"60% of people eat chocolate, 25% never eat chocolate &amp; 5% of people chose to abstain from answering...</i>" I will never say, <i>"90% of people eat chocolate, while only Fruityman said he didn't..."</i> This would be an invasion of privacy. However, if a question has (<i>Please explain</i>) or (<i>Please elaborate</i>) as a choice, your specific answer may be used in the survey outcome, although your name will not be. If a question does not have (<i>Please explain</i>) as a question choice, but your intended choice is not represented on the choice list, then feel free to provide another choice which fits your description.</p>
<p>You're probably getting bored reading all of this so I'll wrap up. To see outcomes of the results, see <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_Polls_f95d.html" title="User:Spawn Man/Polls">my Polls subpage</a>. Feel free to comment on anything! Feedback is always welcome. Most importantly, have fun. Topics will vary greatly &amp; surveys may be resent out at later times to re-assess a consensus if survey numbers have grown significantly. If you know anyone who would be interested in these surveys, send them to my talk page or if you see this survey sheet, send your own answers in! Thanks. -- <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a>.</p>

<p>Yet another person Vandalizing the Alpha Phi Alpha entry. As a new Wiki user, how do you police such activity? In trying to talk to the guy, all you get is nonsense back, with citiations to clearly biased material, including several Tripod pages. He's even gone so far as to tag himself as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha on his page. His above "complaints" above are retaliation for wiki users editing out his vandalism. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotam_8f37.html" title="User:Robotam">Robotam</a>16:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><small>Alphachimp,<br />
I posted earlier about a potential hacker on my website. He has only posted one negative comment on my pledge list, but has also done a few other pledges on my list, some with positive comments. The reason I am writing to you is because the ip address is 207.200.116.8, which was supposedly involved in a major attack on wikipedia, which you were supposedly the main reverter of this attack. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mboverload/vandalattack" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mboverload/vandalattack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mboverload/vandalattack</a></small></p>
<p><small>All right, I am definitely a newbie when it comes to computers, websites, and programming. There was something mentioned on my previous post about this being a shared IP address? Does that mean it is probably not the same guy? It seems fishy to me that this same IP address is posting multipule pledges with nice and naughty comments. I just don't want this person (if it is the same one that sabotaged wikipedia) to do the same to my website.</small></p>
<p><small>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<p>I understand why Wikipedia would want to delete pages that are vandalism or whatever the reason may be. However, I am creating a page for myself for family and friends to view. The extended family I have around the world would love to see something like this. Also, I have every right to create something purely for entertainment and connectability. I would appreciate it if you could leave my page alone and let me go about my business. Keep an eye on the page if you like but their wont be any vandalism or slander or indecent material. Besides, you have pages related to Nazi's, Porn, and Violence. That alone is hate, sex, and crime put out their on the internet for everybody to see. My page will only be viewed by family.</p>

<p>I'm writing in regards to the deletion notice I found on the page I created and have a question about it.</p>
<p>What type of scale are you using to determine the organization's notoriety?</p>
<p>Calling it "entirely non-notable" is highly inaccurate. There are hundreds of people in the city of Louisville as well as other parts of the state of Kentucky and Indiana that would disagree with that.</p>
<p>I'm not in 100% comprehension of the Wikipedia's policies so I cannot efficiently dispute the claim that this page "fails WP:ORG, WP:V, and WP:NOR". If we can come to an understanding on our notoriety dispute, is there a way I can edit the page to meet the criteria of the policies noted?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding your bot and replacing templates.</span></h2>
<p>Hey, I'm somewhat new to Wikipedia. One thing I have noticed though is that when I place warning templates on people's talk pages, some bots often replace the templates with the actual words. Yours has done this (as can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:86.131.253.92&amp;curid=7006421&amp;diff=75955975&amp;oldid=75922082" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:86.131.253.92&amp;curid=7006421&amp;diff=75955975&amp;oldid=75922082" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I don't have a problem with this in the slightest, I was just curious as to why people's bots would actually change the template when it is fine as it is?

<p><small>Hi everyone. If this is your first time filling out a survey, read this. To fill out a questionaire sheet, simply send me a post <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpawn_Man_cbc1.html" title="User talk:Spawn Man">to my talk page</a>, clearly stating your choice for each answer. For example: For Question 1, you might choose to place on the message, <i>"Q1: A)"</i> or <i>"Question 1: Choice A."</i> etc etc. It's up to you, as long as I get the general jist of what your choices are. You have around 1 week to return a survey sheet, but late entrie's will be accepted.</small></p>
<p><small>Remember however, your personal choices may be read whilst they are on my talk page. I will understand if you don't wish to answer some or all of the survey due to this. For this reason I have also placed an <i>"Abstain"</i> choice for each question. Try &amp; answer truthfully, or don't answer at all if you can't.</small></p>
<p><small>However, your personal choices will not be expressed on the survey's outcome, instead it will be part of a larger finding, such as <i>"60% of people eat chocolate, 25% never eat chocolate &amp; 5% of people chose to abstain from answering...</i>" I will never say, <i>"90% of people eat chocolate, while only Fruityman said he didn't..."</i> This would be an invasion of privacy. However, if a question has (<i>Please explain</i>) or (<i>Please elaborate</i>) as a choice, your specific answer may be used in the survey outcome, although your name will not be. If a question does not have (<i>Please explain</i>) as a question choice, but your intended choice is not represented on the choice list, then feel free to provide another choice which fits your description.</small></p>
<p><small>You're probably getting bored reading all of this so I'll wrap up. To see outcomes of the results, see <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_Polls_f95d.html" title="User:Spawn Man/Polls">my Polls subpage</a>. Feel free to comment on anything! Feedback is always welcome. Most importantly, have fun. Topics will vary greatly &amp; surveys may be resent out at later times to re-assess a consensus if survey numbers have grown significantly. If you know anyone who would be interested in these surveys, send them to my talk page or if you see this survey sheet, send your own answers in! Thanks. -- <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a>.</small></p>

Having been blocked before, the NinjaNubian ID was only created about 2 weeks, after the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> article was semi-protected so that anonymous or newly registered users could not edit the article. After about 7 days when the ID was no longer new, he began his vandalism and revert war again. The user then created another ID <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">Mykungfu</a> saying he lost his password to NinjaNubian. Since admin attention was brought to the ID <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">Mykungfu</a> via an AfD and RfC, the user has used anonymous IP addresses to revert and remove the AfD template on the page <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Kappa_Nu_5cb5.html" title="Alpha Kappa Nu">Alpha Kappa Nu</a> as well as comments on the discussion page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alpha_Kappa_Nu" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alpha_Kappa_Nu" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and comments on the AfD itself<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Alpha_Kappa_Nu" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Alpha_Kappa_Nu" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

<li><small>As he has begun editing and reverting my talk page, <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">User:Mykungfu</a> now claims that he is being reported because of an "edit war." Unfortunately, the only person warring is <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">User:Mykungfu</a>. Everyone else is either ignoring him or reporting clear violations by <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">User:Mykungfu</a>, per wiki policy. Article <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> was protected because of <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">User:Mykungfu</a>. When consensus is built on articles that he/she disagrees with, his MO is to flame the article or people's personal pages, and accuse everyone else of be a sockpuppet, even though he/she is the one that uses various anon IPs to do so, which are traceable to his/her ID. And when someone reports him/her, he simply breaks wiki policy by editing out their report (claiming they too are a "vandal" or "sockpuppet"), comments<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alpha_Kappa_Nu&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alpha_Kappa_Nu&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> or template (even on their own page)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpha_Kappa_Nu&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpha_Kappa_Nu&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Robotam&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Robotam&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, as if no one investigating will read the history or logs to see what he is doing--or he tries to flame them by repeating their allegations back against them. His IP and ID's have been previously blocked; It was on the verge of being blocked again that he "lost" his password to NinjaNubian and created ID Mykungfu. No, I am not a sockpuppet of any form, but as I <b>sign my name</b>, I welcome any admin to verify both of our accounts. -<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotam_8f37.html" title="User:Robotam">Robotam</a> 13:07, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

The current straw situation is just too small to get a cohesive point to what should've been done. Please just help me out here with this, even if I get crucified for it (yeah like that's going to happen) at least I'll know we had a proper discussion with multiple sources on it. We've already got one wikipedian leaving and one blocked, both for the same reason, and I'm still not convinced that reason is a strong enough point yet. I just want a larger discussion forum. I've been keeping a level head and being civil about this because I can understand the other side, but being told to simply drop it in the face of what I believe, and near as I can tell all wikipedian policy believes, is just wrong. The reason I'm asking you instead of posting it myself is because you carry more weight than I do and I know you agree with me. If I were an admin I would've posted this already, but I am not and have never been nominated or gotten a barnstar heh, but you are and one of the best ones.

<p>It'd set a bad precedent if more than 4 people knew about it. This is out-and-out bullshit. When one individual can dictate what we can and cannot do here, despite time-honored policy and verifiable, factual information to the contrary, this operation isn't worth its circuits. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETromboneguy0186_2295.html" title="User:Tromboneguy0186">Tromboneguy0186</a> 00:15, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Update</b>, the debate still rages with me getting near accused of committing original research by using the glossary of the USPTO website as well as a secondary source interview being found however now the reliability of the secondary source is in debate. I'm glad this discussion is still going but it's a back and forth battle with no side getting a real foothold (well now there's a secondary source but even that may be thrown out as original research due to connections). –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 04:52, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">block</span></h2>
<p>You blocked me for 16 hours for the 3 RR on Anousheh Ansari article. You blocked me because user <a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> said in <b>Administrators' noticeboard/3RR</b> this: <i><b>Comments:User was blocked briefly for the same behavior on the same artice on 2006-09-20 and the page protected (see #User:Machocarioca_reported_by_User:alidoostzadeh_.28Result:_protected.29). The changes he is making are strongly contested on the talk page and The image he is trying to insert is the same as one that has been deleted by admins on several occassions as a copyright violation.</b></i> You blocked me without earing my side, what in my opinion is not justice,not the work of an administrator.</p>
<p>The point is, if you want to read that article: The assert that Ansari is first female tourist in space is a POV. There are press sources too, saying she's only the first who paid the ticket, not the first one. See here <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14452905/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14452905/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Britton Helen Sharman was the first one in 1991, as you can see in her article. She was a civilian selected in a kind of lottery to be the first UK citizen in space. Of course she didn't pay for the trip, but to be a tourist we don't need pay the ticket, we can win it, right? Then, the assert "first female tourist" is not exact. I said that and changed that assert.</p>
<p>1. I was never before blocked before for this matter. Briefly or longer, as this user is saying.</p>
<p>2. This user <a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> suggested, as a consense, in the talk page, the words <i>The first space tourist to have passionately pursued the development of private space flight."</i> Himself proposed that. I did it. He and a mad guy named Hektor reverted. Can you believe? I did what the user proposed and himself went to Administrators' noticeboard/3RR with my name for you! Of couse I reverted again, it was proposed by himself!. And of course the assert "first tourist female" can´t stay there.</p>
<p>2. About the image, which is the official photograph of Ansari in NASA site: They're nuts. He and user Hektor are talking the image I uploade is unfree. As you can see here <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/157366main_ansari.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/157366main_ansari.pdf" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> this image was uploaded from NASA biography of the astronaut and is use free and public domain , as dozen of another one's from astronauts that are placed in the articles about them here. These guys are nuts. The old image I uploaded (the same) wasn´t deleted by any administrator, but by a unkown IP, maybe a sockpuppet, I don´t know. As you can see in my talk page, administrator <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> never deleted that image, but others, in the same article. I didn´t uploaded the images he deleted.</p>
<p>3. The question now is: If you blocked me, what are you going to do with these users, specially with this mad Hektor, who insists in delet the free image and tag it as copyrighted?</p>
<p>And I can´t agree with "first female tourist in space", it can´t stay there, isn't exact, I'm a serious space exploration student and I have a close contact with copyrights.</p>

<p><small>Hi! I may need an urgent help for editing one of the pages in Wikipedia. Since I have added a subtitle in "Queen's College, Hong Kong". One of the users frequently put my name on it that I purpose to put the information on it. Unfortunately, he/she also puts the name of the place where I study at. This user used multiple IPs which I cannot band them all. I don't know can it be considered as defamation.
