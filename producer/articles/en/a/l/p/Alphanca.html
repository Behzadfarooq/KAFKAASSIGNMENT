<p>HISTORY OF ALPHANCA 1651 BC-AD1772</p>
<p>NOCIAN SETTLEMENT, c. 3000 BC</p>
<p>The tribe that is commonly known today as the Alphancan Nocians first emigrated from modern Sierra Leone approximately 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>In 1651 BC Ferman the Old, Chieftan of the Fermana Tribe of Nocians, settled the town of Nociad on what is now the Sea of Narmos. This was then the furthest settlement of Nocians. In 1648, he made himself Grand Chieftan of Nocia, and attacked nearby tribes. By 1640, he had conquered all the tribes of Nocia, but he died in 1638. As Ferman had no sons to take over as Grand Chieftan, the tribes rebelled, and the Grand Chieftanship of Ferman was ended. The tribe of Fermana was broken up, and Nociad fell to the Caros Tribe, which, despite the claims that no tribe was superior to others, led to the Caros becoming dominant.</p>
<p>What can now be seen in the Nocian religion first appeared in local histories around 1500 BC.</p>
<p>In 1280 BC Garahinko the Tall, the chieftan of Caros, settled the town of Marahasa, now known as Dugla, and made himself Grand Chieftan. However, very little is known of the continued westward settlement, but it is believed that any previous humans occupying the island had been defeated by the Nocians, with the survivors slowly entering Nocian society, and the Nocians were found throughout Alphanca by 600 BC.</p>
<p>In AD 220, the old homeland of the Nocians, the Great Oldlands of the East, which stretched from the northern end of Thomton Peninsula to Nerrimon, began to develop into a desert, and many Nocians moved into the fertile lands of Middle Nocia (Marahasa) and West Nocia (Chankla). The original capital of Nociad was soon left to a few thousand inhabitants.</p>
<p>However, many chose to not move west, and decided to settle the island of Narmos in the south, and the city of Nardon was formed.</p>
<p>THE NOCIAN LANDONOK, AD 670-672</p>
<p>Around the middle of the 7th Century AD, a big issue was developing among the Nocians over their religious practices. The Grand Chieftan’s officers, who were spread throughout the island, were becoming more and more lax in regard to religious rules, and were opposed by the Grand Priest, Haradon the Wise, who tried to impose great strictness.</p>
<p>In the town of Nerrimon, which had been formed by Garadaso the Bearded in 206 BC, most of the population were in favour of the strict rules, and the officers of the Grand Chieftan, Garanowa the Petty, were hardly seen. On the contrary, Garanowa’s homeland of the Isthmus of Dugla, and in particular the twin capitals of Marahasa and Marqab, were strongly against the influence of the Priests of Nerrimon, and a number of Priests were killed by local leaders for attempting to punish those going against religious law. Other parts of the country, such as the southern Oldlands, Thomton Peninsula, Narmos and the West, were allowing both factions to practice their rules, and both points of views were prominent, resulting in those areas avoiding the fighting that was to come.</p>
<p>In 668, Grand Priest Haradon met the Grand Chieftan in Marqab, where they discussed their differences, in an attempt to avoid fighting between their followers. However, the talks ended with Haradon calling for Garanowa to impose the strict religious law, which involved death for many crimes, including saying things against the Priests or not paying taxes to the Temple. However, these usually gave power to the Priests, which Garanowa was opposed to.</p>
<p>In 670, Garanowa banned all Priests from entering the Isthmus region of Alphanca, and the Priests were forced to travel by boat to the West of Alphanca, which resulted in many deaths. In both the Isthmus and the outer lands the Chieftan’s officers appointed Priests of their own, but these had little success outside the Isthmus.</p>
<p>In late 670, the religious fanatics, under the Priests, by then known as Nerrimonians, began building an army to fight the Isthmusians. Luckily, the fighting was isolated to the Isthmus and the north and west Oldlands, as the local leaders in the outer lands managed to outlaw the act of fighting for either the Grand Chieftan or the Grand Priest.</p>
<p>On the first day of Nerrimott in the year of 670, the Nerrimonian army invaded the Isthmus. However, the larger population of the Isthmus allowed them to beat back the fanatical army.</p>
<p>After eighteen months of fighting, both Garanowa and Haradon realized the danger of the continuing fighting, and Garanowa saw the threat of rebellion developing among Haradon’s followers in the Outer Lands. So, at the beginning of Nerrimott 672, after two years of fighting, representatives of both sides met to make peace.</p>
<p>Although it took until the last day of Nerrimott for permanent peace to be found, no battle was fought after the fifth day of Nerrimott. The Priests agreed to move to the uninhabited island of Bentonan with their followers, where they would have all authority, while Garanowa was to become Grand Priest as well as Grand Chieftan and have all religious authority over mainland Nocia.</p>
<p>However, by 750, the differences of the Landonok were starting to fade away, and the two groups began to come together again, and many Nerrimonians returned to the home city of their fathers, Nerrimon.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NOCIAN DOMANOK, AD 920 Almost 4000 years after the arrival of the Nocians in Alphanca, tensions were growing between the ruling Eastern Nocians, under Garmak I (908-926), and the Western Nocians. The Western Nocians (those living West of Marahasa) were seen as ‘Undesirables’, and were not allowed to help govern the tribe.</p>
<p>A Western leader, Marakaso, in 920, announced that the West was now separate from the East, and Marakaso was made Grand Chieftan of the West. Over the next two years, fighting was fierce between the two new tribes, before peace was made in 922, but the relationship was never pleasant. In years to come, this separation and war, the first between members of the Nocian race, became known as the Domanok, or ‘Great Fall’, as Nocians saw the break-up of the great tribe as a fall from grace. Grand Chieftans of both tribes, from this time on, began counting years and history from AD 920.</p>
<p>FIRST EUROPEAN CONTACT, AD 1500</p>
<p>At the turn of the 16th century, Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral passed by the westward tip of Alphanca, but dismissed the sight of land as insignificant, before passing on to Brazil.</p>
<p>In 1575, Ferdinand Miguele, a Spanish trader heading towards Portuguese Brazil on his ship Estolla, passed into a serious storm, and was blown off the course which had been tracked by Cabral 75 years before. Miguele landed on the shore of what he named Phillipland, after King Phillip II of Spain, near the future site of Migueleton.</p>
<p>Miguele met a group of western Nocians who lived in Phillipland, under the Grand Chieftan, Marakaso XI, ruler of all Nocians in the territory between the western coast and the Isthmus of Dugla . Miguele eventually learnt the Nocian language and a number of his crew stayed on with Marakaso, before he returned to Spain on Estolla in May 1578.</p>
<p>EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT OF ALPHANCA, AD 1598</p>
<p>When King Phillip died in 1598, his son, Phillip III, became very interested in Miguele and the island he had discovered. Since Miguele’s return in late 1578, he had returned to Alphanca twice more, altogether mapping the coastline of the island, but he never was involved with the Eastern Tribe, but had extensive contact with Marakaso XI’s son, Jamaneri V, who succeeded his father as Grand Chieftan of the West in 1581.</p>
<p>In August 1598, King Phillip commissioned a Royal mission to meet Jamaneri, with the hope of settling Spaniards on the islands. Colonel Carlos Orillimine, the commander of the Spanish mission, met Jamaneri in December 1598.</p>
<p>In January 1599, a treaty was signed between Orillimine and Jamaneri, which allowed Spanish settlements to begin close to the shores of Phillipland.</p>
<p>In 1602, Orillimine left Alphanca behind, and the 66-year-old Miguele was made Governor by King Phillip. In 1604, Miguele resigned as Governor in favour of one of his deputies, and moved inland with a Nocian clan. He was last seen by Europeans in 1605, and is believed to have died in 1607.</p>
<p><br />
THE FIRST SPANISH-NOCIAN WAR, AD 1618-1622</p>
<p>In 1609, Ferdinand Ollez became the 4th Governor of Phillipland. Early in his term, it became clear that he did not work hard enough to prevent Spanish vandalism of native property, and Nocian anger at the Spaniards grew. In 1617, Jamaneri VI, son of the previous Grand Chieftan, asked Governor Ollez to put a stop to the intrusions. Governor Ollez, who was very racist and resented his appointment to this backwater colony, did not even bother to return any communication from the Chieftan.</p>
<p>In January 1618, Jamaneri prepared for war, with warriors flocking to his capital of Chankla. Around that time, the Grand Chieftan threatened Ollez with the full power of his war machine. In May 1618, with Spaniards now stealing property and ejecting natives in parts of Phillipland, Jamaneri’s Grand Army of Nocians marched south from Chankla, and they invaded Phillipland on May 29 1618.</p>
<p>After early defeats at the hands of the Nocians, the Spaniards congregated to form an army in Migueleton while Governor Ollez, suddenly jolted into action, wrote back to Spain calling for professional soldiers to assist his government. However, around this time, Spain entered the Thirty Years War in Europe, and Spanish troops were committed. The Great Nocian Army, under the 16-Year-Old Crown Prince of the West, Jamaneri, occupied Migueleton on October 10 1618. However, Ollez, now in command of a 12,000-strong settler army, had managed to retreat from the colonial capital and built up his army in the hills of Phillipland.</p>
<p>On December 25 1618, the Christmas Offensive began on Prince Jamaneri’s army in Migueleton. By January 6 1619, the trickle of fleeing Nocians from the isolated city was stopped, and the city, still with Jamaneri and his army trapped within, was besieged by Ollez’s Spanish Alphancan Regiment (SAR). On February 1, Grand Chieftan Jamaneri led another 20,000 men, including 3,000 who escaped from Migueleton, onto the besieged city.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ollez’s SAR was faced with Nocian warriors from both the city and the hills. However, here the superior firepower of the Spanish soldiers came into play. On February 8, Ollez took action. He decided to eliminate the threat from within, and the SAR launched an assault, supported by some minimal artillery, on Prince Jamaneri’s besieged army.</p>
<p>By February 10, the city walls were completely breached, and fierce fighting engulfed the Spanish capital. However, the Grand Chieftan was unaware of the collapse of his son’s defences, as the ritual burning of items in a conquered city by Nocian warriors led to a thick smoke cover that prevented the outer ring of warriors realizing the desperate situation of their comrades within the city.</p>
<p>On February 14, as the last Nocian warriors committed suicide to avoid surrender, Crown Prince Jamaneri took a small force of warriors and managed to sneak through the Spanish positions, weakened by the dispersed fighting.</p>
<p>On February 17, the last remnants of Nocians within the city were defeated, and Ollez turned his attention to the force in the hills. However, the smoke soon cleared, and the Nocians in the hills started building a siege of Migueleton.</p>
<p>Ollez, on February 18, attacked Nocian warriors, and their line collapsed. Over the next two days most of the Grand Chieftan’s army was destroyed, either through surrender or death.</p>
<p>On February 20, the Grand Chieftan retreated into the jungles of eastern Phillipland. On February 22, with most of his army intact from the battles, Ollez led them north, capturing the Nocian town of Vermadu, the northernmost point of Phillipland, on March 1. From there he marched around the western coast of Chankla Harbor, capturing Chankla on March 15.</p>
<p>By April 1619, all of western Alphanca was under Spanish control. However, the soldiers of the Grand Chieftan, who was still at large, were often attacking Spanish military, and they were being helped by Nocians who remained in villages.</p>
<p>After fourteen months of guerilla warfare by the Nocian warriors, a major turning point came. A routine Spanish raid on Nocian positions on June 1 1620 resulted in the death of the Grand Chieftan, Jamaneri VI, and his son, Crown Prince Jamaneri.</p>
<p>The heir to the Grand Chieftanship was Jamaneri VI’s younger son, Prince Marakaso, who was only four at the time. Gharanok, Jamaneri VI’s brother, took over as regent, as Marakaso, now Grand Chieftan Marakaso XII, could only take over at 16. Gharanok was in favour of making a peace with Spain. On July 19 1620, Ollez and Gharanok signed the Treaty of Chankla.</p>
<p>The Treaty gave control of West Alphanca to the Spanish Government, which was now the Colony of West Alphanca, rather than Phillipland. Also, the Spanish recognized Grand Chieftan Marakaso XII as King of Alphanca, and had him crowned King Marakaso I in 1622. The Spaniards allowed Nocians to live under their rule.</p>
<p>Although this Treaty brought peace, it was not popular among any group. The Spanish Alphancans wanted to drive all the Nocians into the East, and were disgusted at the planned crowning of Marakaso XII as King. The Eastern Nocians, who were only beginning to have contact with the Spanish, were furious that a Western Chieftan had been recognized as ruler of all Alphanca, as the Eastern Dynasty was many times older than that of the West. The Western Nocians, among whom Gharanok was hated, had believed they could of won the war, and were furious they were now under Spanish government.</p>
<p>In 1623, Ollez became seriously ill with Malaria, most likely from the swampy terrain around Migueleton, and was sent back to Spain in August 1623. Although he was over 50 at this time and was too ill to continue in government work, he was involved in a long career writing for Spanish newspapers, often criticizing Spanish moves to make peace with the Nocians, as Ollez had been greatly against peace in the first place. He eventually survived the Malaria by February 1624, but it returned in 1631, when it finally killed him.</p>
<p>However, Ollez’s policies in Alphanca continued after his departure, with Governor Fernando Marsez taking over. Marsez, who was already 52 when he took over, denied the request from some Western Nocians to allow the seven-year-old King Marakaso to be taught by Nocians. Instead, his own tutors taught the young King, leading to him being a Spanish puppet when he took over in 1632.</p>
<p><br />
THE SECOND SPANISH-NOCIAN WAR 1665-1667</p>
<p>In 1635, aged 19, King Marakaso I of Nocian Alphanca became father to his first son, Domankari. At this time he moved his capital from Migueleton to the ancient Western capital of Chankla, in an attempt to make peace with his subjects.</p>
<p>However, over the next 29 years, he often was seen to bow to even the most ridiculous demand of the Spanish governor and his army. By 1664, a strong underground resistance movement was developing under Shimonasi the Brave.</p>
<p>In November 1664, Shimonasi the Brave signed a deal with Grand Chieftan of the East, Garmak XV to assist each other against the Marakasans .</p>
<p>In January 1665, Marakaso realised the situation he was in, with three-quarters of the Western Nocians, under Shimonasi, allying themselves with Garmak of the East.</p>
<p>In June 1665, in order to help the King of Alphanca, the new Spanish Governor of Alphanca, Carlos Menqes, brought 12,000 Spanish soldiers with him to his new post.</p>
<p>In August 1665, the Spaniards began deploying around West Nocia. As well as the 102,000 (out of 169,000) Nocians who had joined Shimonasi the Brave, there were over 2,000 (out of 38,000) Spanish-Alphancans in his movement. These European rebels were resenting dominance of the Spanish government on the island by those who had never been there before.</p>
<p>In October 1665, the Spanish captured Shimonasi the Brave’s eldest son, Darnanem, 24, and had him executed for Treason Against the Spanish King.</p>
<p>This provoked the Shimonasians to begin violent campaigns against the Nocian King and his followers, which led to the intervention of Garmak XV of the East, with an army of 28,000 warriors, from a tribe of 216,000.</p>
<p>In January 1666, the Grand Army of Garmak, which had also gained some local rebels, met the Spanish Army of Menqes in the jungles of Phillipland, where Jamaneri VI had hidden almost 46 years earlier, near the village of Lanom. Here, the Nocians were more than double the size of the Spanish (29,500 to 14,800). Altogether, the Nocian superiority was also increased by the jungle knowledge of the 1500 men who had joined Garmak since he left the Isthmus.</p>
<p>Over three days, the Spanish army was routed by the Nocians, before Colonel Enrique Nomas, commander of the Alphancan Garrison of the Spanish Army surrendered on January 22. Unlike in previous Spanish-Nocian battles, the Nocians now had equipped themselves with firepower closer to that of the Spanish soldiers.</p>
<p>After the news of the Spanish defeat at Lanom reached Menqes in Migueleton, where he had been since January 10, he panicked. He gathered together his lieutenants and other senior members of government, as well as much of King Marakaso’s own government, including Crown Prince Domankari, and left for Cadiz on Estolla II, the flagship of the Spanish authorities in Alphanca. However, Marakaso and his four younger sons stayed behind to command the Nocians.</p>
<p>On January 28, 1666, Marakaso left for Chankla, as the East Nocian Army, now with another 2000 Shimonasians, emerged from the jungles of Phillipland and marched on Migueleton, the symbol of Spanish imperialism on the island.</p>
<p>On February 9 1666, Shimonasi the Brave left his jungle hideout, where he had met Garmak two weeks before, on a mission to gather his 100,000 men who were still living in the villages into a great army.</p>
<p>On February 17, Garmak captured Migueleton without a fight, as all the surviving enemy soldiers had either followed Marakaso north to Chankla or had returned to Spain with Menqes on Estolla II.</p>
<p>On February 21, Garmak, like Ollez before him, left Migueleton for Vermadu, where he would meet with Shimonasi the Brave, who, by this time, had 36,000 men under him.</p>
<p>On February 26, Shimonasi captured Vermadu, and increased his army to 45,000. On March 2, he was joined there by the 32,000-man army under Garmak.</p>
<p>On March 15, the 80,000 men of the Grand Alphancan Army marched away northwards, while another 15,000 (out of the 50,000 rebels who had not joined the Grand Army) marched northeast towards Marahasa, in an attempt to mop up the remaining Marakasans and Spaniards in the area.</p>
<p>On April 2, the Alphancans closed off the Chankla Peninsula to the Marahasans, and wheeled around in the direction of Chankla.</p>
<p>On April 10, the city of Chankla was isolated from other parts of the district, and, on April 11, the Alphancans captured the city and Marakaso.</p>
<p>On April 14, with Chankla and all of Alphanca under Garmak and Shimonasi, King Marakaso was put on trial for Treason Against the Western House, which led to his execution, along with fifty other senior members of the Alphancan Royal Court, on April 21.</p>
<p>When news of Marakaso’s death reached Menqes and General Jose Carrere, the man appointed to command the new Spanish Army being prepared to fight in Alphanca, they immediately summoned Crown Prince Domankari to their camp. It was there where the Prince, on May 3, was named King Domankari of Nocian Alphanca and Grand Chieftan Domankari I of West Nocia.</p>
<p>However, in Chankla, Garmak had his ally, Shimonasi, crowned as Grand Chieftan of the West.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, with the war seemingly over and the vast majority of Alphancans favouring the result, the Grand Army began to split up, with most returning to their homes and villages.</p>
<p>On December 3, designed to coincide with the beginning of Nerrimott, 135,000 soldiers arrived from Spain, vastly overshadowing the 32,000 who had stayed on with Shimonasi in Chankla or the 55,000 spread throughout the East of the island.</p>
<p>On December 8, Thomton, on the east coast of Alphanca, fell to the Spanish, followed by the town of Nociad and Narmos Island. On December 25, the Spanish turned north, and marched on Nerrimon, which fell on January 12 1667.</p>
<p>By this point, much of the 87,000 Alphancans had gathered again under the joint leadership of Garmak and Shimonasi. On January 16, this new Grand Army reached the western part of the Great Oldlands, and prepared for battle with the all-conquering Spaniards.</p>
<p>On January 17, the Spanish left Nerrimon, and marched towards the Isthmus of Dugla and the city of Marqab. On January 22, the two armies met near the town of Dunmars in the Oldlands for a battle.</p>
<p>Over the next two days, the fighting was fierce, and the Alphancans were determined. However, they could not defeat the stronger Spanish, and the Spaniards moved on towards Marqab and the Isthmus of Dugla, both of which fell between January 24 and 28.</p>
<p>By February 29, the army of Carrere, which included King Domankari, reached Migueleton, having captured all of Alphanca, including the Bentonan Islands.</p>
<p>On March 10, Domankari was crowned King of Nocian Alphanca and Grand Chieftan of the West in Chankla. The same day, Carrere, who had been appointed Governor over the failed Menqes, began a trial of both Garmak and Shimonasi, which ended with their executions.</p>
<p>On March 21, when the Spanish asked King Domankari to appoint a new loyal Grand Chieftan of the East, he made his only independent move. He abdicated from the Grand Chieftanship of the West and discontinued both positions, ending the era that had stretched back to the time of Garahinko the Tall, 2947 years before.</p>
<p>At the end of the Second Spanish-Nocian War, there were 100,000 Spanish Soldiers left behind, with 65,000 Alphancans of European ancestry, and 110,000 Nocians.</p>
<p>THE NOCIAN JAMONOK, AD 1667-1768</p>
<p>In 1768, 101 years after the end of the Second Spanish-Nocian War, another 159,000 Spaniards had emigrated to the colony of Spain, which resulted in a Spanish-Alphancan population of 230,000. There were also 121,000 Nocians.</p>
<p>Over the last century, the vibrant culture of the Nocians, which had still been thriving in East, and was still alive in the West, before the Second Spanish-Nocian War, was truly dying. More than half of the Nocian population could only speak Spanish, and many were now Christians.</p>
<p>However, their influence had resulted in an entirely new culture developing in the Spanish-Nocian towns of the early 18th Century. There were three occasions from 1700 until 1768 where rebellions of a few thousand men fought against the Spanish Army.</p>
<p>One senior officer in the army of Shimonasi, Ferdinand Acebes, had been the most senior Spanish-Alphancan in the Grand Alphancan Army in the Second Spanish-Nocian War, and, because of this, was executed in 1667, aged 43.</p>
<p>His son, Carlos Acebes, soon began building up those calling for a democratic self-government on the island, which was refused by Governor Carrere officially in 1672. In the five years since the war had ended, a monumental change had occurred in Alphancan society. The cities of the west, such as Marqab, Nerrimon, Thomton, Nociad, Nardon Marshnek, and especially Marahasa, which had been renamed Dugla, had been changed completely. No longer did the population live under Nocian culture, and Spaniards were everywhere.</p>
<p>In 1669, King Damonkari moved his capital from Chankla to Marahasa, which he renamed Dugla. However, all around the country, groups of men were forming to dethrone Damonkari, but, unlike in the past, they now planned a republic consisting of both Europeans and Nocians.</p>
<p>Over the next 32 years, hundreds of cells of Republicans were broken up around the country, but Acebes, who now was running a shipping business in Chankla with Spanish ports in South America, was not seen to be leading the movement.</p>
<p>In 1701, General Carrere retired and returned to Spain, aged 71. In 1703, aged 55, Carlos Acebes, along with two of his three sons, Carlos and Ferdinand, died when pirates attacked his ship, the Fernando, off the coast of Brazil.</p>
<p>Back at home, his 19-year-old son Jose succeeded him as leader of the Free Alphanca movement. In 1712, aged 28, Jose became a father to Julio. In 1715, the dominance of the Acebes Movement ended when Colonel Ferdinand Martens, who had been governor since 1701, was replaced by Carlos Dande, who was very strict on the rebels.</p>
<p>THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE (1768-1772)</p>
<p>The governor, Julio Acebes, sent a letter to Spain saying that all people on Alphanca are now ‘Alphancans’ and not Spaniards or Nocians. The Spanish king was furious and sent the royal expeditionary force to Alphanca on the 2nd of May. The Alphancans fortified the northern coastline.</p>
<p>The Alphancan army was made up of 35,000 Nocians and 67,000 Spanish-Alphancans but were up against 90,000 trained soldiers from Spain – it would be a tough match.</p>
<p>On the 19th of July, the Alphancan army received word that Thomton had been captured by the Spanish. It turned out that the Spanish fleet had sailed around western Alphanca and taken the city by surprise. The Alphancan army marched south to reclaim their land and defeat the invading army. When they got to Thomton they saw many Spanish soldiers patrolling the wall.</p>
<p>”We cannot get over the wall,” said Governor Acebes in a speech that day, “So we must go under it! We will dig a tunnel under the city walls and come out at night.” Many of Acebes’ officers in the army were Nocians, and they knew much about tunnels because many Nocian cities have vast underground parts. It was on the 1st of October that the attack took place.</p>
<p>At exactly nine o-clock at night when the army started creeping out of the tunnel and were all out half an hour later. Half of the Alphancan army stayed outside the city walls to shoot down the Spanish guards when the time was right. One of the guards was going off duty back to the house that he claimed was his, when he saw the Alphancans in the city.</p>
<p>“Rebels in the city! They’re in the city!” This warning was too late for many guards, as the Alphancans were already well placed. Spanish soldiers poured out of their houses, shooting their muskets at Acebes’ men.</p>
<p>As the last Spaniards in the city surrendered to the Alphancans, Acebes met with his senior officers. It was here that news reached them of a large force of Spaniards marching towards Dugla, the capital of the new Republic.</p>
<p>The Alphancans marched west leaving a small force behind at Thomton. When they got to Dugla the Alphancans saw that this time the Spanish army was all at Dugla when 500 soldiers came out of the city gates to patrol the area surrounding the city. The governor decided to use the same strategy as at Thomton, only that the Alphancans on the outside of the wall, after they had shot down the guards, would use a battering ram that the Alphancans had made to knock down the town gates to help their comrades on the inside of the city.</p>
<p>The Alphancan army marched down the tunnel, which they had dug, coming out at nine o’clock on the 2nd of November. When they came out an off-duty soldier saw them and screamed that there were Alphancans in the city. The guards on the top of the wall turned around to shoot the Alphancans, but the rest of the Alphancan army on the outside of the city wall, fired at the Spanish guards from behind. By this time, lots of Spanish soldiers had grouped together to attack the Alphancans inside their city. Meanwhile, the Alphancans on the outside of the walls picked up their battering ram and knocked down the city gates. The Alphancans on the inside of the city ran away from the Spanish who were chasing them. The Alphancans on the outside of the city wall came into the city and started chasing the Spanish. The Alphancans in front of the Spanish turned around to face the Spanish soldiers. When the Spanish turned around, they were faced with the rest of the Alphancan army. The leader of the Spanish army cried “Duck!” just as the Alphancans were about to shoot at them. When they ducked, the Alphancans shot themselves by accident. The Spanish soldiers ran off to the side and retreated out of the city.</p>
<p>As the Spanish soldiers retreated Governor Acebes re-grouped his warriors and ran after the Spanish forces heading west. The Nocians in the army of Alphanca knew this land well and overtook the Spanish army without realizing it. On the 1st December the Alphancans reached Migueleton and found that the people living there were not aware of the Spanish coming their way. Governor Acebes decided that the enemy had been slower than them when going towards Migueleton and that they had overtaken them. The Alphancan warriors settled in the town and waited for the Spanish soldiers to arrive.</p>
<p>On the 2nd December a lookout on the wall saw the Spanish army slowly moving towards them. The Alphancans decided to make the town look unguarded so that the Spanish would believe that the Alphancans had not reached there before them.</p>
<p>When the Spanish army reached Migueleton they saw the city gates left unguarded and figured that the Alphancans living there had fled to the North. When they walked into the city they were attacked by the full might of the revolutionist’s army. By December 5, the Spanish army retreated out of Migueleton and into the jungles of Phillipland.</p>
<pre>
The Spanish army, now considerably weakened by battles, set up a camp. This camp was so small, that the Alphancan army passed it by when looking for the Spaniards.
</pre>
<p>When the encampment was found years later, on the 9th of July, the Alphancans found a note indicating the Spanish surrender, and the Spanish King's acceptance of independance.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>HISTORY OF ALPHANCA 1772-2002 The new government of Alphanca</p>
<p>Julio Acebes became king of Alphanca in 1773. The type of government was not exactly a Monarchy, yet not a Democracy. The king had power enough to change the name of a person! The king could not however, sentence someone without juries present, pass a law without the approval of the three grand advisors , or get any more money than anyone else. What people earned each year was counted, and the king was paid the average out of the taxes per year.</p>
<p>Many people were upset when the king and his advisors declared that it was illegal to eat bread, at a pub in Dugla on the 17th of July, 1775.</p>
<p>Riots broke out all over the country and even the army turned on the four men. With what little supporters they had, they fled to the British colonies in northern America, said to be seeking independence, thinking that perhaps these people would help them.</p>
<p>On the first day of the year in1798, Acebes and his only living advisor, Zolor Michola, came back to Alphanca, which now had a completely democratic government. Acebes said sorry for making the silly law and asked to be named the first president of Alphanca. The current Prime Minister, Taylor Fandango, granted his wish. The Tiberet crisis</p>
<p><br />
In December of 1810, Julio Acebes died. Manuel Tiberet took his place as president. Tiberet was the founder of the Liberal Alphancan Party, which in this, its third year, held one Quarter of the seats in parliament. Taylor Fandango was a member of the People’s Party, yet never seemed to criticize Tiberet.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the People’s party in Dugla, a vote was held that in the next election, they would elect a more competent leader for their party. Fandango was outraged. He was being paid to do what Manuel Tiberet wanted and he didn’t want to lose his money. Fandango singled out all of the neutral party members and bribed them to vote for him. When the elections came, fandango stayed leader, and went on to stay Prime Minister of Alphanca.</p>
<p>Tiberet now controlled all of the government. He stopped funding advertising and spent the money on military. Then, he spent half of all the governments money on the military too!</p>
<p>The people of Alphanca voted Fandango out of parliament in an emergency vote, not suspecting that Tiberet was behind this incident.</p>
<p>Tiberet paid Fandango a large sum of money to keep quiet about everything.</p>
<p>In 1812, a number of politicians revealed Tiberet’s secret and he was sent to prison for life. This crisis nearly bankrupt the government and set the progress of Alphanca back years.</p>
<p>The American Civil war</p>
<p>In 1861, Prime Minister Pedro Alvar sent 300 men to help the north in the American Civil War. The Alphancan government had never supported the use of slaves, and had banned slavery in 1700. These troops were well trained and fought on the front line. All these troops died. The Alphancan government were furious with the USA, for they told them they needed backup soldiers, so the Alphancans did not expect to lose this, a 1/10 of their army. From this point onwards relations with the US were very icy.</p>
<p>Alphancan Silver Mining 1864-1898</p>
<p>In the 1860’s, a large amount of silver was discovered in the province of Bentonan. The silver was found in a mountain range owned by the government. This was an area protected by the Bentonian government, but the national government, led by prime minister Pedro Alvar, were low on funds, so started mining the silver and selling it overseas . The Bentonians suddenly started talking about independence at meetings and, in Dugla on the 3rd of January 1866, many Alphancans from Bentonan marched for independence. When Alphanca refused to grant independence, there were riots in Marshneck, and on the 10th of January, over 100 rioters and 14 police officers died outside the Bentonan government headquarters, where the push for independence was being planned. For 20 more years civil unrest continued in Bentonan, until Marshneck and Likden were both under the control of the rebels. Alphanca continued to send troops to Bentonan for 12 more years. The Alphancans had held on to Bentonan for over thirty years until, in 1898, they granted independence to Bentonan</p>
<p>World War I 1914-18</p>
<p>In 1912 Alphanca joined an Alliance with Britain, France, and Russia in opposition to the central powers. Alphancan forces were sent in large numbers to aid France at the initiation of the German Schliefen Plan. Alphanca fought several battles in Northern France and Belgium, most notably at Marne, in 1914, and Argonne, in 1918. The Alphancian society crumbled at the start of the war, with a majority the able-bodied men away. The fishing industry fell to pieces, and the already poor nation fell into a depression.</p>
