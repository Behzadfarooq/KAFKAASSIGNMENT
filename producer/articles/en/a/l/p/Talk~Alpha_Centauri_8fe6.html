<p>There is one page, the Alpha Centauri page, that is regarding the star system as a whole (general info about all three stars: Alpha Centauri A and B, and Proxima Centauri). The page links to separate detail pages for each of the three stars. The one detail page about Alpha Centauri A indicates a Solar Luminance of 1.519. The main Alpha Centauri star-system page, however, indicates 1.57. Do you know which is the correct Luminance for Alpha Centauri A?</p>
<p>Answer: 1.519 is the best figure, see <a href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/pr-05-03.html" class="external free" title="http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/pr-05-03.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/pr-05-03.html</a></p>

<p>'A' component in the picture titled "Apparent and real trajectory of B component relative to A component" does not lie on bigger axis of B's orbit. More precicely, "flat" orbit is ok, but "tilted" orbit, as we supposedly are seeing it from Earth, is not. Either there is a mistake, or "tilted" pic accounts for the fact that A is not stationary, but has much smaller elliptic orbit too. If it's true, then "flat" orbit needs fixing instead.</p>

<p>Howdy, There is reference under the FACTS section of the Alpha Centauri page (for the star system): Inclination (to plane of sky): 79.24º When the word "sky" is used, does it mean Inclination to the Earth's Ecliptic, or the Inclination to the Primary Star's plane of orbit? I rather doubt that the reference relates to the Galatic Plane? To quote another part of Wikipedia, it might mean, "The ... angle between the normal to the orbital plane and the direction to the observer, since no other reference is available. Binary stars with inclination close to 90 degrees (edge-on) are often eclipsing." If that is the case, doesn't the angle change if it is based on an observer in the Northern Hemisphere, versus on the Equator, versus in the Southern Hemisphere? Thanks, Your easily confused fan, Tesseract 501@aol.com (August 20, 2005)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The definition you quote is the correct one. And, no, it does not depend on where you observe from. It may help to visualise the sky like the ancients did: as a huge spherical backdrop surrounding Earth. It is far enough that rays from observers looking at the same point from various locations on Earth will hit the spherical walls at the same angle: head-on.</dd>

<p>A bit of a request here - would it be possible to know what the sky would look like on a planet orbiting either one of the stars? It would be fascinating to know how the sunrises and sunsets would look, how long night would be given the two suns in the sky, that sort of thing. Assuming an orbit within the habitable zone, somewhere within 0.8 to 3 AU or so depending on which star it is. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 07:46, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks! That's exactly the description I was hoping for. ^^ <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 08:27, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Assuming a planet has an orbit in the same plane as the two stars orbit each other (which is most likely), at one point in the planet's year, the two stars would rise and set together, and in fact, the star the planet orbits would appear to occult the other star. Exactly half a year later, the stars would be directly opposite to each other, and, if the planet has no axial tilt, one would be rising as the other is setting. (If there is an axial tilt, there may be periods of twilight or darkness since one star will be in the sky for less than half a day, or an overlap with both stars above the horizon.) In the intervening months, the secondary star rises and sets earlier each day relative to the primary star. This phenomenon occurs regardless of which star the planet orbits.</p>
<p>However, a planet that orbits both stars, at such a considerable distance that it would be colder than Pluto, would see the two stars together at all times, though varying in their positions as they revolve about each other, with the planet taking so many thousands of years to revolve that the stars' movements are much faster. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 19:03, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Talk%7EAlpha_Centauri_8fe6.html" title="Edit section: Distance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Distance</span></h2>
<p>The article states in the System Components section that the distance of the binary system of Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B is 4.36 light years, while the distance to the Alpha Centauri C or Proxima Centauri is 4.22 light years. However, in the Facts section, the distance to Alpha Centauri is given as 4.396 light years. I suspect that the number given in the Facts section is incorrect or was miswritten to include an extra "9". Anchr 14:53, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>4.396 (actually 4.394 using more accurate conversions) probably comes from the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hipparcos.html" title="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> parallax of 742.24 mas. I don't know where the value that is used in the article came from. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 22:28, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some of the distances may be from older sources. Alpha Centauri has been "receding" from us as astronomers refine their parallax equipment. In the 1893 World Almanac, it was reported as 3.26 light years from Earth (20 trillion miles, or 20 x 10 to the 12th power), equal to one second of parallax. By the 1960s, the distance was refined to 4.2 light years, and through the 1970s and 1980s, 4.3 light years. I learned of 4.393 (25.8 x 10 to the 12th power) light years from the website of the South African Astronomical Observatory, sometime around 2000. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 16:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With a telescope (or binoculars), the 2 primary stars of Alpha Cen are resolvable into distinct components, and will appear as bright as their individual app. magnitude dictate.

<p>There are two reason behind the proposal.</p>

<dd>I <b>oppose</b> the proposed merger - the two stars are each notable in their own right and merit separate articles, though they should of course refer to each other. I think it's not inevitable at all that people looking for info on one of them would be looking for info on the other as well. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Notable, undoubtedly, but that doesn't mean that they need two articles. Sirius B is notable, but it's on the same page as Sirius A. The same is true for Alcor, which is located on the page for Mizar.</p>
<p>Additionally, if α Cen C deserves its own article, why do α Cen A and B not deserve one each?</p>
<p>In all other cases it is star <i>systems</i> that get the article. It makes sense to treat this case no differently from the others.</p>
<p>Perhaps "inevitable" was slightly overstating it; I'll stand by "likely." <a href="../../../b/0/0/User%7EB00P_a30c.html" title="User:B00P">B00P</a> 07:12, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>With an inclination of about 80 degrees, this means from a potential planet around one star the other star would outshine our Sun for parts of the year. Is there a method that this could be found out from the system data on the side bar?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure what you mean - a planet around either would probably be in the same orbital plane as the two suns, so the other would appear kind of like a bright Saturn from the planet. Our sun would be a star in their sky, much smaller than either A or B. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a> 15:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was thinking about how it is the scattered light from the Sun that makes it hard to see anything else on the sky by day except Luna. It is very hard to find Venus even at its brightest (-4.6m) and most elongated from the Sun (about 45 degrees) even on a clear day unless one knows exactly where to look.</p>
<p>Now I was thinking that while the secondary star might appear small on the sky of a planet, if it is 6m dimmer than the primary, the scattered light would also be 6m dimmer compared to that of daylight. Also, the Sun would be a 0.5m star on the sky of a planet, therefore about 5m dimmer than Venus is from Earth at its brightest. Depending on which star would be the secondary and where in the orbit both stars are, the secondary would be between 4.6m dimmer (a Cen A from an a Cen B planet at periastron) and 8.6m dimmer (a Cen B from an a Cen A planet at apastron) so I thought the Sun might be very hard to find on the sky when the secondary is at a relatively small angle to it seen from the planet.<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 21:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wonder what "node at 205°" is supposed to mean. Is that 205° from periastron? And would it mean after that point a Cen B is closer than a Cen A? If so, I guess it would mean the direction towards Earth, seen on the flat orbit from a Cen A, would be at 295° from periastron, or about 6 years before each periastron.<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 13:15, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure what the heading is supposed to mean. Closer to what - a planet or Earth? Roughly every 40 years, one of the stars gets closer to us than the other. Planets in the Alpha Centauri system must orbit one of three gravity centers: Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, or so far out that it orbits both as if they were one. From the perspective of a planet orbiting one of the two stars, the other would act with the characteristics of Uranus in our solar system - taking some 80 years to return to its original position. However, the planet would experience, in a period slightly over one tropical year, a shift of the non-primary star all around the clock - conjunction at one point, and opposition a half year after that; a quarter year after conjunction, the secondary star would be rising approximately one quarter of a day earlier than the primary star. At all times, both stars would be far, far brighter than Earth's sun. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 19:42, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not astronomer, but I have much questions about possibility of habitable planets in Alfa Centauri system. Any planet in this system must have very unstable orbit because gravitional disturbance from another star. Moreover if this planet exist it must have highly unstable conditions on its surface because different quantities of energy which planet obtain when planet is situated between stars and when planet is situated beyond one of stars. From these reasons I believe that none habitable planets are possible in Alfa Centauri system and other double-star systems. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the energy a planet in the habitable zone receives from the other star is always minimal; when the stars are closest to each other and the planet is between the stars, it only receives about 1% of its energy from the other star. A planet for which this would be significantly different would have to be more distant from its primary star, and then its orbit would become so unstable that the other star would eventually pull it out of the orbit around its primary to a more chaotic path, probably slingshooting it out of the system entirely. And about stable orbits: Earth's orbit around the Sun is varying over the millenia between round and elliptic (from the small but persistent effects of other planets gravity, mainly Jupiter's), and Luna's orbit around the Earth even more so (from solar gravity effects), but still both have absolute limits which they don't leave, and neither would an Alpha Centauri planet. The only question is exactly how strong the effect would be.<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 00:10, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is it possible to calculate the maximum distance that planets could potentially form around a star in a binary system without being disrupted by the other star? It would be interesting to note the "planet zone" as well as the "habitable zone". ⇔ <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristTrekker_3e2b.html" title="User:ChristTrekker">ChristTrekker</a> 16:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An article in Astronomy magazine in 1982 said that for the Alpha Centauri system, the maximum distance would be 2.5 AUs from each of the two stars. Beyond that, the gravity of that star would not be dominant enough to overcome periodic tugs from the companion star. I do not know, however, the minimum distance for planets that orbited both stars as a single gravity center. 2.5 AUs is enough to include the inner solar system of our own star, so in theory, both A and B could have four planets, for a total of eight inner planets. The next question is, do those planets exist, and are two, or even one, of them at the right distance from its star for a suitable temperature to allow conditions for life, if that planet has the right chemical elements. Finally, are the planets safe or are they subject to meteor and comet bombardment due to the lack of a Jupiter in close proximity to sweep up those objects? It has been over 10 years since exo-planets began to be found, and I have not heard if anyone's been studying the Alpha Centauri system in search of planets that could be found by those methods already used to discover so many planets around stars that are so many times further away from us. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 17:47, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've looked at it again, this time how much of a temperature rise it would cause: For a planet of a Cen B, temperature at periastron would be about 2K (nearly 4F) higher than at apastron. This temperature rise starts very slowly, and only the 6 years before and the 6 years after periastron would be 1K or more warmer than at apastron. This would still mean a strong global warming and following cooling every 80 years (comparison: in ice ages temperatures are just 5K lower than between them). For a planet around a Cen A, the effects are 3 times weaker as a Cen B is three times fainter as a Cen A.<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 15:55, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand how it is possible. Distantion between Cen A and Cen B is only 11.2 astronomical unit, i.e. only slightly more then distantion between Sun and Saturn (9.5 astronomical unit). Both Cen A and Cen B have mass rougly equal to Sun's mass and highly ecliptical orbit (e=0.52). I don't understand how it is possible that temperature on surface of planet is varied in such small limits in these conditions. Dmitry Krotko.
<dl>
<dd>I think the main mistake you're making is either forgetting that 11.2 AU is the minimum, not the average distance, or that you get just 1 percent of the energy at 10 AU that you would get at 1 AU. Let's look at the example of the planet around a Cen B again. Assuming it is earthlike, it has an average temperature of about 288 K (15°Celsius or 59°Fahrenheit). 11.2 AU is the *minimum* distance between the two stars. Since an earthlike planet has an orbital distance about about 0.7 AU (a Cen B being fainter than our Sun, with about half the energy output), the minimum distance between planet and a Cen A is about 10.5 AU. This again means it is about 10.5*10.5 = about 110 times fainter than it would be at 1 AU distance, at which it would have about 1.52 times the energy output of our Sun... so the energy that reaches the planet is 1.52/110 or about 1.4 percent of the energy of our Sun. Add the 100 percent from a Cen B you get 101.4 percent of the energy of our Sun. Temperature is proportional to the square root of the square root of energy, so you get 100.35 percent of the temperature... the 100 percent would be the 288 K, and the 0.35 percent would be 0.0035 * 288 or about 1 K... so the global average temperature then would be 16°C/61°F instead of 15°C/59°F. I'm sorry that my first guesses were way too generous.<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 19:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Beta Centauri, according to the World Almanac, is 490 light years from Earth's sun. That is 111.36 times as much as Alpha Centauri, which is a shade under 4.4 light years.

<p>The third sentence in the first paragraph is kind of confusing. I mistakenly changed it to read "Alpha Centauri A &amp; B" until I realzed that it was referring to the the fact that Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, two separate stellar systems, form a visual binary.
