<p>Alpha Rho Lambda Sorority, Incorporated/Alianza de Raíces Latinas was created by and for individuals seeking a personal and academic support network. Our members strive to develop a unique bond with each other, make significant contributions to our communities, and achieve personal growth through leadership and academic excellence. The eternal link we share serves to enrich us as individuals, as an organization and as members of our communities.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Tenets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tenets</span></h2>
<p>Alpha Rho Lambda Sorority, Inc./Alianza de Raíces Latinas was founded on the principles of excelling as individuals by striving to reach the highest levels of academic achievement, working toward the betterment of our communities and their members, and establishing a support network of sisterhood that expands beyond the college years. Year after year, "la Alianza" continues to attract women who are committed to living out these tenets in their day-to-day lives and who seek to interact with others that have common values.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Academic Excellence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Academic Excellence</span></h3>
<p>The Hermanas of Alpha Rho Lambda are committed to maintaining our pledge to academic excellence and academic honor. Upon obtaining membership, Hermanas are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.67 on a 4.0 scale. We practice academic integrity and encourage Hermanas to seek academic support not only from their fellow chapter members, but also from Hermanas at other academic institutions and alumnae within their fields of study. Chapters are empowered to utilize organizational and membership support mechanisms to assist Hermanas with their academic programs. Alpha Rho Lambda endorses the academic goals of the membership, and strongly encourages Hermanas to seek professional degrees.</p>
<p>Hermanas of Alpha Rho Lambda have graduated from Yale University, the University of Texas at Austin, Central Connecticut State University, Tufts University, Stanford University Business School, and the University of California at San Diego, just to name a few. These bright women have gone on to practice law and medicine, work in social services, and serve as officers in Fortune 500 businesses.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Community Service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Community Service</span></h3>
<p>Alpha Rho Lambda and its Hermanas maintain a passionate dedication to the betterment of the Latino community and to all those who are disadvantaged or in need. Through various local and national efforts, Hermanas strive to enrich local communities, increase awareness of important issues, and support the empowerment of distressed neighborhoods and groups to promote self-determination and dignity. Alpha Rho Lambda supports and celebrates efforts designed to stabilize the future of Latino communities in order to ensure their survival. Many of the programs Hermanas create and participate in assist diverse communities, and encourage the involvement of other organizations and non-members.</p>
<p>Alpha Rho Lambda has raised funds for the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer organization, and shelters which assist battered women and their children. Beta Chapter has established the Young Latina Excellence Award, which to date has awarded several scholarships to local high school students to assist with their first year college expenses.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Sisterhood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sisterhood</span></h3>
<p>The most important aspect of Alpha Rho Lambda is the everlasting bond of sisterhood developed and cultivated among our Hermanas and the support network we offer one another. Sisterhood is the reason our organization continues to grow and thrive. We make every effort to become familiar with one another and share our opinions, ideas, and dedication to each other and the organization. Through cultural presentations and informative discussions, Hermanas promote communication on the topics of race, ethnicity, and gender in an effort to understand the issues that affect how people respond to one another.</p>
<p>As a Latina-based organization, Alpha Rho Lambda acknowledges all of the various races of Latino ancestry, thereby deriving the name Alianza de Raíces Latinas. Although we are firmly established in our commitment to support Latina women, our Hermanas come from various ethnic backgrounds. We embrace our rich ethnic heritage, and share a mutual respect, wisdom, and desire to share our bountiful ancestry with others. We graciously and openly welcome all women who are interested in true sisterhood and share our organization’s tenets.</p>

<p>Alpha Rho Lambda currently consists of 5 chapters, one of which is reserved for graduates. Although each chapter was founded by a group of students from the same campus, some of these chapters have grown to include Hermanas who attend other institutions of higher education in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"...the only viable option... was to create a new organization..."</p>
<p>During the fall of 1992, ten women came together in search of sisterhood. After extensive research, it became clear that none of the existing organizations could satisfy the needs and expectations of this diverse group, all of whom were of Latino descent.</p>
<p>These enterprising women therefore decided that the only viable option they had was to create a new organization based on the premises they deemed important for college women with needs similar to their own: a dedication to community service, academic excellence, empowerment for all women, and unity. It is through their focused efforts, individual strengths, and mutual ideals that Alpha Chapter of Alpha Rho Lambda Sorority, Inc./Alianza de Raíces Latinas was founded on March 26, 1993 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
<p>As the founding chapter of the organization, Alpha Chapter, established at Yale University, seeks to continue to be a resource for Latinas and all women in the Southern Connecticut region. Alpha Chapter has had the honor of being the first of La Alianza's chapters to induct a graduate student into Alpha Rho Lambda, thus proving that the organization is of benefit to women beyond their undergraduate studies.</p>
<p><a name="Beta_Chapter" id="Beta_Chapter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Beta Chapter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beta Chapter</span></h3>
<p>In the Fall of 1995, six Latina women, Vivian Baez-Montero, Allison Koplik, Maritza Tavarez, Maribel Lara, Erika Suarez, and Wendy Vargas, came together, in search of an organization that would give them what they felt was lacking on their campus. They were searching for an organization that was dedicated to sisterhood, loyalty to each other and their cultures (both past and present), unity, vision, academic excellence and the upliftment of the Latino community at large.</p>
<p>After a search which lasted years for some, they finally came together, and realized that Alpha Rho Lambda Sorority, Incorporated-Alianza de Raíces Latinas, fulfilled all that they were searching for and more.</p>
<p>Founded on May 4, 1996, Beta Chapter is the product of Alpha Rho Lambda's expansion outside of the state of Connecticut. From its small beginnings at Tufts University, the chapter now boasts alumnae and current members from more than seven campuses. The chapter has been a home away from home for Hermanas from different states and countries.</p>
<p><a name="Gamma_Chapter" id="Gamma_Chapter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Gamma Chapter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gamma Chapter</span></h3>
<p>The Gamma Chapter of Alpha Rho Lambda has been reserved for Graduate members of the organization. It serves to recognize the unique needs of graduate and professional women whose schedule constraints may not permit such time consuming involvement, as is characteristic of our other chapters, which consist primarily of undergraduates.</p>
<p><a name="Delta_Chapter" id="Delta_Chapter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Delta Chapter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Delta Chapter</span></h3>
<p>In the fall of 1997, Alpha Rho Lambda undertook the bold project of expansion outside of the Northeast region. With the assistance of one of the founders of the sorority, the Board of Directors worked with a group of women from the University of Texas at Austin to establish Delta Chapter. Despite distance, Hermanas from Texas and from the Northeast have a significant amount of interaction.</p>
<p><a name="Epsilon_Chapter" id="Epsilon_Chapter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Rho_Lambda_de70.html" title="Edit section: Epsilon Chapter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Epsilon Chapter</span></h3>
<p>Epsilon Chapter in San Antonio, Texas, is the most recent addition to the Alpha Rho Lambda family. Founded in the Spring of 1999 by seven students at Our Lady of the Lake University, the youngest chapter in the organization has always demonstrated the noteworthy leadership that prevails at each of the chapters.</p>
<p>Focusing on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood, the seven Chapter Founders--Victoria Vanessa Ruiz, Hortencia Morales, Alexandra Saldana, Amy Denise Aleman, Lorena Navar Gutierrez, Monica Espinoza, and Selena Michelle Baeza--created a sisterhood that would be open to all women who were searching for a vehicle to help them academically and support them emotionally.</p>
<p>Hermanas at Epsilon Chapter expect one another to exemplify the mission, goals, and ideals of La Alianza. Hermanas vow to promote academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. La Alianza shall continue eternally through the commitment that Epsilon Hermanas have to Alpha Rho Lambda's mission.</p>
