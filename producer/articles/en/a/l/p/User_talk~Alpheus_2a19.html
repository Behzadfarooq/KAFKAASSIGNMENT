<p>What's up with the links to this website? Your film link was (on first appearance) blatantly irrelevant to what you claimed it was. Turned out there was a section devoted to the person you described, but frankly I would still have removed the link. Apart from the dubious-looking and all-over-the-shop nature of the site, it's unreasonable to expect anyone to wade through so much non-related stuff before finding the (supposedly) linked material.</p>
<p>Frankly, this looks like spam and/or agenda-linking.</p>

<p>Take it down if you don't like it, I don't care at all. I don't care for your insults either, and certainly not your baseless accusations. I'm not sure which item you are referring to, but the motive would have been other than you so unkindly suggest. Please try to maintain some Wikipedian-style decorum. You have heard of "benefit of the doubt" "civility" and "good manners" I'm sure. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpheus_0c3a.html" title="User:Alpheus">Alpheus</a> 23:37, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed your comments on <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnited_States_1f93.html" title="Talk:United States">Talk:United States</a> and wanted to respond. It's actually more Amerocentric to refer to the US as "America" than the United States, because referring to the country as America disadvantages Latin and South America by marginalizing their existence. It's a more pressing issue in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> than in English, where a new <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonym.html" title="Demonym">demonym</a> was created for the United States (<i>estadounidense</i> to replace <i>americano/a</i>). I do personally think that the name of the United States sucks no matter how you look at it, but in my opinion, using United States is far less offensive than America. <a href="../../../i/b/o/User%7EIBook_of_the_Revolution_13f6.html" title="User:IBook of the Revolution">the iBook of the Revolution</a> 06:49, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have not done so. However important you might think you are, mate, it is very un-Wikiquette of you or anyone to leave unsubstantiated allegations on any Wikipedia page, particularly a user's talk page, and I won't leave it here for long if you don't substantiate your rude assertion. You might try sending a private message, rather than vandalise a talk page next time you want to play bigshot.<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpheus_0c3a.html" title="User:Alpheus">Alpheus</a> 05:46, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you are partly right (except Wikipedia is a public activity). Someone pointed out at <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpam_7973.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Spam">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">WP:WPSPAM</a> that you, as "the admin of a new wikia" have been promoting your website here on Wikipedia, by posting the link to many articles, with the tagline "...encourages articles on...". We at Wikipedia prefer content instead of links. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkspamremover_b617.html" title="User:Linkspamremover">Linkspamremover</a> 09:48, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your courteous response, Linkspamremover. When you say "we at Wikipedia", please bear in mind that I have been actively editing Wikipedia for a long time. I also point out that, yes, we at Wikipedia want content, but we also want 'External links' and always have. Anyway, my adding external links can in no way be called spamming "my website". I don't think that it should be considered wrong to put a link on a wiki to another wiki that covers the very same topic. Please note that I do not own Wikia nor any part of it. I have no financial interest in any wiki. The message that you left referred to "commercial links" and "private websites". Perhaps you did not mean to, but I feel you brought me into disrepute by such phrasing. Surely it would be more gracious to ask a user (especially one such as I who has promoted and contributed to Wikipedia since the early days) by leaving a polite note asking them to contact you to discuss whatever is perceived to be a problem. I have no objection (nor time to argue, nor inclination to escalate into an edit war) if anyone chooses to remove the external links I placed in good faith and with plenty of justification. I placed the links in good faith and altruism, but if they are removed I'm too busy to squeal. By the way, with very great respect, your username makes you sound like some kind of Star Wars bad guy and you can hardly be surprised if people get offended when you leave such blunt and unspecific messages. At the very least, when you leave such messages, you might consider actually referring to the link that you allege to be spam, rather than accusing without presenting evidence. That just gets people's hackles up. However, my colleague, I sign off this message with feelings of goodwill and acknowledgement that you are only trying to improve Wikipedia, as I am, and wish you a good day, and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpheus_0c3a.html" title="User:Alpheus">Alpheus</a> 01:43, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Please note:</b> I have just discovered that my error, interpreted by some as spamming, arose from my mistaken belief that Wikia (formerly Wikicities) is a Wikimedia Foundation project, like Wikipedia or Wikisource. It certainly looks like one, and has many internal links to Wikipedia and uses Wikipedia formatting, templates, etc. Also, I understand that Wikia contributes financially to the Wikimedia Foundation. (Thus I didn't think I was linking outside Wikimedia.) However, I admit my error but wish to make it quite clear that it was an honest mistake. To my detractors on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpam_7973.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Spam">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">WP:WPSPAM</a>: -- wiki work can be very complex sometimes, and life can be too rushed for anyone to know everything, so please go a bit easier. My motives were not as you might have thought. Feel free to remove any links (but I still think they are apposite and very useful to the reader). <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpheus_0c3a.html" title="User:Alpheus">Alpheus</a> 02:03, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I just started editing it before realizing no one has been editing it for a while (I should have checked out the recent changes earlier!). Anyways, what is going on with it? Have you given up (you haven't edited for a while)? In fact, in an hour I've made way more edits than were made in the last 30 days. Kinda depressing, since it sounds like a good idea for a wiki. If you have given up, would it be possible for you to perhaps pass the reigns on to me so I can give it a go and try to revitalize it? I know it's pretty weird to be asking for sysop powers after just joining up, but I am an experienced editor here on wikipedia and have two awards, including one from someone who was recently elected to adminship here, and it's not like anyone else is there right now. I will admit that I don't have the best grasp of the technical aspects of running a wiki, but I do have a lot of resources here who can help me, and some who might be interested in contributing there too. And again, it's not like anyone else is there to see me fail miserably if I do. Well, I hope this project can get off the ground because it really is needed. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 12:21, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, The Ungovernable Force. Thanks a lot for your enthusiasm. I admit I have been very busy lately and haven't put in all the energy I used to. I'm really glad you'd like to help and will join you there soon. I won't hand over sysop now but let's play it by ear. The main thing is to make a great wiki and I would sure appreciate your involvement, as until now it has been mostly yours truly. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpheus_0c3a.html" title="User:Alpheus">Alpheus</a> 04:59, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
