<p>G'day from a wet part of oztraylia, your bot thingy descended upon the above name. I am very curious as to what the bot thingy is interested in. I have dabbled with te article at times and wondered what might be specifically the fault it might hone in on?? would appreciate a response! <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">SatuSuro</a> 10:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually didn't tag the page. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimpbot_48b3.html" title="User:Alphachimpbot">Alphachimpbot</a> completes the simple and repetitive task of converting cleanup links to month-specific cleanup links. The actual tag was issued by <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortunecookie289_45da.html" title="User:Fortunecookie289">Fortunecookie 289</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imogiri&amp;diff=60272429&amp;oldid=56330515" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imogiri&amp;diff=60272429&amp;oldid=56330515" rel="nofollow">here</a>. That being said, I'll offer my opinion. The article does not appear to match the standard Wikipedia articles. Although the content appears to be there, it's format is generally non-consistent with a featured article (See <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant_High_School_9363.html" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a> (a featured article) to see what I mean). I hope that helps. I've appended the wikify tab also. This comment is posted on both of our talk pages. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 21:47, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your response, it helps. It will take time to fix from my perspective, and I must say there was less of an intention to be a feature article,as opposed to being closer to a list with a spearate article as a proper article! Oh well so easy to get distracted on the way! Thanks again. <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">SatuSuro</a> 08:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleanup Template</span></h2>
<p>I've just fixed some of your mistakes, so I figured I would give you a quick heads up. Cleanup and wikify categories are not {{cleanup|Date-June 2006}} or {{wikify|Date-June 2006}}. Instead, they are {{cleanup-date|June 2006}} and {{wikify-date|June 2006}}.

<dd>Hi. There seems to be a bit of ambiguity over this. I previously used {{cleanup-date|June 2006}} but I noticed that someone changed it to {{cleanup|Date-June 2006}} so ever since I have used the latter thinking it was correct. Anyway at least I now know which is correct, thanks for letting me know. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbsey_d5ce.html" title="User:Forbsey">Forbsey</a> 07:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your frustration in my reversion of your edits. To be honest, there was no warning/statement for what I wanted to say to you. I did read your contributtions. I wanted to tell you that the spelling and grammar in your contributions were so bad (sorry, but it's true) that they were basically insalvageable. Still, it was not vandalism, and perhaps the implications of my change were inproper. I have reverted my removal and added a cleanup and copyedit tag. I would suggest that you work on improving the spelling and grammar, as they are a total disaster. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:22, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting?</span></h2>
<p>Hi Alphachimp, would u like to explain me what`s wrong with this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maja_Pavlovska" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maja_Pavlovska" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maja_Pavlovska</a></p>
<p>actually why it`s written this message:</p>
<p>"This page may be a user page mistakenly created as an article. Because Wikipedia is an effort to create an encyclopedia, its content is restricted to materials that are appropriate for an encyclopedia, in which case this page may qualify for deletion as a vanity page. If the creator of this page is a new user, and would like to keep this information posted on Wikipedia, the information in this article can be transferred to the User page of their account. If you feel the page is notable, please discuss the matter on its talk page."</p>
<p>I didn`t have intention to make a user page, but an article, cause all the details mentioned there are right, and Maja is a famous painter and song writer in Macedonia. I just wanted to help.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from u soon...</p>
<p>Thanks... --Majabobi 18:53, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The page does not properly assert the notability of Maja Pavlovska. The similarity between the name of the page and your username, as well as your statement that you wanted to upload "your" photo, probably led the editor placing the tag to believe that you were writing a vanity page. I would suggest editing the article to say more about the notability of Pavlovska. Hope that helps.

<dd>Nah. The message is somewhat of a generic one. You didn't subst a cleanup tag, but you used a badly formed one.

I have a bot that changes {{cleanup}} to the month-specific tags, but tags spelled wrong or subst'ed sort of screw it up. So yeah, thanks for your contributions.

<dd>Quick question: how do you remove the non-usertalk pages from the list? For my cleanup bot, I just click the "remove non-mainspace" option in the file menu. But, obviously, user talk is not mainspace.

<p>Thank you for replying. I was trying to get an edit put into the George W. Bush article. Then my account disappeared. When I tried to log back it, I was told that BMIKESCI did not exist. So I created a new account with the same account name. I've lost the privledge to edit the George W. Bush article however. Also I can nolonger work on the Ken Lay account. I'm not sure what to think about this. Anyway, thank you for replying.</p>

<p>If you have a moment: please take a look at an edit I did earlier today on the Sing-Sing pages. Initially, I just tagged it for references/clean-up, but the more I looked at it, the more it became apparent that it was a straight "review" and had almost no facts in it. So I deleted almost the entire thing in the hopes that someone better equipped with facts than myself will come along and add to it. Was this the proper thing to do or should I have not deleted the entire thing? If you don't have the time, no problem. I'm learning, and don't want to needlessly delete other's work.

<dd>I really do appreciate the offer. I'm pretty sure that the article will be removed at the current rate. Wikipedians really don't like it when they see someone come by and create an article about a business of which they are a part. Most of the time, these creations are just drive-by postings of some corporate material. Wikipedians really don't like it when they feel that the organization is not notable. I see that you've done a considerable amount of research into the policies surrounding the proposed deletion. As it is right now, I think that you will probably lose the article. I would suggest saving it in your userspace (I'll show you how if you'd like) and possibly writing something much, much shorter (people have trouble objecting to 2 sentences) sometime down the line (think 1-2 months).

<p>Can you make any other suggestions as to how to fix this article? It seems that others have also suggested this, but it has not happened? I'm not sure the best way to start on this. Laura June 15:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alpha, as I explained on the discussion page, Jeffrey Johnson is a signifigant musician in Western MA, birthplace of bands such as Sonic Youth, Pixies, Dinosaur Junior and others. There is a revival of independant musicians, Jeff has opened for bands such as Apollo Sunshine and Scary Monsters. Also notable is a revival of the reknown of the department he was involved with. I believe a page for him is not frivolous. Thanks.</p>

<dl>
<dd>While I do think that an explanation is in order, I think that this is a bit of an overreaction. People really do have lives outside of Wikipedia, and I think that administrators with them are significantly more balanced. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 18:32, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll strike out my vote, and wait for the answer. I wasn't trying to say that admins shouldn't have lives (of course not). What I was saying was that that could easily explain several weeks or a couple months of inactivity. But this is a year. Certainly there are explanations for a year of inactivity, but I would hardly consider it explanable by simply "people have lives".

<p><sup>You are getting this weekly update because you are signed up on the <a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_AWB_spamlist_180d.html" title="User:Mboverload/AWB/spamlist">spamlist</a> for updates about mboverload's <a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_AWB_f45f.html#My_AWB_replace_settings" title="User:Mboverload/AWB">magical automatic typofixing settings for AWB</a></sup><br />
<big>Important Update - removes entries that make incorrect replacements – must have update</big><br />
<br />
<b>500 lines of new code</b>, of which include at least 1,500 different possible matches, probably more! I’m up to “d” in the words to replace. Even after I get to Z (a few months) there will be a lot more to do because there are more varieties of each word to replace. One line can match 10 or more different variations of each word, so saying that I added 500 lines does NOT mean 500 new words – It’s more!</p>
<p>I now have a <b>Sourceforge.net project!</b><br />

<p>Hi Alphachimp, my edit to the Canada's Next Top Model (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canada's_Next_Top_Model&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64152352" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canada's_Next_Top_Model&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64152352" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canada's_Next_Top_Model&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64152352</a>) was reverted. I think this edit should not have been reverted as the original version was clearly non-neutral.</p>
<p>Rather than matter-of-factly presenting what contestant Brandi actually stated during the show proper (that she believed the contest winner should be someone who was born in the country), the original text clearly inserted snide editorial interpretations ("greater sense of entitlement", someone who had the "accident" to have been born in the country, "photos and runway skills be damned") that do not represent what Brandi's articulated position. Whether or not the original author agreed with Brandi's perception, it is not adhering to the Wikipedia neutral point of view to put words in Brandi's mouth in order to hold her position in ridicule.</p>

<p>However some of what I added is based on what I can only refer to as local knowledge - ie I am from the town and am familiar with for example the connection of the 3 Olympians with the name of the local Athletic club. How should I cite this or should I just leave it?</p>

<dd>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_your_sources#What_sources_to_cite" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_your_sources#What_sources_to_cite" rel="nofollow">WP:SOURCE</a>, you should only cite credible Third-Party sources. That being said, I think that you are fine with just adding it. If you have any other sources (e.g. books, letters, etc.), you could cite them, but I would not avoid adding something to wikipedia just because I could not source it. I hope that that answers your question. Feel free to contact me if you need any further clarification or have any other questions.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hypocritical</span></h2>
<p>I wrote an article on our company detailing who we are and what we do entitled MediaMiser. It was actually the same format as another article I came across on Wikipedia on another corporation. It was deleted being cited as promotional content.</p>
<p>Now I’m noticing some inconsistencies seeing as how there is an article on Microsoft, their current products, and upcoming products like Vista.</p>
<p>I wrote the article hoping to link it to media analysis, since our site is a large information resource, and number one provider of media analysis in Canada.</p>
<p>If someone is trying to find out about a corporation’s background, what they do, and produce I don’t see why it would be a violation. This site is supposed to be an information resource.</p>
<p>Legally corporations hold the same rights as a person, and there are several articles detailing people from race car drivers to celebrities Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If Microsoft is allowed to have a wiki so should we, popularity should have nothing to do with deletion policy. Take a look at the wiki on Nike, it has an entire section devoted to all their ad campaigns.</p>
<p>It's pretty hypocritical to refuse content from a small corporation, while letting large corporations run rampant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.42.98.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.42.98.121_39a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.42.98.121">contribs</a>).</small></p>

The article characterized token suckers as "guys on their last legs," i.e., druggies and homeless (not "street urchins"--ain't no Oliver Twist situation). In that context, it doesn't seem as far-fetched. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 01:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Hypocritical</span></h2>
<p>Sorry didn't mean to come across sounding frustrated before. I actually enjoy these discussions. I just think that wikis should be an information resource available on any organization. Just as there are several low prominence non-profit organizations listed there should be organizations from all sectors.</p>
<p>That being said it should only be information in a neutral form. No marketing terms, or fluff, just facts.</p>
<p>I understand why they would enact a policy to leave small corporations out, because many engage in this type of promoting.</p>
<p>My previous article contains only facts, and no opinion. If I were to have written “This amazing company, with an A-list of clients…” then by all means I would endorse removing a wiki like that, it’s shameless promoting.</p>
<p>It’s pretty disappointing when large organizations are using their wikis as a promotions tool for their latest sponsorship or ad campaign and no one decides to remove that content. It’s equally as bad as the promoting I talked about before.</p>
<p>I think these rules are disproportionate, and could be managed better.</p>
<p>Remove the sites and information engaged in promoting, and leave the sites that reflect hard facts. This includes removal of promotions materials from large corporations’ wikis.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are mixing up what a "Wiki" is. A <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> is not the individual article, it is the site as a whole. So, if you say that someone started their own Wiki, it would be something analagous to me starting alphachimppedia.org (which would be awesome, btw). Don't worry about sounding frustrated or not. I can honestly say that I would be frustrated if someone deleted an article that I had created. Wikipedia tries not to be an indiscriminate collection of information. I could not, for instance, make up an article about myself, because I do not have sufficient <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> to appear in my own article. The same goes for all relatively small organizations (unless there is some incredible redeeming factor that justifies a separate article). I respect that your article was purely factual. It was not, however, purely notable.</dd>
<dd>As for large corporations engaging in promotion of their goods and services through Wikipedia: Wikipedia is unique in that <i>any</i> user operating in good faith (e.g. not a vandal) can edit the content of an article. It also has a NPOV (Neutral Point of View) policy. You are welcome to change anything that you appear to be blatant advertising. Can you give any examples of what you are talking about? <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 03:54, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commenting about an entry and then having some implication that I am engaged in trickery</span></h2>
<p>I am wondering what happens when an implicit accusation that I have been involved in trickery of some sort is made. For the record, I have not been. There is an entry called Thingbox which I have commented on as it is being marked for deletion. I argued that it should be kept, and now I see someone has made accusations about all those wanting the site kept being engaged in "sockpuppetry". This is not true in my case. I have one account on wikipedia, and I have made contributions in other areas (including reversing and expanding the Haslington entry after some people re-wrote it cliaming that it was a "kingdom" and they and their friends ran it!"). Neither have I been "ordered" in any way to contribute to this discussion about Thingbox.</p>

<dd>I've reviewed the AfD and it seems pretty obvious to me that that was somewhat of a baseless accusation. A lot of times, when an established user sees a spate of new users voting in an afd (a new user is usually characterized by an unfamiliar username and a red link to their userpage), he assumes that it is an instance of sockpuppetry. I really wouldn't worry about this too much, unless a formal accusation is leveled against you at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets</a>.

<p>Thanks for taking the time to review and reply. I appreciate it. Thanks also for the welcome to wikipedia! <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 08:49, 19 July 2006 (UTC) Sorry to come back to you, but there is a continued issue of a rather "highhanded" attitude that some people are taking towards myself (and may be others). As Anon writes below, there is an issue of accusations being made, and being continued to be made, based on suppositions about the past behaviours of other people (not the people having the accusations made against them in this instance) just because, for example, I had a long break from my initial use and contributions to wikipedia. The whole experience has been off-putting, and, I might suggest, detrimental to the image of wikipedia. Instead, I am now accused of wikilawyering. I think these kinds of accusations need some response, though I suspect each response is likely to be viewed by some as being some sort of "failing" on the part of those who feel that their characters or behaviours have been unfairly criticized and that responses are needed. It is in this way that unsubstantiated accusations can continue to be made and be unchallenged. It is all very sad. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 12:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Alpha, I must tell you I am completely impressed by the incredible levels of activity you've been consistently demonstrating since months ago, as well as your quick grasp of policy - wow!. Tho I'm positive I'm not original in the least, I must let it out of my system and say it, you are SO clearly great admin material, that it almost blinds me to watch at your contribs!&#160;;) Needless to say, when the day comes for you to go for adminship (which is right around the corner, I bet), you can easily count on an enthusiastic "yay" from me. But above everything else, the main reason why I decided to drop by was to tell you that I value your humane approach to the project - now that, is way harder to find, and for that, not only you have my admiration, but my wholehearted gratitude as well. Too many times we see stressful and regretable situations that could have been easily solved with just a little good will - and at times like that, I hope others would follow your example. Finally, I am rather puzzled that nobody has seen fit to throw one of these <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuriken.html#Hira_shuriken" title="Shuriken">shuriken</a> at you yet - perhaps I can solve that?&#160;;) (or, I can just present it to you in a velvet box instead - what do you prefer?&#160;;) Keep it up, my dear Alpha, and should you ever need my help, or if you just feel like talking, you know where to find me, right?

<p>I think you have elided away from the point, <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">User:alphachimp</a>, or at least as far as the events are significant to me.</p>
<p>The objector made a direct accusation without supplying any supporting evidence. As I know that several of the contributors to the AfD page are distinct carbon-based humanoids, he has libeled them all. Furthermore, he has brought the discussion to a halt by libelling any subsequent contributor who opposes deletion. I am not, by using a legal term, advising a legal remedy -- that way madness and bankruptcy lie! I am simply pointing out that there is a reason in law why it is wrongful to make false accusations and I would ask you to point me to the appropriate rememdy within Wikipedia for an unsupported accusation against fellow contributors.</p>
<p>A bun-fight on the AfD page is not a satisfactory remedy.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">User:GWO</a> must either present evidence to support his claim or retract it. How do I invoke this challenge?</p>
<p>The objector's posting was directly responsible for my NOT putting forward a new argument in favour of retention. What am I to do to prevent being subject to this 'prior restraint' which he has invoked?</p>
<p>FYI - the original posting:</p>
<pre>
   * Delete, nn website indulging in shocking sock puppetry. -- GWO
</pre>
<p>May I also clarify my motivations:</p>
<p>it is not 'offence' or 'indignation' at having been bullied out of an AfD. It is the fact that the actions of a contributor on an AfD page have been highly disruptive to the editing process.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mystery: Cleanup Tag in <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sagrada_Familia_fa50.html" title="Sagrada Familia">Sagrada Familia</a> Article.</span></h2>
<p>Hello, Alphachimp. Apparently last 18 July 2006 your Alphachimpbot tool re-added, for no apparent reason, a cleanup tag to the <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sagrada_Familia_fa50.html" title="Sagrada Familia">Sagrada Familia</a> article.</p>
<p>Last February user <a href="../../../u/r/b/User%7EUrbane_Legend_8840.html" title="User:Urbane Legend">UrbaneLegend</a> politely asked: <i>"Could the person who tagged this article for cleanup please say why. Templates are useless by themselves. Furthermore, the page looks fine to me."</i> ... He/she got no answer, so he/she went on to remove the tag on March.</p>
<p>Now (July 2006) the cleanup tag is back again, <i>apparently</i> thanks to your bot. I agree with user <a href="../../../u/r/b/User%7EUrbane_Legend_8840.html" title="User:Urbane Legend">UrbaneLegend</a>: the article looks fine to me, too. I wonder, what needs to be cleaned up? I find it interesting and informative, with no language problems, no mistakes, no useless info. Perhaps you could teach us about what has been found wrong in the article?</p>

<dd>I don't usually comment on what was wrong with the article, but I can comment on what my bot did. My bot only sorts articles for cleanup that have already been flagged by another user.

The next day, my bot changes the tag to the updated version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64389775" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64389775" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Help!! Article Constantly being Vandalized!</span></h3>
<p>The GraalOnline article is constantly being vandalized by its administration in an attempt to remove any information on an Unofficial Forums created by members and also any criticism towards them.</p>
<p>We have made several attempts to discuss this, but Stefan and Unixmad the administrators of the game, keep vandalizing it.</p>
<p><br />
I have attempted to post a neutrality template in order to get them to try and DISCUSS removing what the players have written, but they persist. The neutrality of this article is HEAVILY threatened now as most players are growing tired of having to change every little thing they do.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could step in and remind them that this is not their website or their game and they can not censor out things they do not want readers to read.</p>

<dd>I would agree that there is a good bit of edit warring going on at GraalOnline. I would suggest bringing the case before the <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDCABAL_a492.html" title="WP:MEDCABAL">mediation cabal</a>. I would caution that, although it is good to include criticism of articles, it is generally a bad idea to put things in that are <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a>. It's also a bad idea to engage in edit or wheel warring. I've restored my welcome message.

I have reverted the Criticism section because <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">User:Warcaptain</a> keep reverting to a version containing personal attacks against me. Is it allowed on wikipedia to put such text ? "GraalOnline's manager, Stéphane Portha, is viewed by critics as a harsh individual" Also me and lot of others have discussed the Criticism section on the discussion page and it have been decided to not put personal attacks neither advertise the <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">User:Warcaptain</a> private forum (UGCC) on an article about the online game Graalonline.

<p>I mean, do you feel the need to put the naked women first. If you truly sympethize with my concerns,you(with all the respect you have shown me)would say "You know what it is true that the diagram Naldo placed served the same purpose as that nude woman." In fact, if you look at the bottom of the page you would be pleased to find many images of nude women. A person can merely take the diagram which you can see and simply switch that image for the other. So you see, no one needs to remove the original image we simply place it with all the other pictures at th bottom and place the diagram at the top. Think of it this way, say that woman was your daughter and her photo was in the pedia. Would you not be offended that everyone was gawking at her. But guess what sir, someone is that womans father and we must treat this as if that man was in the room with us as we view this content. I leave it at that sir, you seem quite sensible, so I'll leave it to your heart to decide the issue. But yes, sir, you do make a point, the image is not against any rule in wikipedia, it should just be a moral rule that all men should follow. Thank you.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">STOP IGGY</span></h2>
<p>The STOP IGGY website is a legitimate addition to the Michael Ignatieff page - it is an Opponent Site to his candidacy for Liberal Party leader, and has previously been labelled as such, until someone removed the label. It is rude and incorrect of you to call this website "personal advertising". If this line of logic were to be upheld, then any webpages pretaining to Ignatieff's candidacy should also have been taken down by you - including his official campaign website, which surely falls under the category of "personal advertising". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.131.70.118 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.131.70.118.html" title="User talk:66.131.70.118">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.131.70.118_851f.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.131.70.118">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I still don't understand what the problem was. Of course you don't expect me to just say "oh, it's nothing" after making such obvious threats by suggesting you supposedly know my identity. The only resolution i can accept at this moment for this vehement attacks is a face to face meeting to iron out this problem (that should not be a problem for you as you seem very eager to that). however, current circumstances render this meeting very unlikely to occur in the near future and even it will, i'm afraid you won't survive it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Knoppix/VandalSniper</span></h2>
<p>Hi -- sorry to bother you, I was just wondering if you'd had any more luck with your network problems in Knoppix. Sorry if I was convoluted or tiring in my responses (or insultingly over-simplifying; I've become anal about "keeping it simple, stupid"). Obviously, I'm still stumped on what the exact problem is. I still think it's either an issue of the DHCP server not sending back all the needed info for a good route, or an issue with buggy hacked Linux wireless drivers. (Your router is wireless, right?)<br />
I hope this hasn't completely turned you off to trying out VS, as it really seems pretty handy, if you're still interested. The setup guide on my talk page does work for me, so if you happen to get the networking running, give it a go and let me know how things turn out. Please feel free to try these steps sometime and drop me a line if you have more problems (or feel free not to). Have a good one, and keep up the great countervandalism efforts. -- <a href="../../../o/m/i/User%7EOmicronpersei8_71da.html" title="User:Omicronpersei8">Omicronpersei8</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/i/User_talk%7EOmicronpersei8_2291.html" title="User talk:Omicronpersei8">talk</a>) 04:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't really know who to ask and you seemed like the right person since you have been here for a while and have made a good deal of contributions. Actually this is quite random, but it seems everytime I sign my posts it says <b>"Creating is harder than deleting"</b> I have no idea why it does this. Can you please help me. I would like it to just say my name or better yet, look like your name when you sign. Could you please help me.

<dd>Good questions. I actually wondered about this for a couple of months when I first came here. You need to go into the "my preferences" menu and select "raw signature". The space above is open for your sig code, using standard wiki markup (that might be, by the way, why your sig says creating is harder than deleting. Anyway, here's my sig:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[[User:Alphachimp|&lt;font color="DarkSlateGray"&gt;'''Alphachimp'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Alphachimp|'''&lt;font color="Black"&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/sup&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>If you want to have the same sig (I copied it from others, btw), you can just copy that, changing it to:</dd>

<dd>

<p>Thank you for the removal of the word, NONSENSE. We VELDERS' are a proud family, and WE are ROYALITY dating back to 1207. I am sure that the member of our family has paper proof of this. I was only sent a written letter, in Dutch as to its authenticity. As stated elsewhere, I have been working on my Family tree for over 15 years, and one place where I have spent many an hour each day, for weeks, is the LDS. I have posted post's all over the world seeking our name. Found there are Streets, etc, and plenty of VELDERS.</p>
<p>met a Professor in a university of Holland who had come over to hold a sermester for three day, in Athens Ga, University of Athens, and he brought with him his Family Tree. There is/was so much information that I had gathered on line, so I shall re-enter my family member as a Royal member of our VELDERS' FAMILY. What gave me the idea was, I was watching a T.V. station this morning, and saw that the reporters name was brought up on the screen, and it gave a little information about her. I feel that Pieter Velders, a desentant or ROYALITY has just as much, if not more reason to be listed.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">3RR</span></h2>
<p>If I recall correctly, the three-revert rule does not apply to cases of vandalism. At first, this was a content dispute, but various other editors (as well as myself) have demanded the anonymous editor to provide sources for his edits, which he has not; he has not even attempted to discuss the issue. At this point it is simply vandalism. Yesterday he continued to vandalize, even after being warned 4 times. He was then blocked for 3 hours, after which he immediately began vandalizing again. I also submitted the vandalized pages to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>; my request was denied, with the suggestion to simply revert (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;oldid=66003212#Six_New_York_City_Subway_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;oldid=66003212#Six_New_York_City_Subway_articles" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p>Trust me, I thought about the 3RR before I started reverting, and if anyone blocks me, I will use that RFP response as my justification. 3RR was meant to prevent legitimate edit wars (over content); this is just vandalism. And I cannot be held guilty for making so many reverts if my request for page protection was denied. What am I supposed to do without page protection—let the guy keep vandalizing? --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_V_35de.html" title="User:Larry V">Larry V</a> <small>(<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_V_df0b.html" title="User talk:Larry V">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Larry_V_bfa4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Larry V">contribs</a>)</small> 18:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I think it would be just fine to rename it and then let the redirects do their job; I've done it quite often myself with NYCS service templates and such, and it works perfectly.

<p>Thanks for the explanation. Yes, I understand the usefulness and importance of bots. The reason I wrote that was, as you mentioned, I was finding an inordinate number of bot edits on my watchlist, most of which seemed at first glance to be trivial edits.

<p>Hey there. I noticed that in the infobox for the <a href="../../../1/7/5/175th_Street_%28IND_Eighth_Avenue_Line%29_54a4.html" title="175th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)">175th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)</a> station, under "next south," it identifies the A, but not the C (or the 1, for that matter, but since the 1 is on the IRT B'way line, I wouldn't really expect it). Anyway, being new to the world of templates and such, I don't really see how I can correct this. If you do understand it, could you give me any pointers, etc? Thanks</p>

<p>Yeah. Thanks for your sincere and illustrious comments on my page. They are actually appreciated and as far as the nitwit vandal thing..no problem. Most of my irritation was aimed at a nasty, but sort of funny, too, accusation that was placed on my page by a <b>real niiwit</b>, at or around the same time. But, in any case, you gave me a laugh and I sorta always like to do that. As far as the Germans solution of userboxes goes, I don't much give a shit what the Germans think about userboxes. As far as the pres goes, well he's the pres, what can I say? I don't personally agree with him and the controlling nature of his decision, but what I think is not a big deal anyway, so who cares? In the end the new official Wikipedia environmental userbox is more attractive but it doesn't say what I would like it to say. It says, "This user is interested in environmentalism." If I make my own it will say "This user is an environmentalist." Not exactly the same thing. Anyhow, thanks for taking the time to leave considerate and funny comments on my page.

<p>Hi, I have noticed that the subject of food heritage and food-themed museums have not yet been covered in Wikipedia. My wife and I are pioneers in this field. But since original research and thoughts are not welcome...how do worthy topics not previously examined get included? Seems this is a catch 22 situation. Please advise. We are the authors of several books on food history and the directors of The Food Museum and its Global Food Heritage Project....which has been recently profiled in ICOM News....that's Unesco's Council on Museums. We have professional museum credentials, as well, having been guest curators an exhibit at the Smithsonian. Anyway we admire Wikipedia and wanted to see if the worthy subject of museums about eating and food could somehow get included.</p>

<p>The entire purpose of the article is to disparage. There is <i>nothing</i> in the article that is not disparaging. The article is unsourced. Three of us now agree that it meets speedy deletion in every way. As an admin, you should at least explain why it does not meet Speedy Delete criteria. I don't think you can, because it does meet the criteria. To summarily dismiss the tag is not proper. Oops, actually four of us, since one said he believed an article like this was previously deleted. jawesq 03:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to Wikpedia, negative comments that are unsourced may be deleted without explanation. Since you said I am free to edit it, then I will do so. I don't know this guy, and he doesn't look very appealing. However, I am incensed that gratuitous lawyer bashing like this is tolerated, and actually supported by an admin!</p>

<p>You wrote: "Although the article smacks of POV, it's not entirely created to disparage its subject". What other object was it created for pray tell? Clearly we disagree. There is no point to the article other than a not so subtle attack on its subject and perhaps a not so suble attack on PI lawyers as well. It more than NPOV. In the meantime I believe invoking the Wiki rule of removing unsourced dispraging material without explanation is in order. There won't be much left to the article and perhaps you will see the merit in the contention the sole purpose of the article is an attack.Update: See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_criticism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_criticism" rel="nofollow">also this rule</a> "Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and negative in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion" At this point, having removed the negative unsourced material, there isn't anything left, meaning an admin could not have reverted it to a NPOV.

<p>It appears that admins construe the WIki speedy delete rules differently than the plain meaning of the rules would require. That said, I think every attorney on Wikipedia should be incensed at the way this is being handled by admins. I do not know the subject of this article (Jim Shapiro). However, one would have to be blind to see this as anything but gratuitous and unsourced lawyer bashing. There is one sentence in the entire article that is not disparaging. Jim Shapiro is a personal injury lawyer in Rochester, New York.jawesq 04:27, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want to escalate this further because of the administrator's conduct on this article. If it is the policy of admins to ignore the rules, then I want no part of WIkipedia - an online encyclopedia that condones gratuitous lawyer bashing.jawesq 04:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC) <a name="Jim_Shapiro" id="Jim_Shapiro"></a></p>

However, going back into the history, this is presumably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Shapiro&amp;oldid=61987195" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Shapiro&amp;oldid=61987195" rel="nofollow">the version you object to</a>. The things in this article are stated as factual events and indicative of the career and activities of this individual. If that is so, then it is an accurate article. If these things are made up, then obviously that is a serious matter. If these things are distorted, or exaggerated in the career of an otherwise reputable lawyer, then that also needs to be addressed. It may be a question of putting them into proper perspective. However, you seem outraged simply because anything negative is associated with a lawyer. Wikipedia is here to present the truth, not to do a whitewash. You do not at any time say that these things are untrue, or unrepresentative of this individual. What you do say, quite correctly, is that they are not referenced, and you have removed them, as you are entitled to do. However, if they are properly referenced, then there is no reason why they cannot be reinstated, unless you provide a good reason otherwise. An attack page is when unfair or untrue negative statements are made against an individual. It is not an attack page to show that an individual has done unsavoury things, if that is what an individual has done. I am not making a pronouncement on this particular individual, because I have no knowledge of him. I am just drawing the distinction in principle.<br />

<p>You wrote: "An attack page is when unfair or untrue negative statements are made against an individual. It is not an attack page to show that an individual has done unsavoury things, if that is what an individual has done." I don't disagree, and I am not so stupid as not to get the point and I wish you would cease treating me as though I were.</p>
<p>I am not asking anyone to whitewash anything. I don't know or want to know the individual in question. Here are the facts: It is a bio that is unsourced and negative in tone. Here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_criticism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_criticism" rel="nofollow">rule</a> (again)"Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and negative in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion". It is very simple to apply the rule to the facts. Does the rule have any meaning or not? From you response, I can see you agree it is negative in tone. From your response, I can see you agree is it lacking sources. There is a disconnect here. But it is not on my end.</p>
<p>You wrote: "However, you seem outraged simply because anything negative is associated with a lawyer. Wikipedia is here to present the truth, not to do a whitewash. You do not at any time say that these things are untrue, or unrepresentative of this individual." First off, I am not outraged that anyting negative is said about a lawyer and it is disengenious of you to say so. I am not particurally outraged in this case. If I were outraged it would be because unsourced negative attacks are allowed to stand in contravention of the stated rule after it has been pointed out.</p>
<p>You wrote: "What you do say, quite correctly, is that they are not referenced, and you have removed them, as you are entitled to do. However, if they are properly referenced, then there is no reason why they cannot be reinstated, unless you provide a good reason otherwise". If it comes back sourced, I will reinstate the <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> tag and the Afd. Because even if it is true, he is still not notable. I am know of some case much worse than his (assuming the unsourced facts are ture) which are more notable. (See I can say something negative about lawyers) He is run of the mill. And if my Aunt had... she would be my uncle. But at the moment, the article is unsourced as you point out. It is also negative in tone. And then there is the matter of the Wiki rule. I can do much more than what I have done in pointing out to you the facts. I can draw my own conclusions. Gfwesq 05:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yeah, absolutely dude. I always keep votes/csd opinions separate from user opinions. To be quite frank, the only thing that's driving me crazy in this situation is that people are not responding in sequence and responding in the middle of comments.

<p>Hey @C - on articles such as God of War (band), be careful about G4 - it does not apply to previously speedied articles - only where an AfD consensus was previously reached. A repost needs to meet a substantive CSD criterion (A#) in order to be re-deleted.

<dd>Unfortunately even many sysops misunderstand this criterion. Then again, if it was deleted once, chances are it'll go again.

<p>Thanks so much for my barnstar. I appreciate it and will shamelessly list it on my user page.</p>
<p>I still want to help you get things up and going with VS, if you're still interested, so if you ever want to fling some Knoppix error logs or debug messages at me (and size is not a concern), I'd be happy to take a look at them and try to figure out a good response to give. I hate to cast out uninformed guesses about what the problem is, and I know how unhelpful they can be. Sorry to harp on the subject, but I don't want to look like I've given up on helping either.</p>
<p>And thanks for helping out with the CIA link thing yesterday. If anyone deserves another barnstar, it's you. I've actually been thinking about writing a simple script or two to give some bot aid to the project, but I'll have to figure out a reasonable use for one first.</p>
