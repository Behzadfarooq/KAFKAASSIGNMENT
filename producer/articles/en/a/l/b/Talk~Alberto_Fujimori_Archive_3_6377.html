<h2><span class="mw-headline">legacy: privatizations</span></h2>
<p>AF's privatization program is controversial partly because it didn't put into place mechanisms to ensure that the terms of the sale were enforced. In other words, AF sold off enterprises to companies which promised to make investments in them. Did this always happen? No, and here is a good example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The situation at Doe Run's smelter at La Oroya, in Peru's central Andean region, is even worse. Pollution at La Oroya is so intense it has precipitated an emergency situation in which, according to Peruvian government figures, 90% of children in the city have blood-lead levels above acceptable international standards; nearly 20% have lead levels that should require hospitalization. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, cadmium, arsenic and lead all greatly exceed World Health Organization standards -- according to the company's own data. Long term exposure to these substances can have potentially fatal impacts on human health.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Contamination levels at La Oroya have increased dramatically since Doe Run bought the Doe Run operation from the Peruvian government in 1997. When Doe Run purchased the complex, it agreed to undertake an investment program to modernize the plant and equipment and to meet the requirements of the Environmental Management and Remediation Plan (PAMA in Spanish, a legal requirement in Peru).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, because of the decline in the prices of most metals since 1997 and the company's desire to pay for its investment program from income generated by the refinery itself, it has decided to delay until the end of the period of the PAMA (2006) the largest single investment: scrubbers to reduce SO2 emissions from the smoke stack.<a href="http://www.foe.org/WSSD/doerun.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foe.org/WSSD/doerun.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In this more recent news item, from this week, the company appears to be using economic blackmail to backslide on its commitments and apparently it will not have the scrubbers installed until 2011:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Under Peru's environmental laws, the Missouri-based company was required to build a $100 million sulfuric acid plant to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 2007. But Doe Run said it needed until 2011 or it would be in default on bank loans and be forced to pull out of Peru. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=627087" class="external autonumber" title="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=627087" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></i></dd>

<p>This is part of Fujimori's legacy and I think it needs to be mentioned in the legacy section, but I am not sure how. Any ideas? -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 12:35, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Viajero, I actually don't think that this deserves a lot of coverage in a biographical article. We certainly mention here that there were problems with privatization; the privatization probably deserves an article of its own, linked from here, but I wouldn't want to see it take over what is mainly supposed to be a biographical article. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:36, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree with you. At the same time, if it isn't belaboring the obvious, an article on a politician will inevitably be a lot more than survey of his personal life. It seems that most contemporary political leaders have <i>very long</i> articles dedicated to them, and if you look at, for example, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvio_Berlusconi_f762.html" title="Silvio Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>, you'll see little strictly biographical information, and substantial sections on the policies of his administration and his legal problems. Comparing the Fujimori text to that of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>, it could certainly be argued that the sections Fujimori's first two terms could be substantially expanded with detailed information about his policies. From what I understand, it is customary to let the articles expand as long as necessary, and then once the material is more or less stable, refactor sections, such as <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_policy_of_the_George_W._Bush_administration_091e.html" title="Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration">Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration</a>.</dd>
<dd>Concerning privatization, I would suggest that done to the extent Fujimori undertook it, it represents a major restructuring of a country's economy, and the way in which it was done has long-term repercussions, as do his other neoliberal policies, and it would be useful to examine them more closely in this article. For what it is worth, I am not arguing for government ownership in the abstract; it is also obvious that a number of the nationalizations done during the Velasco and GarcÃ­a years were also badly managed. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 10:15, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The topic certainly belongs here, with indication that it was controversial, but since the experience of privatization in Peru wasn't so different from in quite a few other countries, I think it just merits one or two <i>balanced</i> paragraphs in the article making it clear that the matter was controversial, and a <i>see also</i> linking to an article where we can go on at length about privatization in Peru, which certainly merits an article of its own. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:47, Apr 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Background information on tax revenue from mining</span></h2>
<p>For AAAAA:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Today, Toledoâs government argues that the country is dependent on foreign investment in extractive sectors to raise the country out of poverty, which affects nearly half the countryâs 27 million people. Half of the countryâs exports are from the mining sector, and government officials say mining export revenues are needed to help pay off the countryâs 30 billion foreign debt, a debt that eats up about a quarter of the government budget each year. But multinationals and foreign investors can and are freely transferring most of the profits abroad as well as given excessive tax breaks. According to one Peruvian economist, the government collects only about $300 million a year in taxes from mining companies, a relatively small portion of the nationâs $7 billion in tax revenue collected annually, especially when considering the emphasis the government places on the sector. Local communities receive little of the taxes that are collected. In 2001, U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation paid $50 million in taxes for its gold mine near Cajamarca, one of the most profitable in the world. Meanwhile, there is no limit on the amount of natural resources extracted, environmental woes mount with the nationâs lax enforcement of environmental laws, and there is little investment of monies in other, more sustainable industries. <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/pdfs/bp1_destruction.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/pdfs/bp1_destruction.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<dd>If the information is true, then the fault should also fall under the Toledo and Paniagua Administration, since they don't bother to modify those numbers.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestions</span></h2>
<p>In response to <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">User:Messhermit</a>'s <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html#Hello.2C_Help_is_needed" title="User talk:Spangineer">request</a> that I give some input on this article, I will mention a few things. First, I will say that I was previously unaware of this part of Peru's history (which is somewhat embarrasing) and as such, I have little knowledge of the topic beyond what I read in this article and what I found in the Encarta Encyclopedia Standard 2004 (CD-ROM) entry. My views are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>This article is <i>not</i> too long for a biography entry â there are many biography articles longer than this one; including many American presidents (see <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>). So there's no problem with length. The fact that the articles on presidents of Latin American countries are generally so much shorter than those of the presidents of the U.S. is an issue of systemic bias â because most wikipedians are from the U.S. and few are from Latin America, U.S. topics get more coverage. It may be true that particular issues of his presidential term should get their own articles (see <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton_e031.html" title="Impeachment of Bill Clinton">Impeachment of Bill Clinton</a>), but all those topics deserve extensive coverage on the main page.</li>
<li>More information is necessary that relates to his early life and education â there should be at least a short section (several paragraphs) on his pre-political life and early-political life. Right now there are about 4 lines.</li>
<li>His first presidential campaign should be separated into a separate section, and many more details should be given. According to Encarta, Llosa beat him in the general election by a 34-29% margin, but Fujimori came back and beat him soundly in the run-off.</li>
<li>The first term section sounds somewhat POV to me because it fails to mention the fundamental reasons for all the reform. Reform here comes off as bad sounding, and it certainly might have had a bad effect on the country, but that's only visible in retrospect. Why did he make all those reforms? To combat high inflation (according to Encarta). Did it work? Some evidence suggests it did - 12% economic growth in 1994. That stuff needs to be mentioned.</li>
<li>No mention is made of Fujimori attempting to strengthen relationships with Japan in order to get foreign aid (found in Encarta).</li>
<li>"At the time, Fujimori's bold and risky economic reforms (the "Fujishock") appeared to be working." sounds POV. According to who? It sounds ominous - like they only "appeared" to be working, but were setting up for a major crash. That might be true, but it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia in my mind.</li>
<li>The whole "auto-coup" section is really negative. It gives the idea that Fujimori was a power crazy maniac and that peruvians are docile idiots. Why did he take those actions? According to Encarta he thought it was necessary for economic improvement and combatting corruption. That would explain why the peruvians trusted him - they felt that those problems were important enough for drastic government change.</li>
<li>What about the runoff in the 2000 election? And the fact that Toledo boycotted the runoff?</li>
<li>Finally, I <i>do not</i> think that it a problem that this article focuses largely on negative things. That's life â this president was not respected for his policies and his government turned against him at the end of his term. While more mention needs to be made of some of the positive things that occured during his presidency, it is unrealistic to expect that this article be 50% positive and 50% negative. The article should simply record the facts, regardless of who they favor, and when all is said and done, chances are that there will be more negative than positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll continue watching this discussion and hope to be of some service, but like I said, I'm largely unfamiliar with this issue. I hope that my comments are helpful. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer">â</a> 18:51, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Spangineer, you have made some useful points, but I must question your analysis of our coverage of the <i>auto-coup</i>. As dedicated as we are to the philosophy of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, most editors here are "skewered" by Enlightenment ideals, albeit vague, of freedom and democracy. While more attention could be paid to the precedents, Fujimori's <i>auto-coup</i> will, in all likliehood, never be cast in a wholly positive light on Wikipedia; it was after all, an assault on the democratic system, as flawed as it may have been, and Fujimori's advocates here have yet to make a convincing case that it was either indispensible or unavoidable. That being said, there is certainly room for interpretation as to its effects, both in the short- and long-term. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 19:08, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Viajero, I agree with you, and I don't think that the section should be portrayed in a positive light. That's partly what I was referring to in the last bullet point above. I just felt that that part fails to adequately address the reasons for the auto-coup and as a result tends to portray him as a stereotypical evil dictator who takes power for power's sake. I'm not sure that that's what happened here â are there examples of things that Fujimori wanted to change but could not because he was limited by the opposition? What were they? Why were the peruvians ok with this? --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer">â</a> 19:24, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Spangineer bout the stuff of the Auto-coup. If we look closely on why the Peruvian People approved the coup, it could be said (at least in my fair oppinion) a punishment to the already stablished political class. Fujimori did won the Presidency, but most of the authority (according to the 1979 Constitution) lied on Parlament (and its most important Chamber, the Senate). It is stated that APRA (led by Ex-President Garcia) and FREDEMO (a loose aliance of right-wing parties) will not cooperate with Fujimori, since the first was looking for inmunity by the corruption and crimes of its own regime and he second a much more dramatic economic reform. So, it could be said that in Parlament, things were at a stalemate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Peruvian Democracy was restored in 1993, with the approval of the 1993 Constitution. A threat to it was an attempted coup on November 1992: supported by the Righ-wing political class, a group of Military officers attempted to overthrown Fujimori and prevent the electionf for the Contitutional Democratic Congress. Fujimori was alerted of this by Vladimiro Montesinos (who, after this, would gain Fujimori's Trust)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the Constitutional Democratic Congress, FREDEMO was dissolved and several political parties were involved in the draft of the 1993 Constitution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, he won the 1995 National Elections, wich were considerated fair and accurate by most International Observers. He beat <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Perez_de_Cuellar_b4ea.html" title="Javier Perez de Cuellar">Javier Perez de Cuellar</a> (wich acknwonledge its loss) by 65% against 35% I believe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point here is state that, although he wasn't the savior of Peru, he did positive things. The whole thing of "Dictatorship" and other was used only after the 2000 Elections. Ironic to say, but the two other Presidents have made little effort to correct the "mistakes" that he was accused for.

<dd>Spangineer, I don't know which particular "stereotypical evil dictators" you have in mind, but often times they are driven by complex set of motives, partly ideological, partly pragmatic. I think we do need to explain more carefully in the text what Fujimori's justification was for the auto-coup but also determine whether in fact everyone agreed it was justified. We report that he received approval ratings after the fact of 80% or whatever; at the same time, it is worth asking, would he have received the same support if it was known that he, Montesinos, and others were at the same time setting up a vast criminal network to enrich themselves? This isn't an academic question, because people do now ask that question. Alan GarcÃ­a, supposedly the cause of the problems Fujimori inherited in 1990 which necessitated the auto-coup, was nearly re-elected in 2001, receiving 48 percent of the vote and is the leading candidate for 2006, whereas Fujimori now has a support rating of around 12%. Is that a judgment on the auto-coup and Fujimori's government in general? In a way, I think it is. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 13:44, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It appears that Viajero is forgetting that Alan Garcia IS a politician and a Gifted Speaker. Also, 2/3 of the Peruvian Electorade in 2001 was under 20, and don't remember (or didn't care much) about what type of Government Garcia exercise. He was defeated becouse there is still people that remember his failed government. Also, even for the 2006 elections, he is not able to shake the bad image of his government</dd>
</dl>
<p>About his approving rates, don't you think that with the monumental campaing launched by the Toledo Administration to trown all its mistakes to Fujimori, his public image is tarnished? You can talk the same about Gorbachyev, who is glorify in the West, but has a extremely low publicity in Russia. 5 years have past and none of the accusations have prospered. About Montesinos, it is proved already by Peruvian Congress that he spyed on everyone, including Fujimori. There are several tapes and recordings that show this. Also, once again, <b>Vast Criminial Network</b> is your opinion. Unfortunately, this is the only POV that is <i>allowed</i> in the article and also the one about <i>Stereotipical Dictator</i> is being pushed by you.</p>

<dd>He was not a bad or good president, and definetely not a ruthless Dictator.

<p>Viajero, I agree with you that we need to better explain Fujimori's justification and also the stuff about the "vast criminal network". As the paragraph stands, it sounds like the peruvians were ok with Fujimori's power grab, and as a reader of the article, I want to know why â was it because he lied to them and/or because they liked his plans? That's tough to determine, but both possibilities (and any others that exist) should probably be included. Nor do I have any problem with the Peruvians' current opinions (based on new information and in retrospect) being mentioned. I'm not trying to push an opinion that Fujimori was a good guy or was justified in his actions, but just trying to get a better understanding of all the stuff that went on behind the scenes and what caused public opinion to be so positive then and now so negative. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer">â</a> 16:32, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Politicians are politicians, that is a fact. In the same way that some people agree or disagree in Russia about the legacy of Gorbachyev, same is in Peru with Fujimori. About Lies to the People, what Government does actually tell ALL the Truth to its citizens? Right or wrong, not even in the USA are so democratic in theis one. About popularity, those are more political moves. "A Lie told 1000 times becomes truth", so in the case of Fujimori, at least in the last 5 years that appear to become true. Anyways, I'm just trying to prevent this President for being demonized.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">mramirez: several questions</span></h2>
<p>Several days ago you added this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>President Alejandro Toledo has, from the beginning of his presidency, taken up the case against Fujimori as his own, requesting that Japan return "the criminal Fujimori" to Peru. He has arranged meetings with other powers in Peru, such as the Supreme Court and tax authorities, in order to "coordinate the joint efforts to bring the criminal Fujimori from Japan".</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am curious: in what way has a "meeting" with the Supreme Court effected the case against Fujimori? Can you cite any evidence that the Court has been subverted in any way? Have there been any decisions by the Court which have been clearly partisan against of Fujimori? For the one case I know of, that of the "ChavÃ­n de Huantar" commandos, the outcome was largely favorable to Fujimori.</p>
<p>Also, you added "citing Toledo's involvement" to the following paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Undaunted by the accusations and the judicial proceedings underway against him, which, citing Toledo's involvement, he dismissed as "politically motivated"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't understand this: in what way does Toledo's involvement make the issue "politically motivated"? Toledo is ineligible to run for re-election in 2006, no? His party, unlike APRA, has little cohesion and doesn't appear to have a suitable candidate who can compete with Alan. So how is it possible to dismiss his "involvement" as solely political machinations? -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 19:33, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't matter whether you understand how Toledo's involvement makes the issue "politically motivated". All that matters is that Fujimori (or his supporters) claim that it is politically motivated. It is not necessary to prove the claims of the parties to include them in the article, only to prove that they are the claims of the parties. Please keep this in mind when editing. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 23:38, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The assertion that Fujimori's opponents are "politically motivatated" has been included in the text as long as I can remember, and to the best of my recollection, it has never been the subject of controversy. However, I find the recent addition about "meetings" with the Supreme Court troubling. Peru, in theory at least, has an independent judiciary, and this statement implies that Toledo is manipulating it in some way. I would like mramirez to clarify this if possible. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 10:06, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of statistics in a wrong way</span></h2>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies by INEI, the national statistics bureau[17] (<a href="http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm</a>) show that Peruvians living in poverty increased dramatically (from 41.6% to 55%) during Alan Garcia's term.</li>
<li>Same studies show that they actually decreased a bit (from 55% to 54%) during Fujimori's term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accusation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sociologist Pedro Francke, former head of the Fondo Nacional de CompensaciÃ³n y Desarrollo Social (Foncodes) and Gilberto Moncada, head of the INEI, the Fujimori government tried to hide the increase of poverty from 42.7% to 48.4% between 1997 and 2000, insisting that the poverty rate was only 37.7%. (It is currently thought to be between 54% and 55%)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't see the relevancy of the accusation, if what is important is the start and the end. If Alan Garcia started with 41.6% poverty and ended with 55% poverty, that is not important for <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">User:Viajero</a>. But if Fujimori started with 55%, then went down in 1997 to 42.7% and up to 48.4% in 2000 and then up to 54% in 2001, then it is important to state the accusation. Why? I don't see the point. I think that this accusation should be taken out. It is NOT RELEVANT.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 16:42, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I don't follow your logic. The document you cite, <a href="http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, states only thing, as far as I can see, that poverty rose from "41.6% en 1986 a 54.1% en el 2000". It does not support the contention that poverty "actually decreased a bit (from 55% to 54%) during Fujimori's term" as you now have the text read.
<dl>
<dd>Are you BLIND or what? According to the table shown there, it was 41.6% in 1986 and 55% in 1991. You cannot blame Fujimori for what happened in ALAN GARCIA's term!!!--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 02:09, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While the <i>La RepÃºblica</i> piece I cited has slightly different numbers, namely that poverty increased "entre 1997 y el 2000 de 42,7% a 48,4%." and later "despuÃ©s del '98 y '99, se deterioraron, es decir, se incrementÃ³ de 15% a 18%, aproximadamente." the same general direction is apparent.
<dl>
<dd>So, with Fujimori povery started at 55%, then went down to 42.7%, then up to 48.4%. So what is your point? If we take the start and the end, poverty, according to this study, remained the same.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 02:09, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Another document, a UN report, "Globalisation consolidated poverty and increased inequality", also has slightly different numbers, but likewise points the same direction. Here is an excerpt:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The official 1993 document, Strategy for the struggle against poverty, maintained that economic recovery based on stabilisation and liberalisation is crucial for attacking poverty. In 1996, Peru established the goal of cutting extreme poverty in half -- from 18% to 9% -- by the year 2000. Total social spending grew from 24.6% of the budget in 1993 to 44.6% in 1998. The amount allocated for basic social services is unknown because of the lack of transparency. Between 1993 and 2000, the total spending on social programs can be estimated at approximately USD 13 billion. For specific programs on poverty relief, an estimated USD 5.2 billion was spent in the same period Nevertheless, total poverty grew from 51.1% in 1997 to 54.1% in 2000. Currently, 14.8% of the population lives in extreme poverty. <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN002361.pdf&amp;e=8092" class="external autonumber" title="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN002361.pdf&amp;e=8092" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>In short, I find nothing to support your assertion that Fujimori "started with 55%" and that poverty later decreased; to the contrary, the evidence supports my contention that his neoliberal policies had a detrimental effect on poverty, that they acerbated the already serious problems he inherited from AG. If you have other evidence that suggests a different conclusion, let's see it; otherwise, it is primarily a matter of agreeing how we phrase this in the "Legacy" section. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 00:43, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>The lik should be removed for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. That link should be removed because it portrays Fujimori as guilty of all charges and assumes Fujimori has been convicted.</p>
<p>Fujimori still has not gone to trial, therefore he could not be "assumed" to be guilty.</p>
<p>2. The process of extraditing Fujimori is driven by political charges. The book submitted for extradition shows that there are no real wrongdoings commited by Fujimori, however the political arm is weigting on the judicial system to push for his extradition.</p>
<p>Before making any conclusions on this topic it is required to read the paper submitted by the Peruvian government to the Japanese governement so you can get a clear idea of what the illarious charges are.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that the resignation was rejected, and the Congress then voted to declare Fujimori morally unfit to lead the nation. Am I wrong? -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 11:27, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The vote was messy on congress that time, it was something like mixing two votes at the time: "vote NO to deny the resignation and YES for declare him unable to rule". There was a mess and sudenly declare <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valent%C3%ADn_Paniagua_Corazao_6e25.html" title="ValentÃ­n Paniagua Corazao">ValentÃ­n Paniagua Corazao</a> as President.

<p><br />
Actually, I watched the vote take place live on TV, and truth is that the resignation was rejected, and Fujimori was declared morally unfit for the presidency. The idea that the vote 'was a mess' is highly subjective. All said and done, Fujimori did not resign, he was given the boot. It should also be mentioned that Fujimori lost his control of Congress due to massive resignations amongst his party, including that of Francisco Tudela, first vice-president and member of congress. --129.21.144.243 18:42, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Messhermit, I think Hajor's issue is not the content of your edit, it's the wording of your edit summary. "Typo" means that someone probably made a typographical error, a mistake while typing, such as "guerrrilla" or "insungent". It suggests an absolutely uncontroversial edit, just fixing an obvious mistake. That wasn't the nature of your edit. For what it's worth I think your edit was probably a good one; I don't know what Hajor thinks about that; but your summary was (I assume accidentally) misleading. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:36, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sendero Luminoso IS an Insurgent organization. At this point, they don{t even have a clear political agenda. Also, as (I believe) Hajor said once, Guerrilla is more used as a military tactic. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 23:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Viajero, I didn't make any judgement that one of these words gives more or less "legitimacy", I just think they are better described as "insurgents" than "guerrillas". The former refers to being in rebellion against an established government; the latter refers to a specific set of military tactics. The first clearly applies; the second did in the past (certainly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Sendero used mostly guerrilla tactics), but it's not so clear that it is a large part of what they are doing now. I would say that "insurgent" has applied to them at all times; "guerrilla" wouldn't be actively wrong, but if we are going to use one word, I'd opt for "insurgent". -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:33, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

These improvement led to the revival of tourism, agroexport, and fisheries.<a href="http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/0/bc520537f55e0ec805256f3a006beff6?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/0/bc520537f55e0ec805256f3a006beff6?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>

During the Fujimori period the numbers decrease, with a shift in tactics away from general butchery and toward isolating support for the terrorists, with Army engineers building rural roads and schools." Can someone cite more specifically for these than just "the report"? Also "the great percentage of deaths" is very vague, I assume the report gave at least approximate numbers, can we get something more substantive?

<p>I'm the user that intorduced the "dubious material" I have quickly read your editing, and agree with some of it, I've in the process also tried to learn what is the "wiki spirit" in a crash course.

About the economic data it can be obtained from the international organizations (IDB, IMF, world bank, etc), as well as the government agencies, (<a href="http://www.proinversion.gob.pe/english/default.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.proinversion.gob.pe/english/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.proinversion.gob.pe/english/default.asp</a>, Reserve bank). About reduced bureaucracy? I could back up this data by stating the explosion on the number of extra combis (minibus), taxi drivers, internet cabins at the end of the 90's, and the growth of the informal economy, product of the "forced" retrenchments, however, I can only back this part based in my own previous reading, and my experience. I'm also trying to learn, about what really happened in those years, I do not claim to know it for sure, but I intend to put and share just the facts. <small>â<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Amaru (<a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmaru_e343.html" title="User talk:Amaru">talk</a>&#160;â¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amaru_982b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amaru">contribs</a>) 22 Sept 2005.</small></p>

What it comes down to, though, is that some of the economic numbers fo the Fujimori era are heavily disputed, and that it is sometimes very hard to tell whether two particular sources that seem to back each other up are actually independent of one another in where their numbers came from.</dd>

<dd>One other remark on why I removed much of what I removed: while discussion on the talk pages can get very heated, the articles should not. One of the key goals is to write the article from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. It is fine to describe or quote the opinions of a well-cited, significant source (a respected scholar, an international institution, etc.) but not to write opinion directly into the narrative voice of the article, or to quote your own opinions, or those a random web site/blogger. When someone is writing about a rock band, we sometimes cut some slack on this, but not on a significant contemporary political figure.</dd>

<dd>well, in south america there is a different type of racism, here it is quite common to calle a black man "negro" (wich means black), instead of calling him afro-american, like it is used in the U.S.. Mainly this is because there has never been mayor racial issues in here (no KKK, for example), if an indian wants to marry a white girl, no one really says anything (as many of us are really mongrels, such as myself, even though i look very white). There are several racists in both of these countries, usually they are right-wing people with a very narrow view on things, and usually they have very little voice and saying in both of the goverments. Yet comments such as the tittle, have no place in wikipedia, as someone else already sayd. As for Fujimori, i hope he gets trialed for his crimes against peru, for his corruption cases (wich are countless, from the bribing of all tv station owners, thus controling all of the media to all of the corruption from his goverment), for the death squads he assembled, and particulary for how he left Peru in a deep third world country status. To end this, i must say that Fujimori did not ran away, he was at japan (conviniently) and there the arrest warrant was imposed on him, so he didnt really faced the music. Now he has come back to use both the chile-peru pre-war situation (there wont really be any war, none of the 2 goverments wants it, but the media is selling a lot more now that that the tensions have grew, mainly no one can really understand the current situation, so people like to say that Peru is stealing our sea... when in fact what peru has done is just to settle his international waters law, i dont really see why there should be a war there...) and he is here to use the low popularity of Toledo in his favor. In a way, Toledo has a low popularity mainly for how Fujimori left the country after he left. Fujimori would had not returned unless he would actually had something to win, and in this case, Fujimori might return to office.</dd>

<p>You mean haven? While (from my Central American perspective) it clearly is possible to call someone Chino or Negro affectionately this was clearly and obviously not the case here. While one is left wondering whether Fujimori would have gone to Chile without these tensions, and indeed I find it curious that he chose that moment to return to SA because of the danger of becoming a a part of a deal by Peru to drop the sovereignty claims in exchange for his return, any speculation is definitely outsider our remit as encyclopedia editors, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:55, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, about the so called <i>deal</i> with Chile, from my peruvian perspective, would be political suicide, and Fujimori would not risk that.

<p><i>Foreign-born Japanese</i>. Is that a rascist perjorative? He was born and raised in Peru, which makes him Peruvian regardless of the colour of his skin or his ancestry. Anything else is rascism, which will not be tolerated on wikipedia. Please take care.

<p>Under the external links, the article states that "The Fall of Fujimori is a rather NPOV documentary based on a recent interview of the former President, along with extensive footage from his time in office, and other interviews." I'll be the first to admit that I haven't seen this film. I have talked to a few people who have, and they described it as an apology for Fujimori. I remember reading something in the paper, I think the New York Times, that basically said the same thing. I have seen <i>State of Fear</i>, which concentrates on the human rights abuses by both Fujimori and Sendero, and at the screening the producer and director were there. They both said that they thought <i>The Fall of Fujimori</i> was quite biased in favor of Fujimori, and they seemed to think that the two films were essentially competing versions of what happened in Peru from 1990 - 2000. Bottom line: I'm not so sure that <i>The Fall of Fujimori</i> is "NPOV," and I'm not so sure that calling in NPOV is NPOV. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 15:27, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Telephone waiting period</span></h2>
<p>I've removed this citation of an example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For example, before privatization, a consumer or business would need to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed from the monopolistic state-run telephone company. A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This unsourced claim had been challenged and now someone is claiming personal experience as the "source" (which would make it original research).

<dd>No doubt the wait for a phone line was reduced, but that is not the point; telecom privatisations took place all over the world during the 90s and reduced waits happened in many countries, including the one in which I live. There is nothing particular to Peru about this phenomenon, and hence this information doesn't belong in the article. <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/a/User_talk%7EViajero_1260.html" title="User talk:Viajero">Talk</a> 09:09, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Privatization of the phone system took place in the early 1980s in the UK. I don't think it made any difference to wait times for installation, which were always reasonably short. It may be that the Peruvian phone system was underfunded prior to privatization. I find the wait time of ten years, if it's true, quite extraordinary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 10:37, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What AAAA is attempting to state is that the privatization of the Peruvian telephone company (ENTEL Peru) in the 90's (we are not talking about the 80's) allowed the population of a service that prior to that, was not available to everybody. I know this because my father used to work for both ENTEL and TELEFONICA DEL PERU. I don't think that because similar cases happened in England (in the 80's) or the rest of the world, this accomplishment should be omitted. Maybe Viajero is interested in removing it because it is something positive from the Fujimori Administration?. It is amazing that now paragraphs WITH SOURCES are deleted because "someone does not like what it" and using lame excuses. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 13:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no difficulty giving Fujimori credit where credit is due, but my point is that this cannot be construed as an accomplishment particular to his administration because it was a generalised phenomenon. If you look at other telecom privitisations in Latin American, you will find similar results.</dd>
<dd>Also, I would have been interested in seeing the references AAAAA cited, but they were PowerPoint and Excel documents, and I do not have MS Office installed (I use Linux). I don't know if there are any MoS guidelines concerning the file formats of external citatations, but it seems contrary to the open source/GPL spirit of Wikipedia to cite materials in propreitary formats. <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/a/User_talk%7EViajero_1260.html" title="User talk:Viajero">Talk</a> 10:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

Also, because things also happen in other countries does not necessarily mean any particular phenomenon is not notable in any certain country.

<dd>We link to PDFs, isn't property of Adobe? Anyway, if it's true that privatization of telephone companies in Latin America always leads to better service, then why not credit Fujimori with the privitization of ENTEL?

<dd>The MoS guidelines for references are tremendously looser about formats than those for the external links section. The issue is mainly that they be, in principle, accessible. For online sources, there is a preference for "free" formats when they are available; there is a somewhat stronger preference for sites that are available to the general public; but nothing stronger than that. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been trying to clean up the citation mechanism of this article. Along the way (and I'm not finished), I have discovered about ten blind links given as references that lead to dead pages, entirely dead sites, pages that say absolutely nothing about the matter for which they were cited, etc. In some cases I've been able to find appropriate substitutes and have added them. In other cases, though, I have no idea at all what was intended. This is a good illustration of the reason to caption your reference links with cite.php or some such at the time you add them. I'm sure that many of the articles originally linked to are still online some place, but with nothing but a blind link, it is very hard to find an appropriate substitute. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm basically done for now. This article is at best about half cited, and some of the citations are very weak. For example, while Stanford is a good university, I would hope we could do better than what appears to be an undergraduate student paper (a PDF that, by the way, froze up my browser). There are also other pretty shaky citations: for example, what is claimed to be a February 2005 poll is cited to an undated article with a URL including "enero2004".</p>
<p>There are also three sources floating around in a "References" section; as far as I can tell, no particular facts have been cited from these sources. They might be useful for some uncited facts. On the other hand, Encarta is a pretty dubious source: one might as well cite another Wikipedia article. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:30, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
