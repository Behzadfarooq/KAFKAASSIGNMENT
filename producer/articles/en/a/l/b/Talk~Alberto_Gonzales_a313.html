<p>Is it a negative POV issue to ask for anyone to provide the pronunciation of (attribution / verification for)... GW Bush's (rumor on many blogs only?) nickname of "Fredo" for the Attorney General? I would be glad to 1) verify it's authenticity, 2) know how to pronounce this nickname Millerik 17:35, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is so much Negative POV in this article. It needs to be deleted unless someone can give a good reason... 90% of this stuff is just bashing Gonzales (and by proxy, bashing Bush) -- 130.74.138.53 20:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with the negative POV. --Brooks 20:10, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm... I'd assume those 2 paragraphs weren't by the same person. So, I don't think what Brooks said has any importance in this discussion. NPOV should always be about gathering the information on both sides, not about determining which side is more favorable. The suggestion to delete is tempting, but the preferred method around here is only to remove that which is found irrelevant or innaccurate, and to not remove the one-sided argument but balance it out with whatever can be argued on the other side. Right? --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbino_Fox_55b4.html" title="User:Albino Fox">Al Fox</a> 21:01, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Agree with Al Fox. Is the material factually incorrect? I don't think it's POV to document that someone has taken actions that were controversial. How about adding something to balance. What has been done that you think should be highlighted as a positive accomplishment? It's always easier to find negatives about political figures in the news, which is where most of this article comes from. <a href="../../../g/w/i/User%7EGwimpey_8c96.html" title="User:Gwimpey">Gwimpey</a> 21:04, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Let's not wave the NPOV flag unnecessarily. If something is libelous or factually incorrect, then we are obligated to correct that. If it is noteworthy about the person, it belongs here. Otherwise (and yes, this is the worst analogy possible but it makes a point) we should all be heading straight over to the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a> article to try to "balance" that out too.

<dd>I removed the npov tag from this article. I think it's too early. I don't think any of what is in the article is actually disputed, in that it was reported and is widely available. <a href="../../../g/w/i/User%7EGwimpey_8c96.html" title="User:Gwimpey">Gwimpey</a> 00:40, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the NPOV questions are due to the fact that only the first paragraph in the Texas Career section deals with non-controversial items. This is a bit skewed - just gleaning from the .gov site:</dd>

<dd>Good info. That helps to balance the article out quite a bit.

</dl>
<p>I removed parts of the article that were based on op-ed journalism. Sure it's in the news, but it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. For Example: "In 2004, when this memo was leaked to the press, Gonzales said about the memo in Senate confirmation hearings that "... I don't recall today whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis, but I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the department." <b>This indicates that, despite the Bush administration's withdrawal from the memo, Gonzales still believes that the Justice Department was correct in its reasoning about torture.</b> " That section in bold is clearly opinion based and tries to make readers think that Gonzales is some kind of evil sadist by insinuating that he supports torture.~pete6982 3/27/07</p>

<p>Why is the GW Bush, execution thing relevant? Its a known fact that the state of texas (read: not Bush) executed a lot of people... and continues to do so. That sentence just seems out of place and anti Gonzales and anti-Bush. I'm gonna delete it, unless someone gives me a good reason. (edit: I'm changing it to read, the state of texas and leave out Bush... anyone disagree?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As the person who wrote that sentence, I agree that your version of the sentence is better (more accurate). <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"></a> – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"><b>Q</b>uadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_Request_for_assistance_8d8c.html" title="User:Quadell/Request for assistance">help</a>)</sup>[[]] 02:11, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I edited this part too. I think it's ironic that Gonzo is criticized for attempting to uphold the integrity of the gubernatorial pardon by removing the governor from jury duty and criticized for not second guessing the verdicts of juries in death penalty cases. Once again the piece criticizing him here is an op-ed which uses its opposition of execution of the mentally retarded to attack the non-pardons of then Governor Bush. ~pete6982 3/27/07</p>

<p>Let's provide a bit more information about his position on the applicability of (1) Geneva Convention and (2) the U.S. Constitution to the "enemy fighters" locked up in Guantanamo. The article should clarify WHY Gonzales concluded <b>as a lawyer</b> that certain provisions are inapplicable; i.e., it should summarize the grounds that he provided. The cute quote about it being "quaint" strikes me as having been chosen more to portray Gonzales in a bad light than to shed any actual light on his reasoning.</p>
<p>Also, about the so-called "torture memos". Would the article please clarify what definition of torture is being used, and who advocates that definition? Moreover, could the article clarify the distinction between (A) traditionally proscribed modes of torture (i.e., banned by the West and most other countries in the civilized world) and (B) rough interrogation techniques which aren't allowed on U.S. citizens in the U.S.?</p>

<p>Not really sure about the facts listed in this section - and I'm not disputing them, either. The sentence starting with "Those and other incidents . . ." should probably be eliminated because it contains no facts, but appears to be unsubstantiated filler to enhance the argument of questionable integrity. Same goes for the next paragraph starting with "When Bush was sworn in . . ." Additionally, the phrase, "lied to Congress" introduces significant bias, and could surely be reworded in an objective manner while still stating the apparent inconsistencies in his statements; it would be best to include citations. The last paragraph also needs clarification, a citation, or elimination.
