<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Reynolds_78d3.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Albert Reynolds was born in Rooskey, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Roscommon_377b.html" title="County Roscommon">County Roscommon</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>. He was educated at <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summerhill_College_2061.html" title="Summerhill College">Summerhill College</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Sligo_dbcf.html" title="County Sligo">County Sligo</a>, and found work as a clerk in the 1950s with <a href="../../../c/%C3%B3/r/C%C3%B3ras_Iompair_%C3%89ireann_307f.html" title="Córas Iompair Éireann">Córas Iompair Éireann</a> (CIÉ), the state transport service. Reynolds left what many would consider to be a "job for life" in the state company and moved into the showband scene, owning a number of dancehalls in his local area. He became wealthy from this venture during the 1960s when dancehalls proved extremely popular and invested his money in a number of businesses including a pet food company, a bacon factory, a fish exporting operation and hire purchase company. Reynolds also had business interests in local newspapers and a cinema. Although his dancehall empire required late nights Reynolds was a traditional family man and had a happy home with his wife Kathleen and their seven children.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Reynolds_78d3.html" title="Edit section: Early political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h2>
<p>Reynolds became interested in politics at the time of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_Crisis_3b26.html" title="Arms Crisis">Arms Crisis</a> in 1970, a hugely controversial episode in modern Irish history which saw two Cabinet ministers, <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Blaney_22cf.html" title="Neil Blaney">Neil Blaney</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Haughey_c0f7.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a>, sacked from the government over an alleged attempt to import arms to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The two men were subsequently acquitted in court but Reynolds then decided to embark on a political career. Reynolds stood as a <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> candidate in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_1977.html" title="Irish general election, 1977">1977 General Election</a>. The election was a landslide victory for Fianna Fáil, with the party receiving a twenty-seat parliamentary majority. Reynolds was just one of a number of TDs elected to <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/i/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_8259.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> on that day, however, at 43 years of age Reynolds was considered a late starter.</p>
<p>Reynolds remained a backbencher until 1979. In that year pressure was mounting on the <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> and Fianna Fáil leader <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lynch_b953.html" title="Jack Lynch">Jack Lynch</a> to step down. He became a member of the so-called "gang of five" with <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Fahey_080f.html" title="Jackie Fahey">Jackie Fahey</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Killilea%2C_Jnr_c3d8.html" title="Mark Killilea, Jnr">Mark Killilea, Jnr</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_McEllistrim%2C_Jnr_7b54.html" title="Tom McEllistrim, Jnr">Tom McEllistrim, Jnr</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/%C3%A1/Se%C3%A1n_Doherty_%28politician%29_64e8.html" title="Seán Doherty (politician)">Seán Doherty</a> which aligned itself to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Haughey_c0f7.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a> and supported him in the subsequent <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_leadership_election%2C_1979_902f.html" title="Fianna Fáil leadership election, 1979">leadership contest</a>. Reynolds's affable personality helped him to coax a number of backbenchers into supporting Haughey<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, who went on to beat <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Colley_4e03.html" title="George Colley">George Colley</a> in the leadership struggle and become Taoiseach. Reynolds was rewarded for his staunch loyalty by joining the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Government_2258.html" title="Irish Government">government</a> as <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Posts_%26_Telegraphs_2939.html" title="Irish Minister for Posts &amp; Telegraphs">Minister for Posts &amp; Telegraphs</a>. He took on the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Transport_b4fb.html" title="Irish Minister for Transport">Transport</a> portfolio in 1980, making his brief one of the largest and most wide-ranging in the government. As Minister for Transport Reynolds was involved in a bizarre incident in which an <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aer_Lingus_08df.html" title="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</a> plane was hi-jacked with the chief demand for the safe return of the aircraft and its passengers being the revealing of the religious secret, the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Secret_of_Fatima_75b5.html" title="Third Secret of Fatima">Third Secret of Fatima</a>. The incident was resolved in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> with no injuries.</p>
<p>Fianna Fáil lost power in 1981 but regained it again in 1982. Reynolds returned to government as <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Arts%2C_Sport_%26_Tourism_f09b.html" title="Irish Minister for Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism">Minister for Industry &amp; Energy</a>. That government fell in late 1982 and Reynolds was back on the opposition benches. During the 1982–1983 period the Fianna Fáil leader, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Haughey_c0f7.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a>, faced three motions of no-confidence. Reynolds gave him his support at all times and Haughey survived, defeating his opponents and critics within the party.</p>
<p>In 1987 Fianna Fáil returned to government and Reynolds was appointed <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Industry_%26_Commerce_bd1e.html" title="Irish Minister for Industry &amp; Commerce">Minister for Industry &amp; Commerce</a>, one of the most senior positions in the cabinet. The position seemed even more important as the government's top priority at this time was economic recovery. In 1988 the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Finance_2b23.html" title="Irish Minister for Finance">Minister for Finance</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_MacSharry_4d37.html" title="Ray MacSharry">Ray MacSharry</a>, became Ireland's <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Commissioner_aacd.html" title="European Commissioner">European Commissioner</a>. Reynolds succeeded MacSharry in the most important department in the government, a succession that was to have severe consequences.</p>
<p>In 1989 a general election resulted in <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> taking the unprecedented move of entering into a coalition government with the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Democrats_3859.html" title="Progressive Democrats">Progressive Democrats</a>. Reynolds headed the Fianna Fáil negotiation team along with another Minister, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertie_Ahern_225c.html" title="Bertie Ahern">Bertie Ahern</a>. A programme for government was finally agreed, almost a month after the general election, and Reynolds returned as Minister for Finance in a coalition government that he described as a "temporary little arrangement."</p>
<p>The failure to get the Fianna Fáil candidate, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Lenihan_2e75.html" title="Brian Lenihan">Brian Lenihan</a>, elected as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Ireland_2668.html" title="President of Ireland">President of Ireland</a> added to the pressure on Haughey's leadership. In a speech in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">County Cork</a>, Reynolds announced that if a vacancy arose in the position of party leader he would contest it. This was a clear and open revolt on Haughey's leadership. A number of TDs, including some members of the cabinet also began to grow disillusioned with Haughey and they began to look for a successor. Reynolds was the most popular and his profile was enhanced by his so-called "Country &amp; Western" gang of TDs who began to agitate within the party on his behalf. In November 1991 a relatively unknown rural TD, <a href="../../../s/e/%C3%A1/Se%C3%A1n_Power_2834.html" title="Seán Power">Seán Power</a>, put down a motion of no confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his staunchest of supporters, <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/P%C3%A1draig_Flynn_5662.html" title="Pádraig Flynn">Pádraig Flynn</a>, announced their support for the motion and were immediately sacked from the government. When the vote was taken the party re-affirmed its support in Haughey and it looked as if Reynolds political career was finished.</p>
<p>Haughey's victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a>. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_McDaid_5d26.html" title="Jim McDaid">Jim McDaid</a> as Minister for Defence, which saw him resign from the post before he had been officially installed. Worse was to follow when <a href="../../../s/e/%C3%A1/Se%C3%A1n_Doherty_%28politician%29_64e8.html" title="Seán Doherty (politician)">Seán Doherty</a>, the man who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on <a href="../../../r/t/%C3%A9/RT%C3%89_e38d.html" title="RTÉ">RTÉ</a> television and said that Haughey had known and authorised the phone-tapping. Haughey denied this but the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Democrats_3859.html" title="Progressive Democrats">Progressive Democrats</a> members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Des O'Malley, the PD leader, that he intended to retire shortly but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O'Malley agreed to this and the government continued.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> Haughey officially retired as leader of <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> at the parliamentary party meeting. He remained as <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> until <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">February 11</a> when Albert Reynolds succeeded him having easily defeated <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_O%27Rourke_3bf9.html" title="Mary O'Rourke">Mary O'Rourke</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Woods_09d3.html" title="Michael Woods">Michael Woods</a> in the <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_leadership_election%2C_1992_1861.html" title="Fianna Fáil leadership election, 1992">Leadership election</a>.</p>

<p>One of Reynolds's big achievements during his term as Taoiseach was the advancement in the peace process regarding <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Piecemeal negotiations had gone on during 1993 between Reynolds and the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>.

On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_15.html" title="December 15">December 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> the Joint Downing Street Declaration was signed in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>
<p>The agreement between the two governments was a high point for Reynolds, however the Government was soon to face more pressure. A disagreement between the two government partners erupted over certain financial matters, including a tax amnesty for tax evaders and a complex addition to a Finance Bill that was going to be published. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">9 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> the arithmetic in <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/i/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_8259.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> changed due to Fianna Fáil's defeat in the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayo_West_%28D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_constituency%29_29ab.html" title="Mayo West (Dáil Éireann constituency)">Mayo West</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_South_Central_%28D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_constituency%29_86ad.html" title="Dublin South Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)">Dublin South Central</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Irish_by-elections_9401.html#27th_D.C3.A1il_.C3.89ireann_.281992-1997.29" title="List of Irish by-elections">by-elections</a>, and for the first time in the <a href="../../../2/7/t/27th_D%C3%A1il_c2b9.html" title="27th Dáil">27th Dáil</a> an alternative government could be formed without Fianna Fáil. This added to the pressure on Reynolds but worse was still to come.</p>
<p>The report on the Beef Tribunal was eventually published in July 1994 and Labour threatened to leave the government if Reynolds was criticised. As it turned out Reynolds was vindicated<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and wanted to report in the media immediately. This caused tensions between himself and Spring, tensions that never repaired themselves. There was some conciliation for Reynolds in that the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> called a complete ceasefire on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. It was a moment to rejoice for Reynolds, however, this great achievement for him was only the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>Reynolds's and Spring's political relationship came to breaking point over the Attorney-General, Harry Whelehan, and Reynolds's insistence in appointing him president of the High Court. It was later revealed that Whelehan, in his capacity as <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney-General_of_Ireland_3e36.html" title="Attorney-General of Ireland">Attorney-General</a>, had mishandled an attempt<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> to extradite a paedophile Roman Catholic priest, Fr. Brendan Smyth. Dick Spring led his ministers out of a cabinet meeting and mulled over the consequences and what the next step should be. The coalition looked finished but Reynolds still held out for the chance to patch things up. He was forced to go before <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/i/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_8259.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> and indicate that if he had known 'then' what he 'knew now' about the incompetent handling of the case by the AG's office he would not have appointed Whelehan to the judicial post. However it was not enough and the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28Ireland%29_66e3.html" title="Labour Party (Ireland)">Labour Party</a> resigned from government. Reynolds realised that nothing could be done to save the government and he resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">December 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> the Minister for Finance, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertie_Ahern_225c.html" title="Bertie Ahern">Bertie Ahern</a>, was unanimously elected the sixth leader of Fianna Fáil.

<p>Reynolds remained on as a TD following his resignation. At the beginning of 1997 he was thinking of retiring from politics at the next general election, which would have to be held during the year. Bertie Ahern, Reynolds's successor, encouraged him to run and offered him the position of "peace envoy" to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and his support as a candidate for the presidential election. Fianna Fáil won the election, however, Ahern went back on his promise to Reynolds due to poor election results in his constituency and the change in the political situation in the North of Ireland. However, Reynolds was still interested in being a candidate for the presidency, along with two other candidates, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_O%27Kennedy_d95c.html" title="Michael O'Kennedy">Michael O'Kennedy</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_McAleese_8c03.html" title="Mary McAleese">Mary McAleese</a>. In a meeting of ministers the <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> gave a typically ambiguous speech which seemed to encourage his Cabinet to support McAleese. In the end, McAleese was successful and went on to become the eighth <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Ireland_2668.html" title="President of Ireland">President of Ireland</a>. Reynolds was humiliated by Ahern and many of the ministers he had sacked when he came to power in 1992.
