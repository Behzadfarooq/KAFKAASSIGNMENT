The club, founded in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>(though some sources suggest the club was founded in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>),originally hails from the inner Dublin suburb of <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringsend.html" title="Ringsend">Ringsend</a>. From the early 1920s until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> they played at <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenmalure_Park_13cd.html" title="Glenmalure Park">Glenmalure Park</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milltown%2C_Dublin_5bee.html" title="Milltown, Dublin">Milltown</a> and became Ireland's most successful club. Shamrock Rovers have won more <a href="../../../f/a/i/FAI_Cup_3212.html" title="FAI Cup">FAI Cups</a> (24) and leagues (15) than any other Irish club. For many years, Rovers were Ireland's most prestigious team. Famous achievements included the winning of six FAI Cups in a row in the 1960s and four consecutive league titles (including three "doubles") in the 1980s. In addition, they were also the first Irish club to play in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Cup_44bd.html" title="European Cup">European Cup</a>, playing <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>. Further, the Shamrock Rovers were one of the European club teams which spent the 1967 season in the United States founding the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Soccer_League_20a2.html" title="North American Soccer League">North American Soccer League</a>, representing <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> as the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Beacons_23fe.html" title="Boston Beacons">Boston Rovers</a>. Shamrock Rovers have also supplied more different players to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team_e356.html" title="Republic of Ireland national football team">Republic of Ireland national football team</a> (62 in all) than any other single club. Famous players to have played for the club include: <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Dunne_bbe3.html" title="Jimmy Dunne">Jimmy Dunne</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_Coad_572d.html" title="Paddy Coad">Paddy Coad</a>, Jackie Jameson, Frank O'Neill, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Giles_80ae.html" title="John Giles">John Giles</a>, Mick Leech, Pat Dune, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Beglin_2cc6.html" title="Jim Beglin">Jim Beglin</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_Mulligan_3459.html" title="Paddy Mulligan">Paddy Mulligan</a>, Johnny Fullam, Mick Smyth, <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_O%27Brien_%28footballer%29_6e2a.html" title="Liam O'Brien (footballer)">Liam O'Brien</a>,and <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamon_Dunphy_bbcc.html" title="Eamon Dunphy">Eamon Dunphy</a>. Irish <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">Rugby</a> international <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Ward_%28rugby_player%29_8aa1.html" title="Tony Ward (rugby player)">Tony Ward</a> also played for the club for a period in the 1970s. Up until the 1970s, Shamrock Rovers were well supported, attracting over 20,000 people regularly to Glenmalure Park and up to 40,000 for Cup Finals and European matches at <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalymount_Park_4844.html" title="Dalymount Park">Dalymount Park</a>. Ultimately a combination of poor results, competition from televised football and other attractions meant that by the 1980s the club's crowds averaged below 3,000. However, prior to a severe crisis that began in the late 1980s, Shamrock Rovers were still, to many, considered the most prestigious club in Irish football.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, the club's home ground was sold by the then owners, the Kilcoyne family. It was subsequently demolished and developed for housing. Supporters waged a long and acrimonious but futile campaign to save the ground. Home games were boycotted ultimately forcing out the Kilcoynes as owners. The club has been without a home from that time until the present. The most stable period since was while playing at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Dublin_Society_155c.html" title="Royal Dublin Society">Royal Dublin Society</a>'s grounds in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballsbridge.html" title="Ballsbridge">Ballsbridge</a> between 1990 and 1996. During this time Rovers won a league trophy (in 1994) and attracted reasonable crowds. Since then the club have been trying to develop a stadium in <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallaght.html" title="Tallaght">Tallaght</a> and have played their home matches at several venues all over the city including <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolka_Park_327d.html" title="Tolka Park">Tolka Park</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_Park_%28football_ground%29_e172.html" title="Richmond Park (football ground)">Richmond Park</a> and the athletics venue at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morton_Stadium_4eb6.html" title="Morton Stadium">Morton Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santry.html" title="Santry">Santry</a>.</p>
<p>Shamrock Rovers experienced severe financial troubles during the 2005 season, due to overspending and an accumulation of massive debts and spent a period under Examinership (a form of financial <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administration.html#Administration_of_an_insolvent_business" title="Administration">administration</a>). The supporters association, 'the 400 club', who had been bankrolling the club during the Examinership process assumed control of the club.</p>

<p>Tolka Park was home to the Hoops for the 2006 season. The early matches saw Rovers start very brightly, first battling with Limerick FC, then Galway United and Dundalk for Division 1 supremacy. On Friday the 10th of November Rovers beat Finn Harps 4-0 in the penultimate match of the season to effectively win the First Division title. On Saturday 19th November the Hoops came from behind to get a 1-1 draw with Cobh Ramblers to secure the title. Rovers were presented with the 1st Division trophy after the match. The Rovers defence was the best in league history with only 13 goals conceded in 36 league games and 24 clean sheets kept. The 2006 Player of the Year is captain Aidan price and the Young Player of the Year was awarded to Ian Ryan.</p>
<p>Three points were deducted by the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Association_of_Ireland_743c.html" title="Football Association of Ireland">FAI</a> from the team's <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Ireland_c3e4.html" title="League of Ireland">League of Ireland</a> standings on 16 August 2006 for fielding a suspended player illegally.</p>

<p>2005 goes down as one of the worst yet one of the best years in Shamrock Rovers history. The club had serious financial problems. Following a period of examinership during the summer months of 2005 the supporters group, the 400 Club, successfully bid for ownership of the club. Financial irregularities arising from this caused Rovers to be deducted 8 points in the league table. Roddy Collins was sacked towards the end of the 2005 season with 12 months remaining on his contract. Collins took this dismissal to Employment Appeals Tribunal and a settlement was reached with the former manager in 2006. Terry Eviston and Alan O'Neill took charge of the team for the remaining matches of the 2005 season.</p>
<p>The Hoops lost a two leg relegation play-off 3-2 against Dublin City F.C. and were relegated for the first time in the history.</p>

<p>Home games for the new millennium were played in the Morton Stadium in Santry. Work began on the Tallaght Stadium in 2000 however as the building got stalled the Hoops would call Dalymount Park and Tolka Park home later in the decade.</p>
<p>The closest the hoops came to silverware in the early 2000's was the 2002 FAI cup final. Rovers lost 1-0 to Derry City.</p>

<p>From 1990 to 1996 Rovers played their home games in the <a href="../../../r/d/s/RDS_0f41.html" title="RDS">RDS</a>, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. This was the closest the Hoops had to a permanent home since the closure of Milltown. The highlight of the decade was the thrilling 1993/94 season which saw the Hoops win the league for the fifteenth time and for the first time since leaving Milltown. Stephen Geoghegan scored twenty-three league goals that season and came within four of equalling Bob Fullam's record set in 1926/27.</p>
<p>The club chairman John McNamara sold out his interest in 1996 to a new consortium who, within a few months, announced exciting plans to bring Rovers to a new stadium in Tallaght on Dublin's south side. The original plan was to have an all-seated stadium with a capacity of 10,000 but serious objections by a group of local residents held the project up for years and work only began in 2000.</p>
