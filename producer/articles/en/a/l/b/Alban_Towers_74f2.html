<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Alban_Towers_74f2.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The land Alban Towers is situated on was purchased by its developer from the Washington National Cathedral in the early 1920s. It opened in 1929 as the largest apartment building in Washington, D.C. By today's standards, however, it is modest in size; it is 6 stories tall.</p>
<p>Its prominent architect/developer team, Robert O. Scholz, designer, David A. Baer, builder, designed the building in the Gothic Revival with tan-colored brick and limestone employed to simulate the monochrome composition of Gothic style architecture; popular in the 1920s and because it would complement the Washington National Cathedral. (Together Scholz &amp; Baer were responsible for the construction of at least eight apartment buildings between the years 1922 and 1931. As a result, they earned a reputation as one of the more important apartment house architect/developer teams of the post-World War I decade. Representing the product of the collaboration, both whom specialized in 1920s apartment building construction, Alban Towers reflects the work of notable planners and architects who influenced the evolution of apartment construction in Washington, D.C.)</p>
<p>The lobbies and hallways, with their richly ornamented Gothic/Art Deco elements, were integral to the exterior scheme. Paved in quarry tiles of brown, orange, and ocher laid in a geometric pattern, the lobby is topped by plaster crown molding composed of rope and infilled with alternating roses, acorns, and thistles. These symbols of Great Britain serve to reinforce the English Gothic tenor of the building. The walls of the upper-floor hallways are covered in rough-finished stucco, lending a “sumptuous texture that is rarely found in apartment buildings.”</p>
<p>The building represents an exceptionally fine example of superior design, construction, and craftsmanship characterizing luxury apartment buildings erected in Washington during the 1920s. Alban Towers’ highly decorative interior complements and reinforces the architectural style of the exterior.</p>
<p>Offering several amenities first introduced to Washington apartment buildings in the 1920s, Alban Towers is a testament to the changes in apartment design and construction after World War I. Billed as an apartment hotel, Alban Towers offered its residents 24-hour maid service and a public dining room. Indeed, on the ground floor of the building were housed a beauty shop, a travel agency, a grocery store, and a lunch counter. Each of the upper floors contained a maid’s lounge and a bathroom facility. Constructed during the decade in which apartment construction exceeded that of single-family houses, Alban Towers attempted to compensate for smaller family space by furnishing its tenants with luxurious amenities and public areas. The relative modesty of individual apartments is offset by the grandeur of the public spaces.</p>
<p>Originally, the building featured 132 units, mostly of lavish one-bedroom apartment homes, as well as a number of hotel suites. In 1930, responding to the large demand for apartment in the building, the number of units was increased by 84 with the construction of an additional two wings on the south side of the building in 1930.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, neglect of the owners to afford proper care and maintenance to the building led to its decline in status. In 1973 it was sold to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgetown_University_1892.html" title="Georgetown University">Georgetown University</a> for use as housing for some 450 students. In the 1980s and 1990s the building lay vacant, and fell into a state of serious disrepair. During this time it continually changed ownership. In 1994, amidst plans to demolish the building, area residents successfully lobbied for its recognition as a historic place to spare the destruction of a building of such grand architecture and historic past.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1999, it was purchased by Charles E. Smith Co. Residential Realty, which undertook a costly restoration effort. Particular attention was paid to the preservation of the building's original architectural elements. The restoration included restoration architects and artisans to ensure that the original character of the building was retained. The exterior, lobby and hallways were restored, while the actual apartments — which had been demolished by previous owners — were completely rebuilt to serve modern demands. The total cost of the restoration was $63 million. The building was reopened in 2001.</p>
<p>Today, the building provides residence to many diplomats and government officials, as well as to a lesser number of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_University_6c20.html" title="American University">American University</a> students.</p>

Also featured on the porte-cochere are six carved heads; five of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> males and the sixth of an aviator inspired by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_A._Lindbergh_117a.html" title="Charles A. Lindbergh">Charles A. Lindbergh</a>'s historic flight.</p>
<p>The grand lobby is spacious and designed using <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_style.html" title="Tudor style">Tudor</a> ideals, featuring Tudor strapwork and plaster ceilings.</p>
<p>The hallways (which are protected under historic preservation laws) are designed with a rough <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaster.html" title="Plaster">plaster</a> finish, pointed arches, and sculptural plaster <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilasters.html" title="Pilasters">pilasters</a> and brackets. Sculptured plaster arches and panels and friezes in the public corridors resemble the signs of the <a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiac.html" title="Zodiac">zodiac</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the building offers 229 units in the form of studio and one, two and three bedroom luxury apartments between 486 and 1,521 square feet as rental properties.</p>
<p>There are two indoor garages for the building's residents; attached and detached. The attached garage is incorporated into the building's basement level and accommodates a limited number of cars. The detached garage is located opposite the building on the building's access drive, and features two underground heated levels of parking spaces. Additionally, the detached garage serves as access to the private garages of a number of luxury townhouses — Alban Row — located above the garage on 38th Street.</p>
<p>The building includes a grand lobby, a party room, fitness center, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_pool.html" title="Swimming pool">swimming pool</a>, conference center, business center and rooftop garden.</p>

<p>An access drive runs behind the building from Cathedral Avenue to Garfield Street. Originally, a large park was located behind the building, but under the current ownership, it was scaled down into a nationally recognized <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterfly_garden.html" title="Butterfly garden">butterfly garden</a>, which was designed in coordination with the Washington Area Butterfly Club. The purpose of the scaling down of the park was to provide land for the Alban Row townhouses, which were built to offset the costs of the expensive restoration of 1999–2001.</p>
