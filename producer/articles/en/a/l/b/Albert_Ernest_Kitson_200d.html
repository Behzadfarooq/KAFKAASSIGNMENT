	    <p><b>Sir Albert Ernest Kitson</b> (21 March 1868- 8 March 1937), British/Australian <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geologist.html" title="Geologist">Geologist</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">Naturalist</a></p>
<p>Sir Albert Ernest Kitson the geologist should not be confused with another Sir Albert Ernest Kitson (1863-1944), the 2nd <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Airedale_42ba.html" title="Baron Airedale">Baron Airedale</a>, who was his contemporary but is unrelated. The latter was born into a rich family being the son of the industrialist Sir James Kitson, 1st <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Airedale_42ba.html" title="Baron Airedale">Baron Airedale</a>, who was one of the founders of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_University_8dee.html" title="Leeds University">Leeds University</a>. The former had to struggle from relatively humble origins to rise to prominence.</p>
<p>The future geologist Kitson was born in North Street, <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audenshaw.html" title="Audenshaw">Audenshaw</a>, Cheshire, England, the son of John Kitson from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> and Margaret, nee Neil, from <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland. On his Father's side the family had been stone masons whilst his maternal grandfather was a Scottish Presbyterian minister. Albert’s early childhood was spent in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> before his family emigrated to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria (Australia)</a> in 1876. Here John and Margaret taught at Enoch Point's State School before John was appointed as head teacher of North Winton State School near <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benalla.html" title="Benalla">Benalla</a>. John died of Angina in 1879 and so Margaret took over the running of the school which was attended by both her surviving children- Albert and his younger brother (John) Sidney.</p>
<p>Albert Kitson joined the Public Service in Victoria in 1886 as a clerk. Whilst still employed in this function he also carried out geological field work. This fired a passion and encouraged him to take up part-time studies in geology at the Working Men’s College (<a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>) and subsequently at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Melbourne_c667.html" title="University of Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>.</p>
<p>After his initial work in Victoria he then spent much of his professional life in Africa, in particular the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Volta_6300.html" title="Upper Volta">Upper Volta</a> (today's <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkina_Faso_dfc4.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>), the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast_1c1a.html" title="Gold Coast">Gold Coast</a> (now <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghana.html" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>), <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>. Here he discovered important mineral deposits including <a href="../../../b/a/u/Bauxite.html" title="Bauxite">bauxite</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manganese.html" title="Manganese">manganese</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a>. These were important to Britain’s war effort, as supplies of these minerals from other locations had become difficult. Then in 1919, together with his colleague Teale, he discovered on the Birim River the first stocks of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamonds.html" title="Diamonds">diamonds</a> to be found in the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>Kitson is also associated with the development of hydro-electric power in the Gold Coast/Ghana. In 1925 he was the first to recommend building a dam at <a href="../../../a/k/o/Akosombo.html" title="Akosombo">Akosombo</a> on the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volta_River_6102.html" title="Volta River">Volta River</a> to generate hydro-electricity, hoping to use this to process the bauxite deposits which he had discovered in the <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwahu.html" title="Kwahu">Kwahu</a> plateau during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. It was not until 1965 that the idea of the dam was put into effect when Ghana’s first black president, Dr <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwame_Nkrumah_1b1b.html" title="Kwame Nkrumah">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, decided to generate hydropower as a means of modernizing the economy. The real value of this project has been the subject of some debate, opponents cite its cost and the disruption to the lifestyle of <a href="../../../a/k/w/Akwamu.html" title="Akwamu">Akwamu</a> farmers below the dammed site.</p>
<p>Albert Kitson published numerous pamphlets and articles on geology as well as on natural history and anthropology. His writings on West Africa were very sympathetic to the local population. At the end of one 1916 lecture, in which Kitson had demonstrated clearly his enthusiasm for the people and country of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast_1c1a.html" title="Gold Coast">Gold Coast</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropologist.html" title="Anthropologist">anthropologist</a> Amaury Talbot made a statement which underlined that this was a well-intentioned, paternalistic kind of colonialism. According to Talbot: <i>“it would be of great advantage if we had many more men who, like him, would take an interest in both land and peoples of the West Coast. It seems to me of vital importance to this Empire that Britain should rule the tribes entrusted to her charge with justice and sympathy, and this cannot be done unless their ways of thought, beliefs, and customs are studied and considered”</i>. Clearly, this was a liberal brand of colonialism but it should not be forgotten that the long-term purpose of Kitson's geological surveys was the economic exploitation of these countries.</p>
<p>There can be no doubting that, from the British point of view, Kitson did considerable service for the Empire, finding important mineral resources and disseminating his in-depth knowledge of the African countries he studied. Whether what he did was in the long-term interest of the countries concerned is more debatable. Clearly of a liberal mind-set, he tried to promote a positive understanding of local cultures. It could also be argued that Kitson made these countries aware of their mineral deposits. But the exploitation of minerals from Colonised countries for Britain's gain obviously deprived these communities of some of their natural resources and access to Africa's minerals continues to be a controversial issue in the post-colonial era.</p>
<p>Numerous honours came Kitson's way in recognition of his work. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1918 and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1922. In 1927 Kitson was knighted (KBE) for his services to geology. The <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geological_Society_of_London_0fd3.html" title="Geological Society of London">Geological Society of London</a> awarded him the very prestigious <a href="../../../l/y/e/Lyell_Medal_c510.html" title="Lyell Medal">Lyell Medal</a> in 1927, an annual award given to an outstanding Earth Scientist. In 1929 he was appointed as President of the Geology Section of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science_4c62.html" title="British Association for the Advancement of Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> and following his retirement, which he spent in <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaconsfield.html" title="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>, he became President of the Geologists' Association in 1934. One of the <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buchan_Caves_9b64.html" title="Buchan Caves">Buchan Caves</a> in Victoria Australia is named after him, as are a fossil mollusk, a fossil eucalypt and a living eucalypt.</p>
<p>Nicknamed ‘Kittie’, Kitson was a serious-minded man, very religious and a teetotaler. He did, however, engage a hobby as a snake-charmer. In 1910 he married Margaret Legge, nee Walker, who died in 1920. Albert subsequently married Elinore Almond Ramage. Despite their advancing years (he was in his sixties, she in her forties) the couple had two children: (Ernest) Neil and David. Albert Kitson died in <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaconsfield.html" title="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>, England on 8 March 1937 of broncho-pneumonia and influenza.</p>
