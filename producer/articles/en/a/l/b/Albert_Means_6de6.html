	    <p><b>Albert Means</b> was a high school football star and later a college football player. Means became well known because of the rulebreaking that surrounded his recruitment by college programs.</p>
<p>Means was a standout <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_tackle.html" title="Defensive tackle">defensive tackle</a> at Trezevant High School in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. As a high school senior in 1999-2000 he was Tennessee's Mr. Football, a high school All American and was one of the most highly regarded football players in the nation. Many analysts considered Means to be the best high school defensive lineman in the United States. Several schools competed to land him as a recruit. Trezevant assistant coach Milton Kirk asserted that head coach Lynn Lang had let colleges know that for $200,000 Lang would arrange for Means to play for a particular school. Other claims specific to the recruitment of Means included Kirk's assertion that Lang demanded and received $6,000 in cash from a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kentucky_79ba.html" title="University of Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a> booster in the presence of Kentucky assistant coach Claude Bassett for arranging Means' visit to that school, and that Lang in similar fashion received $4,000 for each visit he arranged to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Georgia_bdea.html" title="University of Georgia">University of Georgia</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a>. These allegations and other evidence led the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) and <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) to investigate the recruitment of high school football players in Memphis.</p>
<p>The FBI investigation led to the criminal conviction on February 2, 2005 of Alabama booster Logan Young for paying $150,000 in cash to Lang through 1999 and 2000 in order to have Means play football at Alabama. Lang and Kirk also received criminal convictions for their roles in Means' recruitment.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kentucky_79ba.html" title="University of Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a> were given major penalties by the NCAA for violations of recruiting rules in their pursuit of Means. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Georgia_bdea.html" title="University of Georgia">University of Georgia</a> , the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Arkansas_116b.html" title="University of Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Memphis_b811.html" title="University of Memphis">University of Memphis</a> also pursued Means but were not sanctioned for any conduct regarding their recruitment of Means. At Young's trial Lang testified that Georgia head coach <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Donnan_712c.html" title="Jim Donnan">Jim Donnan</a> gave Lang $700 "out of his own pocket", that <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Memphis_b811.html" title="University of Memphis">University of Memphis</a> head coach <a href="../../../r/i/p/Rip_Scherer_b226.html" title="Rip Scherer">Rip Scherer</a> promised free law school tuition for Lang's wife at Memphis and that an Arkansas coach offered him $150,000 or a position on the Razorbacks' coaching staff. At Young's trial, Donnan and Scherer denied Lang's allegations. Brad Lawing, an assistant coach for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a> who recruited Means, said Lang demanded $200,000 to arrange for Means to play football there, and that Lang stated he would have to repay $50,000 to another school that had already paid for Means. Arkansas head coach <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Nutt_26c3.html" title="Houston Nutt">Houston Nutt</a> stated that one of his assistant coaches was told by Lang that $200,000 was required to secure Means' enrollment.</p>
<p>Also during Lang's trial, Means testified that he never took a required standardized test for college admission. Means testified that Lang had another student take the test in his place.</p>
<p>At Young's trial, federal prosecutors offered evidence that Lang had tried to "sell" Means to eight schools: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Memphis, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Mississippi_d3d6.html" title="University of Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a>.</p>
<p>Means played one season for Alabama in 2000, starting in four games and appearing in seven games as a true freshman. He then transferred to Memphis to finish his college career. He was overweight and academically ineligible in 2002 but in 2004 married, worked on his conditioning and improved his play. He was second team All-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_USA_59f3.html" title="Conference USA">Conference USA</a> as a senior but was not drafted by any NFL team.</p>
