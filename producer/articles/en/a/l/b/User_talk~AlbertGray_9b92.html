<p>Hi. I see that you're adding a bunch of articles for soap opera characters. Thanks for contributing to the project but I think you should take a look at <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">our guidelines for inclusion of articles on fictional characters</a>.

<p>Just a note of thanks for starting the article on the Designing Women character, Kendall Dobbs. Had you not started the article, I would not have been up to expanding it. I really appreciate it. It was a lot of fun adding to it.&#160;:) Have a nice day -- <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFlummery_9fac.html" title="User:Flummery">Flummery</a> 21:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought I'd ask you about this, since you must also have seen "<a href="../../../k/i/l/Killing_All_the_Right_People_75c4.html" title="Killing All the Right People">Killing All the Right People</a>" a decent number of times. I was checking Google for more information about the episode when I found <a href="http://www.glbtq.com/arts/am_tv_sitcoms,4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.glbtq.com/arts/am_tv_sitcoms,4.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a>. I know it's not a big deal, but I was really surprised that some people looked at the episode that way. Let me quote the part I'm talking about:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1987, as part of its second season, CBS's Southern woman-centered sitcom Designing Women explicitly drew the connection between heterosexual problem and homosexual culpability. [...]</dd>
<dd>Mary Jo argued for condoms only as a means of protecting children, not as a way to stop the spread of AIDS, which the episode tacitly connected with promiscuous homosexual behavior. Thus, as Emile Netzhamme and Scott Shamp observe, even though Kendall is portrayed as sweet, well adjusted, and sympathetic, the episode subtly blames his homosexuality for his fatal condition."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I guess I just wanted to ask you if I'm missing something here? It seemed obvious to me that the entire point of the episode was to disprove the reasoning behind the bigotry directed at homosexuals with AIDS. Mary Jo <i>did</i> argue for condoms as a means to prevent AIDS; that was her biggest motivation for participating in the debate. Of course, she was arguing for it as protection for children, not adults, but that was the point of the debate—condoms being supplied in <i>schools</i>. Mary Jo also remarks at the debate that AIDS is a disease Kendall got before he knew what it was or how to prevent it. It's stated that anyone can get AIDS and that no one knew how it got started. I felt the episode showed great sympathy for <i>everyone</i> who died from AIDS or was living with it. I just don't see this "explicit connection between heterosexual problem and homosexual culpability." Do you see it? Thanks for your time.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFlummery_9fac.html" title="User:Flummery">Flummery</a> 18:34, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm puzzled by your removal of cleanup tags from all of the Fashion House character articles. All of them are purely fictional biography written in an in-universe perspective, making the tag appropriate, so I'm surprised to see them all removed without so much as a question as to why I put them there. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 06:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC) Because, I took three days to edit them and cleaned them up to conform to the fictional standards. Hence then I removed the tags.</p>

<p>When is it revealed that William Chandler setup Tania? This is not explicated in the Fashion House finale...</p>
<p>To answer, he was the one who did the deed, and then he and Sophia, as far as I know, planted the gun on Tania. Then it was she who confessed to the crime. he was also the one who told the district attorney, that she confessed to the crime, which could easily set things like that in motion. As I said, that is what I possibly think happened, and it is open to speculation. Also, I fixed all the articles up to conform to the fictional angle, as was told, and I removed the tags after they were finished. It took me a good three days to do so.</p>

<p>Apparently someone seems to think that the character of Lance Miller is a pharmacist, because this is about the fourth time, I have had to remove a line saying that he was the world's best pharmacist.</p>
<p>Let me clear the air here. For one; Lance Miller is a <i>fictional</i> character on a telenovela called Fashion House! Secondly, even on the show, he wasn't a pharmacist, he was an accountant, and a crooked one at that; and third, he was killed on the show.</p>
<p>So, I am kindly asking, whoever is putting in that article that he is a pharmacist to stop, because he was not a pharmacist, and never would be; because he is merely a fictional character and a dead one at that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertGray_7eb9.html" title="User:AlbertGray">AlbertGray</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AlbertGray_00fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/AlbertGray">contribs</a>) 12:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Greetings. I've stumbled across a number of your articles and wanted to call your attention, if you haven't already read it, to <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. I think that for example the article on the TV series <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper_Valley_PTA_%28TV_series%29_d6fc.html" title="Harper Valley PTA (TV series)">Harper Valley PTA</a> would benefit very much from including a list of characters and perhaps a separate article with brief descriptions of the characters. However, each character should not have his or her own individual article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
