<p>In November 1943, the 12-year-old DeSalvo was arrested for assault, battery, and robbery. In December of the same year he was sent to the <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lyman_School_for_Boys_5c79.html" title="Lyman School for Boys">Lyman School for Boys</a>. In October 1944, he was <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parole.html" title="Parole">paroled</a> and started work as a delivery boy. In August 1946, he returned to the Lyman School for stealing an automobile. After completing his second sentence, DeSalvo joined the U.S. <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_forces.html" title="Armed forces">Armed forces</a> upon his parole. He was honorably discharged after his first tour of duty. He reenlisted and, in spite of being tried in a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court-martial.html" title="Court-martial">Court-martial</a>, DeSalvo was again honorably discharged.</p>
<p>Between <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, 13 single women (between the ages of 19 and 75) were murdered in the Boston area. All 13 women were <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_assault.html" title="Sexual assault">sexually assaulted</a> in their apartments, then strangled with articles of clothing. Without any sign of forced entry into their dwellings, the women were assumed to either know their assailant or voluntarily allowed him into their homes.</p>

Gainsborough Street site of the first murder attributed to The Boston Strangler</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the police were not convinced that all of these murders were the work of a single individual, much of the public believed so. Despite police efforts to solve the case, it was DeSalvo who caused his own capture.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_27.html" title="October 27">October 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, a stranger entered a young woman's home posing as a detective. He tied his victim to her bed, proceeded to sexually assault her, and suddenly left, saying "I'm sorry" as he went. The woman's description led police to identify the assailant as DeSalvo and when his photo was published, many women identified him as the man who had assaulted them. Earlier on October 27, DeSalvo had posed as a motorist with car trouble and attempted to enter a home in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgewater%2C_Massachusetts_8669.html" title="Bridgewater, Massachusetts">Bridgewater, Massachusetts</a>. The homeowner, future Brockton police chief Richard Sproles, became suspicious and eventually fired a shotgun at DeSalvo.</p>
<p>DeSalvo was not initially suspected of being involved with the stranglings. It was only after he was charged with <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> that he gave a detailed confession of his activities as the Boston Strangler. He initially confessed to a fellow inmate <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Nassar_11ec.html" title="George Nassar">George Nassar</a> who reported to his attorney <a href="../../../f/_/l/F_Lee_Bailey_a17b.html" title="F Lee Bailey">F Lee Bailey</a> who took on DeSalvo's case. The police were impressed at the accuracy of DeSalvo's descriptions of the crime scenes. Though there were some inconsistencies, DeSalvo was able to cite details which had not been made public. However, there was no physical evidence to substantiate his confession. As such, he stood trial for earlier, unrelated crimes of robbery and sexual offenses. Bailey brought up the confession to the stranglings as part of his client's history at the trial in order to assist in gaining a 'not guilty by reason of insanity' verdict to the sexual offenses but it was ruled as inadmissible by the judge.</p>
<p>DeSalvo was sentenced to life in prison in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. In February of that year he escaped with two fellow inmates from Bridgewater State Hospital triggering a full scale manhunt. A note was found on his bunk addressed to the superintendent. In it DeSalvo stated that he had escaped to focus attention on the conditions in the hospital and his own situation. The next day he gave himself up. Following the escape he was transferred to the maximum security <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walpole%2C_Massachusetts_d965.html" title="Walpole, Massachusetts">Walpole</a> State Prison where he was found murdered six years later in the infirmary. The killer or killers were never identified.</p>

<p>Lingering doubts remain as to whether DeSalvo was indeed the Boston Strangler. At the time he confessed, people who knew him personally did not believe him capable of the vicious crimes. It was also noted that the women killed by "The Strangler" came from different age and ethnic groups, and that there were different <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modus_operandi.html" title="Modus operandi">modi operandi</a>.</p>
<p>Susan Kelly, author of the 1996 book <i>The Boston Stranglers</i>, who has had access to the files of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Massachusetts_3b76.html" title="Commonwealth of Massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a>' "Strangler Bureau", argues that the stranglings were the work of several killers rather than a single individual. Another author, former FBI profiler <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Ressler_0eb1.html" title="Robert Ressler">Robert Ressler</a>, said that "You're putting together so many different patterns [regarding the Boston Strangler murders] that it's inconceivable behaviorally that all these could fit one individual."<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/14/48hours/main272108.shtml?CMP=%20ILC-SearchStories" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/14/48hours/main272108.shtml?CMP=%20ILC-SearchStories" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In 2000, <a href="http://www.sharplaw.biz" class="external text" title="http://www.sharplaw.biz" rel="nofollow">Elaine Whitfield Sharp</a>, an attorney specializing in forensic cases who is based in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marblehead%2C_Massachusetts_0db6.html" title="Marblehead, Massachusetts">Marblehead, Massachusetts</a> <a href="http://wwwforensiclawyer.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://wwwforensiclawyer.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, took up the cause of the DeSalvo family and that of the family of Mary A. Sullivan. Sullivan was publicized as being the final victim in 1964, although other stranglings occurred after that date. A former print journalist, Whitfield Sharp assisted the families in their media campaign to clear DeSalvo's name, to assist in organizing and arranging the exhumations of Mary A. Sullivan and Albert H. DeSalvo, in filing various lawsuits in attempts to obtain information and trace evidence (e.g., DNA) from the government, and to work with various producers to create documentaries to explain the facts to the public. Whitfield Sharp pointed out various inconsistencies between DeSalvo's confessions and the crime scene information (which she obtained). For example, Whitfield Sharp observed that, contrary to DeSalvo's confession to Sullivan's murder, there was no semen in her vagina and that she was not strangled manually, but by ligature. Famed forensic pathologist Michael Baden observed that DeSalvo also got the time of death wrong — a common inconsistency with several of the murders pointed out by Susan Kelly. Whitfield Sharp continues to work on the case for the DeSalvo family. She established an informational website: <a href="http://www.bostonstrangler.org" class="external text" title="http://www.bostonstrangler.org" rel="nofollow">bostonstrangler.org</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of Mary Sullivan, murdered <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> at age 19, <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> and other <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic_science.html" title="Forensic science">forensic</a> evidence — and leads from Kelly's book — were used by the victim's nephew Casey Sherman to try to track down her real killer. Sherman wrote about this in his book <i><a href="../../../a/_/r/A_Rose_for_Mary_be2f.html" title="A Rose for Mary">A Rose for Mary</a></i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>) and stated that DeSalvo was not responsible for her death. For example, DeSalvo confessed to sexually penetrating Sullivan, yet the forensic investigation revealed no evidence of sexual activity. There are also suggestions from DeSalvo himself that he was covering up for another man, the real killer. In his criminal encyclopedia, "Bloodletters and Badmen" Author Jay Robert Nash refused to list DeSalvo, due to these doubts.</p>

<li>The Boston Strangler is briefly mentioned in the song "Dirty Water" by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Standells_1c52.html" title="The Standells">The Standells</a>. The song centers around the singer's love of his home town of Boston, and in an aside toward the end of the song the words, "Have you heard about the Strangler?" are heard.</li>
<li>The song "<a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Rambler_c53d.html" title="Midnight Rambler">Midnight Rambler</a>" by the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> (from the album <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Let_It_Bleed_b608.html" title="Let It Bleed">Let It Bleed</a></i>) was inspired by and almost mentions the Boston Strangler. After a series of lines ending in "rambler" and "gambler", the words 'Well you heard about the Boston...' are sung, yet what follows is obscured by music.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, Texas legislator <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Moore%2C_Jr._2c91.html" title="Tom Moore, Jr.">Tom Moore, Jr.</a> introduced a measure to demonstrate the lack of legislative scrutiny.
