<p>Alberto Fernandez de Rosa began acting as a child. He debuted in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theater</a> at the age of eleven, participating at plays on the Teatro Liceo, under the supervision of playwright Luisa Vehil.</p>
<p>While not a prominent actor at first, he struggled until he was finally able to land a job in a television series, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>'s "La Familia Falcon" ("The Falcon Family"). At the age of eighteen, Fernandez de Rosa became a <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_idol.html" title="Teen idol">teen idol</a> in Argentina.</p>
<p>Next, he made his first movie, "El Secreto de Monica" ("Monica's Secret"). This film proved important in Fernandez de Rosa's acting career, as it exposed him for the first time to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>'s public; Fernandez de Rosa would later participate in a significant number of productions from that <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> country. He also participated in "El Televisor" before 1962 was over.</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa came back to "La Familia Falcon" in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, this time, playing the character of "Alberto". In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, he played "Bobby" in "Pajarito Gomez", a successful Argentine film. He followed that work with <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>'s "El Castigador" ("The Punisher"), and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>'s "Buenos Aires, Verano 1912" ("Buenos Aires in the Summer of 1912"), which was a look back at Argentina's capital city during the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910s.html" title="1910s">1910s</a>.</p>
<p>The 22 year old actor made four films in 1966. Apart from "Buenos Aires, Verano 1912", another important movie he made that year was "El Bikini Rojo" ("Red Bikini"), which enjoyed success in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> as well as in Argentina.</p>
<p>After taking a rest from filming in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Fernandez de Rosa returned to the screens in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, participating in the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a>-Spaniard production, "Marchio dil Kriminal I" ("March of the Criminal I"). Fernandez de Rosa had by then moved to Spain; this would enable him later on to play Spaniard characters back home in Argentina. Fernandez de Rosa lived in Spain three years, during which he made a total of seventeen films.</p>
<p>After returning to Argentina in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, Fernandez de Rosa participated in his first television series, playing "Ruben" in "Niño, las Cosas Simples de la Vida" ("Boy, Simpler Things in Life"). By then, Fernandez de Rosa had gone from being a teen idol to becoming a critically respected actor, both in Argentina and in Spain. After one more movie, Fernandez de Rosa participated in "La Ultima Señora Anderson", a movie that was shown in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> as "Death at the Deep End of the Swimming Pool". "La Ultima Señora Anderson" was also shown in movie theaters at Italy. In some United States markets, the movie was given the title "The Fourth Victim".</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa participated in "Destino de un Capricho" ("A Wish's Destiny") in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, then returned to Spain briefly in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> to film "Don Quijote Cabalga de Nuevo" ("Don Quijote Rides Again"). In that film, he played a character named almost exactly like him, "Alberto Fernandez".</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa began <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> by making another movie, then established himself in West Germany for a small period, having been contracted by an important television network to participate in a sitcom. He acted in 26 episodes of a series named "Kara Bem Nemsi Effendi". After that, Fernandez de Rosa returned to Spain, where he made "Manolo, la Nuit" ("Manolo by Night") and two other films before that year was over.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, Fernandez de Rosa participated in what was arguably his most successful film: "El Insolito Embarazo de los Martinez" ("The Martinez family's Strange Pregnancy") was a very successful hit both in Spain and in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. A comedy movie about a man who became impregnated by his wife, "El Insolito Embarazo de los Martinez" later on became the inspiration for the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> movie, "<a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_%28movie%29.html" title="Junior (movie)">Junior</a>". "El Insolito Embarazo de los Martinez"'s story was set in Argentina but filmed in Spain.</p>
<p>1974 in particular was a very busy year for Fernandez de Rosa: he made seven more movies, including "Yo la vi Primero", "El Reprimido" and "Los Nuevos Españoles", which were released in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> as "I Saw Her First", "The Repressed Man" and "The New Spaniards", respectively.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Fernandez de Rosa acted in the international hit, "El Poder del Deseo" ("Power of Desire"). "El Poder del Deseo" also gave Fernandez de Rosa international exposition, as it was shown in many Hispanic and English-speaking countries. 1975 was another busy year for Fernandez de Rosa; he participated in "Los Casados y la Menor" ("The Married Couple and the Minor"), "Mi Mujer es muy Decente, Dentro de lo que Cabe" ("My Wife is Decent, Depending on what Decent Is"), "La Guerra del Cerdo" ("Diary of a Pig War") and in an episode of a television series named "Las Sorpresas" ("Surprises").</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> was another year where Fernandez de Rosa worked very hard, participating in a total of five films. These included "Tiempos Duros Para Dracula" ("Hard Tomes for Dracula"), which was a horror-comedy, "Retrato de Familia" ("Family Portrait, which became a hit in some English speaking countries; Fernadez de Rosa played "Hipolito" in that show), "La Mujer es Cosa de Hombres" ("Women are for Men"), "Juan que Reia" ("Juan, the Man That Laughed"), and "Las Camareras" ("Female Flight Attendants").</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa played "Manene" in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>'s "El Monosabio" ("The Wise Monkey"). His participation as "Manene" in "Monosabio" was followed with four other jobs that year, "Caperucita y Roja" ("She wears a hood and her face is reddened"), which was a spoof off the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Red_Riding_Hood_86fa.html" title="Little Red Riding Hood">Little Red Riding Hood</a> children's story, plus "Estoy Hecho un Chaval" ("I feel like a Kid Again") and "Caledonio y yo Somos Asi" ("Caledonio and I are Like That").</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, Fernandez de Rosa participated in only one movie, named "El Juego del Diablo" ("<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Devil_200c.html" title="The Devil">Devil</a>'s Game"), after which he decided to take a voluntary retirement from Argentine screens. He had already, however, become an iconic figure among Argentine actors.</p>
<p>When he returned to screen acting in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, he acted in "Buscando a Perico" ("Searching for Perico"). He also acted in "Rocky Carambola", which was an international hit. "Rocky Carambola" was released in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> as "Criada se Enamora: La Rocky Carambola" ("Maid Falls in Love: Rocky Carambola"); other countries knew this film as "Le Agarro la Mano el Chango" ("The Monkey Grabbed it's Hand"). Next for Fernandez de Rosa was Italian release "Por Favore, Ocupatti de Amelia" ("Please, Take Care of Amelia"), which was released in Spain as "Por Favor, Ocupate de Amelia".</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> began for Fernadez de Rosa with another movie that would be released in English: "Corazon de Papel" gained some notoriety in English as "Paper Heart". Then, he played "Alberto Fernandez" in "<a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Colmena_7d5e.html" title="La Colmena">La Colmena</a>", which was also released in English, as "The Beehive".</p>
<p>For <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Fernandez de Rosa returned once again to Spain, where he worked on a children's film, "Parchis Entra en Accion" ("Parchis Goes to Action"), In this movie Fernandez de Rosa shared credits with <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parchis_%28group%29.html" title="Parchis (group)">Parchis</a>, a well known musical group from Spain at the time.</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa returned to Argentina after that. Back at home, he would participate in his first <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telenovela.html" title="Telenovela">telenovela</a>, "Mesa de Noticias" ("News Table"), where he acted as "Rosales". He followed that up acting as "Eduardo" in "El Ultimo Kamikaze" ("The Last Kamikaze"), then he acted in "Mi Amigo el Vagabundo' ("My Friend the Homeless"), finishing his 1984 screen acting schedule with "Dos Mejor que Uno" ("Two are Better Than One").</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa acted in only one film during <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, "Flores Robadas de los Jardines de Quilmes" ("<a href="../../../f/l/o/Flower.html" title="Flower">Flowers</a> stolen from Quilmes' Gardens"), but he came back in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> to participate in five films, namely "Brigada Explosiva" ("Explosive Brigade", once again, playing "Rosales"), a sequel of "Brigada Explosiva ("Brigada Explosiva Contra los Ninjas", or "Explosive Brigade versus <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">Ninjas</a>"), "<a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rapide_0194.html" title="Dragon Rapide">Dragon Rapide</a>", where he played "General Ordaz", "<a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Amores_de_Laurita_4b97.html" title="Los Amores de Laurita">Los Amores de Laurita</a>" ("Laurita's Loves") and "<a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Insomnes_820c.html" title="Los Insomnes">Los Insomnes</a>" ("Insomniacs").</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa made two films in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, "Los Bañeros mas Locos del Mundo" ("The Craziest Beach Goers in the World"), "Los Matamonstruos en la Mansion del Terror" ("The Monster Killers at the Horror Mansion"). Then, he began <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> with "Los Pilotos mas Locos del Mundo" ("The Craziest Pilots in the World", a sequel to "Los Bañeros mas Locos del Mundo), which was followed by "Soldadito Español" ("Little Spaniard Soldier", a comedy movie that was directed by Antonio Gimenèz Rico). He finished off 1988 with a small role in "Baton Rouge" which starred <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Abril_d005.html" title="Victoria Abril">Victoria Abril</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Banderas_59a5.html" title="Antonio Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a> in one of Banderas' earlier works and where Fernandez de Rosa actually had a job as an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra.html" title="Extra">extra</a>, playing a card player.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Fernandez de Rosa returned to Buenos Aires. This would prove to be an important career move for Fernandez de Rosa later on. In Buenos Aires, he became a theater director in the well known Teatro San Martin. Meanwhile, he acted in a television show named "DNI: La Otra Historia ("DNI: The Other Story").</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Fernandez de Rosa acted on television only once. He was elected as subsecretary of culture in Buenos Aires, and he returned to screen acting with his participation in "Atame!", which was televised in the United States as "Tie me Up, Tie me Down!".</p>
<p>Next came one of the most important acting jobs in Fernandez de Rosa's career: His character in "Grande Pa!, "Teo", became very popular in Argentina. In "Grande Pa!" (titled "Super Dad" in English speaking countries that televised the show), Fernandez de Rosa had his first chance of acting alongside <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agustina_Cherri_654a.html" title="Agustina Cherri">Agustina Cherri</a>, who would later on act with Fernandez de Rosa in "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiquititas.html" title="Chiquititas">Chiquititas</a>".</p>
<p>During the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Fernandez de Rosa became casting director at <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telefe.html" title="Telefe">Telefe</a>, a job he held in high esteem; he saw his being chosen as casting director at Telefe as a form of respect towards his career as an actor by that company's executive directors.</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa made one more series in 1991, "Fuera de Juego" ("Offsides"). In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, he acted in a Spaniard comedy, "Sevilla Connection". He also participated in "Una Mujer Bajo la Lluvia' ("Woman in the Rain") as "Javier", and in "Aqui, el que no Corre...Vuela" ("Here, He Who Won't Run...Will Fly").</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa began <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> by playing "Cairo" in "Tretas de Mujer" ("A Woman's Threats"). But after "Tretas de Mujer", Fernandez de Rosa was approached by Telefe to begin searching for <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenage.html" title="Teenage">teenaged</a> actors to be cast in his next show, "Chiquititas". He spent <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> helping <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cris_Morena_af58.html" title="Cris Morena">Cris Morena</a> prepare the show that would become a megahit internationally.</p>
<p><a name=".22Chiquititas.22"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Rosa_bb8e.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Chiquititas&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Chiquititas"</span></h2>
<p>"Chiquititas" began to be produced by Telefe, and shown across Argentina and various countries in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. Fernandez de Rosa acted along with the performers he casted for the children's telenovela, including <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Jimena_Piccolo_10b2.html" title="Maria Jimena Piccolo">Maria Jimena Piccolo</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facundo_Arana_ed80.html" title="Facundo Arana">Facundo Arana</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romina_Yan_0631.html" title="Romina Yan">Romina Yan</a> (Morena's daughter) and, as aforementioned, Agustina Cherri. He played "Saverio", a cook who had immigrated from Spain. The fact that Fernandez de Rosa had lived for many years in Spain helped him play "Saverio", who had a Spaniard accent. Playing "Saverio" enabled Fernandez de Rosa to become known among Argentina's younger generations during the 1990's.</p>
<p>"Chiquititas" albums and magazines followed; although Fernandez de Rosa mainly did not participate in these products, he would occasionally be featured on the magazine. When "Chiquititas" began to be shown in the United States on Telefe's satellite network during the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>'s, Fernandez de Rosa started to become famous among Hispanics in that country as well.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Rosa_bb8e.html" title="Edit section: After &quot;Chiquititas&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After "Chiquititas"</span></h2>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa slowed down his work as a screen actor considerably after "Chiquititas", concentrating more on his job as casting director for Telefe. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, he played "Augustus Rios" in "Palace". Contrary to previous years, however, Fernandez de Rosa acted in only one new production during 1996.</p>
<p>Already a veteran actor, Fernandez de Rosa once again participated in only one new production in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, "24 Horas (Algo Esta por Explotar)" ("24 Hours, Something's About to Explode") a drama-comedy starring Julieta Ortega and Eduardo Cutuli. In "24 Horas (Algo Esta por Explotar)", Fernandez de Rosa also had the opportunity to act alongside well known actress Divina Gloria.</p>
<p>Fernandez de Rosa took <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> off, then returned to Argentine television in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a>, "La Mujer del Presidente" ("The President's Wife"). After being away for one more year, Fernandez de Rosa joined <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillermo_Francella_7dc1.html" title="Guillermo Francella">Guillermo Francella</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> during some episodes of Francella's hit series "Pone a Francella" ("Put on Francella").</p>
<p>2001 has so far proven to be the last year in which Fernandez de Rosa did screen acting, with his last appearance in a film named "Te Besare Mañana" ("I Will Kiss you Tomorrow"). <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">As of 2006</a>, Fernandez de Rosa continued working as casting director for Telefe.</p>
