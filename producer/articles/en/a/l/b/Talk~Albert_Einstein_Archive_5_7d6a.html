<dd>I don't believe there is any reason to suspect that Einstein was an autist. High-functioning autists may be considered "little professors", but that doesn't mean all eccentric professors are autistic. One of the signals that a person is autistic is that they are "mindblind", that is, unable to infer anything about the intentions of others. Einstein did not display such characteristics, to the best of my knowledge; his views on politics were sensitive and sophisticated, as is pretty notorious. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 21:33, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The article seems pretty balanced, and appropriately sourced, though, so my worries should take a back seat to that. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 02:46, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, dear God. Not another one. That makes, what, 634,572,204 people, doesn't it? Please, Lucidish. If you'd like to stereotype people, at least read up on them first. If you read things on high-functioning autism, you probably would be ashamed that people would say things like that. It's like feeling sorry for a blind person, only worse, because</p>
<p>A. They don't remember what it was like before they got it, because they've always had it.</p>
<p>B. It's easier to spot a blind person on sight, whereas you think even worse of autistics because until you learn they have it, you wonder why they're not normal. And</p>
<p>C. People reason that if autistics are like this, then, thusly, if someone's not like this they're not autistic. But what if not all autistics are like this? This also leads to B.</p>
<p>I won't argue that Einstein is autistic, though. I try not to force my opinions on others, unless my opinion is that they're using illogical reasoning.</p>

<dd>Well now, JeffK, I would be better equipped to cite sources and defend my comments if I knew what exactly you were complaining about. The <i>purposefully hedged</i> mindblindness reference? The "little professors" reference? The acknowledgement of sourcing in the article? For info on mindblindness, read Uta Frith's "Autism: Explaining the Enigma" and Simon-Baron Cohen's ";Mindblindness". For a reference on the characterization of "little professors", see the classic works of Kanner and Asperger -- that is to say, the persons who discovered the disorder. For info on the sourcing of the article, see the article. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 20:44, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about all that. I really got carried away... I hope it didn't offend you. I still stand by my point, but it was a bit too harsh on you, Lucidish. My point was you probably should learn about what they're really like before you generalize about them, but you probably were just citing what you know when you talked about mindblindedness... true, generally it takes them a bit longer to realise things like that, but just because a person's diagnosed with autism doesn't mean they have no idea that other people have their own ideas and opinions. I certainly never had a problem with that. And truth be told, I'm probably taking a very biased stance. But small story short (too late&#160;;-)), I was just angry at the time. People do stupid stuff when they're angry. Oh, and btw... autist? That can't be right...&#160;;-p <a href="../../../1/3/3/User%7E1337_r0XX0r_1b37.html" title="User:1337 r0XX0r">1337 r0XX0r</a> 15:22, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't sweat it. The thing is, I didn't generalize: it's one of the symptoms not the only symptom. There are other hallmarks, like certain pragmatic language deficits, and routined behaviors, which are just as important in gauging a person on the autistic spectrum. My point was just that mindblindness seemed to be a key criterion, and Einstein didn't seem to have it; this is reason to beleive that he wasn't an autist. Also, I wanted to point out that hindsight evaluations purely on the funny characteristics of professorial types may simply be superficial personality-related stuffs. If he had other characteristics (preferably the sort outlined in DSM4), then that would be reason to discount my worries.</dd>
<dd>None of this means anything about the autistic population at large, or that mindblind autists can't learn to compensate for that problem by learning complicated schemata (and it certainly doesn't mean that they lack instinctual empathy, which is not what's meant by "mindblindness"). It's just one way of trying to figure out the likelihood that a person was or wasn't autistic.</dd>
<dd>"Autist" is the term that Frith used in her book, and I like it a bit better than saying "an autistic", because it just seems aesthetically nicer. Though people in the field probably still use the descriptor "autistic", since "autist" sounds too much like "artist". <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 16:35, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">German-American theoretical physicist</span></h2>
<p>I disagree with the opening line which reads "..[Einstein] was a Jewish theoretical physicist..". The word Jew is used in many ways but generally refers to a follower of Judaism, a child of a Jewish mother, or someone of Jewish descent with a connection to Jewish culture, ethnicity and/or religion; It's improper to refer to Einstein with an ethnic/religious pretext. Traditionally, the opening line refers to one's place/nation of birth, not their cultural or religious background. I'm going to change this to German-American, and leave it up to the rest of the article to debate over his ethnic and religious heritage. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 216.105.163.3 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.105.163.3.html" title="User talk:216.105.163.3">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.105.163.3_47a6.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.105.163.3">contribs</a>) 21:10, January 9, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>His parents were Jewish as far as I know. Was also educated at a Jewish school, and persecuted for being Jewish. What's improper? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 04:28, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not disputing his Jewish heritage at all. However, traditionally the opening line for an article relating to a person (or persons) outlines their profession (one related to their accomplishment(s)) and his or her place of birth. Discussing one's cultural/religion background should be debated in the body of the article, not the opening line. I.e.: Georges Cziffra (and other figures of distinct heritage) was Gypsy by birth, yet you don't see anyone describing him as a Gypsy first, and a classical pianist second. 22:24, 10 January 2006 (UTC) <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 216.105.163.3 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.105.163.3.html" title="User talk:216.105.163.3">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.105.163.3_47a6.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.105.163.3">contribs</a>) 22:24, January 13, 2006 (UTC)</small>

<p>Why does the article begin by describing Einstein as "German-American"? It's inaccurate, or at least incomplete. If you're going to use such a hyphenate, it should be "German-Swiss-American", or better yet it should be dropped altogether. Einstein's somewhat complex citizenship is explained in the body of the article.

<p>-"he renounced his <a href="../../../w/%C3%BC/r/W%C3%BCrttemberg.html" title="Württemberg">Württemberg</a> citizenship and became stateless."- Ths is somewhat confusing to the ignorant. Why "Württemberg citizenship" and not "German citizenship"? Could somebody please add a note of explanation about how this worked?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">1931 Unified Field Theory... Gone Missing???</span></h2>
<p>From the International Herald Tribune's "In Our Pages 100, 75 &amp; 50 Years Ago" article, 23 Jan 2005:</p>
<p>1931: Einstein's New Theory</p>
<p>PASADENA, California: The fundamental unity of light, gravity and electromagnetism was proclaimed by Professor Albert Einstein here today [Jan. 22], in a theory which scientists hail as the most revolutionary and the most daring ever propounded in the whole history of science. The theory which Einstein has now made public, after having been at work on it for the last 10 years, is known as the theory of the unified field. According to the generalized conception reached by the great mathematician, all optical, gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena figure as modifications, identical in their essence, of this one field.</p>
<p>Einstein explained that he believes that he has finally reduced all the principal laws of nature, as known to physics, in this one theory. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 66.81.219.54 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.81.219.54_fcb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.81.219.54">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Einsteins nationality / citizenship</span></h2>
<p>I noticed there is a lot of dispute about Einstein's nationality. In order to stop the bouncing, removal of nationalities and insertion of nationality that einstein possesed once in his life i have added a small section about the nationalities that einstein used to have during his life. I sincerly hope that this clears up something, but i also hope that people do not simply delete this info (such as <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct">User:Max_rspct</a>), (due to hateful feelings against germans?? or the belief that einstein would want to be a german, lets stay to the facts pls). <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanseichbaum_324a.html" title="User:Hanseichbaum">Hanseichbaum</a> 14:16, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I dont feel that it is necessary to dedicate a whole section to his nationality; Is it really that important to know whether or not he was german? If so, I believe that this kind of information would reveal itself to the reader in the intorduction, or the section concerning his early life. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelta759_0b5c.html" title="User:Delta759">Delta[XK</a>] 21:47, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Every date should <b>not</b> be linked. It's bad style and inapposite to information provided in the article. I removed said links. Please do not revert. green 65.88.65.217 19:59, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a> says that full dates (i.e. April 1, 1900) should be wikilinked, because then the Wiki software can re-adjust it to whatever the date format the user has specified (i.e. 1 April 1900). Only individual years (i.e. 1900) should not be linked, because no formatting occurs. I agree that it's sort of silly to have so many links of this sort but that's the normal convention followed on here.--<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 20:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't see any requirement to link dates. In fact, the style rules state that overlinking is undesirable. They give different acceptable (unlinked) formats. If you concur, please revert what you changed.

<li>But right above that it explains about date linking so that date preferences will work. "Editors are not required to link full dates, but most full dates in Wikipedia <i>are</i> linked so that each user's date-formatting preference appears in the text." --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 21:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I don't wish to pursue this, but if date linking is <b>not</b> required, and <b>is</b>, as you agree, non-informative, from the pov of style they should be eliminated from the article. Have I missed something here? green 65.88.65.217 00:28, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ahhhaaa! It means that if an editor is dumb enough to use a date like 01/02/06, Wiki software will default Jan 2 say, instead of Feb 1, if it is smart enough to know that 06 is not June. But if the editor was that careless, his edits would surely have greater insufficiencies. green <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.136.26.226.html" title="User:64.136.26.226">64.136.26.226</a> 04:43, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
