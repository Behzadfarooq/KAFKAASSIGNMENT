<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Ellis_7f58.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Ellis was born to a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> family in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>. He was the eldest of three children, with a brother two years younger and a sister who was four years younger. Ellis' father was a businessman who experienced minimal success at a succession of business ventures; he showed only a modicum of affection to his children and was often away from home on business trips during their early childhood.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Ellis characterized his mother as a self-absorbed woman with a <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">bipolar disorder</a>. At times, according to Ellis, she was a "bustling chatterbox who never listened". She would expound on her strong opinions on most subjects but rarely provided a factual basis for these views. Like his father, Ellis's mother was emotionally distant from her children. Ellis recounted that she was sleeping when he left for school and was usually not at home when he returned. Instead of reporting feeling bitter, he took on the responsibility of caring for his siblings. He purchased an alarm clock with his own money and woke and dressed his younger brother and sister. When the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> struck, all three children sought work to assist the family.</p>
<p>Ellis was sickly as a child and suffered numerous health problems through his youth. At the age of five he was hospitalized with a <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidney_disease.html" title="Kidney disease">kidney disease</a>. He was also hospitalized with <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonsillitis.html" title="Tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a>, which led to a severe <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_A_streptococcal_infection_f14b.html" title="Group A streptococcal infection">streptococcal infection</a> requiring emergency surgery. He reported that he had eight hospitalizations between the ages of five and seven. One of these lasted nearly a year. His parents provided little or no emotional support for him during these years, rarely visiting or consoling him. Ellis stated that he learned to confront his adversities as he had "developed a growing indifference to that dereliction".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Ellis_7f58.html" title="Edit section: Education and early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education and early career</span></h2>
<p>Ellis entered the field of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_psychology.html" title="Clinical psychology">clinical psychology</a> after first earning a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_degree.html" title="Academic degree">degree</a> in business from the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_University_of_New_York_91a7.html" title="City University of New York">City University of New York</a>. He began a brief career in business, followed by one as a writer. These endeavors took place during the Great Depression that began in 1929, and Ellis found that business was poor and had no success in publishing his fiction. Finding that he could write non-fiction well, Ellis researched and wrote on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">human sexuality</a>. His lay counseling in this subject convinced him to seek a new career in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_psychology.html" title="Clinical psychology">clinical psychology</a>.</p>
<p>In 1942, Ellis began his studies for a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Philosophy_8163.html" title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in clinical psychology at <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teachers_College%2C_Columbia_University_b125.html" title="Teachers College, Columbia University">Teachers College, Columbia University</a>, which trained psychologists mostly in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoanalysis.html" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>.</p>
<p>He completed his <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">Master of Arts</a> in clinical psychology from <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teachers_College%2C_Columbia_University_b125.html" title="Teachers College, Columbia University">Teachers College, Columbia University</a> in June 1943, and started a part-time private practice while still working on his <a href="../../../p/h/2E/Ph.D_8cff.html" title="Ph.D">Ph.D</a> degree – possibly because there was no licensing of psychologists in New York at that time. Ellis began publishing articles even before receiving his Ph.D.; in 1946 he wrote a critique of many widely-used pencil-and-paper <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality_test.html" title="Personality test">personality tests</a>. He concluded that only the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory_f6d5.html" title="Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory">Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory</a> met the standards of a research-based instrument.</p>

<p>After the completion of his doctorate, Ellis sought additional training in psychoanalysis. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving his Ph.D. in 1947, Ellis began a personal analysis and program of supervision with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hulbeck_1e9a.html" title="Richard Hulbeck">Richard Hulbeck</a> (whose own analyst had been <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Rorschach_c396.html" title="Hermann Rorschach">Hermann Rorschach</a>, a leading training analyst at the Karen Horney Institute.) <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Horney_f8f2.html" title="Karen Horney">Karen Horney</a> would be the single greatest influence in Ellis's thinking, although the writings of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Adler_4b3a.html" title="Alfred Adler">Alfred Adler</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Fromm_30e6.html" title="Erich Fromm">Erich Fromm</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Stack_Sullivan_91e6.html" title="Harry Stack Sullivan">Harry Stack Sullivan</a> also played a role in shaping his psychological models. Ellis credits <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Korzybski_f76a.html" title="Alfred Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a> and his book, <i>Science and Sanity</i>, for starting him on the philosophical path for founding rational-emotive therapy.</p>
<p>By January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. By 1955 he dubbed his new approach Rational Therapy (RT). RT required that the therapist help the client understand — and act on the understanding — that his personal philosophy contains beliefs that lead to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviors by demonstrating their irrationality and rigidity. Ellis related everything to these core irrational beliefs such as "I must be perfect" and "I must be loved by everyone." Ellis believed that through rational analysis, people can understand their errors in light of the core irrational beliefs and then construct a more rational position.</p>
<p>In 1954 Ellis began teaching his new technique to other therapists, and by 1957 he formally set forth the first <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_behavior_therapy.html" title="Cognitive behavior therapy">cognitive behavior therapy</a> by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for neuroses. Two years later Ellis published the book <i>How to Live with a Neurotic</i> which elaborated on his new method. In 1960 Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> convention in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the zeitgeist within a generation.</p>
<p>At that time the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behaviorism.html" title="Behaviorism">behaviorism</a>, while in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_psychology.html" title="Clinical psychology">clinical psychology</a> it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Jung_ba49.html" title="Carl Jung">Jung</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Adler_4b3a.html" title="Alfred Adler">Adler</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Perls_11c7.html" title="Fritz Perls">Perls</a>. Despite the fact that Ellis' approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked almost everyone with the possible exception of the followers of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Adler_4b3a.html" title="Alfred Adler">Alfred Adler</a>. Consequently, he was often received with hostility at professional conferences and in print. <a href="http://www.rebt.ws/albertellisbiography.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rebt.ws/albertellisbiography.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Despite the slow adoption of his approach, Ellis founded his own institute. The Institute for Rational Living was founded as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not-for-profit.html" title="Not-for-profit">not-for-profit</a> organization in 1959. By 1968 it was chartered by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_New_York_b1ea.html" title="State of New York">New York State</a> <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Regents_6315.html" title="Board of Regents">Board of Regents</a> as a training institute and psychological clinic. This was no trivial feat as New York State had a Mental Hygiene Act which mandated <i>psychiatric</i> management of mental health clinics. <a href="http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/researchroom/rr_health_mh_timeline.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/researchroom/rr_health_mh_timeline.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Ellis had broken ground by founding an institute purely based on psychological control and principles.</p>
<p>Curiously, in 1965 Ellis published a book entitled <i>Homosexuality: Its Causes and Cure</i>. Ellis was one of the psychotherapists that still regarded homosexuality as a pathology and therefore a condition that one should want to cure. He was writing a decade after the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinsey_Report_f44f.html" title="Kinsey Report">Kinsey Reports</a>, which had found homosexual behavior extremely common in both men and women. About a decade after Ellis's book, homosexuality was regarded as a condition that is within normal limits. In 1972, the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a> lesbian feminist journal <i>Libera</i> published a satirical article entitled "Heterosexuality in Women: Its Causes and Cure," whose title closely parallels Ellis's and whose style is deadpan academic prose. (The journal is no longer published, and this article has become difficult to find.) In 1973, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychiatric_Association_f5df.html" title="American Psychiatric Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> declared that homosexuality was no longer a mental disorder, and thus not properly subject to cure. This decision has not been reconsidered by the APA, although many other people, particular <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">Fundamentalists</a>, disagree with it. There are apparently still "Christian Therapists" who claim to have cured homosexuality, and they occasionally present "ex-gay" patients to prove it.</p>
<p>In 2003 Ellis received an award from the Association for Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (UK) for the formulation and development of REBT. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Association. At the same time he celebrated his 90th birthday, an event attended by luminaries such as Bill Clinton and the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Ellis_7f58.html" title="Edit section: Albert Ellis and Religion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Albert Ellis and Religion</span></h2>
<p>Ellis may be as famous–or infamous–for his vigorous <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> as for his development of REBT. Controversy associated with his atheistic stance probably began with his book <i>Sex Without Guilt</i>, in which he expressed the opinion that religious restrictions on sexual expression are needless and harmful of emotional health. He has famously debated religious psychologists about the role of religion in psychological distress, including O. Hobart Mowrer and Allen Bergin. Ellis has most recently described himself as a probabilistic atheist, meaning that while it is impossible to be certain that there is no God, the likelihood that a God or Gods exist is so vanishingly small that it is not worth his attention.</p>
<p>While Ellis’s personal atheism has remained consistent, his views about the role of religion in mental health have changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and with characteristic sarcasm stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In <i>The Case Against Religiosity</i>, a 1983 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic, demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals may, of course, manifest religiosity, but added the idea that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many psychoanalysts, communists, <i>and</i> aggressive atheists like the late Madalyn Murray O'Hair. He proposed that intolerance of any set of beliefs with which one disagrees is common in religiosity.</p>
<p>Ellis has been careful to state that REBT is independent of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. While Ellis maintains his atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism is likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he has recently acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God is probably psychologically healthy. Based on this approach to religion, he co-authored a book describing principals for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients, <i>Counseling and Psychotherapy With Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach</i>.</p>

<p>In 2004 Ellis was taken ill with serious intestinal problems, which led to hospitalization and the removal of his large intestine. He returned to work after a few months of being nursed back to health by Debbie Joffe, his assistant, who later became his wife. In 2005 he was subjected to removal from all his professional duties, and from the board of his own institute after a dispute over the management policies of the institute.</p>
<p>In 2005 he was removed from all professional duties and from the board of his own institute, and he is currently bringing civil court actions against those who removed him. His reinstatement is being championed by the <a href="http://www.rebt.cc/_wsn/page3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rebt.cc/_wsn/page3.html" rel="nofollow">Justice for Albert Ellis Campaign</a></p>
<p>Currently, at age 93 Ellis continues to write and is completing his first college text book with co-authors Dr. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Abrams_63da.html" title="Michael Abrams">Mike Abrams</a> and Dr. Lidia Abrams. This book to be published in the fall of 2007 will be the first text to formally present Ellis' theory of personality.</p>
