<dd>Licorne, there is no one who is surprised at this -- I announced both to this page and on your page many times that I find your editing disruptive and that continuing it would lead to arbitration and eventually probably your own banning. If anybody is curious as to why I am trying to ban Licorne from Wikipedia, they are welcome to view the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Licorne_b89f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Licorne">RFC</a> or the RFA about it. It isn't a "lynch mob", it's well over a dozen editors who think you have consistently violated both the policies of this website and lack any ability to contribute productively. You've brought it upon yourself, and people have shown unbelieveable amounts of patience with you on this issue. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:06, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi I just came back from vacation... knowing you, even when I improve the intro, I very much doubt that you'll like it! Even more, the intro seems not to bad; there is a glitch however, but that is in the linked <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> article intro - it's misleading to state that "General relativity (GR) is the <i>geometrical theory of gravitation</i> published by Albert Einstein in 1915". But I was unable to explain it to the bunch of people who currently tweeks that article. Maybe someone else wants to try to explain that in 1915/1916 "general relativity"was <b>not</b> a "theory of gravitation"? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 06:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>GRT was a theory according to which all motion is <i>relative</i> , in <i>general</i>, just like inertial motion was in SRT. As Einstein put it (Einstein 1916), GRT "<i>leads</i>" to a theory of gravitation, which however he didn't give a separate name. Nowadays that unnamed theory is called "GRT". <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 11:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, the GR section makes it sound like Einstein discovered the field equation which is of course false. -- Where is Harald he said he would rewrite the article, where is he. <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 22:49, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ironic, that you would be making an argument about it being quoted out of context in this respect. But in this case, you are, I think, wrong: Thorne's quote conveys exactly what Thorne meant. It clearly says that the issue of dates is complicated, that Hilbert may have published first technically, but then explains some of the difficulties in just saying that "Hilbert has priority". It's very easy to understand what Thorne was intending, and I saw nothing in the book itself which would imply that Thorne meant anything different by it. I suspect you might be using the term "quoting out of context" wrong: it refers to the question of whether the quote has been used in a way which would imply something not said in the text of the original work (i.e., the way you originally used Thorne's quote, to try and imply that Thorne thought Hilbert had simple priority, was using a quote out of context). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>No, I mean in the greater context of quotes by <i>OTHERS</i> especially by Hilbert himself who repeatedly claimed priority, which neutralizes Thorne. In this larger context Thorne is clearly seen as wrong, so his quote should removed, or else for balance Hilbert's claims of priority should be there too, for the <i>COMPLETE CONTEXT</i>. <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 23:36, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I suspected, you're using the term "quoted out of context" incorrectly and somewhat nonsensically. What you are saying is that you think Thorne's quote is incorrect. Which is a different type of claim (and the same one you've been going on about, ever since Thorne's quote was no longer being quoted out of context).</dd>
<dd>Quoting "out of context" refers to the process of isolating a quote from a larger work in a way which obscures or distorts the meaning of the author in a way which would have been clear had the work as a whole been taken into consideration. A classic example is the phenomena of Creationist websites which take Darwin's passage on the evolution of the eye from <i>Origin of Species</i> (in which Darwin expresses the fact that it is hard to imagine the eye having been evolved gradually) and then say, "Look, even Darwin knew his theory was wrong!" In reality, Darwin thought no such thing: the passage immediately following the part quoted out of context by the Creationists resolves the issue completely for Darwin (he says that even though it is hard to believe, there are reasons to think even the eye could have been evolved gradually over time, and lists them). Hence, the Creationists remove the quote from its overall context and use it in a way which gives a false or misleading impression of Darwin's opinions, in this case.</dd>
<dd>So having a quote on a page which, say, disagrees with other things on a page is not "quoting out of context". At worst it would be a case of contradiction. And having a quote which other facts disagree with does not make it a "quote out of context" either -- it just means one or the other quotes could be wrong. In this case I think neither is the case, but that's a separate issue.</dd>
<dd>Quoting out of context is the sort of thing you did with the Thorne quote originally, attempting to imply that Thorne believed that Hilbert had priority. In reality, as the whole context of Thorne's work explains, Thorne thought no such thing. As you seem to realize in your many "theories" about why Thorne disagrees with your opinion.</dd>

<dd>That all seems pretty tenuous to me. You're basically saying that on the basis of two pronouns, you think a long and more synthetic approach should be removed. I don't think that's a sound research strategy, sorry. Find a good secondary source that says that Hilbert claimed priority, and we'll consider integrating their point of view in. Otherwise it's not acceptable.

<p>I've reverted the bit about Einstein approving "the patent for the mold for <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toblerone.html" title="Toblerone">Toblerone</a>". Although there are many web pages that claim something of this sort, I am nevertheless somewhat skeptical of this claim.

<dd>Looks false. The <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toblerone.html" title="Toblerone">Toblerone</a> article has a link to the patent, but Einstein's name is not on it. The patent pdf is from toblerone.com. at that site (link above) it says "The TOBLERONE brand is registered with the Federal Institute for Intellectual Property in Bern, and shortly thereafter TOBLERONE becomes the first patented milk chocolate with almonds and honey. The physicist Albert Einstein, barely thirty years old, is employed at the Institute. A few years later, he will become famous for his theory of relativity."

<p>"Important contributions to ... cosmology", looks like an understatement. I think he (almost) originated the study of cosmology by applying GR to the whole Universe. AS far as I know, the only serious cosmology before that was a realisation by someboby that Newton's Universe must be infinite to stop it collapsing under gravity, and the possibly contrary notion that if it were infinite the night sky should be much brighter (you see a star in whatever direction you look).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tone of this article</span></h2>
<p>I have been asked to explain what I think is inappropriate about the tone of this article. I find these questions difficult to answer with examples, because usually in cases like these I will give specific examples, and then those examples will be fixed, and then I will be expected to remove the dispute or cleanup tag even though many more remain. Therefore I will try to explain as generally as possible and give a few examples for illustrative purposes only. I think it's important that we all understand the formal tone that is expected of encyclopedia articles, and when we do, we should be able to improve everything here.</p>
<p>Broadly, this article reads like "hero worship". Certainly, Einstein was a remarkable person, but I think there is an undercurrent of adulation and an overall attempt to emphasize all the amazing things he did. Please understand that I am not criticizing the factual accuracy of this article, but only the method of presentation. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The final lecture <b>climaxed</b> with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity, the Field Equation.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the word "climax" here implies that there was something monumental about his equation.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Einstein's postulation that light can be described not only as a wave with no kinetic energy, but also as massless discrete packets of energy called quanta with measurable kinetic energy (now known as photons) was a landmark break with the classical physics.</i></li>

</ul>
<p>Unclear what this means, but it seems to imply that the generalized theory of gravitation is "unsolved" only due to Einstein's death. Maybe "unfinished" would be better?</p>

Roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using uranium as a weapon, which in a few years was superseded by the Manhattan Project.</i></li>

<p>Someone removed this sentence from the intro: "widely regarded as the greatest scientist of the 20th century", referring to <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>.</p>
<p>I reverted that change. The reason being that I think it's important for our understanding of Einstein's role in the 20th century to note that he is so regarded.</p>
<p>If it were not for the few naysayers like Bjerknes and <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">User:Licorne</a>, I'd remove the qualification and say "is" the greatest scientist of the 20th century. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 21:52, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I removed that phrase, and I think with good reason: it's both weaselly and peacockish. Don't get me wrong; he probably was the century's greatest scientist, and I'd bet he's widely regarded as such. But it doesn't contribute anything to the article to say so (if there's someone who's reading this article who's not familiar with Einstein, well, Wikipedia's not going to convince them of such a bold claim, true or not), and it's not a verifiable claim (or if it is, no one has bothered to provide a source for it). <s>I think <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> et al are irrelevant; how does their presence justify the intentional inclusion of unencyclopedic statements?</s> <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a> 22:16, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't find it weaselish, as it is a rather straightforward, blunt statement. As for <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a>, there's no need to let a style guide take on the role of absolute policy on editing this page.

If you want to remove the phrase, you're going to have to convince us, and just quoting WP:PEACOCK isn't good enough. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 22:45, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You mention the discussion at <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_9b63.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia_talk:Avoid_peacock_terms</a>, but of the four commenters there commenting on the Einstein article, one agrees with you and three with me.</dd>

<dd>Per discussion at <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPeacock_fa49.html" title="WP:Peacock">WP:Peacock</a> I don't see a breakdown of three people saying that you are correct in saying that specific statement about Einstein should be removed. So I find your summary rather suspect. In any case, I still think that discussion points out Einstein as an exception to the general rule of thumb, with tacit agreement by several others. Note in particular, the comment by Stan, with response by ESP.</dd>

<dd>The statement in question is a very useful statement. It points out Einstein's unique role in public consciousness as the greatest scientist of recent times. Your use of "encyclopedic" is rather vague, as Brittanica is even more praising, saying he was "recognized in his own time as one of the most creative intellects in human history". It is not alone. So clearly encyclopedias do say stuff like this, as far as Einstein is concerned. Your additional use of this term in addition to saying it's not useful, is meant to convey some additional point that I am missing. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 01:55, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Clearly we do think that and so does Fastfission. Alvestrand clearly gave a reason, and my comments clearly indicated I believe there is a good rationale for keeping the remark. We're all experienced editors here and to imply that we are not basing our comments on a belief that we are keeping useful content, or that we are somehow arguing to keep unencyclopedic content, is in poor taste. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 02:09, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What did you mean to imply by that comment then? Rather than try to understand why Alvestrand and I would consider the statement useful or encyclopedic, you state that we don't seem to be arguing on that basis. So you basically said we were arguing for something else, while leaving it open as to what that could be.

(I'll admit that I shouldn't have painted you and <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> with the same brush, though; he did give an argument, albeit one that I didn't agree with: "I think it's important for our understanding of Einstein's role in the 20th century to note that he is so regarded." You, however, gave no such argument.) Re-read your comment, and you'll see what I mean. <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a> 15:29, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a pretty strong statement -- to be widely regarded as the greatest (not "a great", mind you, but the superlative form) scientist of the 20th century is a remarkable fact in and of itself. We are not -- and should not -- say whether he was or was not "the greatest" (how would one measure such a thing?) but saying that he is regarded as such is not a problem and, I think, generally true. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:21, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And as a note.. we should not, and do not, say that Einstein <i>is</i> the greatest. That's the peacock phrase. Saying that he is <i>regarded</i> as the greatest is not -- that's a statement about perception, and a significant one. The statement does not intend to convince the reader that he <i>was</i> the greatest -- it is a statement about his status in the minds of others. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:22, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is a somewhat more exceptional situation than the Yankees. We're not talking about some loose sense of fan opinion, we're talking about major publications, the fact that he's probably the only scientist almost everyone knows about, and so forth. As the article explains in a later section, the number of verifiable things enshrining him with that status. Compare it with the opening lines of Encyclopedia Brittanica's article on Einstein: "In the first 15 years of the 20th century, Einstein—recognized in his own time as one of the most creative intellects in human history—advanced a series of theories that proposed entirely new ways of thinking about space, time, and gravitation." --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:49, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the sentence is inappropriate. It's part of the general tone problems in this article that I described above. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 01:13, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the first sentence is appropriate and adds to the article. One of the guiding styles for encyclopedic writing is <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_style.html" title="News style">news style</a>, which is written using the "<a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverted_pyramid.html" title="Inverted pyramid">inverted pyramid</a>" structure. In this style there is a sequence consisting of the first sentence, first paragraph, first section (the lead or <i>lede</i>), etc., with each element giving more detail, but also capable of standing on its own. The idea being that the reader can stop reading at any point and the article would still make sense. So the first sentence should ideally be how you would describe the subject if you had to do it in one sentence. The first paragraph would be what you would write if you could only write one paragraph and so on. If I had to explain who Einstein was, in one short sentence, saying something like <i><b>Albert Einstein</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">March 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a> – <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>) was a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a>-born <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theoretical_physics.html" title="Theoretical physics">theoretical physicist</a> widely regarded as the greatest <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">scientist</a> of the 20th century.</i>, would be my choice. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 04:43, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
