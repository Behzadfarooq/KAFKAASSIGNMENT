<p>Hi. Just FYI I have put up a request for undeletion of this article, which was speedied earlier today (I don't know if it was by you, but you indicated it in the VFD). There is plenty of precedent for Star Trek episode articles, and I feel this was speedied before anyone had a chance to notice it was up for deletion and expand it. There are numerous other episode articles lacking content in this way, but they will be all expanded eventually. Cheers. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:09, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I uploaded the image I didn't notice the discrepancy that the hammer and sickle need to be over europe and africa, I liked the image because it was clear and high-ress. Maybe instead of deleting the image, you could just revert to the other older version (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/6/62/20050319032017%21Soviet_coat_of_arms.png" class="external free" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/6/62/20050319032017%21Soviet_coat_of_arms.png" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/6/62/20050319032017%21Soviet_coat_of_arms.png</a>)? --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerkut_1f38.html" title="User:Berkut">Berkut</a> 01:51, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was a very good catch by AlbertR, when I looked at it for the first time I didn't notice the discrepancy too. I think, that it was one of the revisions (probably before 1958, or after 1971-this is much less likely, as I know it didn't experience major changes after 1971), it would be very interesting to get more inf. on that revision, if this is true.

The image under that name on commons doesn't exist anymore (I can't check if it was the same one, I can't see deleted pages there). By the way, for future reference: images now on commons aren't speedy deletion candidates, it's best to use {{Nowcommons|Image:newfilename}} instead. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 13:41, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So it is, when I checked this afternoon it wasn't there, I might have typoed though. Moved to commons isn't a speedy deletion candidate by the way, you should use the <i>nowcommons</i> template for that. Still, as you're the only person to edit the page, you're entitled to a speedy delete of it, as it would appear has already happenned.</dd>
<dd>On a marginally unrelated note, I notice the version you uploaded to commons is significantly smaller in dimensions than the previous version is. Is that on purpose? --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 23:46, August 31, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No it wasn't on purpose.

<p>Egoless. If we want the wikipedia to be its best we should be egoless. Still, it was an unpleasant shock to see one of my images slated for deletion. I try to be careful, when I create an image, to put an appropriate tag on it. It took me several minutes to determine that this deletion was not due to neglecting to tag the image, but to your idea that your image had rendered mine obsolete. Don't you think that this is something that should be subject to a discussion?</p>
<p>Your image is highly stylized. You eliminated St Pierre and all the other smaller Islands. You eliminated all the fjords. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is a question of aesthetics. Personally, I don't like the approach you chose.</p>
<p>In your image you made the same mistake I did in the first version I created -- you have put some of your text right on top of the boundaries on the map, making it hard to read.</p>
<p>There are guidelines for creating wikipedia maps. My maps don't follow those guidelines in all aspects. There are certain colours that are recommended. The primitive tool I used doesn't make it easy to change colours. But I don't think you used the recommended colors either.</p>
<p>Since I put some effort into this map, and since I think yours uses the silhouette of the shoreline from the one I created, may I suggest that both common sense and common courtesy would suggest that we should have a discussion as to how to replace the image I created with a better image? -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:24, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>AlbertR. I thought that was quite a dramatic picture. As it dates from the 1960s and is widely used on various internet sites, is there any copyright problem concerning it?. I suspect it was a publicity shot done for the airline, which no longer exists.

<p>AlbertR. Thanks for taking the trouble to reply. I have checked into the provenance of the image. It is actually the black &amp; white photograph of a painting commissioned by the airline in 1965. The picture itself was hung in the boardroom of the airline office - although I do not know where it is now. The photograph was widely used for promotional purposes (eg the cover of brouchures and timetables) through to the 70s. I have inserted its URL source on the Image narrative. The term "Fair Use" is a new one on me. But it seems to correspond to the British term "Public Domain". If a picture has been widely used over a number of years, then there is no copyright to it. Am I OK to re-insert the link to the Rhodesia page?. Bob</p>

<p>I believe that your objection to the "minis" image in "Expo 67" is an opinion of based on your own idea of ugliness. I do not think this is sufficient reason for its deletion &amp; have reinstated it once more. Whereas I and several others think that the image underlines the light mode that existed during Expo 67. I hope that this is not going to be a battle of opinions. Regards DonJay</p>

<p>The Wikiproject No Ads, created as a backlash against the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_1-Click_Answers_172e.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/1-Click Answers">Answers.com deal</a>, has served an important function in providing a space for users to express their disagreement with the Foundation proposal. While the current controversies about userboxes raise questions about political and social advocacy on Wikipedia, there should be greater flexibility regarding advocacy <i><b>about</b></i> Wikipedia in the Wikipedia namespace. Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_No_ads_e460.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject No ads">an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether</a>. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed. Until the situation becomes more clear, I believe the group should still have a place in the Wikipedia namespace.

(e.g that Habana Vieja is a Unesco world heritage site).

<p>You recently deleted a clariffication I made containing valuable information regarding the money exchange rates in Cuba, saying that's not necessary...

I see that you make the images all aligned in one line at the left side of the article, while I think it's nicer to place the pictures near their sections, for example the Historical Castle should be in the History section, and the Population graph is really out of context if placed outside of the Population section, Also I don't understand why you reverted the edit I did to the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masmak_Castle_0a4e.html" title="Masmak Castle">Masmak Castle</a> link, I changed the link to link it to it's page and now you changed it back to make it a red link. --<a href="../../../m/u/h/User%7EMuhaidib_851f.html" title="User:Muhaidib"><font color="darkgreen"><b>muhaidib</b>--</font></a> (<sup><a href="../../../m/u/h/User_talk%7EMuhaidib_26fb.html" title="User talk:Muhaidib"><font color="darkgreen">Talk</font></a></sup> | <sub><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki_p&amp;user=Muhaidib" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki_p&amp;user=Muhaidib" rel="nofollow"><font color="darkgreen">#info</font></a></span></sub> | <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg_f071.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/0d/Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg.png" alt="" width="22" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg_f071.html" /></a> ) 16:51, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In deleting the "Trivia" paragraph, you have given the reason as "wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". The Oxford dictionary gives the definition of the word "Encyclopedia" as "Book giving information on many subjects, or on many aspects of one subject." By this definition, your opinion of what constitutes 'indiscriminate' aspects would for many others be considered as important complementary information. You are, therefore, acting as a censor rather than a critic. I therefore request that you do not delete for this reason. I would also suggest that instead of deleting, you edit, preferably by adding material if you feel there is a lack. DonJay 11 July 06</p>

<p>For some reason you decided that your suspicion that the above image was not from a DVD cover was enough reason to put the image up for speedy deletion (using the lack of fair use criteria as a reason does not work, you could easily have written one yourself in the same time it took you to add the speedy tag). Luckily I was around and paying attention and removed the speedy tag before it could get deleted. I scanned the image myself from the DVD cover, why do you not believe me? I stated it right on the image page. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 05:27, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
