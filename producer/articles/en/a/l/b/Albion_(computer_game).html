The data which describes the planet as a desert, however, turns out to be forged. Albion is a world full of life, secrets, surprises, and magic. When Tom Driscoll, the pilot of the reconnaissance team discovers this, he swears to save Albion from Toronto's tentacles.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p><i>Albion</i> is a fantasy role playing game. The gameplay has the basic statistic and level system most RPGs of its time had. To level up, you defeat monsters in battle and gain experience. The non-battle portions of this game are mainly puzzle and conversation based, so there are very few "Give X to get Y" puzzles. You can have up to six characters in your party, led by Tom Driscoll, the only character who stays with you through the entire game.</p>
<p><a name="Battle_system" id="Battle_system"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Battle system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle system</span></h3>
<p>The Battle System in <i>Albion</i> is <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turn-based_game.html" title="Turn-based game">turn-based</a> and takes place on a six-by-six grid similar to a board game. You choose, at the start of each turn, an action for each character to perform: Attack, Move, Cast magic, Use Item, or Flee. There is also an 'Advance Party' option to move all enemies towards you one square. The area in which your characters can move is limited to the bottom two rows. If you have a weapon (or two, in the case of the Iskai) equipped, you can attack. If not, you cannot attack unarmed, unless you are choosing Siobhan.</p>
<p><a name="Navigation" id="Navigation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Navigation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Navigation</span></h3>
<p><i>Albion</i> is one of the few role playing games of its time to use a hybrid system for the navigation of the maps and dungeons. In most parts of the game, the maps are depicted in 2D overhead mode, with full mouse and keyboard control. You can move the party 'train' around with the keyboard and select items to interact with the mouse (so long as you are in fair reach of them). When there are mazes, corridors or even some dungeons, the map is represented in <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_tracing.html" title="Ray tracing">ray traced</a> 3D, akin to <i><a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfenstein_3D_e125.html" title="Wolfenstein 3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></i>. You can still move around with the mouse and/or the keyboard and select items to interact with using the mouse. Some players find this 3D mode off-putting, but thankfully it is in shorter densities than the detailed 2D maps.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Conversations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conversations</span></h3>
<p>Conversations in <i>Albion</i> are handled in two ways: Set Topics and Keywords. The Topics usually signify something you can specifically ask that person, for example the leader of a tribe about an object that only he knows about, or a shopkeeper to show you his or her wares. Keywords are more dynamic and may yield different results to different people. You learn keywords for a particular town by speaking to people about common topics, and gradually you will learn all there is to know in the game just by speaking to people. For example, you can learn some of the native language and culture, some superfluous knowledge about who likes whom, and what kind of drink is preferable.</p>

<p>There are nine playable characters in <i>Albion</i>, all but one of whom must join your party at some point as the plot progresses. In spite of the game's giving the initial impression that Albion is a planet of the Iskai, most of these characters are human. A further division exists between Terran and Albion's Celtic humans.</p>
<p><a name="Human_.28Terran.29" id="Human_.28Terran.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Human (Terran)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Human (Terran)</span></h3>
<p>These are humans from outer space that originated from Earth. Terran humans have no magical ability whatsoever, speak primarily Terran (English or German, most likely German because of the country this game originated from) and have a somewhat extensive knowledge of technology. There are three Terran human characters available to play as in <i>Albion</i> throughout the game: Tom Driscoll, Rainer Hofstedt, and Joe Bernard.</p>
<p><b>Tom Driscoll</b><br />
The protagonist of the game is Tom Driscoll, a Terran pilot who soon after the game's beginning finds himself stranded on a planet that against all expectations is teeming with life. Much of the game's plot revolves around Tom's attempts to locate the landing site of the Toronto. Tom remains in the party at all times; even if he is separated from everyone else, it is him the player will continue to follow. He has no particular special abilities, aside from the ability to use most human-made equipment in the game, whether it be made by Albion's Celts or Terrans, but he has and develops a decent overall combat skill.</p>
<p><b>Rainer Hofstedt</b><br />
One of the two government officials supervising the Toronto, and eventually the only one after the mysterious death of Inspector Beagle, Rainer is a physicist and xenobiologist with an ecological bent. He ends up joining Tom on his exploratory flight on Albion and gets stranded along with him. He reacts to the Iskai and Albion's ecology in general with the wonder of a scientist who not only finds himself with a whole new world to study, but also finds some of his old beliefs and attitudes shaken. Rainer is the most intelligent playable character in the game, often offering insightful and even valuable comments, and has good lock-picking skills, but is also the weakest fighter, a flaw that it seems almost impossible to negate.</p>
<p><b>Joe Bernard</b><br />
Joe is an engineer aboard the Toronto and Tom's old friend. Though he can be met early in the game, he only becomes a playable character after the rediscovery of the spaceship. His strengths mainly reflect his profession; he can offer invaluable advice during adventures that take place within the Toronto, at one point helping the party avoid some of the hardest battles in the game, but his combat ability is essentially limited to his ability to use superior Terran weapons, such as firearms.</p>
<p><a name="Human_.28Celtic.29" id="Human_.28Celtic.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Human (Celtic)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Human (Celtic)</span></h3>
<p>These humans originate from Albion itself (though their mythology speaks of travelling there from far away, apparently magically) and are quite different from the humans you see at the start of the game. Unlike Terran Humans, Celtic Humans are sometimes quite apt at different types of magic – Druidic, the art of magic used by Kenget Kamulos, and a rare art used only by Chosen Ones. They speak Celtic, and some Iskai. There are four Celtic Humans you can play throughout the game: Mellthas, Khunag, Harriet, and Siobhan.</p>
<p><b>Mellthas</b><br />
Mellthas is a young druid living on the traditionally Celtic island of Gratogel. He is deaf and dumb but communicates via written notes; it's still not possible to initiate conversations with NPCs with him as the leader, except in some cases to gain training. He first joins the party to help them find his missing foster father, but soon falls in love with Sira almost in an instant after discovering that he has the more or less unheard-of ability to communicate with her by touching her Trii. Mellthas has a relatively short list of possible spells, most of which are moderately powerful combat spells. They notably include the Banish Demon spells, which when successful will destroy demons at once. His fighting skills are less good.</p>
<p><b>Siobhan</b><br />
Siobhan is a human warrior from Beloveno, a large city on Maini. She will join the group if asked to, but uniquely of all the playable characters has no bearing on the plot and is purely optional. Once arriving at Beloveno, the player essentially has the choice between recruiting Siobhan or Khunag, the latter of whom will be required later on regardless. Siobhan is the strongest of all the characters and the only one capable of using the most powerful non-magical (and non-Terran) human weapons.</p>
<p><b>Khunag</b><br />
A former high-ranking member of the militant Druidic sect Kenget Kamulos, Khunag is a dark, brooding wizard (an Oqulo Kamulos) currently living in Beloveno. He has been exiled from Khamulon, the city of the Kenget, but will join the party either when they need a guide to said city late in the game, or at any earlier point after he has been first encountered. He is physically weak but has the most powerful array of combat-related spells in the game, though many of these cannot be obtained very soon. Almost all of his spells concentrate on dealing damage. Khunag comes across as somewhat amoral but not entirely disloyal.</p>
<p><b>Harriet</b><br />
Harriet is a young member of the Dji Cantos, or Enlightened Ones, dispatched by said group to help Tom's party in their quest. She does this mainly by allowing them to travel instantly from one island or continent to another with the help of a magic item she carries. She has the shortest spell list of all the characters who have any, mainly consisting of the most effective healing spells in the game but also including the most difficult and powerful combat spell available, which if successful destroys every opponent instantly.</p>
<p><a name="Iskai" id="Iskai"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Iskai">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Iskai</span></h3>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../i/s/k/Iskai.html" title="Iskai">Iskai</a></i></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Iskai resemble humanoid cats in design and are tall, slender beasts. Though called <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammals.html" title="Mammals">mammals</a> in spite of living on another planet, they have a few physiological features that differ noticeably from all species of Earth mammals, such as an emphatic/telepathic forehead organ called a Trii and bony "claws" between their toes rather than at the end of them. They most likely originate from Nakiridaani (a jungle island) and inhabit Srimalinar and Jirinaar – two Iskai cities. Unlike Celtic or Terran humans, they have their own created culture and history, which is quite rich and explored within the first part of Albion. Iskai have two forms of magic: Dji-Fadh (Architecture and Building), and Dji-Kas (Nature Controlling). The Dji-Fadh guild is much older than the Dji-Kas guild. There is also a rank of Iskai warriors called the Stiriik. There are two Iskai characters you can play as: Sira and Drirr.</p>
<p><b>Drirr</b><br />
Drirr is an Iskai warrior originally from the continent called Maini, but first encountered working as a Stiriik in Jirinaar. He joins Tom and Rainer initially to help them in solving a murder in which they are implicated simply because the act was carried out by a human, but continues to travel with them afterwards. He is very fast and stronger than most humans (Iskai tend to be faster but weaker than humans), and arguably the best fighter in the game, though it's somewhat difficult to find him good equipment since he is limited to using Iskai weapons and armour. He is shown as somewhat curious and impulsive, once to the point of it being detrimental to the party.</p>
<p><b>Sira</b><br />
A young, red-headed female Iskai, Sira is the daughter of Akiir, the head of the Dji-Fadh guild. Against her father's wishes, she has chosen to study the rival Dji-Kas branch of magic. After an unpleasant incident related to this old tension, she chooses to travel with Tom's party to get away from it all for the time being. Sira has the most varied list of spells that she can learn of anyone in the game, including some that freeze enemies immobile, thus potentially temporarily removing dangerous opponents from the battle and making them some of the most effective spells in the game. As a Dji-Kas mage, she must use a seed of the Triifalai plant every time she casts a spell, but these are found by the hundreds in several places so this is unlikely to be a problem. She also becomes a decent hand-to-hand fighter with experience, though it's even more difficult to find good equipment for her than to Drirr. Sira's personality seems to be kind, caring and thoughtful. Early on, she develops a special bond with Mellthas.</p>
