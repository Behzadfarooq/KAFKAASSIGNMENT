<p>The "tropics" section is flawed. Many factors control surface temperature, particularly those associated with vegetation. I find fault with the statement "When Brazilian ranchers cut down dark, tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount" as the lack of evapo-transpiration after forest is removed may have far more control over surface temperature than a change in albedo. The statement should be supported with a reference or should be removed.23:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This page looks weird to me. Some of it is definitely rubbish: the arctic ice stuff (there is no SW in winter...). Is anybody very fond of this page...? [WMC]</p>
<p>(<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 19:55, 15 Sep 2003 (UTC)) OK, no-one spoke up, so I've started stripping out stuff that looks especially dodgy to me, and putting it here (note: stuff left is not necessarily OK, just less obviously not). If anyone thinks I've been unreasonably harsh, please feel free to revert, or perhaps better make comments on a per-para basis. I've put comments on what I've removed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The albedo of an object can be used to help determine its <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical.html" title="Chemical">chemical</a> composition. Every <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecule.html" title="Molecule">molecule</a> of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Composition by albedo? Really?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">sun</a>. The reverse is true in <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">desert</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropic.html" title="Tropic">tropical</a> climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apart from local stuff, like painting houses white (not mentioned here) I can't see any evidence for that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The difference would most likely be more than 17°C (30°F) if the landscape of the rainforest was <a href="../../../w/h/i/White.html" title="White">white</a> instead of dark <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">green</a>. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Kilimanjaro_7d9e.html" title="Mount Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a> in <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, which is located in an area well described as "steaming jungle". But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27°C (81°F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1°C (2°F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5°C (41°F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7°C (20°F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaiian</a> <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcano</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauna_Loa_a957.html" title="Mauna Loa">Mauna Loa</a>, which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4°C (40°F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here we have a long chain of unsupported assumptions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10°C (14°F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1°C (2°F) gives 6°C (42°F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23°C (74°F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25°C (77°F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1°C (2°F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Err?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11°C (20°F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Err, both are very wet, but above it sez that Hawaii is drier.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70°N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70°N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13°C (55°F). Given a lapse rate of 1°C (2°F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2°C (35°F). In fact, 1°C (2°F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12°C (10°F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17°C (2°F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1°C (2°F) lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 1°C (2°F) per 1000 feet lapse rate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More imaginary lapse rates. Or am I being too harsh?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2°C (28°F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1°C (31°F).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is confused.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not albedo</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Rewrites near this bit</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More kind of wurbly stuff removed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Keep to the subject...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8°C (15°F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This wanders of into GW, which doesn't fit here. I've added a much simplified and shorter version to the page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps, but not very albedo-relevant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Albedo and frequency. There seems to be little mention of the fact that albedo is frequency dependent and objects which are white in visible light, (i.e. reflective), can be black (i.e. not reflective) in infra red, and so on for other frequencies. Most of the sun's energy comes to us as infra red heat. This means that apparent large changes in visible reflection are not necessarily significant in the main part of the spectrum. Someone said above that a molucule (or atom) has albedo, but this is highly frequency selective and is misleading if gross energy balances are being inferred in relation to global warming. For example it is often said that snow and crystals of ice have very high albedo, which is true in visible light, but they absorb at lower frequencies, otherwise, why would all the snow melt in summer?ProfSWback 16:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While you're obviously right that albedo is frequency dependent (although not <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bond_albedo.html" title="Bond albedo">Bond albedo</a>, which depends rather on the spectrum of the incident light), the sun's energy output IS highest in visible light which is the most energetically significant part of the Solar spectrum.

<dd>Certainly needs ref because, as I understand it, when tropical forest is removed it is often replaced quite rapidly by pasture, which corresponds to an increase in albedo.

<p>I think it is not a good definition but it is also misleading to say light is electromagnetic radiation because it is only part of the spectrum.

<p>..but I read once that some climatologists said that if they plant about 10,000 trees in the ever-sunny steaming-hot San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, that it could lower the average temperature of the Valley by several degrees, as the Valley's concrete sidewalks are reflecting the sunlight and heating up the air for several meters above the surface. So- which is right? or, is it that the trees will provide shade, heating up themselves to provide cooler air at the surface? I'm confused. - <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Shalov_5a29.html" title="User:Eric Shalov">Eric</a> 00:10, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not albedo, Eric. While a small amount of the energy is used in photosynthesis, evapotranspiration would be the major cause of the cooling. Concrete and asphalt pavement reflect relatively little, the heating of the air is mainly due to conductive transfer. It takes about 600 calories of heat energy to change 1 gram of liquid water into a gas.(DW 20061231) 68.151.34.107 21:45, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first paragraph should be in plain English for the many non-scientists who will read it. I don't have the expertise to be sure I write it correctly, but here's a draft idea:</p>
<p>Now it says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Albedo is the ratio of reflected to incident electromagnetic radiation power. It is a unitless measure indicative of a surface's or body's reflectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think most readers will not understand "incident", "electromagnetic radiation power", or "unitless", or the way these things tie together. Suggested revision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Albedo is a measure of how much electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) a surface reflects. When electromagnetic energy, such as light, hits a surface, such as a window or a mirror, it must either pass into the surface or be reflected. For example, when light hits a typical mirror, almost all the light is reflected; thus the mirror's albedo is high. When light hits a typical window, almost all the light passes through; thus the window's albedo is low. Most surfaces both reflect and absorb; for example, there are two way mirrors, and a window both allows sunlight through and reflects it -- you can see the glare.</p>

<p>Albedo describes what proportion of electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) a surface reflects. When electromagnetic energy, such as light, hits a surface, such as a window or a mirror, it must either pass through the surface or be reflected.

<dd>Thanks. One more try below: The first sentence omits all but essential terminology; it's a little less precise but the interested reader can find plenty of detail further down the page. Also, I tried to remove a possible point of confusion (the angle of the light hitting the window) by widening the range of the proportion of light absorbed ("almost all" -&gt; "most"); I hope that addresses your concern. Overall, do you know enough to say it's technically correct? It looks good to me, but 'I don't know what I don't know', as they say ...
<dl>
<dd>The term Albedo describes how reflective a surface is when electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) hits it. When electromagnetic energy, such as light, encounters a surface, such as a window or a mirror, the energy must either pass through the surface or be reflected. For example, when light hits a typical mirror, almost all the light is reflected; thus the mirror's albedo is high. When light hits a typical window, most light passes through; thus the window's albedo is low. Most surfaces both reflect and absorb electromagnetic energy; for example, there are two way mirrors, and a window both allows some sunlight through and reflects the rest -- the glare that you see is the reflection.</dd>

<dd>Hi, you know I strongly think that the first sentence should be informative. Otherwise you get lots of words and no meaning. I agree that jargon should be watched out for, but "measure" and "proportion" are not particularly scary words. At least once we're in the full encyclopedia and not in interwiki:simple. I've put almost your original opening sentence back in.</dd>
<dd>Reading it all again, I was also struck that the comparison between mirrors and windows was a bit academic - most common materials absorb just as much or more than they transmit or reflect. When light hits a surface it can do one of <i>three</i> things: be reflected, go through, or be absorbed. I've tried to take this into account below.</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Albedo is a measure of what proportion of electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) a surface reflects. When electromagnetic energy, such as light, encounters a surface, such as a window or a mirror, the energy must either be absorbed, pass through the surface, or be reflected. For example, when light hits a mirror or white sheet of paper, almost all the light is reflected; thus their albedo is high. When light hits a dull black object or a cave entrance, it does not come out; hence their albedos are low. A window is interesting in that when light hits it head on, most light passes through and the window's albedo is low, but when light hits the same window at a grazing angle it acts partly like a mirror, and its albedo becomes high. Most common surfaces act as some combination of the above behaviours.</dd>

<dd>(I revised the following post. If you want to see the original version, look in the history, but at this point it's just spam so I removed it):</dd>
<dd>The first sentence looks good. I realize we're unnecessarily complicating our intro to Albedo by also discussing the behavior of light: Whether the light is transmitted or absorbed, albedo is still reduced, so let's cut out the light discussion (I'll linkify terms so readers can look them up) and phrase it in terms of albedo: 'Is it reflected or not?' With the transmit/absorb issue removed, I think a window and mirror are the simplest examples (I tried snow and asphalt, but I know people who have never seen snow, much less understand its reflective qualities. People intuitively understand mirrors and windows -- their purposes are to reflect and transmit).
<dl>
<dd>Albedo is a measure of what proportion of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.html" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic energy</a> (e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a>) a surface <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reflection_%28physics%29.html" title="Reflection (physics)">reflects</a>. When electromagnetic energy, such as light, encounters a surface, such as a mirror or a window, the surface reflects some of the energy. For example, when light hits a mirror, most of the light is reflected and thus the mirror's albedo is high. When light hits a window, little light is reflected and thus the window's albedo is low. Few surfaces reflect all light or no light: For example, even windows reflect some light and thus you can see a glare.</dd>

I think our definition may not be technically correct. The following is from the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reflectivity.html" title="Reflectivity">Reflectivity</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That part of incident light that is reflected from a body of water is specular and is calculated by the Fresnel equations. Fresnel reflection is directional and therefore does not contribute significantly to albedo which is primarily diffuse reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am curious why specular reflection contributes less to albedo, but I don't think this is the forum. I'm more concerned with how to define albedo properly. The definition in the current Abledo article also seems wrong (assuming the Reflectivity article is correct), since it doesn't distinguish between different kinds of reflection.
