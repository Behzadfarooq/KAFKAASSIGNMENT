<p>I don't like categories, and I am boycotting them. Most of the images you can already get from the links I posted above. The rest you can probably get by following the articles listed at: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Albania-related_articles_77cf.html" title="List of Albania-related articles">List of Albania-related articles</a>. You can find a lot of images on the German Wikipedia (I don't edit much there, but I have seen images when I've followed the interwiki links from the English articles). Shnet. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDori_37a5.html" title="User talk:Dori">Talk</a> 02:09, Dec 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you please help just with this category. It becomes so much easier to have all the images regarding Albania, and plus that I need all this image for the swedish wiki where I have made over 130 articles in only about 15 days, and now I need image to my articles. Keep on with the good word Dori! --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 12:33, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm, I didn't know about him.

<p>Since they were the same article, I decided to translate the entire thing. I did this in one shot, so excuse any potential mistranslations or mistakes. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDori_37a5.html" title="User talk:Dori">Talk</a> 19:48, Jan 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the translation. You have done a very good jobb and should remain being instruktive person. I have my self contributed with an article to the english wiki regarding the "Origin &amp; history of the name" that you can find at article <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a> if you intressted.

<p>From Dr. Moikom Zeqo, Director of The National History Museum, Defense Magazine, 4 August 2003</p>
<p>While searching in the archives of the National History Museum, I found an extraordinary document by any means. Over a strong piece of cardboard there was a picture of the space craft Apolo 14, a photograph taken from the surface of the Moon. Alongside this photograph there was a small Albanian flag. Immediately under the photograph was the following writing: Antares at fra mauro, while further below the caption read: This flag was carried to the moon onboard Apollo 14 January 31 through February 9, 1971. It is presented by Rear Admiral Alan B. Shepard, Jr., United States Navy, delegate to the 26th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>From this writing it was learned that the (official) Albanian flag was taken to the Moon aboard the space craft Apolo 14 from 31 January until 9 February 1971. This flag was presented by vice Admiral Alan B. Shepard Jr., of the Navy of the United States of America, who was a delegate of the 26th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Antares was the part of the craft that landed on the Moon and Fra Mauro was the name of the lunar landing place. There is also a handwritten message on black ink from Alan Shepard that reads: With the compliments of the astronautes of the United States. Alan Shepard 02.10.71, that translates into Albanian: Me fjalët me të mira të astronautëve të Shteteve të Bashkuara. Alan Shepard, 2 Tetor 1971. This document that holds the Albanian flag with the photograph on the Moon, together with the writings, was handed over to an Albanian diplomat by Alan Shepard himself, who also took part in the 26th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Alan Shepard, when he prepared this gift to also show authenticity, has written by hand the salutation not only from himself, but also from the other astronauts of the USA. This means that the fact of the carrying of the Albanian flag was the theme of a discussion of the fellow astronauts. Thus Shepard had talked to them of his Albanian origin. The gesture of Shepard is majestic.</p>
<p>While reading a space encyclopedia where yearly names of astronouts are found, we read the following information for Alan Shepard. He was born in East Dery, New Hampshire of the USA on 18 November 1923. He is of Albanian origin. He completed the Naval Academy in Anapolis where he completed a flying school for non-military pilots. Later he also completed the Marine School for pilots in Patuxent, Maryland, as well as the Naval School of War in New Port, Rhode Island on 1958. On 1961, the Russian Yuri Gagarin was the World's first man to be lifted into space. He flied in space as a passenger, while Shepard piloted the space craft during the Apolo 14 mission on January-February 1971. As an astronaut, he was the first American to fly in space, and the fifth to have set foot on the Moon. Before retiring, Shepard was promoted to Admiral. He died on 21 July 1998; thus living to the age of 75.</p>
<p>In the same enciclopedia, there was an entry for William Gregory, another Albanian-American astronaut. Gregory was born in Lock-port, New York on 14 May 1957. His origins are from the village of Dardhë in Korçë. On 1979 he graduated as an engineer from the Air Force Academy. He completed his doctorate as a mechanical engineer from Columbia University on 1980 and the doctorate for director (?) on 1984. During the years 1981 - 1986 he was a flying pilot on the FL11. He later served as a pilot instructor on the British Air Force. He has flied on over 40 kinds of airplanes and he has surpassed 5000 hours of flying. He was selected by NASA on January 1990 and he was declared an astronaut on July 1991. He completed his first flight in space of the Shuttle STS-67 on 2 March 1995 from the Kennedy Space Center, and he landed on Earth on 19 March 1995. He set the space flying record with 16 days and 15 hours while completing 262 trips around the Earth. He flied over 11 million km in space, has more than 400 hours of space flying experience alongside his 5000 hours as a pilot. He now works as a directory for the development of business (?) in Arizona, USA. While Shepard has died, we hope to meet Gregory soon. These two names have their own place in the Museum of Nation History and in the memory of Albanians.</p>

<p>Hello. Please don't remove or change the VfD notice inserted in some articles, as you have done in Albanau Community and European Forum. The notice is important so that users who find the articles can be aware of the VfD vote and have their say in it. If the vote result is to keep the article, the VfD notice will be removed.

<p>Hey, what's up. I have no problems with you posting arguments for the Illyrian-Albanian idea, but it would help everybody if you took more time with your arguments and got real references for them. Whoever is on the side of truth will win. Decius 02:04, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To second RickK's comments, please don't do that again. You blanked it, then moved the article to Testttttttttttttt and then to Testttttttttttt, then asked for it to be deleted as your test. It took a good deal of time to look back through the history, figure out what you had done, and then move the article back and delete the extra redirects. In the future, if you wish an article to be deleted, please follow procedures and list in <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">Votes for deletion</a> like everybody else does.
