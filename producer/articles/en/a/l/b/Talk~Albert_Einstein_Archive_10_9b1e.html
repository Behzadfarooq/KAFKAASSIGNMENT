<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nationalities</span></h2>
<p>The very first sentence clearly needs cleanup. It now says: Einstein "was a German-born Jewish-American Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist". What kind of spin doctor wrote this sentence that is misleading in so many ways? Einstein's <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> certificate mentions only <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where he did all his important scientific work. He did not conduct any important science in the US. So the association "American Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist" seems funny indeed. True, he got <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> citizenship when he was an old man, but even then he remained <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a>. In fact, he held <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a> nationality longer than any other (oddly, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> is not even mentioned in the introduction). Similarly, why call him Jewish-American but not Jewish-German, Swiss-Jewish etc? Mixing up religions and nations is making things even worse, IMHO, and although he was <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>-born, he was not a practising Jew. Since <b>Einstein despised patriotism</b>, I suggest to remove all the nationalities etc. from the first paragraph. There is a reasonable section on citizenships further down. But if for some reason this proposal does not get accepted, then we will have to correct the list of nationalities by extending it. For example, it would not be wrong but cumbersome to write that Einstein was a <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a>-born (1878), <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> (1878-96, 1914-33), <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stateless.html" title="Stateless">stateless</a> (1896-1901), <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a> (1901-55), <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> (1940-55) theoretical physicist who won a physics <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in 1921. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicists_3d25.html" title="User:Physicists">Physicists</a> 17:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We went through this at some length in the now-archived sections of this talk page <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbert_Einstein_Archive_9_3117.html#Opening_Line:_Jewish-German-Swiss-American_scientist.3F" title="Talk:Albert Einstein/Archive 9">Opening Line: Jewish-German-Swiss-American scientist?</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbert_Einstein_Archive_9_3117.html#Jewishness" title="Talk:Albert Einstein/Archive 9">Jewishness</a>. The consensus (if I read it correctly) was that he should be labeled as “German-born” (or perhaps as “German-born American” or “German-American”) for consistency with other Wikipedia bios and that he should not be labeled as “Jewish” or “Swiss.” The text that you found was not the work of any one editor but rather the result of editing drift. (BTW it’s customary to start a new topic at the bottom of the talk page.) --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 21:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But what kind of "consensus" or "consistency" could possibly have led to the deletion of the nationality that he held until his death and longer than any other? He was <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a> during his last 55 years. He was <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> during his final 15 years (but did not produce any important science during this time). Clearly his "Swissness" totally dominates the additional "Americanness" of the retirement years. Your answer seems to indicate this kind of "consistency" is distorting other Wikipedia articles as well - but then let's correct them as quickly as possible! I understand that many nations want to claim a share of <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>, but Wikipedia is not the place to warp <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a> through <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a> or something. I sincerely hope this was not some sort of 40:1 majority "consensus" reflecting the fact that the Americans outnuber the Swiss 40:1! Let facts be our guide, not wishful thinking. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicists_3d25.html" title="User:Physicists">Physicists</a> 19:15, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That opening sentence was getting so silly that I felt obliged to clean it up. There is already a Citizenship section later in the article. "German-born" is relevant for explaining why the German pronunciation of the name (seen just before the subject sentence) is relevant. The parenthetical birth year after "German-born" was not needed, as it had just been given in the text immediately preceding. — DAGwyn 21:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. And with regard to Einstein's Swiss-ness: <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicists_3d25.html" title="User:Physicists">User:Physicists</a> seems to confuse nationality with citizenship. As Gordon Freeman said in the archive I cited above, “he certainly did not identify with the Swiss land, its people, nor its culture and customs to the extent which would equally qualify it worth of a mention.” (If he had, he could have safely spent his last ten years in Switzerland.) --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 21:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Funny Spin-Doctored Microsoft Encarta Article</span></h3>
<p>I think I found the source of the misleading statements discussed above - it is the Encarta Encyclopedia of Microsoft! See <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I couldn't help smiling when I read its first sentence: "Albert Einstein (1879-1955), German-born American physicist and Nobel laureate." They simply ignored that his Nobel Prize mentions only <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/" class="external autonumber" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, that he was <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a> for most of his life, that he was an old man when he added the US citizenship to the Swiss one, and that he did not do any important physics in the US. Alas, the pride of nations! I wonder whether other Microsoft Encarta articles are similarly spin-doctored. Fortunately, in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> such reality distortions can be undone, illustrating the superiority of Wikipedia's approach to fact finding. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicists_3d25.html" title="User:Physicists">Physicists</a> 20:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dunno - did he take a test? I doubt it. Otherwise we'd just be guessing. And guesses don't make this page or any other. He would likely have scored very highly in certain tests though not necessarily have done very well (comparatively) on general IQ tests which often stress linguistic skills as highly as reason and mental manipulation. It would also have depended when he took his test. He would likely have scored better as a young man. In addition, accurate IQ testing is a notoriously tricky. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 22:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recall long ago seeing somebody's estimate that it was around 200, but there are several things wrong with that; unless a reliable <i>measurement</i> of Einstein's IQ is cited, it shouldn't be inserted into the article. IQ isn't much of a measure of anything relevant anyway, especially in the "tails" of the distribution. — DAGwyn 00:32, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We've been over this before. A google for "einstein greatest scientist" gives 11 million hits. Google book search gives 7080 hits. "Widely regarded" isn't a weasel word in this case; it's true. "is the greatest scientist" would need a specific reference to someone who's an authority on measuring scientists' stature, and would be a magnet for all the Einstein-bashers that regularly make maintaining this article such a pain in the posterior.</dd>
<dd>If you want a place to put "widely held beliefs about Einstein" (the other common one is that his name has become a synonym for "genius"), feel free to start typing in those 7000+ references - but NOT in the Einstein article, please. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 06:12, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">And now a timeline?</span></h2>
<p>I thought the infobox was ugly, but I wasn't prepared for this:</p>
<hr />
<p><map name="6a2392c70d5e9e952fa585d7f2c2fe73"></map><img usemap="#6a2392c70d5e9e952fa585d7f2c2fe73" src="../../../upload/timeline/6a2392c70d5e9e952fa585d7f2c2fe73.png" /></p>
<p><br />
Is there any reason to include an ugly and cumbersome timeline at the bottom of the page? I don't think it helps the article out one bit. It is unbearably foul looking (nothing like poorly kerned Helvetica to ruin a page), and most of the dates added are unbearably dull (all of the ones of note are already well known and well-discussed in the article; some of them are down-right pointless, like when he was in grade school and when he stuck his tongue out for a camera—the most interesting thing about the latter is <i>not</i> the year in which it took place).</p>
<p>Just because one <i>can</i> do something with a computer does not mean that one <i>should</i>, and while timelines <i>may</i> have their place in other articles where it is actually useful to plot out ten different things relevant to each other, it certainly does little good <i>here</i>. A sure-sign that a timeline is useless is when it looks like a descending staircase; it fails at its only benefit, which is to show concurrent events, when the events follow in a linear fashion (as they usually do with someone's life, time-travellers excepted).</p>
<p>In the end I don't think one gains any greater insight from it, and it is, I do repeat, unbearably ugly (the fault of the software, mind you, not whoever made it, who I'm sure had good intentions).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Einstein's brain</span></h2>
<p>I'm a bit confused, as the section talking about the autopsy reports significant differences in the make-up of Einstein's brain and a normal brain, yet under "Speculation and controversy" it says that no significant differences have ever been found. Can one or the other be cited, and the other removed? 69.175.66.113 12:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This may be moot now, but I believe that the "Speculation and controversy" section mentions the lack of brain differences in connection to his mental health. I'm not a neuroscientist, but I am fairly sure from my elementary knowledge that the lobe irregularity is interesting since Einstein was a brilliant mathematician, and that part of his brain was enlarged. And the higher number of glial cells has an effect on fundamental brain chemistry as a sort of helper cell to the neurons. Regardless, neither of these irregular aspects of Einstein's brain can be connected to a specific disorder, such as those listed in that section. Perhaps the article could say that better, but I'm not comfortable adding to an excellent featured article with information that is implied. I'm not sticking around to watch if someone else does, either. Cheers, 69.19.14.15 22:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NY Times ad</span></h2>
<p>The segment dealing with Einstein's participation in the December 2nd, 1948 NYT ad regarding Menachem Begin's Freedom Party is highly misleading as it currently stands:</p>
<p><br />
<i>He also purchased a full-page ad in the New York Times condemning early Zionists for their treatment of the indigenous Arabs, especially at Deir Yassin (New York Times ad).</i></p>
<p><br />
For one, Einstein didn't purchase the ad; he just signed it, along with many other notables of the time, including Hannah Arendt and Rabbi Cardozo. Moreover, it's quite overly broad to suggest that the petitioners condemned the early Zionists as a whole for their supposed mistreatment of the indigenous popuation, since the text of the letter makes quite clear that its animus is specifically directed at Begin and the Freedom Party.</p>
<p>In fact, it also discusses the dangers the paramilitary groups which were the party's predecessors posed to the Jewish community in Palestine as well:</p>
<p><br />
<i>During the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and</i> Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.</p>
<p><br />
There's no evidence the authors of the ad believed the early Zionists were abusing the local Arab populations on a general basis.</p>

 Hi  Mr. Price,  
 What's wrong with referencing Block_Time ?
 Einstein said his belief in " universal causation "
 ( which, by the way, is shared by people like 
   Stephen Hawking )
 means the future is just as fixed as the past.
     Where do you think the term Block_Time
 came from, if not from descriptions of
 the field equations of General_Relativity ?
 Stephen Hawking wrote:
     In relativity,  
 there is no real distinction between
 the space and time coordinates, just as there is
 no difference between two space coordinates.
 ...
 In summary, the title of this essay was a question:
   Is_Everything_Determined ?
 The answer is yes, it is.  
 But it might as well not be, because
 we can never know what is determined.
 ...
 The boundary condition of the universe is that
 it has no boundary.
 The universe would be completely self-contained 
 and not affected by anything outside itself.
      It would neither be created nor destroyed.
 It would just _Be_. 
 What place, then, for a creator ?

<dd>Please stop inserting your special-interest point of view into the Einstein article. I am quite familiar with what Einstein's technical writings — and he did not mention "block time" nor "pseudorandomness" (which term you are misapplying, by the way, as others have told you). While you might <i>think</i> you know ideas from other sources that Einstein would agree with, an <i>encyclopedia</i> article about Einstein's ideas needs to limit itself to what Einstein verifiably said himself. Further, the place where you inserted the block-time note (re. determinism) disrupted the flow of the surrounding context. It brought in a bunch of ideas "out of the blue" and thereby raised more questions than it provided answers. — DAGwyn 22:17, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

 Hi  DAGwyn,
 Why are references to spatial time,
 spacetime, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_time.html" title="Block time">Block time</a>, 4D time,
 ( whatever you want to call it )
 unmentionable ? not even in 3 lines ?

 " universal causality "  was central to
 Einstein's religious and scientific philosophy.

<dd>Your addition to the Einstein article is a <i>fraud</i>, because you claim that it is Einstein's point of view without any documentary evidence to back up that specific claim. And being merely somebody else's ideas about space-time or randomness, it certainly does <i>not</i> belong in the article about Einstein. It also damages the coherence of the discussion about determinism to insert a bunch of alien references and neologisms there. Further, we <i>have</i> answered your legitimate questions several times; we didn't respond to the query about evolution because it was based on false premises and is not relevant to the matter at hand. I would match my intelligence, rationality, credentials, and depth of understanding of (and support for) relativity theory against yours any day. What you need to do, but seem uninclined to do, is to critically examine your own motives in repeatedly vandalizing the Einstein article.

<dd>Obviously several other editors disagree with you on the appropriateness of the change you keep trying to make. Since there is no consensus for the change, and no pressing need for any change in that area, the appropriate default action is to leave the previous text the way it is. It isn't even important to debate the truth of the insertion, just to understand that this particular change is not acceptable. You especially should not try to guess about our motivations (which you're getting completely wrong), which we have explained already but which really don't matter when it comes to the advisability of the editing. If the editing made something (which was relevant and undisputed by other experts) clearer to the general reader, then it would be a good idea and we would presumably be all for it.

<dd>Jeff, Wikipedia's content is determined by the consensus of editors. Individual editors who persist on "setting the record straight" against the will of others are highly frowned upon. We have a few core content policies which govern what can appear on pages, one of the clearest is that no original research or analysis is allowed. What you are doing is putting a highly idiosyncratic and personalized interpretation of Einstein's views into the article, and this is against our policies. Either start citing some sources which actually purport to discuss Einstein's philosophical views (and not in passing, but directly) or you might as well take your one-man Einstein show back to Usenet. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 20:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Indent citations</span></h2>
<p>In other articles, it has been noted that citations to webpages should be expanded as footnotes that include the author/group, title, and date of a reference, so in case the webpage expires in a few months, the reference can still be hunted by title or author, perhaps found on other webpages or in print journals. The problem caused by expanding most citations to have author/title/date is that the citations can become huge within a sentence and clutter the text of the article, unless formatted to avoid the "mass-of-text" appearance. I have found that ref-tag footnotes can be indented (with restrictions), similar to a block-structured <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a>, to improve readability of all the added details, without totally obscuring the original sentence with a "mass of text" about the cited author/webpage/publication. The following is an example of an indented ref-tag (where "ref-tag" will be "ref" in the actual citation):</p>

<p>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The main restriction is to never split a bracketed link "[xx yy]" across 2 lines using a carriage-return newline (or the link could appear as unlinked text); however, each separate text line (after carriage-return) can be indented (such as by 5 spaces), similar to a computer <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a> where each line has a carriage-return. Also, the lead ref-tag cannot be separated by a blank line from the prior sentence phrase, or the Wiki-formatted line will split. There is no reason to impose a standard indentation: it could vary, throughout an article, such as indenting the author name by 5 spaces, or 7, with no strict limit. Indented ref-tags can make it bearable to have a dozen footnotes in a paragraph without appearing, internally, as a complex mass of text. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 06:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many physicists detest his work as not proven. Gianni</p>
<ul>
<li>There are detractors to every major theory in science. However as far as deeming Einstein's work "controversial" in a scientific sense, that's about as reliable as saying that Darwin's work is "controversial" in a scientific sense. It is not "controversial" like string theory is controversial, where there are indeed many mainstream practitioners who have their doubts over it. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:20, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually Einstein's work is not really controversial among professional physicists. Special relativity is part of the working toolkit of particle physics and quantum field theory. The only widely accepted theory of gravitation is still Einstein's, and modern cosmology depends on it. There is a general consensus that Einstein's efforts toward a unified field theory were unfruitful and that his criticism of the incompleteness of quantum physics was puzzling, yet work proceeds today even in those areas, albeit from a somewhat different perspective. —DAGwyn 06:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The predictions of his relativity theories accord with the observations to great (and increasing) accuracy. Though all theories are in some sense provisional (or physics would stop), this accord is what is colloquially meant by "proven" in physics. Because his theories come into their own at speeds and gravitational field strengths far greater than those in which human intuition is schooled, his work probably will always be controversial. For instance it is not easy to accept that a clock flown round the world in a fast jet will return showing very slightly behind one kept stationary with which it had been synchronised. It is no coincidence that the cleverest anti-relativity arguments are by engineers, who have the best developed Newtonian intuition of all. (I mean this as a compliment!) But their arguments always somewhere involve a subtle Newtonian assumption. There are also differences of viewpoint; Einstein worked out general relativity as a theory of curved space, but it can also be derived from gauging considerations as a flat-space theory with a different interpretation. Since no testable predictions differ, this is a matter of taste. What counts is that the equations accurately predict values measured in the experiments, and no other set of equations does. To derive those equations for the first time was one of the greatest feats in theoretical physics, perhaps the greatest. The equations work, and whether people like or detest them tells you more about their own outlook. As for his unified field investigations, he would be the first to agree they are not proven, because they did not really get as far as generating clear predictions. This work is not detested but ignored today, because physicists prefer other lines of attack. - AG, Stockport, UK.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to the unified field theory work, much of it wasn't done with the expectation of producing new predicted physical behavior, but was rather an attempt to derive the already accepted "laws" from a single unifying principle. Einstein and Infeld did manage to show that trajectories of singularities of their (circa 1950) theory were consistent with particle trajectories known from conventional physics, although the significance of that is arguable. The main reason for general lack of interest in such work is that it didn't seem likely to incorporate quantum principles, which most physicists believe to be fundamental. — DAGwyn 20:10, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The aim of unification is not merely aesthetic, but to improve prediction. Quantum effects are ignored - which must lead to inaccurate prediction - in general relativity, and vice-versa. I agree that you can't hope to ignore quantum when attempting unification. - AG, Stockport, UK.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Good Theories</span></h2>
<p><i>Although he maintained that the only source of knowledge is experience, he also believed that scientific theories are the free creations of a finely tuned physical intuition and that the premises on which theories are based cannot be connected logically to experiment. A good theory, therefore, is one in which a minimum number of postulates is required to account for the physical evidence. This sparseness of postulates, a feature of all Einstein’s work, was what made his work so difficult for colleagues to comprehend, let alone support.</i> <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Perhaps someone could add this information to the section on his scientific philosophy. --68.224.247.234 21:52, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Putting "Jewish" back in the opening sentence.</span></h2>
<p>I know this topic has been discussed at a pretty good length, but I'd like to revisit it for a bit because I don't think any the following arguments have been made. Initially I made these comments in one of the talk page archives, I'm afraid, so I'm reproducing them here and expanding on them a bit. (Thanks to TEB728 for pointing out my error.)</p>
<p>I would argue that his Jewish ancestry is on a level in significance with his being German-born, and that noting his German origin without mentioning his Jewish ancestry is confusing. We cannot quantify the affect either of those things had on his actual work. After all, despite the misguided characterization of Einstein's work as "Jewish physics" as is noted in the article, physics has neither nationality nor religion. However, when it comes to the way his work was accepted, the circumstance of his life and his own personal attitudes towards faith they are very significant.</p>
<p>Not to delve too deeply into a Turtledove line of reasoning here, but let's imagine for a moment that he had been born a non-observant Christian, and stayed in Germany through WWII. I sincerely doubt he would have joined the Nazis but surely his work would have been more acceptable to scientists working under the Reich, and they would have made further inroads into nuclear research, drastically changing the 20th century paradigm. By way of comparison, imagine that Werner von Braun (whose wikipedia introduction, BTW, takes pains to note both his German and American background) was born a Jew. That's not to say that von Braun was to rocket science what Einstein was to physics (von Braun is probably more aptly compared to Openheimer) but it does illustrate that simply noting that the man who originated much of the science that molded his century was "German-born" leaves one wondering why his ideas didn't wind up as the payload of a V-2 rocket. The rest of the article does address the issue, but the acknowledgement of his ancestry does much to address the issue at very little cost at the beginning of the article. Indeed, I would argue that it is definitive of the nature of his contribution to world history--at least as much as his German birth, and that the circumstances of his birth are incomplete without noting both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>As for his "German-Swiss-American" status those things are largely trumped by his being Jewish, for he would likely never have become the second or third if he weren't born a Jew. Indeed, identifying him as "German-born" without noting he was Jewish is something of a muddle. Where Charles Darwin can simply be described as English, Linus Pauling as American, and Henri Poincaré "one of France's greatest mathematicians and theoretical physicists, and a philosopher of science" in their wikipedia articles without noting that Einstein was Jewish his "German-born" status is confused. If he were not a Jew he'd simply be "German" rather than "German-born" so "German-born Jew" explains his itinerant nationality better than would a hyphenated list of the nations in which he had/took citizenship, introduces the text on his life, and gives a reader at first glance an idea of the implications of such an origin that are addressed later in the article.</p>
<p>Einstein himself, of course, noted that "If my theory of relativity is proven correct, Germany will claim me as a German and France will say I am a man of the world. If it's proven wrong, France will say I am a German and Germany will say I am a Jew." I would suggest, however, that describing him as a "German-born physicist of Jewish ancestry" or words to that effect elegantly and accurately addresses both sides of the issue. It indicates that he was nominally both but not really either. --<a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 10:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I don't see Einstein's Jewish ancestry as being notable enough to include in the intro. Einstein was not especially known for being Jewish. Obviously the fact that he was of Jewish ancestry affected his life in many ways, but it doesn't seem to be significantly connected to his notability. By way of comparison, neither the Encyclopædia Britannica nor Encarta mention Einstein being Jewish in their intros. Indeed, Encarta's biography doesn't mention it whatsoever. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 17:52, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is his German background any more notable? More importantly, "German-born" by itself is inadequate. Why not say he was a physicist and ignore his nationality and ethnic background entirely in the opening sentence? My argument is that saying he was "German-born" without saying he was also jewish creates a muddle for the reasons described above.</dd>

<dd>I don't think we should put too much stock in how this particular issue is handled in other encyclopedia's, but since you mentioned those two it should be noted that MSN Encarta's opening sentence calls Einstein a "German-born American physicist" (<a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562147/Einstein_Albert.html</a>) while the rhapsodic EB says "German-American physicist" (<a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106018/Albert-Einstein" class="external free" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106018/Albert-Einstein" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106018/Albert-Einstein</a>). My point being that "German-born" alone would appear to be inadequate if we are going to use those two as a guideline.</dd>

<dd>That said, I would argue that Einstein was famous for being a Zionist, and this it was a significant part of his identity. He did, after all, pen a book on the subject and was widely recognized for his stance on the issue. The rest of this article, however, is peppered with his participation in Jewish causes, so I think it contradicts your assessment that he was not known for being Jewish. His Jewish background relates directly to his early participation in politics, and continued throughout his life. I think a more accurate assessment would be that much of the world did not embrace his being Jewish.... That does not, however, vitiate the reality of his background nor address the nature of his background.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Big Picture here, however, is that "German-born" is not a particularly accurate or well-considered way of describing his background. It differs from the norm for other wikipedia articles (already cited) the articles on Einstein in other encyclopedias and is vague.</dd>

<dd>The problem is that so many groups want to lay claim to Einstein that when we let them all into the intro it ends up looking ridiculous. The only reason I left "German-born" in the intro when I simplified it was that it ties to the preceding German sound snippet, an easy way of indicating why the German pronunciation matters. Of course, other nationalities, Judaism, vegetarianism, etc. should be (and are) discussed within the body of the article. Speaking of which, this article is way too long, containing myriad details that would be considered irrelevant for most biographical articles. — DAGwyn 20:44, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It definitely is problematic.... I do think saying he was "German-born" rather than just "German" is important, given his history, politics and the nature of his character. It's a fairly elegant way of dealing with that particular aspect his background, and introduces that he gave up that citizenship, which will later be described in the article. That alone, however, does not tell the whole story, and in the brief introductory sentence a few more words (IMO "of Jewish ancestry") would be the most meaningful (though, admittedly, probably not the most politically correct) way of conveying information in as short a manner as possible. As has been argued in the past "-Swiss-American vegetarian" might be (and occasionally have been) added as well, but catalogueing the list of his citizenship or later affiliations is not a particularly accurate way to describe the nature of that transition or what motivated it. Saying that he has a Jewish <i>background</i> implies that he was not himself an observant Jew, but that it did inform his personality, and influence the way his background influenced others. I can't speak to whether he was or was not a vegetarian, let alone whether he would have been one or not had he been Jewish :) but would he have been "-Swiss-American" were he not born a Jew? Would he have supported Zionism, written a book on the subject and been offered Israeli political posts were that not part of his background?</dd>

<dd>"German-American" as other encyclopedias describe him does give a hint as to his background and political shifts, but it is a vague term, and innaccurate in this case. As I'm sure everyone is aware, such phrases can as easily mean "American-born of German ancestry" rather than expatriated German. It is, perhaps, a smidge more accurate than just saying "German-born" because it indicates that he moved from one to another, and expresses the beginning and end of that process, which is why it is better than the polyglottal German-Swiss-American. But as you note it opens up the issue to those who want to lay claim to Einstein for their own reasons--whatever those might be. I suggest "of Jewish ancestry" rather than just "Jewish" because it parallels "German-born" in that it reflects his tepid attitude towards the faith, that he was a Zionist on an intellectual level, but didn't actually "pull the trigger" as it were when it came to the nitty-gritty of creating Israel or participating in its government. It shows how the circumstances of his birth were an influence on his life and personality, but doesn't actually ally him with that origin.</dd>

<dd>In any case, I'm not going to make this particular change until/unless there is some sort of support for it because I expect it would be reverted pretty quickly, and what's the point in that? However, I would suggest that if accuracy is the goal here--if some sort of truthful assessment of his background and personality is what we want in the introduction--and we can adopt a little language that implies details to be more fully described in the body of the article (which is what I think a good intro does) then the addition of those three words would be the way to go, just as "German-born" is more accurate than "German" alone. I suspect people might be a bit too sensitive on this particular issue even if it might be the most "truthful" way of expressing his origins, and that is understandable. It touches upon things that people seem to find unsettling: the whole religion and science thing, let alone issues of religion to begin with.... I think "of Jewish ancestry" skirts that topic in a manner similar to the way "German-born" does, but I do realize the casual reader may not recognize that distinction. Nonetheless, if we're interested in being true to Einstein's character then I think it's the way to go. Other ways of describing him really seem to fall victim to the most insidious trap of biography: expressing the POV of the author(s) rather than summing up the person. — <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 13:39, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">one of the greatest physicists of all time</span></h2>
<p>The opening paragraph states that Einstein "is widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time". I believe this does not accurately convey the situation. That sentence could be applied to six or seven people, whereas Einstein stood alone in the modern era. Better would be "He is widely regarded as the greatest physicist of all time" (the only rival is Newton, and they are so far apart that it is difficult to compare); or "He is universally regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time". Pedantically, "of all time" includes the unknown future, and the alternative "yet" is understated; I prefer "there has ever been" - AG, Stockport, UK.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seems a little pedantic to me. You certainly wouldn't get away with "universally regarded as one of the greatest...", as he has many detractors (whether they're right in criticising him is a moot point). --<a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscarthecat_3c87.html" title="User:Oscarthecat">Oscarthecat</a> 17:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the existing wording is as close to an expression of consensus as we are likely to attain. Elsewhere in the article are such facts as Einstein's being TIME's "Person of the Century", which conveys pretty well the general level of esteem he has been accorded. — DAGwyn 20:47, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I still don't see the point. It doesn't really "summarize" anything — almost none of that information (the exception being what he is "known for", but a stale list doesn't really cover that) is what I would include in a summary of Einstein's life, as knowing it does not really tell you anything about Einstein at all (alma mater? work institution? doctoral advisor? doctoral students? who cares? these are not the essence of Einstein; any of these could have been changed by chance and he'd still be Einstein. You can't say that about the rest of the fields, at the very least). I don't really think it has much functional benefit. Aesthetics are obviously going to differ from person to person, and I'm against it, but that's another question anyway. In any case, I think that the religion field should be jettisoned whatever the case; his religious beliefs are too individual and too complicated to fit into a simple field and it is not worth even trying to do so. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:17, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

And above all the Religion field should be deleted: His religion cannot be summarized in a few words. What’s left (other that the Born and Died fields) is a repetition of what’s already in the lead paragraph, which would stand right next to the infobox. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 07:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC) (By the way, I don't recall seeing previous contributions to this article from <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESureFire_0864.html" title="User:SureFire">SureFire</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a>, <a href="../../../l/w/7/User%7ELW77_7410.html" title="User:LW77">LW77</a>, <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a>, or <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a>.

<li><b>Reply.</b> I can't speak for everyone. But my personal interest (and possibly that of others) has been spurred by the recent revamping of the infobox (and many people are now propagating it--some &gt;200 scientific biographies now have it). I have been doing some of the work in placing it in other articles, then when I came around to doing the Einstein one I noticed there is a warning not to add an infobox unless it is discussed first. Well...here I am :-) Now to answer your questions: (a) regarding your point about repetition and the importance of the fields, these have all been discussed here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_Scientist#Let.27s_move_on_and_reach_consensus_on_the_individual_fields_so_we_can_trim_the_box" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_Scientist#Let.27s_move_on_and_reach_consensus_on_the_individual_fields_so_we_can_trim_the_box" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> at some length in a consentual debate about the infobox. The answers are there. A little repetition isn't necessarily bad thing, especially as many readers go directly to the infobox as a first pass. (b) The doctoral advisor/student idea is important because it is part of his <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_genealogy.html" title="Academic genealogy">academic genealogy</a> ...if you follow the external links in that article you will see there is intense interest in this. You may well become fascinated yourself :-) Also if you read the article on <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Kleiner_43b2.html" title="Alfred Kleiner">Alfred Kleiner</a>, you'll see that he was one of the influences on the young Einstein. I'm surprised the Einstein article doesn't mention him. (c) Take a look at the footnote field that warns the reader to refer to the article for expansion. As you rightly pointed out that Einstein is a colorful case, the footnote is appropriate. This covers your other objections. (d) Regarding your point about his "time after useful science," my take is that a biography includes the person as well as the science. As a person, that's where his life ended up. The reader then goes to the main article for expansion. (e) Regarding the religion issue, the Spinoza quote nicely sums up his position in adulthood...the footnote again directs the reader to the article for expansion. (f) Remember a summary by nature is a form of lossy compression of facts, in the same way that the wiki article itself is a lossy compression of what could be said in a book about Einstein. Our lives revolve around summarizing things. Scientists have to summarise a whole journal article into a tiny Abstract. Summary is an art that can and is done. So let us collaborate together and take on the challenge of how to best present Einstein in summary. I believe the foonote takes care of the problems you raise but am open to other creative ideas.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I disagree strongly on the religion issue. Firstly, as I wrote above, an infobox is not the place to put a quote (except in rare cases, such as a motto in a country infobox). Secondly: while most of the other fields are self-explanatory and useful, even if in some cases (such as citizenship) reading the text is required to get the full story, this indication of religion is <i>absolutely</i> useless to any reader who has not read the full article (except your goal is to get curious people to read it...). Even after reading the page, I see a difference between reading Einstein's (interesting) quote in a telegram, and generalising it to "His religion was ...". As you say, a summary is a compression of facts; "I believe in Spinoza's God" is not a fact about Einstein's religious belief even if the word God is part of it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchutz_72ef.html" title="User:Schutz">Schutz</a> 13:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b>. Well, the only source, as far as I know, is this 25-words telegram. Given the context, the fact that the recipient was a religious man, and other kind of letters I have seen from Einstein, I would not be surprised if he was more trying to make a point rather that expressing a real religious feeling. Inferring his "religion" from this anecdotical piece of evidence is what I call borderline to original research; I would much prefer seeing a reference to a secondary source, e.g. a biography where it is shown that this "religious belief" was more or less consistently (and several times !) expressed (maybe it exists and I have missed it).

<li><b>Reply.</b> I don’t see why you think you have to put something in every available field no matter how inapplicable to Einstein. Take Nationality for example: If you read this talk page you will see that the question of how to summarize his nationality is a very contentious matter. If there must be an entry for Nationality, it should be “German-born” or “German” and/or “Jewish” – certainly neither Swiss nor American – those were his citizenships not his nationality. And certainly there should be no flag: Einstein was anti-nationalist. If there must be an entry for Institution, it should be the Swiss patent office and the University of Berlin – certainly not the Institute for Advanced Study, where he did no notable science.

Actually that is not a bad idea...readers who are unfamiliar with the details of Einstein's life will see that statement in the "religion field" and it will pique their interest to go and read the main article. Now that's not a bad strategy. I disagree, however, with mixing up Einstein's anti-nationalist sentiments with wanting to remove flags from the infobox. Flags are in there as standard. Just because some scientists may have hated computers, doesn't mean we respect their sentiments and exclude them from computer-based online encyclopedias :-) Spread the wiki-love. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 23:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b>Somebody spammed me on my talk page, but anyway, as a very active member of WPBIO: I can understand reservations about this particular infobox (it's a bit unweildy) but the standard by consensus now is for bios to have infoboxes. This one looked naked without an infobox. You might want to use a smaller box, perhaps just with birth, death and profession details. I don't think, though, that having no infobox at all is a reasonable solution.

<li><b>Response</b> Yes, but that doesn't mean we can't be reasonable in keeping the size of the infobox down. I mean, the box as it is doesn't provide any particularly useful information about Einstein, and I can't imagine that it ever will. Why not limit it to information that is amenable to the box format: that that can be stated clearly and unambiguously in one line. In this case, that is Birth, Death, Field, his Nobel prize (although there is already a template for that at the bottom of the page) and (if necessary) his Alma Mater and doctoral advisor. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 17:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>The Next Step.</b> The consensus to remove the "religion" field for Einstein is now loud and clear. Remember I did already delete it from the main page. In the above example I've put "See main article" as an experiment to see if you all like it. The next step is to decide if we want the slightly shorter version that is on the main page or the slightly longer one in the above example. My opinion is that there is still white space on the main page that could be nicely taken up by the longer version.

To you and anyone else who say the fact that some “Keep” voters favor the omission of some fields proves their neutrality: The issue in this poll is the insertion of <i>any</i> infobox; a previous infobox was removed which contained only the name, picture, and Born and Died fields.

<li><b>Comment.</b>Thank you for your gracious and civil apology. I've completed my inquisition and here are my conclusions: (1) It's all pretty unbiassed, as most people are asking to delete the religion field. As I said before: this suggests it was done in a neutral way. (2) Avi and SuperGirl were not spammed if you check the histories on their talk pages. (3) You can't exclude SureFire...how can someone spam themself? Your logic is questionable :-) He/she started this thing, so should be in the vote. (4) Your argument that both I and Fastfission were prior contributors, also applies to Kaldari who contributed on 24 Sep 2006 and SquidSK who contributed 13 Oct 2006. and Schulz who contributed on 16 Oct 2006. <s>(5) You appear to have totally missed Schulz in your count.</s> (6) Also Szvest contributed on 18 May 2006 under his primary name: FayssalF.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Even the longest infobox is still a nice way of getting quickie information on a subject, and though this one is longer than average it's still not so long as to ruin its effectiveness as a way of conveying data.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cultural depictions of Albert Einstein</span></h2>
<p>I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on <i>in popular culture</i> information. I started that last year while I raised <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> to <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a> when I created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a>, which has become a <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a>. Recently I also created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Alexander_the_Great_d3a1.html" title="Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great">Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great</a> out of material that had been deleted from the biography article. Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.

If there must be an entry for Nationality, it should be “German-born” and/or “Jewish” – certainly neither Swiss nor American – those were his citizenships not his nationality. And certainly there should be no flag: Einstein was anti-nationalist, and flags imply nationalism to many people. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 00:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think the intention of this template field is to treat Nationality/Citizenship in the broad sense. They are often broadly used to mean the same thing. They are only different in legal detail to do with political voting rights (see <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a>). The template uses the label in the broad sense, not the narrow legal sense. Thus, Swiss-US is fine, so long as the footnote is used to point the reader to the main article. I am hesistant to include "Jewish" as that is more to do with ethnicity rather than nationality. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 02:14, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response.</b> Disagree. There are many ways an infobox gets used. Here are just five examples (1) As a navigational tool before reading the main article, (2) As an appetite whetter before deciding whether or not to read the main article, (3) By someone who's read the main article some time ago, forgotten a detail and then wants to go back and quickly find a fact, (4) By people who scan several biographies wanting to quickly compare trivia between them, (5) By school children who print the articles out, cut out the infoboxes and collect them like baseball cards. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 20:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC) PS: Now let's not get too precious about the fifth point because as a scientist, myself, I know one of our big problems is in inspiring the younger generations. It's just not fair that baseballers get infoboxes, and scientists (till now) were subject to some misplaced honor of being "above that."</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> I think point (2) above is notable in the case of Einstein...people will see the infobox...they will then read footnote that points out the difficulties in summarising Einstein, which then points them to the main article. I think this will result in more readers getting curious and actually then taking the effort to read the main article, instead of just scanning the infobox. Isn't a bigger audience what the resident editors of this page would like? It's a win-win.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I still don’t like the Nationality field for Einstein, or including citizenship in Nationality if present. (I think both his Jewishness and his Germanness are far more notable than his citizenships.) But I seem to be outnumbered on both counts. Perhaps the solution is an inclusive list with both ethnic identity and citizenship. That might also reduce the likelyhood of edit wars over his nationality (which we have seen in the past).

<li><b>Comment.</b> Sorry I am coming late to the discussion (but basically agree with SuperGirl's comment just above); just one question/comment.

<li><b>Reply.</b> My 7-line example above <i>was intended</i> as a fragment of a proposed infobox; imagine the caption <b>Nationality</b> to the left of it. If part of it were relegated to the footnote, it should be the citizenship, for the notable thing about Einstein’s nationality is his ethnic identity not his citizenship. It’s like the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rowan_Hamilton_5d5e.html" title="William Rowan Hamilton">Hamilton</a> example you brought up in the side thread below: Hamilton’s Irish ethnic identity is listed as his nationality, and his British citizenship is not even mentioned. Since you suggest using the footnote, how about listing his nationality as “German-Jewish”? (with no flag?) And say in the footnote, “Although his nationality was German-Jewish, he held Swiss and American citizenships at the time of his death.” (On Einstein’s citizenship prior to 1896, I don’t know what it was: Württemberger, Bavarian, both? The article doesn’t find it important enough to discuss.) --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 07:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply.</b> Your phrase 'to me' confirms you realise you are being POV. Let's get encyclopedic here. I just checked "nationality" on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) online and it says nationality is: "the status of being a citizen or subject of a particular state." Bingo. The same as what the wiki article on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> says.

<li><b>Reply.</b> Well no, the phrase “to me” means I prefer one of two accepted meanings. If you look more closely at the article on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">Nationality</a>, you will see that it includes my preferred meaning as an “Alternate usage.” I simply regard this “alternate” meaning as the more basic. (I hope you don’t regard it POV to think an article could be improved.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My understanding is that ethnic affiliation was the <i>original</i> meaning of “nationality,” but that in a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation-state.html" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a> it is natural to extend this meaning to include state affiliation. Inasmuch as most states these days are nation-states, this extension has come for many people to dominate the understood meaning. The extension, however, is really proper only in a nation-state.</dd>
<dd>To demonstrate that consider: Einstein was born a subject of the Kingdom of <a href="../../../w/%C3%BC/r/W%C3%BCrttemberg.html" title="Württemberg">Württemberg</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlagge_K%C3%B6nigreich_W%C3%BCrttemberg.svg_7ed5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/14/Flagge_K%C3%B6nigreich_W%C3%BCrttemberg.svg/20px-Flagge_K%C3%B6nigreich_W%C3%BCrttemberg.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlagge_K%C3%B6nigreich_W%C3%BCrttemberg.svg_7ed5.html" /></a>. I’m pretty sure that did not make him directly a subject of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">German Empire</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_German_Empire.svg_c82a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/ec/Flag_of_the_German_Empire.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_German_Empire.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_German_Empire.svg_c82a.html" /></a>. (In any case, Württembergers could not have been German Empire subjects prior to 1871.) The point is that I doubt anyone would claim the “nationality” of Württembergers then was Württemberger rather than German.</dd>
<dd>So, there are two meanings of “nationality”; some people think more in terms of one, and some the other. This difference has led editors to change Einstein’s nationality label—sometimes quite insistently. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 07:47, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response.</b> Dear <a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a>, wow, I'm really impressed by your research. I like you because you dig up stuff and back yourself up rather than shooting from the hip like many 'pedia editors out there in wiki-land. So you have my respect. You are right that there are alternative interpretations of 'nationality.' However, what I've been trying to get at is that the intention of the template guidelines appears to go more for the citizenship angle, and to steer clear of the ethnicity angle. Ethinicity is a can of worms and we should try avoid getting into its evil trap ...Citizenship is a clean well-defined status that can be backed-up by historical documentation and paperwork. Ethnicity on the other hand is a grey concept...for example what if a given scientist has mixed grandparentage from different countries? What if the grandmother cheated with the Mexican milkman? What do we say the ethnicity is? There is no paper trail back-up for ethnicity and there is even no sure-fire DNA test for ethnicity either. So we can't even go to Einstein's preserved brain samples and test them. So let's keep it encyclopedic, and stick with the more legal citizenship interpretation of the word "Nationality" as orginally intended by the template. Dare I blow you a wiki-kiss? <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 09:36, 21 October 2006 (UTC) PS: If people feel "citizenship" is a more clearer term than "nationality" for describing the legal national status (as opposed to ethnicity) then I am for supporting a change to the template master.

<dd><b>Comment.</b> This may be a good fit for many modern states, but breaks down in a lot of other cases. "Roman citizenship" was not extended to all Roman nationals, but it was over time extended to a lot of non-Romans. For a more modern example: Were slaves considered citizens in the pre-civil war US? Were blacks considered citizens in apartheid South Africa? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:17, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> One can cross that bridge in such articles on Romans and South Africans, should you need to write one. Our mission here is to focus on Einstein. I am pointing out the general principle that it's much safer to stick to citizenship (and steer clear of ethnicity) for modern "western" scientists such as Einstein. Ethnicity is too much of a hot potato. For modern western biographies there is a clear paper-trail of documentation to verify citizenship. Ethnicity is always open to some uncertainty. For example, take the mathematician <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rowan_Hamilton_5d5e.html" title="William Rowan Hamilton">Hamilton</a>, (as in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian.html" title="Hamiltonian">Hamiltonians</a>). Was he Scottish or was he Irish? He was an Irish national and born there, but his family came from Scotland. It's much cleaner to put him down as Irish as that was his legal status and his upbringing. He identified with being Irish. It would be silly to list him as a Scottish scientist...even though his ethnicity was clearly Scottish. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 12:45, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply.</b> Oh. Once again we are tripping over varying meanings of words. By nationality (and ethnicity) I refer to the people <small>(the singular noun—not the plural of person)</small> that one identifies with or that one is identified with—a social meaning, related to culture and not particularly to genetics. I am sorry if I wasn’t clear about that before. So as far as I am concerned, Hamilton was Irish because he is associated with the Irish people, and he was not Scots because is not identified with the Scots people. By your OED definition, however, he should be regarded as British because he was a British subject. Applying this to Einstein: He was Jewish because throughout his life he identified with the Jewish people. His Jewish identity was far more significant in his life than his Swiss or American citizenships. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 21:33, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply.</b> See how it is handled in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton.html" title="Hamilton">Hamilton</a>. It says "Irish" and there is an Irish flag. However, there is a qualifier there saying he is of Scottish descent. Notice there is no Scottish flag. So the same applies to Einstein. I have no objections with a qualifier saying he is from a Jewish family, but I object to an Israeli flag...because Einstein was not an Israeli. It would be as silly as putting a Scottish flag there for <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton.html" title="Hamilton">Hamilton</a>. (<i>An aside:</i> the reason why the British flag is not there for <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton.html" title="Hamilton">Hamilton</a> is that he was not from Northern Ireland...only Northern Ireland came part of the UK in 1801).<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 22:10, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply.</b> Pets?....giggle. Getting a job in Princeton is a pretty damn good acheivement. He was there for 23 years which is about a third of his whole life. Therefore from a historial biographical viewpoint the IAS needs to be listed. Otherwise the reader will think, "well, where was he for 23 years?" Also his critique of QM was very influential; it is untrue to say his acheivements then were zero. Critiquing things is part of the scientific process. His modus operandi simply changed when he went to the USA. He took a risk that simply didn't pay off as much as his previous work. But I call that still a success, not a failure. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 21:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Are we pandering to the "reader" who reads <i>only</i> the infobox, now? Listing the IAS (which is <i>not</i> part of Princeton University) as his "institution" will not tell this hypothetical reader anything about how long he stayed there, where he was before then, or when or where he did his most important work. It tells you a single fact and one which isolated from all explanation is worthless. And most of Einstein's critiques of QM were developed and published well before he went to IAS (EPR was published two years after he arrived at IAS, though Einstein <i>didn't actually write that one</i>, but that's a bit pedantic to point out). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:18, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Reply.</b> I agree with your details but not your sentiment. The fact is that Einstein was at the IAS for a long time. So it's part of his biographical record. Yes, his work there was not as significant as his prior work, but you are plain wrong to say his IAS years are not noteworthy. The infobox is a navigational tool and it quickly shows the reader where Einstein was working. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 01:36, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response-to-response</b> I think that scientific genealogy project is a good idea, but in the context of an infobox its rather unwieldy. Probably a better way of compiling such a system is with a set of articles. The infobox should be for quickie-reference information. "When did he die?" "What award/s did he win?" A "family tree" of intellectual development going back centuries is a valuable and fascinating subject, but using infoboxes as the hook into such a project is like using postage stamps to pay your mortage. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 20:45, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> This is a non sequitor. There is no family tree in the infobox. It's just the advisor and any students with a wiki article. This provides quick and handy links primarily to these related articles so the reader can then easily check for themselves how significant or trivial these influences were. Then a secondary effect is that the reader can then crawl up or down the tree via successive infoboxes. This is no different to a succession infobox in many other articles out there.<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 22:19, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clarification</b> My comment was regarding "a 'family tree' of intellectual development" not an actual geneological family tree. :) I support the idea behind the project--a series of links connecting up the mentor to student relationship throughout the centuries, showing the development of ideas and scholarly work. That's a good idea. However, it would be better portrayed in actual article pages in which the whole "tree" could be written out, and/or the process could be given its due attention. Using infoboxes to create a series of links is unwieldy because it doesn't show a whole lot of information at once, requires the reader/browser to make the "family tree" leaps himself (as in, it presents these people as being related without any actual explanation of how) and because it is rather a hamfisted use of the infobox system. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 02:44, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response.</b> Sure....making trees and putting them on pages is a good idea and some editors are already doing that, for example see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Baez_descent.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Baez_descent.png" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. No problem! However, this in no way replaces the idea of having quick links to the immediate supervisor and students in the infobox. I can see there is room for both on wikipedia and they can co-exist in harmony. As I said before, what you are seeing with this infobox is no different to succession boxes for monarchs or politicians. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 08:18, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response to Reply</b> Well, I think it should replace the idea of having quick links to the immediate supervisor in the infobox mostly because I don't think supervisor/student is the kind of information that is signficant enough to belong in an infobox. Who is going to look for quick reference information regarding Einstein's doctoral advisor? I can see someone wanting quick reference to his DOB, DOD, the major theories he is credited with, etc. but are people really going to want quick reference to the people he studied with? What's more, the infobox format isn't the right way to display such data. The succession of boxes used for monarchs and politicians is a much better way of portraying such data--at the bottom of the page where such links belong (for format's sake and because it really is rather tangential information.) It'd be more in line with the method you describe for politicians and monarchs and a better presentation of the idea (tracking the chain of scholarly learning) in a more obvious and meaningful way. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 20:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply.</b> Many people would be curious to click on the links in the infobox and explore. Your assertion that no one is interested in Einstein's advisor is false. Have you read the article on <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Kleiner_43b2.html" title="Alfred Kleiner">Alfred Kleiner</a> yourself to see that it is in fact interesting? Also what you are saying about succession boxes being at the bottom of the page is false too. Check out <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, for example, where you'll see the succession of presidents is done at the top of the page in the infobox. The fact is that different ways of displaying succession do peacefully coexist on wikipedia. If it ain't broke why fix it? If you seriously wanna change over 200 templates, are you offering to do all the work? I'm not! If you are serious about this change go ahead and do it yourself. The correct way to start is not here (because this is specifically for Einstein)--you need to start a discussion at the talk page of the infobox and raise a concensus here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_Scientist" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_Scientist" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

<li><b>Some More Clarification</b> First, I have not asserted that no one is interested in Einstein's advisor, and I think I've been pretty clear that I think the project is a good idea.... (Honestly, where did that come from?) That said, I actually would assert that there there is a pretty big difference between the infoboxes of politicians listing their predecessors and successors in office and a more abstract concept like a mentor and student relationship. That's the kind of information someone might want a quick reference to. Who succeeded Polk or preceded Taylor? People ask those kind of questions all the time about those sorts of people. Very few people have the same question about the educational development of Max Planck or even of Einstein.... Do people need quick reference to that right at the top of the page? In this case, using the infobox as a method of relating information about the history of scholarly development for centuries is an odd way of trying to relate that information and outside the scope of what that little portion of the page is meant for. Second, there are other tools that can be used, ones that suit the situation better. The "succession box" at the bottom of many bio pages (like those of U.S. Presidents) would be more appropriate. If you take a look at the bios of Presidents (like Bill Clinton's) you'll see that there is the "Preceded by" and "Succeeded by" entries in the infobox, but the succession box is the one at the bottom of the page that has a more complete list (and that's where such a concept would be more appropriately placed.) --<a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 08:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Where did it come from? It was when you said its inclusion wasn't "significant." Maybe I was hormonal and overeacted. You are right about a succession box being at the bottom of the the US president page. However, note: (i) succession is also in the infobox and the two coexist, (ii) in the US prez case, the bottom succession box is necessary because there is more than one type of office to describe. In our case we only have one item and that is "advisors"...so it is much neater and more visible in the infobox. (iii) Who said anything about "centuries?" (Honestly, where did that come from?). No. The infobox only has the predecessor and successor only. Period. The "centuries" thing _may_ happen as a side-effect one day when enough biographies are there to form a "chain." But that is nothing that needs concern you. That is something that naturally happens via a self-organization process as the number of biographies increases. The idea is to let that effect evolve by <i>itself</i>. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 09:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yet more Clarification</b> Well, I'm going to leap to my own defense once more to say that I think the academic geneology project is a good idea. I just don't think the infobox is the appropriate place for such information. There exist better methods already extant on WP that are more apt. My comments that advisor/students isn't right for the infobox is quite different from asserting that nobody is interested in such information, so <i>please</i> be more careful when attributing statements to others. Heck, I'm interested in it myself. I look forward to spending some time checking it out. However, the issue is not whether that information can coexist in the infobox and in a succession box at the bottom of the page, but if it is appropriate for the infobox in the first place. For an infobox on politicians or regents it makes sense to have "Preceded by" and "Succeeded by" because that's the kind of information that people might want quickly. Students memorize the succession of presidents all the time, for example, and lots of people might want to quickly reference that kind of thing. The connection between advisor and student, however, is more abstract. In certain cases the connections are even debatable, not just factually but whether that relationship was, in fact, significant. The whole concept is less concrete than DOB, DOD, countries that someone held citizenship in, or the order of office holders, and as such doesn't belong in what should be a brief list of definite facts about an individual. Now, as for where "centuries" came from, according to the link <b>you provided</b> above for the academic geneology projects one of them (the Mathematics Genealogy Project) "attempts to go back to the time of Leibnitz." Since Gottfried Leibnitz died nearly 300 years ago that'd put the project's timeline in the centuries. The "Genealogy of theoretical physicists" page goes back even further. Again, it's a good idea and a fascinating subject, but I don't see the infobox as being the proper place to put it for the reasons already described. --<a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 13:08, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply.</b> Again, I'll repeat that the "centuries" factor is nothing that concerns us here. We are <i>only</i> taking about <i>immediate</i> succession and precession. If several boxes happen to link together and go back centuries, then that is a nice <i>side-effect.</i> It is not something we have to consciously aim for. That takes care of itself as the wikipedia <i>grows</i>. Whilst I agree that succession connections can sometimes be debated, I disagree that monarchs etc are more clear cut. There are contested monarchs. And look at the succession of Popes. Lot's of controversy there! That's why we have <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipope.html" title="Antipope">Antipopes</a>. Advisor/student relationships are much easier to handle than Popes. Sure you can put a succession box at the bottom of the page. Nobody is going to stop you! As I said before, here is not the correct place to discuss that. The correct proceedure is to just go ahead and do it. Then once you've populated all the bios, start a discussion on the Infobox Scientist talk page suggesting the Advisor and Students <i>then</i> be removed from the infobox. You need to do the work first, to ensure that the information is not buried. I will support your proposed removal once I see your succession box nicely populated throughout the bios, and not before! <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperGirl_e75a.html" title="User:SuperGirl">SuperGirl</a> 01:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, and under no circumstance should "see main article" be the entry for any infobox field. If it cannot be reduced to something elegant--and in Einstein's case, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinozism.html" title="Spinozism">Spinozism</a> is elegant--then the field should not be used at all. I will add that Einstein is a good example--and maybe the best example since Newton--of religion taking part in a scientist's thinking. Many of his famous quotes deal with the beauty of scientific law from the perspective of a Creator--"God does not play dice with the universe" (a belief that may have prevented him from making contributions to quantum theory); one would be hard-pressed to find a page of quotes by Einstein that does not mention God three or four times.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Boy this is a tough one. I'm kinda sticking my neck out here, for a royal flaming :-) So please be gentle with me. Here is my reasoning for "keep." The fact is that the discussion in both the popular literature and scholarly literature on the interplay between Einstein's scientific and religious beliefs is <b>huge</b>. If I stacked every piece of paper written on it end-to-end, I could circle the globe. The paradox is that because it is so complex and significant, an entry in the infobox is justified...but because of that very complexity it makes the wording tricky and the entry difficult. Because it's difficult, is no reason to "delete" IMHO. We are all clever guys and surely we can collaborate to come up with something pithy and suitable. I've trawled around some of the other science biography articles to see how they have coped with this problem to get ideas. One idea is to put it in the negative, and say what Einstein is not. So something like "Did not subscribe to any organised religion" or even "Did not believe in a personal God" could be possible entries. Or even something like, "Had complex beliefs that are described in the main article" might work. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESureFire_0864.html" title="User:SureFire">SureFire</a> 23:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete with a proviso</b> I think Einstein should be described as "German-born... of Jewish ancestry" in the first sentence of the article for reasons having to do with consistency with other WP articles, his description in other encyclopedias (encyclopedium?), because it works best as an introduction to the body of this article and most importantly its an accurate assessment of Einstein (to that extent that something like this can be done in a few words, of course.) If the current opening sentence is kept (which lists his date of birth, death and the locations in which they occurred) then I vote <b>Keep</b> as such information is incomplete on its own. Though an infobox notation is not very informative, it's better than nothing. <i>IMO: It needs to say <b>right at the top of the page</b> that Einstein was of Jewish ancestry.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 02:12, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Einstein would hate this infobox with the flags</span></h2>
<p>He despised nationalism. If you guys really want flags, then put in all of them, to reflect his cosmopolitan attitude. Maybe insert an extra section "Other remarkable events" next to "Notable Prizes" and mention Israel's offer of the presidency. That will give a nice excuse to insert the Israelian flag as well, to better illustrate the notion of Einstein, the cosmopolitan. And add the German and Swiss flags again after his Nobel Prize, otherwise superficial readers might think the other flags have something to do with it! <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicists_3d25.html" title="User:Physicists">Physicists</a> 19:36, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, so there are three points here — four if I start with a general comment:
<ol>
<li>The content of the infobox has been discussed in details on this page just a few days ago; I am not sure it is a good idea to reopen the discussion so soon, or to modify the infobox before any such discussion.</li>
<li>This has been discussed above as well: we are writing an encyclopedia, and with all respect due to Einstein, his potential opinion about the presence of flags in our infoboxes is of very little interest to us. We want to make articles that are complete, informative, easy to access, etc, not articles that are modeled according to their subject.</li>
<li>The fact that he got offered the presidency of Israel is significant, and deserve to be discussed in the article (and currently is); however, should we really indicate in an infobox all the potential nationalities that a person could have had if he had made different choices in his life ? Nationality was the most discussed topic in the discussion above, so I reverted this change for now (as I will revert the change made while I was writing this edit and which put "Cosmopolitan" as a nationality).</li>
<li>As for the flags added to the Nobel Prize, I don't really care, even though I would rather not add them. Sure they are useful, but they essentially duplicate information already present in the infobox.</li>

<dd>As an aside... As mentioned above, I agree with you, flags should not be added to the Nobel Prize, but this prize <i>was</i> actually the occasion of a (diplomatic) fight between Switzerland and Germany who both wanted to claim it (especially because Einstein was not present to receive it, so "his" Embassy was supposed to receive it for him). Funny story (the Swiss let the Germans take it in the end, partly because the Germans insisted, and partly because a Swiss already got a Nobel prize just one or two years before), but maybe a bit too anecdotical to deserve a note in the article (if someone disagrees, I can add it — relevant sources and copies of original documents are available online in misc archives). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchutz_72ef.html" title="User:Schutz">Schutz</a> 20:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I agree. Having just looked at the article again, the flags are hideous. Why can't we remove the lot of them? Where is the consensus to have tiny little flags, like we're covering the Olympics? Does it help people too lazy to actually read the infobox to have the little flags? Too often on Wikipedia, people roll with the misguided notion that just because we can do something (populate a page with templates, infoboxes, links, categories, banners, little flags) it is a good idea. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 21:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section needs a little work. It has some excessive quoting, for one thing, and does not really explain any of it in simple terms. Additionally, when it says "In the Schilpp book", does it just mean, "In EPR, which is in the Schilpp book"? I can't tell though I guess I could pull out EPR and see if that is what the text is from. There is a general problem with talking about EPR in the way which is done here, mainly that Einstein didn't himself write EPR — it was written by Podolsky based on conversations with Einstein and Rosen. Einstein himself didn't like the way it was formulated at all — he thought it was unclear. Though one can use EPR as an example of Einstein's thinking on incompleteness, the quotes in it cannot be directly attributed to Einstein individually (if at all directly).

<p>Sometimes quotations are suitable for Wikipedia. You cannot generalise and say that all quotes should be in wikiquote. Wikiquote is for, and I quote from their policy pages: "...quotations which are notable. A quotation can be notable either because it has achieved fame by itself, but more usually because it was said by someone notable, or appeared in a notable work." I take this to mean that a short quote to illustrate a specific point in Wikipedia should not be entered into Wikiquote, but might be found in wikisource if the original document was there. Having said that, yes, the quotes section should be replaced by the link to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Einstein" class="extiw" title="q:Einstein">q:Einstein</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 20:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The general policy seems to be that detailed discussions of the various physical theories are conducted in their own articles, not in the general Einstein article (which includes just enough about them to orient the reader). For example, the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_constant.html" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a> has its own article. Actually Einstein was not personally involved with either the accelerated expansion of the universe nor the Higgs field. — DAGwyn 08:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, GR has led to many discoveries, such as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_holes.html" title="Black holes">black holes</a>, and it is also in controversy with quantum mechanics, which is very worth noting. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchayakan_1724.html" title="User:Watchayakan">Watchayakan</a> 07:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">General relativity</a> has its own article. Einstein was not personally involved with black holes, either, and I rather doubt that he would have approved of the way that theory has developed. Actually, all classical theories conflict with quantum theory. The problem of constructing a consistent quantum theory of gravitation is quite apart from anything Einstein did. — DAGwyn 08:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I understand (on extensiveness), but mentioning them and their impact on society (even if just the scientific community, but we all know that black holes and curved space have become a big part of pop culture) would seem a good idea, especially considering the fact thet what he claimed was his greatest blunder might turn out to be a very prescient thought. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchayakan_1724.html" title="User:Watchayakan">Watchayakan</a> 11:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still think that the coverage of that topic in the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_constant.html" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a> article is sufficient, and that it would be too much detail for the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> article, which is already way too long. Note also the Schrödinger section of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_unified_field_theories.html" title="Classical unified field theories">classical unified field theories</a> article, where it is observed that in his formulation the cosmological term arises automatically. That article also notes that Eddington thought that there was a natural role for the cosmological constant. If somebody searches for the phrase he should turn up hits on these. I'm especially concerned that we don't give the impression that Einstein approved of black holes nor of modern cosmological ideas. — DAGwyn 22:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
