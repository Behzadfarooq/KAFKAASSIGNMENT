<p>During the Spanish era, the way to travel around Bohol was by sea. Many coastal areas with a sheltered cove or harbor became progressive settlements. Among them was a place called "Lo-oc", Baclayon. As the name implies, it was a sheltered cove good for berthing seacrafts. It was also the breeding place of the "Bulinaw" or anchovie. Since Lo-oc, Baclayon was relatively far from the Poblacion, the people had difficulty in attending Holy Mass during Sundays. To solve the problem, the people thought of the idea of constructing their own chapel and let a priest from Baclayon come to serve the people. Lady Mariona Irag, a prominent lady in the community took the mantle of leadership. In 1842, she requested the parish priest of Baclayon, Fr. Pedro de la Encarnacion, to supervise the construction of the chapel to be built by the people.</p>
<p>The first kapitan of the place was Pedro Jala who lived in the sitio of Carnago and the leader of Segunto. Carnago, a barrio separated from the town. It's name was changed to Sikatuna, in honor of the brave chieftain, Sikatuna, who made a blood compact with Spanish Conquistador, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a> 1968, Gov. General Jose de la Gandara, issued the decree establishing the new town of Alburquerque in its civil jurisdiction. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a> 1868, the Fr. Provincial of the Recollects approved the creation of the town as to its religious jurisdiction. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_18.html" title="June 18">June 18</a> 1869, the Bishop of Cebu in which Bohol was a part of the Diocese, made Alburquerque a separate Diocesan parish. It was advocated to Sta. Monica.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a> 1869 Fr. Tomas Hernandez assumed his post as the first curate Priest of Alburquerque.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Alburquerque%2C_Bohol_a96d.html" title="Edit section: The Name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Name</span></h3>
<p>Formerly this town was called "Sagunto", but in the research of Engr. Jess Tirol in Manila, this town was called "Segunto". Local folklore say that Alburquerque was in honor of Alfonso Alburquerque, the famous seafarer and conqueror of Malaca, Sumatra. But Alburquerque was a Portuguese.</p>
<p>Alburquerque is also a name of a town in the province of Badajoz, region of Extremadura, Spain. In Spanish the word "Albur" means to risk; to venture; to chance. If we would translate Alburquerque, it would mean the chance I wish, or grammatically better, "I wish to venture". Thus we can say, Alburquerque is the town of adventurous people, the folks who do not fear to venture. There is also a place called Albuquerque in the ancient town of Mexico, once a colony of Spain for several years.</p>
<p>Since then, Segunto was changed to Alburquerque and its inhabitants are called Alburanons.<a href="http://www.alburbohol.net/articles.php?id=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alburbohol.net/articles.php?id=9" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>The municipality of Alburquerque covers an area of 28.93 km² or 0.77% of Bohol’s mainland area. It is composed of eleven (11) barangays, from which 5 are located along the coast and 6 inland. The road network shown in Figure 1, is not updated. The central part of municipality, from the east extending toward northwest is characterized by rolling to moderately steep terrain (18-30% slope), with ground elevation ranging from 80 to 131 m amsl. The area in northeastern and southwestern part is characterized by steep terrain (30–50% slope), with ground elevation up to 153 m amsl. The southeastern part is characterized with undulating to rolling terrain (8–18% slope) with ground elevation up to 60 m amsl. The area along the coast is characterized by level to nearly level terrain (0-3% slope), with ground elevation ranging from zero near the coast to 10 m amsl inland. Alburquerque municipality is covered by Hydrosol and three (3) sorts of clay namely, Faraon, Bolinao and Lugo clay. The northern portion of municipality is covered mostly by Lugo clay, the southern half portion is mostly covered by Faraon and Bolinao clay, while Hydrosol has a very limited extent along the coast. For more detailed description of different types of soils refer to Appendix 2. The municipal area is covered by grassland, coconut, shrubs and built-up area. The northern portion is mostly covered with grass, with exception of small area in the northeast, which is covered with shrubs. The southern portion along the coast is covered with coconut, with a small built-up area in the west. The whole Bohol is in the Corona's climate type IV, characterized by evenly distributed rainfall over the year. The average annual rainfall is estimated to 1,627 mm/yr. The average annual rainfall is the sum of the average annual rainfall from respective river basin, multiplied with percentage of respective municipal area within respective river basin.</p>

<p>The population projection is based on 1995 NSO census and the population growth rate from NEDA’s population projection 1980-2030, medium assumption, for every 5 years for urban and rural barangays (for details refer to Table 5.4 in the Report on Physiographic &amp; Socio-Economic Conditions in the Bohol Province).</p>
<p>The 1998 population is estimated to 7,924 (274/km²), which is projected to increase to 7,948 (275/km²) in 2030.</p>
<p>Urban population in 1998 is estimated to 2,888 (36.44% of total). It is projected to increase to 3,861 (48.58% of total) by year 2030. The urban population is located in three barangays namely, East and West Poblacion and Ponong.</p>
<p>The rural population in 1998 is estimated to 5,036 (63.55% of total), which is projected to decrease to 4,087 (51.42% of total) by year 2030.</p>
<p>The potable water demand, including domestic, industrial, institutional and commercial water demands of urban and rural population, is estimated in 1998 to 926 m³/d, which is projected to increase to 1,529 m³/d in 2030. Majority of this water demand (67.4%) in 2030 is for urban population.</p>
<p>The water demand estimated to 65 m³/d, is required to irrigate 0.015 km² of land, located in 1 irrigation system in barangay Ponong.</p>

<p>Several small rivers and creeks, which have their headwaters in the elevated terrain in the northern part, traverse the Alburquerque municipality. These rivers and creeks flow in generally north to south direction and drain the major part of municipality into Bohol Sea. The municipality is located in two major river basins. Tagbuane RB covers the major part of Alburquerque (19.94 km² or 94.64% of municipal area), and Abatan RB covers a small area (1.55 km² or 5.36% of municipal area) on the northern part. The municipality of Albuquerque has a poorly developed drainage system, due to presence of permeable limestone, which covers most of municipal area and enables infiltration of large portion of effective rainfall into underground. This is characteristic for karstified limestone terrain. Surface water runoff (estimated to 304 mm/yr. per km²), is estimated to 24,100 m³/d on the average. The surface runoff is sufficient to satisfy the water demand of 65 m³/d for irrigation purposes. Drainage of Maribojoc limestone through springs, also contributes to the streamflow in rivers and creeks downstream.</p>

<p>The municipality of Alburquerque, 12 kilometers away from Tagbilaran City is a fifth class agricultural locale with an area of about 2,865 hectares, sheltering almost 9,000 inhabitants. The town has natural wonders and micro local industries like the making of calamay, traditional method of manufacturing pottery, and the weaving of raffia using locally made loom. These are just some of the enriching legacies of old time which are being preserved by the Alburanons. With these native industries that evolved from industrious residents with the indigenous materials in the surroundings, Alburquerque is considered as one of the progressive coastal towns in the province of Bohol. Exotic marine sites fascinating upland view are in place to capture nature lover’s profound interest in creation. Unspoiled setting of landscape and seascape would bring one to whimsical atmosphere one has ever fantasized. The Local Government Unit of Alburquerque welcomes and invites everybody to take a sensation on the grandeur of tangible wonders.</p>

Felomina where the beach and the Mangrove Protected Area are located, is being given utmost concern by the Local Government Unit. The sanctuary had been set up in the area selected to be fit for the purpose due to its coral cover. Few months in existence prove to be beneficial to marine ecology and to the community as well. Fish stocks rise and corals started to live up again from the destruction done by illegal fishers. Bamboo rafts has been put in place for the curious observers to set on board for a closer view to marine ecology. It has been considered as a dive site of the municipality for local and foreign tourist visiting the place. In the capacious, sandy, white beach, one can refresh in crystal, blue waters in the area with cottages for rent and verdant, lush mangrove area. To satisfy one’s longing for mother nature in the area, trekking up to Tagbuane River passing through a Forestal Reserve Zone and an abode to other nature’s winged and feathered creature is an added enticement to lissome nature lovers.</p>

Prony, the Python</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Just a few hundred meters is a <i>Python sanctum</i> which is 5 years old in existence with a length of about 22 feet and an estimated weight of about 300 kg. The biggest python in captivity ever known. Named after its captor, Pronie, it loves to eat during feeding time. The winding barangay road leading to the sanctuary and the majestic sights along the course keeps one feel the prime of nature.</p>
<p>The Animal Kingdom Federation, Inc. (AKFI), a SEC registered, non-profit and non-stock animal welfare organization registered with the Animal Welfare Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry recently vowed to build an animal sanctuary here. The AKFI made this commitment after hearing reports on the 25-foot long python locally called baksan, owned by Sofronio Salibay in Barangay Sta. Felomena, has been fed with stray dogs.</p>
<p>The python has caught the attention of many local and foreign tourists, not only for its size but particularly on how it has been fed. It even caught the attention of GMA 7 who sent a crew to document the procedure. Feeding is done during full moon. Alarmed by the reports, AKFI requested Mayor Efren Tungol to stop Salibay from feeding the python with dogs since it is a clear violation of Republic Act No. 8485, otherwise known as the Animal Welfare Act. The Mayor agreed. However, in order to preserve the python, which has become a tourist attraction, AKFI, represented by its Director Charles Wartenberg, sealed a memorandum of support and cooperation with the municipality creating the site as an animal sanctuary. The memorandum, aside from manifesting full implementation of RA 8485, also reiterates the improvement of the cage based on animal welfare standards and introduction of alternative feeding. Creating an animal sanctuary would make Albur the only Animal Welfare Friendly Municipality in the country. AKFI is also associated with the International Wildlife Coalition Trust (IWCT), an internationally recognized organization founded in the United States dedicated to the protection of global wildlife and natural habitat protection.</p>

<p>Some sources say the parish had its beginning as a <i>visita</i> in 1842 when a chapel was built under the direction of the parish priest of Baclayon. The parish advocated to Santa Monica was canonically established on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_18.html" title="June 18">June 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, following royal approval given on November 1868.

<p>Up to the 1880s, the parish church was more like a huge shed. Although it boasted of three aisles, its walls were only of tabique. The present church of coral stone was commenced shortly afterwards, utilizing the same three-aisled plan. However, the upper portions, especially the tower over the facade, were completed during the first half of this century. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the link between the church and the casa parroquial was planned along a grander scale, but never finished. The grotto at the back of the courtyard between the two structures hides a ruin which may be of another unfinished arcade.</p>
<p>Ray Francia signed the church's interior ceiling painting on one side of the choir loft. Another section, now vanished, showed that the painting was carried out from <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a> 1932. As regards the church bells, amongst them in the quadrangular tower are three bells, inscribed with the patron saints of the parish (Santa Monica, San Agustin, and "Calipay" or Joy). Dated 1866, two years before the ecclesiastical recognition of the parish, the bells are mute testimonies to the anxiety of the community in becoming an independent parish.</p>
<p>As to the <i>casa parroquial</i>, the year 1876 is etched over the porta maior. However, in the center of the entrance arches to the steps, the year 1884 could be read until recently.</p>

<p>Household buri weaving project in Basacdacu The weaver processes and weaves her buri cloth at home from local young buri leaves. She produces a roll of 4 place mats joined by a finer buri weave. The Toril barangay captain also buys these for export to Cebu where the place mats are cut from the roll. The weaver gets P14 per place mat (P56 per roll of 4). She also sells the midribs of the buri palm leaf for basket making at P12 for 100, and bundles of bure stems (pawa) to Tagbuane barangay for broom making for P23 a bundle.</p>

<p>The weaving shed in Basacdacu houses 20 looms made by local carpenters, though only 5 were being used at the time of the visit. The municipality of Albur provided funds for construction of the bamboo and zinc-roofed building and the looms.</p>
<p>The "spears" of young buri leaves are now mostly bought from Inabanga municipality using funds from the Self-Employment Assistant Program (SEAP) of the Social Welfare Program. Weavers process the leaves themselves, though colored fibers used for the few 5-inch-square glass coasters made there are bought ready-dyed from Inabanga.</p>
<p>The weavers separate the young buri leaves from the "spears", strip the fiber from them with a knife, bleach them by soaking them in water containing oxalic acid, then sun dry them at their homes. They then tie the fibers in sequence to make long skeins for weaving. At the Center they weave this white buri into 8-meter lengths of cloth, 30 inches wide. The cloth is rolled up as it is woven, and one 8-meter roll takes one person about five days (a working week) of weaving from 9 am to 5 pm at the Center.</p>
<p>The barangay captain of Toril buys 30 rolls of the cloth at a time for P280 per roll. He does not impose a deadline and gives a cash advance for the cloth. He exports this to Cebu from the town of Tubigon from where other orders are sometimes negotiated. The Center once obtained an order for 100 rolls from Manila, but was unable to meet the deadline, and the buyer refused the cloth already made as he considered it of poor quality. In the past the weavers at the Center made the cloth into bags and wall or ceiling-coverings, but no longer do so, probably because the finished product was harder to sell than the rolls of cloth. The only finished products still produced at the Center are coasters, which are sold in Bohol. The main problem the weavers perceive is the difficulty of obtaining markets for their buri cloth.</p>

<p>Buri stems (from Basacdacu, Sikatuna and Loboc at P28 a bundle or P30 a kilogram?) are soaked for 1½ to 2 months until the fibers separate. Mrs. Tubera then dries the fibers in the sun and rejects the darker brown ones, as they are weak. She bends bundles of fiber double over both sides of a wooden peg through the end of a short, thin bamboo pole that forms the handle (P60 for 100 handles), and ties them on with one or two strong fibers. A baton of wood is then placed on each side of the fan of fibers, and the two batons tied to each other at the ends. Cutting the fibers to the same length levels the broom end.</p>
<p>On the larger brushes, an extra bundle of fibers is added to each side of the fan of fibers, and tied in several places to the broom handle by encircling them and the handle with strong plastic twine. A few green or red fibers are included on each side for decoration. The ends of these extra fibers are cut straight on the handle, and the broom is made stronger by sewing through all the fibers across the narrower part of the fan-shaped broom. Small brooms sell individually for P5, larger ones for P12 and the biggest for P18. Mrs. Tubera has an order from a businessman in Poblacion who sends them to Davao, Mindanao. She receives P120 for a dozen medium-sized brooms, and makes 10 dozen per month, so earns P1,200 each month with which she is putting her son through college.</p>
<p>There are 50 households making brooms in the area, and it was not clear whether they all sell to the same middleman.</p>

<p>Salt-making is one of the source of income of some Alburanons. Production begins when the upland farmers plow their fields for rice production. This is because the "asinderos" salt-makers trade their salt for rice in a barter system, and salt production takes about as long as the growth of the rice it will be exchanged for.</p>
<p>The fibrous husks of a large number of coconuts are placed in pits on the landward edge of the mangrove area. These fill with seawater at high tide, and this is retained in the pits for the salt water to be absorbed into the fiber of the husks. (Or perhaps the salt water drains away with each low tide and is replenished with each high tide?) After an unspecified time of soaking, the husks are removed from the salt water and allowed to dry, before being burnt in the center of the salt-making hut to leave a fine ash mixed with salt.</p>
<p>The ashes is then packed in a cone of bamboo about 1½ meters high. Seawater is poured into the top of the cone and leaches out the salt in the ash as it passes through. The water is caught in a wooden trough below the cone. This extra-salty water is then put into very small clay pots, and these pots wedged together in a series of "bridges" across a large gutter made from compacted coconut husk ash. A fire of palm wood is stoked beneath the suspended pots to "cook" the salty water. The water evaporates, leaving the dry salt in the pot. More and more of the super-salty water from the ash-filled cone is continually added to the pots, and the fire kept burning, until the pots are full to the brim with salt. It takes one day to obtain the ash from the dried coconut husks, and 100 pots can be filled with dry salt over the fire in 3 hours.</p>

<p>The pottery-making enterprise is located beside the main road in East Poblacion. Clay is dug from a pit near the sea, and mixed with silicate soil before being ground through the large rollers of an electric mill, in a pit beside the pottery works. This is mixed with water and molded into pots of various sizes and shapes on a potters wheel, rotated by the potter pushing round a car wheel below the turntable with his feet. During our visit simple, straight-sided water pots for poultry were being made in about 2 minutes each. There were tall, large, elegantly shaped pots for storing water, and round-bottomed pots for use in cooking, in the open-sided work shed. Small, round-bottomed pots for salt making are also made.</p>
