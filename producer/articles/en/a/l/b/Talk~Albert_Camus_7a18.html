<p>re The Outsider: <i>Should this not be The Stranger?</i></p>
<hr />
<p>Good question. Literally "L'Étranger", translates as the stranger, but the outsider is the usual accepted translation of the name of this work, and it does so much better seem to sum up the condition of Meursault, the novel's protagonist. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Apparently, the old translation by Stuart Gilbert was called The Outsider. The newer translation by Matthew Ward is named The Stranger. From what I have read, the difference in wording is the subject of some dispute.</p>

<p>Hey... Look at this line: "Camus joined the French Communist Party in 1934, apparently because of the Spanish Civil War, rather than support for Marxist-Leninist doctrine."</p>
<p>This can't possibly be right. The Spanish Civil War began in July of 1936. If Camus joined the French CP in 1934, it would have nothing to do with Spain.

<p>at the end it says: " Each of these people finds meaning in his or her own pursuits and thus lives up to the example of the Greek mythical figure Sisyphus, who was "condemned" to push a boulder up a hill for eternity fully aware that the boulder would simply fall down the hill as soon as he seemingly finished his task."</p>
<p>What Camus wants to remark in that myth is not the absurd in the "condemn". Instead, he shows that, not regarding of why he've left the Hades, Sisyphus sit at the beach to contemplate the beauty of it.</p>

<p>I take some issue with the explication of <i>L'Etranger</i>, particularly the indication that Mersault is a hero in Camus' eyes. I would argue that he is just the opposite; Mersault is guilty of his crime and deserves to die in the absurdist sense, not because he is insensitive, but because he failed to recognize the absurdity of his life and wrest what little control he might have been able from it. In other words, he is guilty for his passivity, which Camus understandably dispised as a member of the resistance in Vichy France. Even Sisyphus, for that one hour that he is walking back down his mountain is free. On the other hand, Caligula is <b>more</b> the hero for following his absurb logic all the way through; at least he does so consciously and willfully.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In a 1955 afterward, Camus makes it pretty clear that he views Mersault as a hero (at least, as much of a "hero" as <i>The Stranger</i> allows for). Moreover, in Camus' eyes (or so he says), Mersault's only crimes are loving the truth and not crying at his mother's funeral. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 20:02, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm after some input from the other people on this page -- does Camus' extended essay, <i><b>Réfléxions sur la guillotine</b></i> deserve its own page? This was, of course, the piece of writing (officially, anyway) that earned him the Nobel Prize; for that reason it seems to me to be a curious omission. Any other opinions on the matter? --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a> | <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a> 02:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'd say the piece deserves its own page. It did earn him the Nobel prize and fighting against the death penalty was an important part of Camus's life. It should at least be mentioned on the main page, right now its only listed in the bibliography section. Windmillchaser 22:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hate to imitate in any way that cruel grammar teacher that everyone had at some point in school, but -- I've noticed a consistent error when citing the French titles of Camus' works. <b>Unlike in English, French titles do not capitalize every word, just the first one</b> as though the title were itself a sentence. (Proper names are, of course, still capitalized.) The only exception here is when the first word happens to be a preposition (i.e. "<i>Le</i>", "<i>La</i>", "<i>Les</i>", etc.), which actually isn't much of an "exception" since virtually every French title will have such a word before it. In this case, the preposition is capitalized along with the "first word of substance". So, in English we would write something like, "<i>The First Man</i>"... In French this would be "<i>Le Premier homme</i>". Or, for a more ridiculous example,</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>English: "<i>The Camus Family's Grammar Lessons</i>"</b><br /></dd>
<dd><b>French: "<i>Les Leçons grammaires du famille Camus</i>"</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't ask me to explain <i>why</i> this is done in French: it's just one of those crazy subtleties of the language.</p>
<p>This is probably irrelevent to most people on this page, and probably considered unimportant by even more. However, it makes sense to me to write the titles properly if they're going to be written in their original French. In any event, I'll still keep an eye out&#160;;) --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a> | <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a> 22:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I owe a great debt of gratitude to Albert Camus for writing "The Myth of Sysyphus," wherein he shows that even in the worst of circumstances, in the pits of hell, one can still have a little fun, win a little moral victory.

And to think I always thought it was about the meaninglessness of life. 208.4.152.130 23:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC) → —The "knowing" smile of Sisyphus was all that Camus had to give us in the middle of all the absurdities of this life. That's how it is to really learn something. We may cover 99.9% of all our travels with total ignorance, but then in an instant--a glimmer of something, an unknown, a point of contact with a reality which we cannot put into words or give away. Emptiness...Camus lived it the best way he could, he didn't just talk it like the existentialist philosophers, the academics did. He's my Man.</p>

<p>"one of the principal luminaries (with Jean-Paul Sartre) of existentialism". I don't think Camus wanted to be called an existentialist or compared to Sartre.

<p>My understanding is that Camus and Sartre agreed about existentialism for a while, but Camus started disagreeing when Sartre got too optimistic and political. I don't think Camus really considered himself a philosopher anyway, so maybe it's misleading to say unqualifiedly at the start of the article that he was a philosopher. That said, some of his essays probably are philosophy. Michael Keats 13:11, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ad Todeswaltzer: Why do you say: "the people involved in this nonsense don't even bother to post comments on this discussion page explaining themselves". It's not one group who does everything. There are too diffrent "people". One is erasing the photo maybe from some "metareasons" (licence etc.) and another one (like me) want to place into this article some <i>cc image</i> (because evidently it's not possible for some reasons - which I don't understand - to put there the photo). To see my reasons, just look on my comment few lines above.<br />
What is essential, it's that I <b>did not replace the photo by the sketch</b>. There was <b>no photo before</b> because someone just erased it (because of its licence), do you understand? The only thing I say it's that <b>the sketch is better than nothing</b>! By deleting the sketch you just make the same nonsense like they do. (when you said "I'll delete the sketch from Wikipedia and hope that that at least makes it more difficult for them.") So keep the sketch there please if they erase the photo again or draw a better one (if you are such a art guru), unless we find another cc image.<br />

<dd>Thank you for the comments; they are much appreciated and it is unfortunate that no one besides you would take the time to explain their position sooner or more clearly. In absence of such explanations, the repeated removal of the photo appears to be petty vandalism -- hence my (and others') reversions to the photo. One point that I would like you to clear up, however: it seems that you're overlooking the fact that the image that was on the page counts as fair use. Furthermore, it looks as though there is widespread agreement that the photo is infinitely better than the sketch. What, then, is your issue with the photo being on this page? --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 22:57, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its pretty clear from the history and the responses above that Alaiche added the drawing in good faith some time ago when there was no image at all - replacing it again when there was no image to speak of in good faith. These kinds of positive acts are what keeps wikipedia alive. The various negative comments surrounding this act of good faith are what makes wikipedia stink. --<a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmusichead_95ae.html" title="User:Mrmusichead">Mrmusichead</a> 03:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mrmusichead, I think you are being unfair to the people who have been discussing the photo/sketch issue here -- and who have been doing so in good faith as well. As I pointed out above, no real explanation had been given as to why the sketch was continually replacing the photo (note that this was <i>after</i> a suitable photo was found) and so, as I also pointed out above, it appeared to be a case of ongoing vandalism. In this light, the actions taken by a number of people on this page were appropriate and their anger understandable. Your comments don't seem to take this into consideration and I don't find them terribly constructive. --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 17:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbert_Camus_7a18.html" title="Edit section: Meaning and the Absurd">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Meaning and the Absurd</span></h2>
<p>I have a couple points of contention with the article, and perhaps someone can defend it before any revisions are contemplated. First, the article's summary on the Absurd states, "If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?" This is strictly incorrect; in his essay, Camus does not assert that life has no meaning, simply that reason cannot lead us to the meaning. We ask the universe for meaning, but it responds only with indifference. We ask the universe for values; it offers us only facts.</p>
<p>Also, in this section it states that "Meursault, the Absurdist hero of L'Étranger, is a murderer who is executed for his crime." However, Mersault is not executed in The Stranger. In fact, near the end, the priest with whom he has his final encounter suggests that his appeal is likely to succeed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for your first point, the claim that Camus saw life as without meaning is quite "<i>strictly</i> incorrect" -- but in a broader, more inclusive sense, I believe it adequately gets the message across to people who are unfamiliar with Camus. In every <i>practical</i> sense, Camus sees life as having no inherent meaning -- as opposed to no meaning whatever -- and his writing advocates that we need to find meaning for ourselves instead of expecting an uncaring universe to bestow it upon us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your second point, I don't understand this interpretation. When I read the novel, it seemed quite obvious to me that Meursault will be executed. Even if the story itself didn't lead up to this inevitability, philosophically, he must be executed if we are to view him as accepting responsibility for his own existence. And in any event, he rejects the preacher most violently, along with any "salvation" he might offer. --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 04:53, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some say Camus had been an atheist, some say he had been an agnostic. What was he?

<dl>
<dd>It's really hard to tell, although to be safe I would lean towards the agnostic side. It seems like he had strong reservations about proclaiming a God, or at least if Camus were to ever meet God, I think that God would be hard pressed to answer some of the questions Camus has lined up for him! c.f. <i>The Plague</i> for a few on human suffering. It would perhaps be best to look for an answer in interviews rather than in his literature. Qzxtvbzr 14:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. In The Fall Jean-Baptiste goes as far as to ridicule "Coffee House Atheists," so I don't think you can really look at his fictional work for answers to that question. I believe many philosophy professors refer to the likes of Camus as "Meditative Atheists." That is to say that while they don't believe in God, they don't mind looking at things from religious perspectives. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.53.239.37_f102.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.53.239.37">67.53.239.37</a> (talk) 17:36, 9 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I have gone over the cultural influences section and changed it from a list to a writeup format, it looks more like an encyclopedic entry, but are all the references notable? I think maybe the songs should be limited to singles or significant mentions or something along those lines, as I don't think this article should list each and every song that mentions Camus or has lyrics that contain themes or words related to his writings.

<p>I suggest restructuring the article into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Life - including info on his birth, family, and death.</li>
<li>Political Career - including all the info on his membership in various political organizations and political writings.</li>
<li>Literary Career - including info on his various publications.</li>
<li>Philosophical views - including info on his views on matters such as the absurd, totalitarianism, the death penalty etc.</li>
<li>Complete Bibliography - no reason naming the section selected bibliography if it is a complete one... If this is too long, maybe split into a separate article, but it seems to me like this isn't too long.</li>
<li>Cultural Influences - only those of notable significance, not every song mentioning something that sounds like absurd.</li>
<li>Further Reading</li>
<li>External Links</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>P.S. This talk page should also be cleaned up, preferably by <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_talk_pages_ad80.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages">refactoring</a>.</p>
