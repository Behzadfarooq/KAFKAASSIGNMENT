<p>Myer was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newburgh%2C_New_York_eb9b.html" title="Newburgh, New York">Newburgh, New York</a>, son of Henry Beekman Myer and Eleanor McClanahan Myer.<sup id="_ref-TX_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TX" title="">[1]</a></sup> The family moved to Western New York and after the death of his mother in 1834, he was raised primarily by his aunt in <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a>. He worked as a telegrapher before entering <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_College_508a.html" title="Geneva College">Geneva College</a> (now <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart_College_fbcf.html" title="Hobart College">Hobart College</a>) in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva%2C_New_York_cc03.html" title="Geneva, New York">Geneva, New York</a>, at age 13.<sup id="_ref-Cameron_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cameron" title="">[2]</a></sup> He received his M.D. degree from <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Medical_College_9165.html" title="Buffalo Medical College">Buffalo Medical College</a> in 1851, while working part time for the New York State Telegraph Company. His doctoral thesis, <i>A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes</i>, showed concepts that he later used for his invention of aerial telegraphy. Although he inherited a large fortune from his family, he was ambitious and intellectually curious. It was said "that he was specially noted for the manner in which he would take hold of an idea or principle, and, following it to its length and breadth, develop all there was in it or of it."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>He engaged in private medical practice in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> and then sought a commission as a U.S. Army assistant surgeon (lieutenant), entering service <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, posted at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Duncan_d948.html" title="Fort Duncan">Fort Duncan</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Davis_National_Historic_Site_7660.html" title="Fort Davis National Historic Site">Fort Davis</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Davis_County%2C_Texas_2cab.html" title="Jeff Davis County, Texas">Jeff Davis County, Texas</a>.<sup id="_ref-TX_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TX" title="">[1]</a></sup> His major interest of the time, besides medicine, was to devise a system of signaling across long distances, using simple codes and lightweight materials. This system of codes using a single signal flag (or a lantern or kerosene torch at night), known as <i>wig-wag</i> signaling or <i>aerial telegraphy</i>, would be adopted and used by both sides in the Civil War and afterwards.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>(Note: Myer's signaling system should not be confused with <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semaphore_%28communication%29.html" title="Semaphore (communication)">semaphore</a> signaling. The wig-wag system used a single flag, waved back and forth in a binary code conceptually similar to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morse_code.html" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>; semaphores used two flags and each character to be transmitted had a unique pattern for holding the flags. Unfortunately for Myer's legacy, the official branch insignia of the U.S. Army Signal Corps depicts crossed semaphore flags.)</p>
<p>In 1858, the Army expressed interest in Myer's invention and appointed a board to examine "the principles and plans of the signalling, mode of use in the field, and course to be pursued in introducing to the army." Myer appeared before the board, chaired by <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lt. Col.</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, in 1859 and convinced them to authorize field testing of his invention. He conducted field tests starting in April of that year around <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Harbor_4e52.html" title="New York Harbor">New York Harbor</a>. The tests were successful and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_War_e0d8.html" title="United States Secretary of War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Floyd_69dd.html" title="John B. Floyd">John B. Floyd</a> recommended to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> that the Army adopt Myer's system and that Myer be appointed as chief signal officer. Congress approved Myer's appointment as major and chief signal officer and the Signal Corps was formed, despite opposition in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> from <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. Myer was sent to the Department of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> for further field trials of his system in a campaign against the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navajo_people.html" title="Navajo people">Navajos</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cameron_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cameron" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_21.html" title="June 21">June 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>, letter from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_War_9516.html" title="United States Department of War">War Department</a> that ordered Myer to organize and command the new U.S. Army Signal Corps provided little of substance. It authorized $2000 for equipment and a promotion for Myer to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a>, effective <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">June 27</a>. Myer was faced with the responsibility of recruiting subordinates who could be detailed from elsewhere in the Army. The Signal Corps would not commence as an official Army organization until <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, at which time Myer was promoted to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a>. Between these two dates, Myer served first under <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Maj.

During this period Myer was awarded a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28military%29.html" title="Brevet (military)">brevet</a> promotion to lieutenant colonel in the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_army.html" title="Regular army">regular army</a> for his actions at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hanover_Courthouse_ef34.html" title="Battle of Hanover Courthouse">Hanover Courthouse</a>, and to brevet colonel for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Malvern_Hill_d0e2.html" title="Battle of Malvern Hill">Malvern Hill</a>.<sup id="_ref-Eicher_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eicher" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ironically, the first use in combat of Myer's signaling system was by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_Army_46d5.html" title="Confederate States Army">Confederate</a> Captain <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Porter_Alexander_cd4b.html" title="Edward Porter Alexander">Edward Porter Alexander</a> at the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run_8962.html" title="First Battle of Bull Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>. Alexander had been a subordinate of Myer's and assisted in the New York field trials.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to his aerial signaling, Myer recognized the need for electrical telegraphy in field communications. He introduced a field telegraph train of wagons to support a device called the Beardslee telegraph, which used a dial instead of a key tapping Morse code, developed to require less training for its operators.</p>
<p>Myer's Signal Corps was actually a separate entity from the Military Telegraph Service, a War Department bureau staffed primarily by civilian telegraph operators. He had numerous organizational disputes with the assistant secretary of war for this function, attempting on several occasions to take control of all telegraphic operations. When he proposed to remove the less than dependable Beardslee device and recruit training telegraphers into the Signal Corps, Secretary of War <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_M._Stanton_648c.html" title="Edwin M. Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a> removed him from his post as chief signal officer<sup id="_ref-Cameron_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cameron" title="">[2]</a></sup> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>,<sup id="_ref-Eicher_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eicher" title="">[5]</a></sup> and reassigned him out of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, effectively exiling him.</p>
<p>While conducting routine reconnaissance of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> from <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo%2C_Illinois_9d7b.html" title="Cairo, Illinois">Cairo, Illinois</a>, to <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, Myer wrote the <i>Manual of Signals for the United States Army and Navy</i>. In June 1864, he was appointed by Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Canby_aa34.html" title="Edward Canby">E.R.S. Canby</a> to be the signal officer of the Military Division of West Mississippi.<sup id="_ref-Eicher_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eicher" title="">[5]</a></sup> Under Canby, Myer added a new duty to the tasks of the Signal Corps by working out a system for interrogating deserters and refugees who came into the Union lines. He also developed a coding system for transmitting routine messages between land and sea forces. He organized communications plans for the operations in the <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile%2C_Alabama_e278.html" title="Mobile, Alabama">Mobile</a> area and participated, with U.S. Navy officers, in the surrender of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Gaines%2C_Alabama_6ccc.html" title="Fort Gaines, Alabama">Fort Gaines</a>.<sup id="_ref-Scheips_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scheips" title="">[7]</a></sup> He served as signal officer for the Department of the Gulf from August 1864 to 1865.<sup id="_ref-Eicher_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eicher" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>While he was preparing for the Mobile campaign, Myer received the disturbing news that his appointment as colonel and chief signal officer, which had been made before his dismissal in 1863, had not been confirmed by the Senate and was revoked, thus returning him to his permanent rank of major. Through early 1865, Myer employed lawyers and political connections to attempt to correct what he perceived as an injustice. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, reacting to the influence of <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_General_%28United_States%29_c665.html" title="Lieutenant General (United States)">Lt.

He was particularly gratified when word of this victory came on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, as his old nemesis, Edwin Stanton, had to inform him of his reinstatement. He was not confirmed in the position until February 1867 and was not ordered to active duty until August 1867. His new duties included control of the telegraph service, resolving the dispute that had removed him from his position.<sup id="_ref-Scheips_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scheips" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Myer received the brevet rank of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a> in honor of his formation of the Signal Corps, effective <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>.
