<p>He was born <b>Albert Henry Knattriess</b> in New Normanton, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derbyshire.html" title="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. As a child his family <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emigration.html" title="Emigration">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and there, his father, Henry Knattriess, changed the family name to "Stanley".</p>
<p>His father worked as a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coachbuilder.html" title="Coachbuilder">coachbuilder</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a> which led Stanley to employment with the Detroit Street Railways Company. An exceptional manager, Stanley was General Superintendent of the company by the time he was 28 in 1902. He later worked for the Railway Department of the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Service_Railway_0fa5.html" title="Public Service Railway">New Jersey Public Service Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">20 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, Stanley was appointed General Manager of the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_Electric_Railways_Company_60cc.html" title="Underground Electric Railways Company">Underground Electric Railways Company</a> of London (UERL). The UERL was the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holding_company.html" title="Holding company">holding company</a> of four underground railway companies in central London. Three of these (<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_and_Metropolitan_District_Railways_cc9e.html#Metropolitan_District_Railway" title="Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways">Metropolitan District Railway</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakerloo_Line_9932.html" title="Bakerloo Line">Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccadilly_Line_a983.html" title="Piccadilly Line">Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway</a>) were already in operation and the fourth (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charing_Cross%2C_Euston_%26_Hampstead_Railway_33fd.html" title="Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway">Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway</a>) was about to open.</p>
<p>The UERL had been established by American financier <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Yerkes_f020.html" title="Charles Yerkes">Charles Yerkes</a> and much of the original finance had been from the United States, so Stanley's experience of managing urban transit systems in that country made him an ideal candidate for the position. The cost of constructing three new lines in just a few years had put the company in a precarious monetary position. Stanley's role was to restore the financies. By improving the integration of the separate companies with the group, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around and, in 1910, he became <a href="../../../m/a/n/Managing_Director_789f.html" title="Managing Director">Managing Director</a> of the company - renamed the London Electric Railway Company but commonly known as the Underground Group.</p>
<p>With Commercial Manager <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Pick_1420.html" title="Frank Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Stanley instigated a plan to increase passenger numbers. Part of this plan was the extension of the existing Underground Group's lines into new, undeveloped areas beyond the central area. The first of these, the extension of the <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakerloo_Line_9932.html" title="Bakerloo Line">Bakerloo Line</a> to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Park_station_1aff.html" title="Queen's Park station">Queen's Park</a> to provide a connection with the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_and_North_Western_Railway_685d.html" title="London and North Western Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>, opened in 1915. The other expansion plans were postponed during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>.</p>
<p>The consolidation of London's underground railways under one management was brought closer by the Underground Group's take over of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Line_b68b.html" title="Central Line">Central London Railway</a> and the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_and_South_London_Railway_22ee.html" title="City and South London Railway">City and South London Railway</a> in 1913. Only the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_and_Metropolitan_District_Railways_cc9e.html#Metropolitan_Railway" title="Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways">Metropolitan Railway</a> (and its subsidiaries the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_City_Line_9d9e.html" title="Northern City Line">Great Northern Railway</a> and the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_London_Railway_f81f.html" title="East London Railway">East London Railway</a>) and the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo_%26_City_Line_28b5.html" title="Waterloo &amp; City Line">Waterloo &amp; City Railway</a> remained outside of the Underground Group's control.</p>
<p>In 1914 Stanley was <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_Bachelor_b301.html" title="Knight Bachelor">knighted</a> in recognition of his services to transport. In 1916 he became <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Unionist</a> <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashton-under-Lyne_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_48d2.html" title="Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)">Ashton-under-Lyne</a> at a <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashton-under-Lyne_by-election%2C_1916_f367.html" title="Ashton-under-Lyne by-election, 1916">by-election</a>. He held the cabinet post of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Trade_and_Industry_1b9e.html" title="Secretary of State for Trade and Industry">President of the Board of Trade</a> in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lloyd_George_0b0a.html" title="David Lloyd George">Lloyd George's</a> government from <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">10 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">26 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>.</p>
<p>On leaving the government he returned to his role as Managing Director of the Underground Group and also became its Chairman. In the 1920 New Year Honours,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> he was created <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Ashfield_dcfd.html" title="Baron Ashfield">Baron Ashfield of Southwell in the County of Nottingham</a>, ending his term as a MP. With Stanley back at the Underground Group, he and Pick reactivated their expansion plans and one of the most significant periods in the organisation's history began, subsequently sometimes called "The Golden Age".</p>
<p>The Central London Railway was extended to <a href="../../../e/a/l/Ealing_Broadway_station_de37.html" title="Ealing Broadway station">Ealing Broadway</a> in 1920, The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway was extended to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendon_Central_tube_station_a9cd.html" title="Hendon Central tube station">Hendon</a> in 1923 and to <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgware_tube_station.html" title="Edgware tube station">Edgware</a> in 1924. The City and South London Railway was reconstructed with larger diameter tunnels to take modern trains between 1922 and 1924 and extended to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morden_tube_station.html" title="Morden tube station">Morden</a> in 1926. In addition a process of modernising many of the Underground's busiest central London stations was started; providing them with <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escalator.html" title="Escalator">escalators</a> to replace <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">lifts</a>. New rolling stock was gradually introduced with automatic sliding doors at points along the length of the carriage instead of manual end gates. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building was constructed at <a href="../../../5/5/_/55_Broadway%2C_London_40f0.html" title="55 Broadway, London">55 Broadway</a> over <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James%27s_Park_tube_station_c54a.html" title="St. James's Park tube station">St. James Park station</a>.</p>
<p>In 1928 Stanley relinquished the role of Managing Director to Pick, retaining the position of Chairman. Having long seen the need for an integrated transport system in London, he was, with <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport_2ef6.html" title="Secretary of State for Transport">Transport Minister</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Morrison_d253.html" title="Herbert Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, instrumental in the foundation of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%27s_transport_history_from_1933.html#London_Passenger_Transport_Board_1933-1948" title="London's transport history from 1933">London Transport Passenger Board</a> (LTPB), responsible for managing all London's transportation needs. He served as the organisations chairman from its establishment in 1933, with Pick as Managing Director.</p>
<p>The opening of extensions of the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccadilly_Line_a983.html" title="Piccadilly Line">Piccadilly Line</a> to <a href="../../../u/x/b/Uxbridge_tube_station.html" title="Uxbridge tube station">Uxbridge</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hounslow_West_tube_station_79af.html" title="Hounslow West tube station">Hounslow</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockfosters_tube_station.html" title="Cockfosters tube station">Cockfosters</a> followed in 1933 and of the <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakerloo_Line_9932.html" title="Bakerloo Line">Bakerloo Line</a> in 1939.

<p>In 1948, the year Stanley died, the LTPB was <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalization.html" title="Nationalization">nationalised</a> along with the majority of British railway, bus, road haulage and waterway concerns. The LTPB became the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Transport_Executive_e99e.html" title="London Transport Executive">London Transport Executive</a> under the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Commission_2c69.html" title="British Transport Commission">British Transport Commission</a>.</p>
<p>During his forty-year tenure as Managing Director and Chairman of the Underground Group and the LTPB, Stanley oversaw the transformation of a collection of unconnected, competing railway companies in severe financial difficulties into a coherent and well managed transport organisation, internationally respected for its technical expertise and design style.</p>
<p>In addition to his management of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> and brief political career, Stanley held directorships of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Bank_c412.html" title="Midland Bank">Midland Bank</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Chemical_Industries_df64.html" title="Imperial Chemical Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI). During the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, he was <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Force_b323.html" title="Territorial Force">Territorial Force</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer_and_Railway_Staff_Corps_b5f2.html" title="Engineer and Railway Staff Corps">Engineer and Railway Staff Corps</a>.</p>
<p>A memorial to Stanley was erected at 55 Broadway in 1950 and a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_plaque.html" title="Blue plaque">blue plaque</a> was placed at his home, 43 South Street, <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayfair.html" title="Mayfair">Mayfair</a> in 1984. It reads:</p>

<p>A large office building at London Underground's Lillie Bridge Depot is named Ashfield House in his honour.
