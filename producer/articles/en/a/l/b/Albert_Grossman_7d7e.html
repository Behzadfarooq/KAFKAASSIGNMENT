<p><b>Albert Bernard Grossman</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> -- <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>) is best known as the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talent_manager.html" title="Talent manager">manager</a> of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>.</p>
<p>Albert B. Grossman was born in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> on May 21, 1926, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants who worked as tailors. He attended <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lane_Technical_High_School_f1e0.html" title="Lane Technical High School">Lane Technical High School</a> and graduated from <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt_University_a77a.html" title="Roosevelt University">Roosevelt University</a>, Chicago, with a degree in economics, though he is also said to have studied child psychology under <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Bettelheim_a13a.html" title="Bruno Bettelheim">Bruno Bettelheim</a> (later the author of the pioneering work <i>The Uses of Enchantment</i>, a 1970s study of the inherent psychological wisdom of the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairytale.html" title="Fairytale">fairytale</a>). Perhaps this helped Grossman to psych people out, which he was extremely good at, in his later business dealings in the music industry.</p>
<p>After university he worked for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Housing_Authority_387b.html" title="Chicago Housing Authority">Chicago Housing Authority</a>, leaving in the late 1950s in unclear circumstances—it is often suggested that he was fired for misconduct—to go into the club business. Seeing folk star <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Gibson_%28musician%29_74b4.html" title="Bob Gibson (musician)">Bob Gibson</a> perform at the Off Beat Room in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> prompted Grossman’s idea of a ‘listening room’ to showcase Gibson and other talent, as the folk revival movement grew. The result was the <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gate_of_Horn_0336.html" title="Gate of Horn">Gate of Horn</a> in the basement of the Rice Hotel, where Jim (later <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_McGuinn_e636.html" title="Roger McGuinn">Roger</a>) McGuinn got his early inspiration and kicked off his career as a 12-string guitarist. Grossman moved into managing some of the acts who appeared at his club, and in 1959, with Boston-based club owner <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wein_dc43.html" title="George Wein">George Wein</a>, who had founded the Newport Jazz Festival, Albert started up the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_Folk_Festival_afb3.html" title="Newport Folk Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a>. ‘The American public,’ he told <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Shelton_7c32.html" title="Robert Shelton">Robert Shelton</a>, ‘is like Sleeping Beauty, waiting to be kissed awake by the prince of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_Music_e86e.html" title="Folk Music">Folk Music</a>.’</p>
<p>He was a pudgy man with derisive eyes, with a regular table at Gerde’s Folk City from which he surveyed the scene in silence, and many people loathed him. In a milieu of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Left_1a8c.html" title="New Left">New Left</a> reformers and folkie idealists campaigning for a better world, Albert Grossman was a breadhead, seen to move serenely and with deadly purpose like a barracuda circling shoals of fish. Other people—among them Jones and Howard Alk—liked him, finding him loyal, flexible and tolerant, polite and considerate on a personal level and possessed of a dry sense of humour. Either way, he protected those whose careers he managed, building them up, gaining them far more of their dues and defending their interests more fiercely than the nicer, more amateurish managers in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Village_91fa.html" title="Greenwich Village">Village</a>. His clients included Bob Gibson and Hamilton Camp, <a href="../../../o/d/e/Odetta.html" title="Odetta">Odetta</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter%2C_Paul_and_Mary_9be8.html" title="Peter, Paul and Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lee_Hooker_e754.html" title="John Lee Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a>, <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_and_Sylvia_f7e7.html" title="Ian and Sylvia">Ian and Sylvia</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lightfoot_f3f9.html" title="Gordon Lightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Havens_f15d.html" title="Richie Havens">Richie Havens</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Rundgren_d96f.html" title="Todd Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_86d7.html" title="The Band">The Band</a>, the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Flag_5b5f.html" title="Electric Flag">Electric Flag</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janis_Joplin_70f1.html" title="Janis Joplin">Janis Joplin</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. Sometimes he advertised that he was managing an act before they knew it themselves (as for instance in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> Newport Folk Festival programme, when <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mimi_Fari%C3%B1a_bfab.html" title="Mimi Fariña">Mimi</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Fari%C3%B1a_b694.html" title="Richard Fariña">Richard Fariña</a>—and their manager—were surprised to find their names on Grossman’s list of clients).</p>
<p>He moved in on Bob Dylan’s career very early — secretly his manager by the time he encouraged <a href="../../../i/z/z/Izzy_Young_b017.html" title="Izzy Young">Izzy Young</a> to lay out the money to hire Carnegie Chapter Hall for Dylan’s launch there in November 1961, though not officially in place as manager until August 20, 1962— and some speculate that Dylan might not have broken through so quickly if Grossman had not been wheeling and dealing for him. Nor can it be denied that he accommodated this most intelligent, difficult hustler of a client superbly—giving him space, not only figuratively but literally too, out at his house near <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodstock_%28town%29%2C_New_York_2819.html" title="Woodstock (town), New York">Woodstock</a> (where Daniel Kramer photographed him so memorably in early 1965), and never telling him, as others were quick to do, that he should stay where he was artistically, or stay sober, or play safe.</p>
<p>Grossman is to be seen in all his stealthy pomp, like the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire_cat.html" title="Cheshire cat">Cheshire cat</a> without its grin, oozing in and out of the scenes of <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Dont_Look_Back_3755.html" title="Dont Look Back">Dont Look Back</a></i> as he guides Dylan through his 1965 British tour and out the other side into superstardom. In 1969 he built the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearsville_Studios_2402.html" title="Bearsville Studios">Bearsville Recording Studio</a> near Woodstock, and in 1970 founded <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearsville_Records_da74.html" title="Bearsville Records">Bearsville Records</a>. He had a finger in every possible pie, taking his percentage from venues and festivals his clients played, from their fees and royalties, from their music publishing, from the studios they recorded in, from the record labels that released their work, and sometimes from the houses they rented out of town.</p>
<p>By this time he was coming to the end of his association with Dylan. But he guarded Dylan’s premium value to the end. At the Isle of Wight Music Festival in August 1969, by this time with his long hair in a ponytail (a rare sight on a man in his 40s), he was prowling around the hospitality tents ahead of Dylan’s appearance. Asked if he’d heard the rumours that various members of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> were going to join him on stage, he replied, sotto voce: ‘Of course the Beatles would like to join Dylan on stage; I should like to fly to the moon.’ Bob Dylan has never been given that level of guardianship since. The contracts between them were officially dissolved on July 17, 1970.</p>
<p>There are two interesting comments on Grossman in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Scorsese_e0ab.html" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> film <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Direction_Home_4354.html" title="No Direction Home">No Direction Home</a></i>. One is Dylan’s: ‘He was kind of like a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_Tom_Parker_e32c.html" title="Colonel Tom Parker">Colonel Tom Parker</a> figure... you could smell him coming.’ The other is John Cohen’s: ‘I don’t think Albert manipulated Bob, because Bob was weirder than Albert.’</p>
<p>Albert Grossman died of a heart attack while flying on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a> to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> on January 25, 1986. He is buried behind his own Bearsville Theater near Woodstock, New York. His widow Sally, ne´e Bueler, an ex-New York City waitress whom he’d married in 1964, and who is the woman in red on the front cover of <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bringing_It_All_Back_Home_1fe5.html" title="Bringing It All Back Home">Bringing It All Back Home</a></i>, continued to oversee his domain after his death. In 2004, reportedly, she began to sell off some of her late husband’s holdings, including the theatre complex, the Bearsville restaurant and the studios.</p>
