<p>Some of the political analyst says that dissolving the congress is just a Constitutional infraction, because in other countries the president has the power to dissolve the congress, and in Peru not. Fujimori, at that time, was in power and was elected in voting; then, he was a constitutional president with all the powers to make some changes. 10 Aug 2003</p>

<dd>Other countries react with worry. The OEA, ask Fujimori to call for elections and re constitute the Peruvian congress. Fujimori did, and he won the biggest number of sits on that congress (Congreso Constituyente Democratico). Fujimori, according to the polls, had a 80% approval.</dd>

I will put the {{npov}} notice again. I believe that this article is strongl biased against Fujimori.

<p>I must say that most of this article is clearly parcial and doesn¬¥t present an equal point of view aobut Fujimori. I believe that more research is needed before writing something agains a political figure or former statesman. Also, this article is clearly more focus in promoting him as "evil" rather than something more accurate.

<p>I just saw that somebody remove the "Disputed Article" of the Page, and I decide to take action about it. First them all, I believe that this article is higly biased against the former president, since it lacks to present an NPOV.</p>
<p>I will explain them steep by steep:</p>
<p>- The self-coup was made in order to remove APRA and FREDEMO from power. Until 1992, Fujimori couln'd get any piece of legislation to pass Congress. The APRA was making this in order to have another chance to get elected in the 1995 elections, after a "failed" Fujimori Government.</p>
<p>- The Fujishock did not created a social disaster in Peru. It was proved that betwen 1989 and 1990, the Garcia Government artifially keep the prices of most basically needed products in order to create a sence of "stability" and at least give the party enough votes in congress to avoid being investigate. The Fujishock was the elimination of government subsides on this. Unfortunately, when the subsides dissapeared, the real cost was show.</p>
<p>- Terrorist activities that does not involved him where deleted</p>
<p>- He did not run away from Peru: He was representing Peru on a International Forum that was located in Brunei. The real motive for his self exile in Japan is that opposition parties already have control of the congress, and they were ready to impeach him. He submit his resignation, but this was rejected in a really controvertial vote on congress.</p>
<p>- The level of corruption during his government was high, but it was not the biggest in the country. The Garcia Administration was far more corrupt than his government.</p>
<p>- the ressecion on Peru was also caused by the Asian Crisis on 1997. At that point, Peru stop to grow. Privatisation was mostly of inefficient government owned companies. (i know this fact becouse my father worked in ENTEL, the telephone state company during the 80's and later on Telefonica)</p>
<p>- I don't think that the foreign opinions about the self coup add a NPOV. I see them as an attemp to create a sence that he use illegal force to seised power.</p>
<p>- Interpol image is of poor quality. If you have a good picture of Fujimori (as President) please put it here. If you want to put the interpol image, at least one of better quality.</p>
<p>About the accusation, I wouldn't count as a serious investigation the ongoing ones by the Toledo Government, since it has a poorly sence of Justice: Former President Alan Garcia is free to walk in the streets of Lima, even that he face crimes such as the Fronton Massacre. After 4 years, Accusations are the only thing that they have. Fujimori has not being condem of any of those.</p>

<dd>This progress on <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> is remarkable, i support you.Many people with no knowledge of Peruvian Politics may be badly informed about events in the 1990's on fujimori era over the internet write this kind of articles with a point of view clearly unaccurate and with rotten intentions.It is obviously known the current Government use it as a shield to excuse its own mistakes.As peruvian citizen and universitarian student i must say there isn't actually a perfect gobernment without any trace of corruption, i agree with you about the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunei.html" title="Brunei">Brunei</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forum.html" title="Forum">Forum</a>, it must said that if he could decided to come back to Peru it woulded be a treat to his personal integrity and of course the congress it wouldn't be impartial to made an appropiate judgment.</dd>

<li>We cant say former president Fujimori was a political figure outside of assistance by Montesinos, however it is well known Montesinos was the power behind the figure of Fujimori doing many kinds of crimes against humanity, hopefully Montesinos is behind the bars now, as a criminal. (Declarations from him must be completely examinated, <b>as his declarations are completely untrustable and unrealiable</b>).</li>
<li>Facts about Fujimori are completely wrong, many opposers believe he was a man who used his etnicity to come to power to then take wealth and return to Japan, and obviously this point of view it was reflected on the previous version, the fact is six years of investigation on Fujimori supposed crimes, none of them could be appropiate explained <b>no evidence</b> could be found until today.</li>

<dd>Sorry, I am not interested in debating Peruvian partisan politics in this forum. The facts about Fujimori are well known and documented, and that is what the bulk of this article should contain, as well as a small amount of space for presenting various interpretations of those facts. Politicians are politicians; most of them are corrupt or incompetent, albeit in Peru or any other country. If Peru had a extradition treaty with Japan, Fujimori would now be behind bars, where he belongs, sharing the view of the Callao harbor with Guzm√°n and Montesinos, and answering for his crimes like the two of them. And if he ever returns to Peru, he will be arrested, no? As for the privatizations, it was well-documented, <i>in the Peruvian media</i>, that of the some seven billion dollars raised by privatizations during the Fujimori era, only one billion ended up in the Peruvian treasury; the rest got spent on election campaigns, bribes, etc. Moreover, many of those state-owned enterprises, like the Cerro de Pasco mines, which I have visited, were sold far below market value to Fujimori's cronies, who have made a forture exploiting them. In a country as poor as Peru, that really <i>is</i> a crime. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 21:53, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that you are talking in that way clearly show your lack of information about Peruvian Politics. Behind bars is a strong word to use, and in fact, you are no judge or jury to decide who belongs there and who does not. Besides that, Comparing Abimael Guzman (A mad man that torn apart my country for nearly 10 years) also show how pathetic is your efforts for demonize Fujimori. As of Montesinos, I'm sure he is cooperating, giving soooooo much information to the actual government that they destroy almos the political career of everyone who is against the Toledo Administration. Documented Media??? what Media are you talking about??? Since when the "Peruvian Media" is independent? Oh, I'm sure that is "FAIR AND BALANCE" as in American, isn't it?. May I remaind you that unfortunately Latin America medias are highly controversial?.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides that, here in Peru, We don't need your pitty. Poor or not, This country rise up after the economical suicide that the Garcia Government left us. Fujimori was only a small part of that. If you have lived in Peru during the 80's, I'm pretty sure you will not talk so freely about this. Let's put Garcia in the Jail where he belongs if that was the case. Oh, by the way, did you know that most of the peruvian mines are owned by American Transnationals since the Government of Fernando Belaunde? And that Most State Owned Companies where saturated with APRA Party members during the Garcia Government that made them almost inefficient? I'm sure you ignore those facts.</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like you to explain a number of the assertions you want to add to this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In late 2000, while representing Peru in a International Conference in Japan, he submitted his resignation by fax.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In everything I have read about Fujimori, I have never heard anything about a conference as his reason for going to Japan. Could you please provide a reference? A link to an article in online mainstream news site would be best.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fujimori call for early elections, wich were due to be held on April 2001. He also stated that he will not be one of the candidates, since he will transfer the Government to the next President elected.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Are you saying he called for this election from Japan, after he had fled from Peru? This is the first time I have heard of this. A citation please.</p>
<p>Also, you want to remove this text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>many in hastily and poorly-organized privatizations. Of the estimated $9 billion raised in the process, only a small part ever benefited the Peruvian people; much of the money raised disappeared in Fujimori's patronage machine.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>These were the findings of a congressional investigation led by Peruvian congressman Javier Diez Canseco in 2002. Do you deny these findings?</p>
<p>And you want to remove this text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>it did so at tremendous social cost; it generated massive poverty and pushed Peru's economy into a deep recession from which it has yet to recover.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The last time I looked, the poverty rate of Peru was about 55%, with some 15% living in <i>extreme</i> poverty. These figures are a lot worse than they were in 1990. What is the current unemployment rate in Peru? Is it even possible to measure it? We both know that the recent growth rates have been due to mining activities, a notoriously capital intensive activity, and one of little of any benefit for the vast majority of Peruvians (the profits leave the country). If Peru is not in a recession, then the word has no meaning.</p>
<p>And you want to remove this text:</p>

<dd><i>Despite a constitutional prohibition of a third term of office, Fujimori insisted in declaring his candidacy for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> elections.</i></dd>

<p>Are you insisting that a third term <i>was</i> permissible under the consitituion of Peru?</p>

<dd><i>It emerged in 2002, on the basis of forensic investigation and testimony of witnesses, that only one of the 14 rebels actually died in the assault; the others surrendered peacefully but were summarily executed by the commandos on the order of Vladimiro Montesinos.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Forensic investigations determined that the thirteen were executed in cold blood, and this was confirmed by eyewitnesses; this report was published in <i>La Republica</i> on 20 May 2002. Here is an excerpt:</p>

<dl>
<dd>Los comandos que el 22 de abril de 1997 rescataron a los 71 rehenes de la casa del embajador japon√©s en Lima "fueron instruidos para disparar a los subversivos en una parte vital del cuerpo", afirm√≥ el general del EP Jos√© William Zapata, quien estuvo al mando de la preparaci√≥n militar del los miembros del "Comando Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar". William explic√≥ que la t√©cnica que utilizaron los militares que participaron en la acci√≥n fue la de disparar a los subversivos hasta asegurarse de que est√©n "fuera de combate".</dd>

<p>Although I realize that Fujimori cannot be held responsible for all the actions of Montesinos, in this particular case, as you may recall, Fujimori took explict credit for the outcome, posing for the press amidst the bodies of the dead rebels.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">For Viajero</span></h2>
<p>Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:</p>
<p>- Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori¬¥s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.</p>
<p>- <b>16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participar√°. (Reuters y Dpa)</b>. Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video.</p>
<p>- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.</p>
<p>- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy.</p>
<p>- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.</p>
<p>- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.</p>
<p>- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.</p>
<p>Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here. OH, and by the way, Please, before reverting something please stated why are you reverting it. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 15:19, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

There are some reasons reflected in this article that lacks of neutrality point of view, users like viajero are trying to confuse people over the internet. There are no accurate proves what facts are just accusations without fundaments, which indeed is like among traitors, such as <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruto.html" title="Bruto">Bruto</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>President Alberto Fujimori accepted to let to public knowledge his accounts on foreing banks, proving he is innocent.</li>
<li>All acussations have submitted a large scale of nonsense journalist attacks from big newspapers to over small pages on internet, and even portals of knowledge like Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Peruvian congress has useless investigated Fujimori without having a real prove, what they all have as same as media on Peru are entirely accusations without arguments.</li>
<li>Peruvian prosecutor Ugaz and his 30 member tean have been a useless investigation too, even to the cinism to see what was hinded behind the old house of Fujimori - Higuchi couple.</li>
<li>It is impossible to have so many delits as press say, facing this fact, without leaving any evidence of the crime, THE perfect robber? i dont think so.</li>
<li>Even Montesinos could have said any appropiate argument or just any clue against him, just yada yada yada ~</li>
<li>All the accusations against Fujimori have been done in base or arguments said by criminals and people on jail, obvious pressed by circumstanses. Such as ms. Pinchi Pinchi former Montesinos assistant which obviously does only for attracting mass media attention.</li>
<li>If all those arguments about the accounts Fujimori has, who know where they are?</li>
</ul>
<p>6 years have already passed and there is no clue, we know about other so called presidents such as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Toledo_4a48.html" title="Alejandro Toledo">Alejandro Toledo</a> which indeed they are guilty of borrowing money from national treasury to favoring his family.</p>
<ul>
<li>Obviously the monarchy of Japan has analysed all this information against him, and knowing there is no arguments that has proves or evidence, let him stay in his <i>heart-motherland</i></li>
<li>Peruvian politics such as Weisman even said Mig 29 were scrap, hopefully he admitted his mistake, and even said he wouldn't wish to said that.</li>
<li>About the gold ingots all is entirely false, based on proves by the BCR (Peruvian National Treasury Bank) , the institution proved there was no evidence that even a singe gold <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingot.html" title="Ingot">ingot</a> could be left.</li>
<li>About the welfare retirements found , it is well known by media was already in shrink crisis since 15 years ago.</li>
<li>It is impossible to use the word criminal to a president that let Peruvian wealth and stability came after 100 years of reining corruption and insiduous wars internal and external ones.</li>
<li>President Fujimori has a universitarian title and studied in one of the most prestigious universities in the science field in Peru (<a href="../../../u/n/i/Universidad_Nacional_de_Ingenier%C3%ADa_a0da.html" title="Universidad Nacional de Ingenier√≠a">UNI</a> - Engieenering and Science National University), and even has been a tv personality during the <a href="../../../8/0/27/80%27s.html" title="80's">80's</a>, a simple man, industrious, does this seems a figure to a criminal to you?.</li>
<li>Criminals are those who died on Japanese embassy in 1997 trying to let old and extinguished and rotten ideals from comunism back alive, they were terrorist which they kill people without asking, or even doing any judgement.</li>
<li>Montesinos managed by himself all by his interest, money he earned all these years has been adquired by insiduous operations held alongside drug and gun traffickers, and if you want a criminal there you got, hopefully as i stated he is behind the bars where he belongs.</li>

<p>Well people among on wikipedia, it's time to face the facts, never a single man in peruvian history was investigated so far like Fujimori.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lengthy essays not helpful</span></h2>
<p>These alternating, lengthy essays are not very helpful in letting anyone who is not deeply engaged in this article sort out the (apparently several) matters under contention. I'll attempt to start a list of disagreements as to what the article should say, so that each can actually be discussed, but up till now I've had no involvement in the article, so I probably will not be able to do this comprehensively. Please, intersperse your comments relative to particular issues. Also, I strongly suggest that in matters where there is disagreement, we need to rely heavily on clearly cited sources. It is fully possible, indeed often desirable, for Wikipedia to indicate that disagreement exists on certain matters, and to cite the most authoritative view on each side. It is rarely appropriate to delete one authority's opinion in a controversial matter simply because another authority disagrees. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:44, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Joe, for my part, I would like to see citations in support of two assertion of Messhermit:
<ol>
<li>that Fujimori left Peru to go to Japan to attend an "international conference",</li>
<li>that the international warrant for Fujimori's arrest issue by Justice Minister Fausto Alvarado was later retracted</li>

<p>Yes I have them. This will finally settle down the issue about the Brunei Conference:</p>
<p>"Habiendo salido del pa√≠s para asistir a una reuni√≥n internacional en Brunei, Alberto Fujimori anunci√≥ desde el Jap√≥n su renuncia a la presidencia de la Rep√∫blica el 19 de noviembre. Dos d√≠as despu√©s, el 21 de noviembre, el Congreso de la Rep√∫blica decidi√≥ no aceptar su renuncia, declarando la vacancia de la presidencia por incapacidad moral, asumiendo entonces el cargo el Presidente del Congreso, Sr. Valent√≠n Paniagua Corazao."</p>

Two days later, November 21, the Congress of the Republica decided not to accept his resignation, declaring the vacancy of the presidency on account of moral incapacity, with the President of the Congress, Sr. Valent√≠n Paniagua Corazao, then assuming the charge [that is, taking on the responsibilities of the position]."</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is more accurate:</p>
<p>"Luego de asistir en noviembre a la Cumbre de L√≠deres del Foro de Cooperaci√≥n Econ√≥mica Asia-Pac√≠fico, celebrada en Brunei, pa√≠s del sureste asi√°tico, Fujimori hizo una escala en Jap√≥n, tierra natal de sus padres. El 20 de noviembre, luego de que la oposici√≥n tom√≥ el control del Congreso, Fujimori envi√≥ su renuncia por fax al Congreso desde la habitaci√≥n de un hotel en Tokio. El Congreso rechaz√≥ la renuncia y declar√≥ a Fujimori como incapacitado moralmente para ejercer el cargo. El pol√≠tico moderado Valent√≠n Paniagua fue juramentado dos d√≠as despu√©s."</p>

Congress rejected the resignation and declared Fujimori to be morally incapacitaed to exercise the charge [of the office].

</ul>
<p>Regarding about the warrant</p>
<p>"Interpol had suspended an earlier warrant for Fujimori on February 27 (2003) after asking Peruvian officials to provide evidence tying the former president to a paramilitary death squad and to demonstrate the charges were not politically motivated"</p>
<p>"A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ministry had not confirmed the Interpol order and added that Tokyo had not received any extradition request for Fujimori from Peru."</p>

<li>Messhermit, you seem to be misunderstanding the nature of Wikipedia. It is not a matter of <i>proving</i> that he was a dictator, it is a matter of citing someone reasonably authoritative as saying so, and being clear whom you are citing. And if <i>you</i> have a comparable citation to the contrary, then that also belongs in the article. Where there is a difference of opinion, we try to represent the clearest statements of all sides.<br /></li>

<li>The constitution of 1993 is not retroactive. That is a fact.

<li>Messhermit, I don't see your point here. I assume there is no question of the authenticity of the photo, or of the fact that Fujimori deliberately put himself in the position for it to be taken. Given that, what, precisely, is the argument against using it. "Controversial" can't simply mean "I don't like it". It has to mean that there is actual controversy, based on some principle, such as factuality, editorial standards, etc. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:25, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Totally Disagree. The Garcia Administration was by far the most corrupt government in Peruvian history, with massive Human Right Violations and Corruption (Remember the "Dollar MUC"?).

<p>Messhermit, a few of your comments seem to assume that I am going to write things into the article. Except for fixing grammar, etc., I intend mostly to stay out of trying to write this myself. My chosen role here is to enumerate the points of disagreement, try to facilitate the process of reaching agreement on at least some of them, and make comments on things where I have an opinion.

Reich formul√≥ estas declaraciones a prop√≥sito de las informaciones de un posible rebrote del terrorismo en el Per√∫, cuyo gobierno tiene una popularidad de menos del 10%. Por otro lado, el congresista Luis Iberico (FIM) calific√≥ de presi√≥n inaceptable la huelga de hambre declarada por los cabecillas subversivos recluidos en la base naval del Callao.

<dd>It <i>would</i> be appropriate to say that MRTA is characterized by the UK, US, EU, and the Peruvian government as a terrorist group. It would <i>not</i> be appropriate to say blindly that they <i>are</i> a terrorist group.</dd>

<dd>As for Lori Berenson "even the Devil can quote scripture". If, for example, her site reproduces a document, it is perfectly valid to cite it, just as it would be perfectly valid to cite a document posted on a right-wing paramilitary sympathizer's site. The fact that a Reuters' dispatch is quoted on Berenson's site doesn't invalidate the fact that it is a Reuters' dispatch, unless your claim is that it had been misquoted.

It worried me that your previous statement failed to provide a reasonable answer and also try to gave a distortionated POV about this. Excusing those who use Terror to achieve its political goals (Most of the Wolrd would agree that it doesn't matter if they are Right-Wing, Left-Wing, Anarkist, Eco-Terrorist or whatever) is wrong. Period. Peruvians are very concern and don't forgot about what Sendero and the MRTA truly are: Terrorist Organizations. What type of "rebels" plant car-bombs on Neighboors? Maybe you don't know about the Talara Bombing on Lima, or the destrucction of elecctric towers, leaving the capital withouth electricity for hours, and more recently, another carbomb during the visit of George Bush on 2001. It is sad to see how some people can get trick by those murders and even get defended. If you are so concern with the "neutrality" that the word Terrorism, go ahead and also modify the West Bank Article. And most other article that talk about that. The fact that you are using a double morale to defend this is clearly POV. Regarding Lori Berenson, Most of us don't forget her defient words, claiming that he was supporting a revolution. I can't see how her oppinions can be of any use in achieving a NPOV, but only to add controversy. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 09:07, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are very, very few hard and fast rules in Wikipedia. There are, however, a number of useful guidelines for handling controversial topics, such as <i>terrorism</i> (see <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words to avoid</a>). A substantial number of editors, such as Joe and me, prefer to avoid labelling people "terrorist" for reasons explained on that page and discussed at great length on many Talk pages; namely, that it is not a objective, scientific term and it depends largely on your point of view. My preference is to avoid using it where possible and use the worda "rebel" and "militant", and to speak instead of "terrorist acts", which is less ambiguous. How about simply presenting the facts and letting readers be the judge of whether people are "terrorists"? It is a form of intellectual laziness to simply moralize about these phenomena; it is far more useful to try to understand them. It would, IMO, behoove you to spend less time ranting about SL and MRTA and more time understanding why they came into being. Indeed, SL and MRTA have been erradicated, but the societal problems that led to their creation have not been addressed, and in fact today Peru is demonstrably worse off in many ways than it was ago in the 1970a. So, theoretically at least, it is possible that violent revolution returns to Peru some day. This time you managed to destroy it. Next time, it might destroy you.</dd>
<dd>As for the use of term "terrorist" in Middle East articles, this is and has been an extremely controversial matter for as long as Wikipedia has existed. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 14:42, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Judges all over the world have already condemn the actions of MRTA and SEndero. They have label them of terrorist and even Narco-terrorism (just like the FARC's) Of course, the fact that you are using the term "rebel" only in the case of MRTA and SEndero,shows that you have no knownledge of the atrocities that they cause in Peru. Most of peruvians will definetely not agree with your vision of "Armed Revolution". This was a Civil War that torn appart my country for nearly 10 yeas. As for next time "it will manage to destroy me"... that is just a pathetic rethoric and I pray that it was just a desperate attack in order to counter my arguments. Do you have any idea of what you are talking by saying that? I assume you not, since you have talked so freely. It will mean a genocide of the seice of Cambodia at least. You have already proved me that you have no knownledge of Peru AT ALL, and your opinion towards we used to be better on the 70's are completely irrelevant. Go ahead and if you are so impartial, change the word terrorism in the Palestine article, ok? Please, stop telling to us, peruvians how we must call this terrorist, The fact that our civil war is not as widely know as the palestinian conflict doesn't give you any authority to try to appologise those murders. you are acting of bad faith and with a double standar to judge things. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 15:42, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think "rebel" is particularly appropriate either. I'd say "armed faction", "armed group" or some such. But that's a secondary issue. Messhermit, <b>I see no sign that Viajero is acting in bad faith</b>, and would suggest that you withdraw the accusation. There are edits from each of you that I think represent POV, and I've called them as I see them; so far, he has been far more open to reconsidering than you have.</dd>
<dd>The article "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>", which you allude to, does not contain any form of the word "terror". The only occurrence of that word in the article "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a>" is a link to a separate article "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_terrorism.html" title="Palestinian terrorism">Palestinian terrorism</a>". "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a>" is an article with a dispute tag on it; even that begins very cautiously: "The term Palestinian terrorism is commonly used for terrorist acts committed by Palestinian citizens and Palestinian organizations against Israeli Jews, and occasionally against nationals of other countries. Valid or not, "Palestinian terrorism" is often regarded..." There is a parallel article, also disputed, entitled "Israeli terrorism".</dd>
<dd>About the only article on a major Israeli politician that I can readily find that uses the word "terror" or "terrorist" with reference to Palestinian actions is "<a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_b27b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a>", which uses it with reference to the Entebbe hijacking.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Constitutionality of third term</span></h2>
<p>I have found on article in the <i>New York Times</i> which provides a useful, non-partisan analysis of the third-term issue:</p>
<p>December 28, 1999</p>
<p><b>Peru's Chief to Seek 3rd Term, Capping a Long Legal Battle</b></p>
<p>By CLIFFORD KRAUSS</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 27 -- President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru announced his candidacy for an unprecedented third term today, arguing that his country needed him to guarantee an end to terrorism and to complete its economic recovery.</p>
<p>President Fujimori's announcement capped four years of legal and political maneuvering to overcome a constitutional bar against three consecutive presidential terms.</p>
<p>"We do not want to return to the past," he said in an address to the nation. "That is the reason for my candidacy. Another option may have been preferable but there are no alternatives."</p>
<p>The son of Japanese immigrants, President Fujimori, 61, shocked the political establishment by winning election in 1990 and was easily re-elected five years later. During his decade of rule, he has brought the country's traditional hyperinflation under control, greatly reduced the cocaine trade and negotiated a settlement to a border conflict with neighboring Ecuador.</p>
<p>His enduring popularity, however, comes from the retreat of two guerrilla groups that once controlled wide swaths of territory but now can do little more than mount small, isolated attacks. In his speech today, President Fujimori pledged to "extinguish every vestige of terrorism from the country" in his next term.</p>
<p>But President Fujimori's often autocratic methods -- including replacing the Congress and the Supreme Court by decree in 1992 and taking a television station away from a critic of his government -- have attracted widespread criticism among human rights groups. Most recently, critics have accused him of manipulating and even replacing judges and election officials who opposed his re-election bid.</p>
<p>The 1993 Constitution prohibits a third presidential term. But three years later, supporters of President Fujimori who control the Congress pushed through a law that excluded him from the prohibition since his first term began before the document was written. Over the last two years, the Congress dismissed three senior judges who opposed the law and then blocked a popular referendum intended to block his re-election.</p>

<p>March 1, 2000</p>
<p><b>Peru's president accused of illegal campaign ploy</b></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE</p>
<p>Presidential candidate Luis Castaneda Lossio, third in the polls, cited the allegedly forged signatures as an example of how Fujimori and his allies ``trample the constitution and remain on the margins of the law.</p>
<p>Most opposition candidates maintain that the president's candidacy is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Fujimori was first elected in 1990. During his first term he dissolved Congress and convoked a Constitutional Congress to write a new constitution, which permitted reelection. It was approved in a 1993 referendum.</p>
<p>Fujimori won reelection in 1995 with 64 percent of the votes. Fresh off that victory, his allies in Congress interpreted the new constitution to mean that he had been elected only once under it and, therefore, could run again in the 2000 election.</p>

<dd><b>UPP hace en√©rgico llamado a la unidad de la oposici√≥n</b></dd>
<dd>Uni√≥n por el Per√∫, frente a la ilegal candidatura del ingeniero Alberto Fujimori y su convalidaci√≥n igualmente ilegal en d√≠as pasados por el Jurado Nacional de Elecciones, expresa a la opini√≥n p√∫blica nacional e internacional lo siguiente:</dd>
<dd>1. La maquinaria estatal fujimorista contin√∫a con su pretensi√≥n de entronizar en el pa√≠s un <b>r√©gimen autoritario</b> de larga duraci√≥n y un sistema econ√≥mico antinacional al servicio de los intereses transnacionales. El control de las instituciones b√°sicas (poder Judicial, Legislativo, FFAA, Ministerio P√∫blico, etc.), el empleo abierto y descarado de recursos del Estado, el control de algunos medios de comunicaci√≥n, la persecuci√≥n a la oposici√≥n, la impunidad para los corruptos y violadores de los derechos humanos y, ahora √∫ltimo, el uso de l√∫mpenes para agredir a todos aquellos que no comulgan con la verdad oficial, nos muestran que los peruanos nos enfrentamos, luego del intento criminal del senderismo, a la m√°s grande amenaza por imponer un sistema totalitario en nuestra patria. El triunfo del fujimorismo significar√≠a la consolidaci√≥n de un gobierno que, tras un fachada aparentemente democr√°tica, ejerce el poder de manera clandestina, empleando para ello m√©todos policiacos.</dd>
<dd>2. Frente a esta <b>amenaza totalitaria</b>, a la que se suma un manejo econ√≥mico que prometiendo prosperidad a los peruanos los empobrece m√°s, Uni√≥n por el Per√∫, consciente de su responsabilidad, hace un llamado a las fuerzas de la oposici√≥n democr√°tica a buscar la m√°s amplia unidad. S√≥lo unidos podremos derrotar a la <b>dictadura fujimorista</b> e iniciar la construcci√≥n de un pa√≠s democr√°tico, desarrollado y justo, capaz de enfrentar colectivamente los retos de la globalizaci√≥n. Es hora, pues, de deponer intereses de grupo y escuchar el reclamo de millones de peruanos que aspiran a un pa√≠s unido y a un r√©gimen democr√°tico. La UPP reitera, en este contexto, su voluntad unitaria.</dd>
<dd>3. Finalmente, Uni√≥n por el Per√∫ reitera su confianza en el pueblo y lo llama a reflexionar sobre las consecuencias para nuestra patria que significa la instalaci√≥n de un <b>sistema totalitario</b>. Estamos convencidos, como siempre lo hemos estado, que los peruanos sabremos responder a esta amenaza y poner fin a la tiran√≠a en el Per√∫.</dd>

<dd><i>With Mr. Fujimori signaling to aides on Sunday his intention to resign and remain indefinitely in Japan, there were spontaneous celebrations in the streets ranging from workers and students dunking each other in the colonial fountains of Arequipa to protestors burning tires in other provincial cities while carrying banners demanding that the entire "Fujimori mafia" be imprisoned. The sense of relief that Peru's long roller-coaster of a political crisis may be coming to an end was summed up by the simple banner headline in today's Liberaci√≥n newspaper: "Finally!" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/21/world/21PERU.html?ex=1109826000&amp;en=2fdbdf7621d8363b&amp;ei=5070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/21/world/21PERU.html?ex=1109826000&amp;en=2fdbdf7621d8363b&amp;ei=5070" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></i></dd>

<dd><i>[...] A medida que el primer impacto del "descubrimiento" de la <b>mafia fujimorista</b> retrocede en el tiempo, van cambiando partes de la percepci√≥n p√∫blica del fen√≥meno.

<p>Once Again, I confirm that you are poorly informed, Viajero. Stop fueling this discussion by adding those Highly Biased arguments, that clearly don't have any NPOV idea. THey are quotes of people that hate the former President, and also show their efforts to demonize him. I could load this entire page with information supporting the president, but i will not dout becouse it will only mean to gave you some justification to keep writing nonsence on this page. Those sources also show how you support your statements: POV and opinions of this corrupt Toledo Administration and those who support Terrorist under the banner of "Human Rights". Please, stop using this kind of rethoric and pathetic information. The former president is controvertial, but not even a 50% + 1 of Peruvians call it dictator. PERIOD. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 16:41, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
