<p>Many references have been provided and this article has certainly benefited from it. However, there are some residual issues, and we should try and fix them as best as possible.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Guidelines of Schools</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>References â€” Provide verifiable sources of information about the school, that are <b>independent of the school itself</b>. This may include newspaper and magazine articles on the school. For private schools, an accreditation body or government source should be provided to show the organization is a legitimate school. An article should not rely solely on what its subject has to say about itself (as with any article in Wikipedia). If a resource is online (which is ideal) consider that potential it will go offline (newspaper's often allow free reading only for recent stories) and <b>provide sufficient information</b> that the story could still be found (<b>author, publication, full article title, date, etc</b>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only fact with a fully compliant citation is the St. Pius incident. Every other citation is from AA itself, or is not fully and properly transcribed.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Utt_9ea2.html" title="User:Ryan Utt">Ryan Utt</a> 22:20, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I would say that citations from <i>The Albuquerque Academy Advocate</i> are valid because it is published completely independent of official school opinions, administrator influence, or prior review. What appears in the publication is not approved by anyone in the administration, nor can they dictate what stories and angles are covered.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Highschool student newspapers generally don't meet Wikipedia criteria for verifiability so it doesn't matter if the AA Advocated is "independent" or not, but this is not the point. The major contention is that AA itself is used as the only source for multiple claims in the AA article. This is against the guidelines for high schools and it should be changed. Furthermore, the alledged citation of AAs literary magazine winning a "Lighthouse Award" doesn't actually identify an article and hence the claim is still uncited. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Utt_9ea2.html" title="User:Ryan Utt">Ryan Utt</a> 07:10, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, all citations include every piece of information available. If things like the exact date of publication or the author cannot be found, then they obviously cannot be included. Any style book will tell you that. This is the case for the Associated Press article on the St. Pius razor incident and the 2005 Tribune Lighthouse Award Winners publication. Those are considered to be correct citations since all the information isn't available. -<a href="../../../v/o/n/User%7EVontafeijos_b6bc.html" title="User:Vontafeijos">Vontafeijos</a> 06:57, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may have cited the articles as best as you can and hence they might be "correct" citations, but if you can't name a specific source then your claim doesn't pass the criteria for <b>verifiability</b>. If the "best" you can do is allude to some article alledgedly existing, then you're going to have to remove the claim.

If you examine <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> under the section "When Adding Information" it tells you what is meant by "full citation":

<dd>Disparaging another's use of the passive voice might be quite the insult at AA, but it falls flat outside the shelter halls of private school. Next time you should try something like -- "Ryan, you're so stupid that you waste your time arguing about a wikipedia article that nobody will ever read aside from you and the grandiose students who authored it." Or, better yet, why don't you engage the actual substance of the debate? If I'm so "demonstratably stupid" then why don't you demonstrate it by <i>proving me wrong</i>. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Utt_9ea2.html" title="User:Ryan Utt">Ryan Utt</a> 07:03, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In other words, if you're not satisfied with the sources Vontafeijos has provided, do something constructive and look for the sources yourself instead of badgering him about it. Incidentally, the parts of the article you're griping about weren't even written by Vontafeijos, so he's doing you a favor by attempting to address your concerns. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamerafiend_c778.html" title="User:Camerafiend">Camerafiend</a> 00:39, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The link to the New Mexico Department of Education was broken. Guidelines for Schools says "an accreditation body or government source should be provided to show the organization is a legitimate school" so it's critical that a new citation be found for at least one of the accrediation bodies. AA obviously is a legitimate school so this shouldn't be too hard, but I don't know much about private schools so I wouldn't know where to look. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Utt_9ea2.html" title="User:Ryan Utt">Ryan Utt</a> 08:06, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sale of the land over the years and careful management of the proceeds created a $200 million endowment which since then has grown, placing the Albuquerque Academy among the highest endowed secondary schools in the United States</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The student population of the Academy ranks among the most diverse for independent schools throughout the country</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Albuquerque Academy prides itself on its personal attention to its students with an 8:1 student/teacher ratio, but simply in terms of such tangibles as facilities and average SAT score, the school now ranks alongside such schools as St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas and the Kinkaid School in Houston.</p>

<p>I'm doubting the notability of some of these so-called "notable alumni." In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greg Archuleta, "controversial Lobo football writer for the Albuquerque Journal."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Martin Chavez, "computer programmer and Wall Street broker, not to be confused with the Albuquerque Mayor of the same name."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Michael Robbins, "World Bank Consultant and PhD student at the University of Michigan."</li>
</ul>
<p>As it stands, none of these entries sufficiently explain why the subject is notable. Credentials like "World Bank Consultant," "programmer and Wall Street broker," or "controversial Lobo football writer" do not constitute notability. If these people are to remain in the list, better evidence of notability needs to be provided.</p>

<p>I mainly focused on the history section, trying to make it more readable, tightening it up, and correcting some information. (E.g. I don't think the BLM ever had any role in the land swap, and the CABQ source confirms that it was in fact the Forest Service.) I also did some random cleanup on other sections, including the Bear Canyon subsection. Hope the edits are an improvement. Overall the article still needs more verifiable, independent citations, as mentioned by various folks above; that's a longer-term project. However for some noncontroversial facts I did cite the school as a source, as an interim measure. -- <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpireguy_272b.html" title="User:Spireguy">Spireguy</a> 23:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
