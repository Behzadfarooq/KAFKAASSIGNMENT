<p>Hey, I saw you are changing all the time the combatants list of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> and the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_War_of_Succession_b53a.html" title="Spanish War of Succession">Spanish War of Succession</a> articles. Stop changing it unilaterally please. At least talk about it in the talk pages.</p>
<p>About the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_Spanish_Succession_a039.html" title="War of Spanish Succession">War of Spanish Succession</a> there are few things:</p>
<p>1) For some reason you unilaterally change the alphabetical arrangement I did for the combatants list.</p>
<p>2) A guy changed "Great Britain" for "England/Great Britain", which is historically correct: at the begin of the war it was England, but at the end of the war it had become the Great Britain. But for some reason, you also change that.</p>
<p>3) You also keep changing the terminology of "Austriacists" and "Philippists". Please, don't do that. I don't know where are you from but these are the names given to the two factions of the war in Spain since the birds can fly.</p>
<p>4) I've also seen that you change things like "Kingdom of Spain" for "Spain", "Kingdom of France" for "France", "Nazi Germany" for "Germany", "Fascist Italy" for "Italy", etc. Well, that's incorrect too: you don't change "Soviet Union" for "Russia", right? Why? Because the article "Russia" displays the information of the modern-day country of Russia while "Soviet Union" shows what was Russia and all the associated republics in the past. So it's the same with "Nazi Germany" and "Fascist Italy". And it's also the same with "Kingdom of Spain" and "Kingdom of France"... if you say "France" instead of "Kingdom of France" it redirects to the modern-day French Republic... and that's wrong...</p>
<p>That's all. So please, talk about it in the Talk Pages of the articles before doing those changes...</p>
<p>Oh, and please, don't use expressions like "Jesus Christ, fix everything"... like if you were the bringer of the mundial knowledge.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, well, in the case of the Spanish Civil War it's pointless that you put "Germany" and "Italy" as combatants, because these names link to the modern day countries. Maybe they didn't call their country "Nazi Germany" or "Fascist Italy" by those times, but everyone knows these countries in that period with these names, and actually there are articles named <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a> that show what these countries were by those times, and they were a different thing than what they are today. And putting this in the combatants list is much more clarifying than putting the modern day countries, because it wasn't the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> who fought the war, it was the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, and the same with <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Italy</a>. Or take the example of Russia: you don't put <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> in the article because it wasn't just Russia who fought the war but the whole <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. So what I did wasn't wrong, and you can't disagree with terms like "Nazi Germany" or "Fascist Italy" because they are <i>vox populi</i> and a proof of this is that, as I said, they have their own articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then you put Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union as "subordinated forces" of the Second Spanish Republic // the Spanish Nationalists. Well, they were not a branch of the spaniard factions, they were allied powers, and I think it's much more clarifying if you put in the combatants list "Second Spanish Republic" vs. "Spanish Nationalists" and then "With the support of:". With the way you did it, putting them as "subordinated forces" it seems that they were sub-factions of the main combatants. Anyway it was much more wrong before I changed the combatants list some weeks ago: someone had put the trade unions and the international brigades and more stuff that was totally wrong. And by the way, linking the "Spanish Nationalists" to "Spanish State", or directly putting "Spanish State" in the combatants list is not very appropiate because the Spanish State came after the Republic was defeated, and if you directly put it in the combatants list you are legitimating and giving official recognition to a bunch of rebels who did a <i>coup d'état</i>. The real <i>Spanish State</i> of those times was the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then you say that we should remove "Austriacists" and "Philippists". I don't think so, because putting that not only shows which were the factions of the war and helps to clarify the conflict but it is also a way to include all those supporters of one or the other faction that fought because they believed on the cause, but were not flagged under any combatant state. And they were hundreds of thousands just in Spain. In addition, this is the name that has been always given to the factions of the war, here in Spain, but I can understand your ignorance about this as you seem to be an <i>anglo</i>. It's almost offensive not to mention the austriacists and philippists (or borbonics, or however you wanna call them) who fought the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a> in the Spanish territory, because it was a civil war, and sometimes it seems that this war was just fought by the british. And about putting the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_of_Aragon_a413.html" title="Crown of Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> maybe it's okay, I had consulted wrong sources. But if you don't put "Austriacists" and "Philippists" you are removing from the history all those individuals who fought for one side or for the other.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About the problem with the combatants of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, there are two ways to do it:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) You put <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a> linked to <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Italy</a> linkted to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) You directly put <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a>, linking to the articles with the same names.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both options are correct. Maybe using the words <i>Nazi</i> and <i>Fascist</i> is redundant like you said, but it is redundant only when you are already linking the countries to these terms through the articles that make reference to the situation of Germany under the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">nazism</a> and Italy under the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>. It is not redundant but <b>completely necessary</b> when you are linking <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> to the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> to the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Republic_7a74.html" title="Italian Republic">Italian Republic</a>: because that is what you did, and it is wrong; what do you say to that? You don't regonise your own mistakes. In addition, it emphasizes on the strong political character of the war (freedom against tirany, reason against dogmatism, a free republic against a totalitarist and fascist state).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So we can argue what is better: if <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a> (linking to <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>) and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Italy</a> (linking to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a>), which is clearly the same (instead the terms <i>Nazi</i> and <i>Fascist</i> may be redundant in the first case). But we cannot argue if <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, which are linking to <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> and to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Republic_7a74.html" title="Italian Republic">Italian Republic</a>, are more appropiate than what I did, because these terms are wrong. And that's what you did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't make any historical mistake when I put <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a>, but you did when you put <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> (linking to <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>) and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> (linking to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Republic_7a74.html" title="Italian Republic">Italian Republic</a>).</dd>

<dd>That was the first point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then you say that the case of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> is different. Well, it is not, because it is right that while <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> was the official name of country by those times, Germany and Italy were not called <i>Nazi</i> and <i>Fascist</i> oficially. But when you are calling them with these names, you are capturing the characteristics of these countries during the 30s. The territories that Germany and Italy had during that period were much different than the territories they occupy today. For example, if you just say "Germany", you don't show that Königsberg was a part of Germany. They were the same countries, but much different. And to show this difference it's much more clarifying to put <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_Italy_4493.html" title="Fascist Italy">Fascist Italy</a> in the combatants list than <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Republic_7a74.html" title="Italian Republic">Italian Republic</a>, which is what you did. And don't come with stuff like that saying "Nazi Germany" is the same than saying "Marxism-Lenninist Russia" or something like that... it's obvious that Nazi Germany is <i>vox populi</i> and defines the state of Germany during those times, while "Marxism-Lenninism" defines a political theory that may be applied to multiple situations... so what you are saying is pointless.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then you say that "Subordinate is obviously meant in terms of the scale of the forces". Well, subordination is what it is; in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> article, the US had x10 the forces of UK and UK is not in a sublist under the US. Anyway it's much more clarifying if you put "With the support of", because you show that the two real combatants were the Second Spanish Republic against the Rebels, while the other forces were unidirectionally helping the two mentioned factions. Putting all the combatants at the same level means that all the combatants of the first faction fought against all the combatants of the second one, and it is not so. And using the sub-bulleted list shows subordination. And as I don't think there is any "special symbol" to show "unidirectional support" (like the bulleted list showing subordination) I think the best that can be done is to write "With the support of", which is what I did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And about the "Spanish State", it is wrong to say that the combatants of the war were the "Spanish State" against the "Second Spanish Republic": "Spanish State" not only refers to the state that Franco created, but it is also a way to define the structure in which the country is organised; and this structure, in 1936, was a Republic. Putting them at the same level creates a conflict of legitimacy: you are generating two legitimate states for Spain: (1) a Republic and (2) a totalitarist state (which was then named "Estado Español" and to which you are awarding official recognition, a thing that did not have in the bulk of the international community). If they had not won the war, you would never say that "the Spanish State fought against the Republic", because the only state that everyone would recognise when talking about that period would be the Republic. Moreover, no one says that the Spanish State fought against the Republic; a bunch of rebels, did a <i>coup d'état</i> and after overthrowing the legitimate government they created their own state. Finally, when you are generating two states for Spain in the combatants list you are confusing the reader, and it must be clear that Spain had a legitimate state (the Republic) that was overthrew by the rebels that then created what they called <i>El Estado Español</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And finally, about the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_Spanish_Succession_a039.html" title="War of Spanish Succession">War of Spanish Succession</a> it's okay that the catalan austriacists fall under the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_of_Aragon_a413.html" title="Crown of Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> but as I said there were austriacists and philippists (or borbonics) both in Castile and the old <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_of_Aragon_a413.html" title="Crown of Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a>, and if you don't use the term <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_V_of_Spain_2f3b.html" title="Philip V of Spain">Philippists</a> you are missing the hundreds of thousands of individuals who supported the Bourbons, and if you don't use the term <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_emperor_Charles_VI_27a1.html" title="Holy Roman emperor Charles VI">Austriacists</a> you are missing the hundreds of thousands of Austriacists that were outside of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_of_Aragon_a413.html" title="Crown of Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a>. Furthermore, when you are linking these terms to the articles of the aspirants for the crown, it's totally clear what do they mean. And it's not pointless to mix flags with coats of arms, because the factions of the war were about two kings, and each one had his own coat of arms, and the people supported the individual more than a nation or a state. It was a civil war, and the civil wars are not so simple. When you, from your personal point of view, disdain these issues, and call the people who fought the war in Spain "a bunch of opportunists" and reject to mention them in the combatants list you are not only being historically unaccurate but also showing a lack of respect for what happened here. And the fact that you had never heard about terms like "Philippists", "Austriacists" or "Borbonic" shows that you are not as well informed as you think.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All in all, I agree that the stuff of the combatants list must be simplified, but it cannot be done from a distant, partial, simple and simplifying point of view like yours. You rudely disdain important issues that must be considered.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Let me clue you in on something, chief: Franco <i><b>won</b></i>. And <i>even if</i> his side had lost, it would still be more proper for us to use the <i>name they called themselves</i> than to come up with post-facto demonising labels. We're not in a position to judge whether a combatant is an "extremist insurgent" or a "hero of national liberation." Were the Fenians who invaded Canada "terrorist dupes" or "Erin's noble crusaders"? Who can say? That's why we don't rely on the consistency or veracity of any group's description. So you can continue to smother my talk page with talk of "freedom against tirany, reason against dogmatism, a free republic against a totalitarist and fascist state," but when you pollute the articles with your biases, we have a problem.</td>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Judging from your comments above, there's obviously nothing to be heard from you on this point besides the rote tirades of an outraged nationalist. Unfortunately, I'm more concerned with arranging these articles in conformity with the guidelines of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">WP:MILHILST</a> than with debating the legitimacy of the Franco regime. So, what I would suggest is this: Go convince the editors of "American Civil War" to change "Confederate States of America" to "southern rebels and traitors," and then I'll be happy to hear your case. Get going, and good luck.</td>

<dd>Ok, I've already discussed with you about this and you seem not to understand it. Calling the fascist combatants of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War article</a> "Spanish State" is simply stupid, because what they called "Spanish State" was something they created when they had overthrown the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republic</a>. But when you are talking about the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">war</a>, you can't say that it was the "State" against the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republic</a> because the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> was itself the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>.

<dd><b>Anyway, to conclude:</b> it's totally pointless to discuss with you. My edits in all these matters are correct, when I edit the articles I always create a topic in the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_Page_74c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk Page">talk page</a> and if you have any problem with it I also come to your <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_Page_74c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk Page">talk page</a> and I justify my position. The fact you don't want to accept all this is not my problem. We've been discussing about these issues for too long, and I'm tired of it. In the <i>conversations</i> we've had I always replied the problems you raised, and you still not understand it. I just upgrade the articles, adding additional information and explaining and clarifying lots of issues, and all what you do is to revert my changes in these matters taking <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">WP:MILHILST</a> like a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preacher.html" title="Preacher">preacher</a> takes a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, with the difference that while the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> probably supports what the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preacher.html" title="Preacher">preacher</a> is saying, while <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">WP:MILHILST</a> does not support you. So you can keep trying to revert my edits, but you won't get anything because like a <a href="../../../c/u/c/Cucumber.html" title="Cucumber">cucumber</a>, I will keep my <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStay_cool_4d94.html" title="Wikipedia:Stay cool">WP:SC</a> attitude, and will keep changing the articles again and discussing about it in the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_Page_74c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk Page">talk pages</a>.</dd>

<p>Back on July 20, 2005, you apparently developed some numbers for the strength box for the [Siege of Tenochtitlan]. I think these numbers (150,000-300,000) are way off and have made the changes that I think are appropriate. However, in the edit summary, you quoted some sources (Hanson and Prescott). If you have time, could you document how you arrived at your numbers in the Talk page for the article? I have already put the justification for my revised numbers in the Talk page. I'm more than willing to discuss and be convinced that your numbers are right and mine are wrong. I just would like to understand what yours are based on. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 18:18, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello there! Maybe the first exchange of words that we had here in Wikipedia was not the most appropriated one. Hence, a little explanation regarding my actions should be stated: The main reason I was only able to add the "NPOV" tag and not modify that much the article is due to the fact that I'm currently involved in a RFC against my person dealing with this Ecuadorian-Peruvian related articles.</p>
<p>Having explained this, I encourage you to take a look at the talk page. I'm now providing (slowly, but steady) some points that need to be rectify before declaring the article as "neutral". Cheers! And hope to hear from you. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 03:20, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the comments made by the Ecuadorian Wikipedist involved in the "Cenepa War" articles may sound a little out of context... and that is the main reason I didn't want to get too involve with the article. The fact that this user clearly attempts to impose its will is disturbing, specially regarding this conflict. Therefore, I have to state that this user clearly portrays only one side of the story. Thus, I invite you to express yourself in this RFC against my person that is more like a "political trial" (based on conveniently presented evidence). My patience has limits, but I don't go around proudly proclaiming them like the example below. Cheers! And I hope to hear from you. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 05:05, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You may have a good point, but it's one that anyone may readily deduce from a reading of the article. The original suggestion on the DYK talk page referred to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzers</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sapper.html" title="Sapper">sappers</a> which do not appear anywhere in the article. Facts mentioned in a DYK entry should appear in the article so, as the updating admin, I changed it to reflect the actual wording used. The artillery bombardment and aerial bombing are mentioned and demonstrate the disproportional balance in the fighting that you think has been lost. The only specific that is missing is the reference to tanks, which the reader of the article can quickly determine were a factor (albeit there were only "2 or 3" of them). I think the essence of the article is still well represented on the DYK page and will hopefully inspire a large number of readers to visit. --<a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECactus.man_4fe2.html" title="User:Cactus.man"><font color="#2B7A2B">Cactus<b>.</b>man</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/c/User_talk%7ECactus.man_82b9.html" title="User talk:Cactus.man"><font size="4">✍</font></a> 16:50, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough (although the broader issue of present-day material being included within "military history" is one that I don't think we've fully resolved yet). I suspect part of the problem is that people who work exclusively on the current events may not have had enough interaction with us to recognize our templates; maybe leaving links to <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WP:MILHIST</a> in the edit summaries would help here. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><font color="#960018">h</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">in</a> 01:13, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To be honest, there is still little coverage of some very interesting operational &amp; tactical information from the Peruvian side (what I do know, comes mainly from talks with Peruvian friends, so it is not citable).

<p>Hello, I've just noted your comment of the 11th:</p>
<p><i>I dislike the antagonistic approach to deletion; I had thought to persuade the article's editors of the validity of my concern. If their consensus is against me I will annul my vote and leave the rest to their judgment. But I'm not touching that article again.</i></p>
<p>I do hope that you haven't percieved me as being unduly antagonistic, it certainly wasn't my intention (although, I hope you understand, that a note on the talk page before initiating the afd would have been appreciated). Contributing here should be fun (in the broadest sense of the word), I apologise if I've caused you any disquiet. I must say issues raised by the Afd have changed my feelings towards the article (and the whole int power series in fact). What they need is the attention of people with a background in the academic side of it. It looks like we are about to get into an argument over Italy on the Major Power page and an argument over whether Russia is an emerging superpower on the superpower page - all very tedious and messy.</p>
<p>Essentially these articles need informed editing, please do reconsider your decision. The enthusiastic amateur has his place, but needs to be guided from time to time. As for this enthusiastic amateur, I'm going to take a break from this series, to those areas in which I can claim a little expertise; primarily to articles on South African history - an area which doesn't attact the attention of too many other editors, thank god!</p>

<p>Personally, I don't think it's a good idea, since the conflicts don't really form a logical sequence, but merely a geographic one. One rule of thumb that might be useful is to consider whether a coherent article about the "group" of conflicts could be written; in other words, would Spanish-Moroccan Wars be a mere list of conflicts, or could it be dealt with as a single larger "conflict" that happens to be broken into stages. If it's the former, having a navigation template is probably not all that useful; the last thing we want is to have a campaignbox for every pair of countries that has found themselves on opposite sides of a war (e.g. {{Campaignbox Anglo-French Wars}}). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 21:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, ok; something like "Spanish colonial wars in Morocco" seems rather more reasonable, since there's actually a common theme beyond the two sides involved. The fact that the participants may vary shouldn't play into it too much; even for the obvious series of wars (e.g. the Napoleonic Wars), there tends to be a lot of variation in that regard. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 22:37, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>My apologies</b> You were afraid that you were vague, and I have to admit the same - my edit summary may not have been explanatory. The Green March had nothing to do with Spain, except as a proxy, or only in asmuch as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Sahara_526c.html" title="Spanish Sahara">Spanish Sahara</a> was a province of Spain. The conflict was between Morocco and the Polisario Front; so it seems misleading to characterize it as a Spanish-Moroccan conflict (Spain, of course, rolled over and sold out the Sahara, so there was clearly no conflict between the Spanish and Moroccans.) I suppose that since the Sahara was a province at the time, you could justify re-adding it; I won't object. I hope that clears up what I was doing - otherwise, nice template, by the way. -<a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a>·<a href="../../../k/o/a/User_talk%7EKoavf_18ee.html" title="User talk:Koavf">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Koavf_fde1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Koavf">C</a>·<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Koavf_292b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Koavf">M</a> 18:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article is fairly ridiculous, I must admit. It speaks of a "siege," but nothing notable actually happened. If you want a real siege, see the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Paris_66aa.html" title="Siege of Paris">Siege of Paris</a> in 1870-1871. I don't see why someone could not use this article as precedent for creating other articles with the harmless fall of cities.....like "Surrender of London (1066)" or "Surrender of Berlin (1806)." Just opens up an uncomfortable can of worms. I'd personally support for deletion if it came up, but I don't think it would succeed.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 04:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I see you reverted many of the changes I included in this entry. I can't see why. I am really not trying to leaden anything when I mention that the institutions were kept for some more decades (centuries, actually) after Spain formed: this is just a fact and I think it is interesting to know that the Crown of Aragón kept functioning basically the same way even when Spain was already existing. Is it not? Since I mention this fact, then I mention the moment when these institutions are finally abolished. I would be trying to load this politically if I mentioned some sort of continuity with present day self government, which I do not. I am no nationalist of any kind.</p>
<p>It is true that Barcelona and Valencia shared the economical primacy. I don't have the citation, neither does the present version, so? Then the reference to the Consell de Cent does not fit in there, for this is an article about the Crown of Aragón, not an article about Catalonia's municipal regime.</p>
<p>Again I am surprised at seeing reverted my mention to the Fueros ¿? I am not trying to load anything politically here, just mentioning the well known process in medieval Europe of kings trying to strenghten their power by getting allied with cities or territories which they granted self governemnt.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I am really against of the use of "Empire". That was no empire. How can someone call Empire a loose confederation of three Peninsular territories? They ruled lands all over the Mediterranean? ok, but again this was a loose one which, besides, didn't last that much anyway.</p>
<p>Please, mate, look into my reasons and let me know what you think: I am hoping you reconsider this matter. As I say above, I am no nationalist of any kind and I am only trying to add some interesting information here, really. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMountolive_175f.html" title="User:Mountolive">Mountolive</a> 03:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your fast feedback, Albrecht. Well, indeed I think your revert was quite drastic, but I see no problem -and actually agree- with your point of taking things out of the introduction. Also you are right that, to some extent, a few of my remarks were a bit redundant, even though I still wish to make clear the interesting fact that the Crown of Aragón institutions kept working after uniting with Spain (this is an interesting fact which, besides, proves the Catalan nationalists that "Spain" doesn't necessarily mean lack of self-government, as they want to stress). I may come back to this article again with similar views, but detailed in a different way. I hope you will agree with those, since, as I said, I am actually not trying by any means to endorse the Catalan nationalist view. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMountolive_175f.html" title="User:Mountolive">Mountolive</a> 04:24, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments on the Nine Years’ War article. I must add though that my use of Churchill was very minor.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I agree entirely with your reservations of Churchill as a historian but I understand your concern which is why I use Churchill sparingly - if at all. Chandler quotes him throughout his work – although he does say when discussing Marlborough that Churchill was ‘more than a little <i>parti pris</i>’ ie: Predjudice</p>
<p>Its been some time since I read his Second World War – I have an abridged version. I shall take another look at it taking into consideration what you said.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the comment – coming from someone as yourself, who clearly has knowledge and interest in early modern warfare, it was certainly much appreciated. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_Palmer_73bf.html" title="User:Raymond Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a> 13:19, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I try to only include information that can be verified with another source. The sentence that you refer to:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Although Marshal Luxembourg, with superior numbers defeated William’s army at the bloody Battle of Landen on 29 July, it had little effect beyond attrition; despite suffering enormous casualties, William was able to maintain himself in the field.</i></p>
<p>The quote that Landen had ‘little effect beyond attrition’ was taken from Lynn. Lynn goes on to say ‘William gathered back dispersed elements of his forces to restore his army’. I used the Churchill quote - ‘was able to maintain himself in the field’ because it is more economical with regards to wording.</p>
<p>If I can’t verify a ‘fact’ from another source I usually don’t put it in the article.</p>
<p>I am currently updating the WOTSS article to bring it up to modern FA status. The existing article is missing plenty of history and is completely unsourced. When its finished I’ll let you know, and if you feel its deficient eg: too anglo-centric, particularly regarding the Duke of Marlborough, I can make the necessary ammendments . When it comes to Marlborough I certainly won’t use Churchill.</p>

<p>Well, that depends on whether you're content to leave the article in its current state. If you are, then simply ending the discussion may be the best approach, as continuing the debate may provoke a defensive reaction from him. In my experience, such questions of national pride and such tend to blow up into fairly time-consuming fights more often than not. (Which is not to say, of course, that he may not be willing to have a perfectly civil intellectual discussion on the point of significance of contributions and so forth; but, if things get out of hand, you'll likely be forced to spend a lot of time on the issue.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 21:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Commons seems to go through these bouts of copyright insanity every so often; they're really caused by inconsistent copyright law across national borders, and Commons generally choosing to go with the most restrictive possibility even when it's fairly absurd.

<p>Unfortunately, I don't really have any influence on Commons policy, so there's not much I can do at the source of the problem. My advice would be to simply upload the image(s) directly to en:Wikipedia, where the Commons admins can't get to them. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 18:06, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My guess is that, when the image was moved to Commons, our local copy was deleted; you may need to upload it here again if we want it to stay regardless of what happens to the Commons one. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 21:08, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, nice work on this article so far. Three small points I want to address.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is not customary to begin a battle article with a quote from a poem or song. I'm not sure where the quotation comes from (Hugh Thomas obviously quoted it, but where does it originate?), but it surely belongs either somewhere within the article or at the end?</p>
<p>Second, the context of Charlie Donnelly's "even the olives are bleeding" is the recollection of a Canadian veteran as follows, "We ran for cover, Charlie Donnelly, the commander of an Irish company is crouched behind an olive tree. He has picked up a bunch of olives from the ground and is squeexing them. I hear him say something quietly between a lullin machine gun fire:'Even the olives are bleeding' (quoted in Joeseph O'Connor, Even the Olives are Bleeding - the life and times of Charles Donnelly, p.105). O'Connor goes on to say, "a few minutes later, as Donnelly was covering the retreat, he was caught in a burst of gunfire. He was struck three times, in the right arm, the right side and the head. He collapsed and died instantly. thre was no time to retrieve the body. So I think the wording in the Jarama article should be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>Third, the title of the sub-section, "Suicide Hill". This hill (though emotively named) was only one of a series of positions which saw fierce fighting on the Pingarron and Pajares heights on February 12-14 1937. The title of the sub-section should reflect this and not magnify the importance of just one of these actions which involved British volunteers.</p>
<p>That's it. Well done again, on your contributions so far. I await your response before making the changes.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorney_3c50.html" title="User:Jdorney">Jdorney</a> 17:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, some more thoughts on improving the article.</p>
<p>First, I think a map would be a big help, as the descriptions of the fighting are surely very confusing to someone who has not seen a map of the positions in question. Beevor has a good one in his book. I may be able to do one based on his and upload it.</p>
<p>Also, reading through the article, it seems strange to me that the Republicans seem to have used their Soviet armour extensively and the Nationalists seem not to have used their German tank corps at all. Are we missing something? perhaps they just weren't practical for the job of taking bridges and then establishing bridgeheads on the far side? I don't know.</p>
<p>Re Suicide Hill, I decided to leave it there, despite issue raised above, as it does sound better. Until we can come up with another title at least.</p>

<dd>Hi I'm new here. But I stumbled over the article for the French and Indian War/Seven Years'War/The Great Conquest. Being from the area I thought I might be able to contribute. I left a message on the discussion page. Seems there might of been a slight POV issue there. I would like to dicuss a few things I thought might make the article feature class. I think the original article misses a few key points on the geography of the area and how that might escalate into the conflict that accurred in Europe.

<p>I saw the maps you created and would like to know whether you are interested in creating some more?</p>
<p>We have lots of requests for maps showing areas under different political control. One issue that is likely to rise are the Muslim, Indian and African political entities which often lack maps (there are lots of editors lacking the know-how to create maps, but knowing what should be in it. Also territorial changes like during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Punic_War_97a8.html" title="Second Punic War">Second Punic War</a> are only available as external images while they would be essential to show the progress. Quite a good example is the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Punic_War_be20.html" title="First Punic War">First Punic War</a>, although I don't approve of the style. As long as there is no sufficient group working on maps we are unlikely to create any guidelines. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 18:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You've taken out Algeria and Morocco There were in fact 2 Moroccan Divisions (plus the Goumiers = another Division, so three in all) and an Algerian Division at Cassino. This compares with only 1 Free French and 1 New Zealand Division, which continue to be listed. Admittedly both Algeria and Morocco were French colonies at the start of the war but the legal French government was VIchy. I think these two should be reinstated and India added because of the major roles played by 4 and 8 Indian Divisions (although an issue here is that it was colonial India which included modern day Pakistan and Bangladesh) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirrages_8e06.html" title="User:Kirrages">Stephen Kirrage</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirrages_6679.html" title="User talk:Kirrages">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirrages_aee2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirrages">contribs</a></sup> 02:05, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your compliment and the fine edits on Battle of Teruel. Pehaps you might look at my article on the Seige of Oviedo, also in the Spanish Civil War. I know it could use some editing.

<p>The addenda on the casualties should be removed. As you know a casualty is more than just killed or wounded. at Teruel, we had missing, captives, and sick for casualties as well.</p>
<p>The flags of the combatants should be restored. The International Brigade was never really under Spanish control nor were the Soviet fliers. On the other side the Germans and Italians were always semi-independent.</p>

<p>I am working on the War in the North and the battles that occurred during that camapaign. I think this is an area where the German and Italian flags could be added to the forces available as they were very prominent in those campaigns.</p>

<p>Hello Albrecht. Albrecht, if there was ever a naval battle that was inconclusive it was this one. From a British point of view the battle was shambolic, Lestock was courts martialled for cowardice (he deliberately ignored Mathews signals but was acquited because of his friends in high places), but it was wholly indecisive. I can of course back this up with many sources but I thought I would consult you before making changes. What do you think? <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_Palmer_73bf.html" title="User:Raymond Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a> 21:48, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
