<dd>Well, if there <b>isn't</b> currently a list of old Albany mayors, I'd say keep this or else the info will be lost completely. But I agree that it might be better to have them in a separate list article, esp. if someone wants to make a <i>complete</i> list rather than the sampling that is here now. Basically, it's good info - just not necessarily presented in a good way. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:31, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ouch. Yeah, I'd vote to move the list to its own page and then have a link from here. I don't know what others would say. I'm assuming the past mayors of Albany would be a notable subject for an article - individually and as a list - but maybe there's a standard that says otherwise. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 18:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(resetting tab) I second the vote to move the list to it's own article. Based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cities#Template_for_a_U.S._City" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cities#Template_for_a_U.S._City" rel="nofollow">US Cities template</a>, the Mayors list should be a part of the Law and Government section possibly with details on notable mayors in the 'Notable Natives' section. More generally, I propose restructuring the article to this template and add the {{WikiProjectCities}} tag. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 14:44, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, finally got around to moving the list of mayors to its own page. Based on resources <a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> and I have found, I feel very comfortable about the accuracy of this list through 1800 and for recent history, but the late 19th Century and early 20th Century information is still incomplete (e.g. there are gaps in the dates where no mayor is listed). If someone can find a source for completing that list (other than Political Graveyard, which I have deleted as a reference since it has proven to be very inaccurate), it would be great if you could finish this list and double check the period from 1800-present.--<a href="../../../g/n/h/User%7EGnhn_5e26.html" title="User:Gnhn">Gnhn</a> 12:08, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hello Albany people. Is there a place we could all find each other on here anyway? Is there a list of Albany editors or something? Anyway, I know we're shooting for NPOV here, but does the picture of the Agency buildings really have to feature such "typical" Albany weather? Maybe, if it ever clears up, we could get one on a Sunnier day? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Przylucki_688c.html" title="User:William Przylucki">Billy P</a> 19:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah. I plan on shooting more photos sometime soon, but it's not easy as I don't drive and I live in the suburbs (Guilderland). Hopefully I can get some less "artsy" photos, too.&#160;;) <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungtwig_c721.html" title="User:Youngtwig">Youngtwig</a> 23:52, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Do you know what the copyright situation would be on postcards?

Alright, I shot some more photos in Albany yesterday. I think I got a pretty good picture of the capitol building, although someone walked into the photo. There's also some construction going on. At least there's no snow.</p>
<p>I still don't have a skyline photo, though. Anyone have any recommendations for a photo spot? Thanks. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungtwig_c721.html" title="User:Youngtwig">Youngtwig</a> 17:49, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure I agree with the recent changes to this article. (First off, I hate "United States state of New York" but that's not why I'm here). Some of that school stuff was interesting. Admittedly, it needed to be made more aesthetically pleasing and clearer in some spots but removing it entirely isn't what I would have done. This was just about the only link to Doane Stuart School so you might as well remove that article altogether. If the school section was taking up pages and pages, I might agree but it was a nice compact chunk of interesting facts IMHO. --<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">wknight94</a> 17:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize if some of my edits were awkward (especially "United States state of New York," which on second thought is pretty bad.) I removed school stuff if it was only an external link (WP:NOT a phone book or directory) but I left it if there was a WP article about that school...if I made a mistake on that one, then I apologize and please revert the error. Thank you for informing me of this and make the changes you think should be made; I will comment on them in this space.

<dd>Incidentally, about the "United States state" thingy, if it were up to me I would address each U.S. state on its own and not make references to it only as a component unit of a larger entity (which of course is important to mention, but IMHO states are primarily units unto themselves and not subdivisions). This goes along with my whacky decentralist-secessionist tendencies, and is basically irrelevant, but figured I'd share. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 18:08, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree about the removal of U.S. completely. I think that's sometimes the result of people outside the U.S. saying, "I have to say Queensland is in Australia so 'they' should have to say New York is in the U.S.!!". I'm not sure if that's people being paranoid or me being paranoid about people being paranoid... Remember, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you! Regardless, I usually leave it in unless it sounds ridiculous like "Schenectady is an American city in Schenectady County, New York, United States" (American <b>and</b> in the United States - which is what that article used to say). No offense, but "United States state" qualifies as needing to be fixed...</dd>
<dd>I'll take your thoughts about school stuff sounding like a directory under advisement - but I'll probably put it back in some very short form (unless someone else objects) and maybe make a request for new articles for them. And I'll assume removing the Erastus Corning link was a mistake and put it back as well. And don't worry about me being abusive which only happens if someone is abusive at me first. --<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">wknight94</a> 18:53, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The population for the city itself is given; however, as everyone knows, the population within the legislative boundries of a city is not what many people would generally consider the true population of the greater metropolitan area.

It'd be nice if here, as in many other city articles on Wikipedia, we could put both the official population stat for the city AND the population of the greater metro area (in this case the Albany-Troy-Schenectady metro area), which is according to the capital district article, the 135th Largest in North America (though no actual figure is given there).

<dd>I believe the populations here come directly from the U.S. Census and so they come with the complications of that data. I think the best you could do for the "metropolitan area" you're looking for is add up the populations for Albany, Schenectady and Rensselaer Counties. The Census web site will give all the gory detail for exactly what areas correspond to which population figures. Often, towns are located inside cities, etc. which makes things very confusing. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 21:42, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_District_43c6.html" title="Capital District">Capital District</a> is specifically about this "metro area" (the article is not "Capital District (New York)". I corrected a typo in the original comment (since it was wikified, being misspelled caused it to appear un-linked). New York is unique, at least it seems, to have this "Capital District" <a href="../../../m/o/n/Moniker.html" title="Moniker">moniker</a> about the area of three "major" cities (one of which is the capital), three smaller cities, and several villages and suburban development all served by the same broadcast media and a significant amount of print. It would be there that the total population would be given and, since those outside the area might mistake an article about Albany to miss the greater impact of this District, to have that article mentioned. <a href="../../../f/w/g/User%7EFwgoebel_07f8.html" title="User:Fwgoebel">Fwgoebel</a> 22:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually got them from the Capital District page, but am fine if you want to pull some parts of them back out.

<dd>I'll confess to not reading super close. All I'll say is that we want to avoid having a lot of information stated in two articles at once. If you think there is an inconsistency, I'd say go ahead and remove it rather than trying to clarify by pulling over a lot of content from a separate article. Duplicate info requires duplicate maintenance. Like I said, this is just from a quick review, but it looked like there was a lot of region-specific info that was not really appropriate for a city-specific article.

<p>Metroland is a proven local commodity and resource, but I'm not sure that Valley Voice merits being included here at all, or even having its own wiki. There are LOADS of free newspapers (Parent Pages, etc.) that float around this market that have more reach and tenure than Valley Voice, so including it with Metroland gives it far more prestige than it deserves thus far. I would recommend that it not be listed here until (a) it's been around a little longer, since there have only been about four issues to date, and (b) it gets recognized by an organization like Association of Alternative Newsweeklies as being a legit alternative paper. Follow the link to its page; I would also seriously question whether that wiki merits a delete as non-notable, or at least a SERIOUS review for NPOV.

<p>I removed the Arbitron ratings from the main page for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their presence on the main Albany, New York page is very clunky and out of place. I could make a case for having them on the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_in_Albany%2C_New_York_d10a.html" title="Media in Albany, New York">Media in Albany, New York</a> page though.</li>
<li>The official Arbitron name for the Albany market is <b>Albany-Schenectady-Troy-Saratoga</b> and much of what goes on in the ratings doesn't reflect the tastes of Albany proper. Anyone who has spent considerable time in Albany proper (or lived out of town and heard the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wilkow_2861.html" title="Andrew Wilkow">Andrew Wilkow</a> take on the city) knows that there is no way that <a href="../../../w/g/n/WGNA-FM_0127.html" title="WGNA-FM">WGNA-FM</a> is #1 in the city limits.</li>
<li>It could be slighty risky to put rankings in an article given the veritable witchunts Arbitron's legal department has gone on in the past given threatening letters to certain message boards (but not others) that even posted rankings. I should mention that I am against such practices (given it falls into the area of potential <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> violations on their end) and left a position for one of said boards for that among other reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, other cities don't have their Top 10 stations posted on their city pages. Why should Albany be so different, especially with the demographic differences between city and suburbs? <a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScrabbleship_2703.html" title="User:Scrabbleship">Scrabbleship</a> 11:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Since their actions have had a significant affect on this article, we need to be extra cautious to make sure that we follow proper guidelines. However, if you see images missing, please do a Google search or check answers.com, download them, and restore them, as they are most likely legal but improperly cited.</p>

<p>I am wondering how the name of Albany is actually pronounced by natives of our capital city. I am from Orange County, NY and have alway pronounced it "aul-buhnee" with the "al" sounding like the word all. but whenever I travel out of state people pronouce it "al-bahnee" with the "al" sounding like the name Alan. So I'd like to know which is correct. Thanks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrideranne_2f02.html" title="User:Strideranne">Strideranne</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrideranne_bb1b.html" title="User talk:Strideranne">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strideranne_e466.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strideranne">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I've lived and worked in this area for 15 years and never heard that term, whereas most anyone who has spent time here has heard "Smallbany". You can't claim people are "pouring into" a city that has lost population steadily for several decades. (The growth in our MSA is primarily in Colonie and Clifton Park . . . and I presume that those newcomers aren't generally the underground/independent artists you're citing). All of the text about "some people moving from Boston or NYC" is unencyclopedic and anecdotal . . . people have ALWAYS moved between the cities in the Northeast. While I applaud your efforts to promote Albany's arts and culture (I've been working to do so for years myself), you can't make something so just by saying it, as you appear to be attempting via the "Crossroads City" moniker. "Tech Valley" has caught on in the local media and vernacular, but until I hear or read "Crossroads City" used in the same sort of "everyone around here know what we're talking way" that "Smallbany" or "Tech Valley" or "The Collar City" are, I can't see it being listed as having replaced any other marketing/discussion tags to describe Albany. <a href="../../../g/n/h/User%7EGnhn_5e26.html" title="User:Gnhn">Gnhn</a> 13:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section was recently restored and while I had no part in it, I wish to voice my support for it being a part of this article and staying here. Many times I have welcomed someone who has moved here from Lon Guyland (Long Island, as some of us pronounce it around here) and like its urbanesque nature, yet at the same time complain that it's too small. Several years ago, I welcomed a Norwegian Jaycee to the area and drove her around Center Square. She remarked how similar it really is to Amsterdam, Netherlands. <a href="../../../f/w/g/User%7EFwgoebel_07f8.html" title="User:Fwgoebel">Fwgoebel</a> 19:15, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So what's the protocol here when someone just keeps deleting something legitimate from a page without justification? (I've had to put the Smallbany info back in three or four times now, and whoever keeps deleting it never offers any discussion or valid justification). I haven't had to deal with this before.

<dd>Generally, it's a good idea to leave a note on the talk page of the user (or IP address) removing the content. If it seems clear that they're just blanking sections left and right, one of the {{test(n)a}} user warning templates may be appropriate (see <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a> under "Removing content" for more info on those templates). Or, you can leave a more specific message, as I've done at <a href="../../../1/4/4/User_talk%7E144.211.195.112.html" title="User talk:144.211.195.112">User talk:144.211.195.112</a> (for the last particular IP who has removed this), and hope that they stop or join the discussion. Other than that, just keep restoring the section, and other editors will probably do so as well, as long as they see this discussion and agree with keeping the section (which, to add my two cents, I do). And, of course, always remember to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">be civil</a>, no matter how annoying these repeat changes get!&#160;:) —<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrellis_efff.html" title="User:Krellis">Krellis</a> 03:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the "Smalbany" mentality is not a LOCAL one. It's from the college students who en mass come here to Siena, UAlbany, Skidmore, and the rest of the colleges from downstate. They think that compared to the NYC metro area we have less to do and see. And yes we do have less if you compare metro area to metro area. We still have lots more than their individual Long Island towns have, its unfair to compare Albany to NYC. Compare us to Yonkers or Hempstead and we have a much better standard of living and nightlife and shopping. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.206.97.30_c3cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.206.97.30">128.206.97.30</a> (talk) 15:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I completely disagree that "Smallbany" springs from the colleges . . . you'll hear it more among oldtimers in town on Lark Street than you will on the Uptown Campus. If the college kids use the phrase (I work at one local college, and attend grad school at another), then they have learned it from the locals. It is definitely a home-grown inferiority complex, and oftentimes in the local arts and music community (both of which I have been heavily involved in for 15+ years) it is used as a crutch or an excuse when the local community doesn't support something worthwhile and worthy. The word can be used fondly as well as derisively, and I think the article is clear about that. It's great that certain segments of the arts community are exploding downtown, and I'm thrilled to see/hear that . . . but suppressing/stifling the word "Smallbany" isn't what made those things happen, and it won't hurt those things in any way either. I get a sense that at some of the resistance to the phrase in this article is from people who have moved here from elsewhere, and don't want their friends in their former cities seeing it and thinking that they've moved to some provincial backwater or little unimportant place. I don't know many locals who are bothered by the phrase. Small can be charming. Embrace it. <a href="../../../g/n/h/User%7EGnhn_5e26.html" title="User:Gnhn">Gnhn</a> 19:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A promotional website for anything "Albany" would very likely stay away from the "Smallbany" term, but this isn't a promotional website. This is an encyclopedia article, and that means that anything good and bad, as long as presented with a neutral point of view, that exists is fair game. Some other articles with which I've been involved have had subjects having their own good and bad points. As of now, "Smallbany" is not an article unto itself, nor does the name redirect here (maybe it should?

<p>Is there any city in the US that was NOT founded by Europeans?

<p>I see we have a section on Famous Albanians - is that the correct term for someone from Albany (i.e. the same term used as that for someone from Albania)? Do we have some reference to that? It seems confusing. I don't live there so can't verify it easily. If this is really true we should add it to the disambiguation page at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a> -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/u/User_talk%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_01bf.html" title="User talk:Alucard (Dr.)">Talk</a> 15:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've heard it used informally, but have no idea where a citation could be found for that. I definitely don't see it used in more formal settings, due to the confusion with people from Albania and the fact that it just sounds a bit weird in reference to people from Albany. It might just be easier to title it "Famous people from Albany" or "Notable people from Albany"-- <a href="../../../o/a/x/User%7EOaxaca_dan_17a3.html" title="User:Oaxaca dan">Oaxaca dan</a> 15:50, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a reference, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binghamton%2C_New_York_0c54.html" title="Binghamton, New York">Binghamton</a> uses "Famous residents" while <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a> has the page <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_people_from_Buffalo%2C_NY_1dc3.html" title="Famous people from Buffalo, NY">Famous people from Buffalo, NY</a>. <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utica%2C_New_York_1f41.html" title="Utica, New York">Utica</a> uses "Utica people." Syracuse uses "Famous Syracusans" but has a separate page for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_from_Syracuse%2C_New_York_a061.html" title="List of people from Syracuse, New York">List of people from Syracuse, New York</a>. I prefer the Buffalo Style, but would use "notable," because some of the historic people are notable, but not necessarily "famous." But in the end, it really doesn't matter to me -- <a href="../../../o/a/x/User%7EOaxaca_dan_17a3.html" title="User:Oaxaca dan">Oaxaca dan</a> 15:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another possibility would be "Notable Albany Natives". I agree to using the term "notable" though. Maybe "Notable residents" would be best. -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/u/User_talk%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_01bf.html" title="User talk:Alucard (Dr.)">Talk</a> 16:06, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
