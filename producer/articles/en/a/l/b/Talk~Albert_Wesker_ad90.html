<p>I question this claim. He is arguably the main <i>human</i> antagonist in the original game, but you never actually fight him. Then he isn't in Part 2 or 3 at all. He shows up in Code Veronica but the "main antagonist" label doesn't exactly fit that game either. I don't know much about Part 0 but I know he's basically a "bonus" character in Part 4. I am editing this, please discuss before reverting. --<a href="../../../f/e/i/User%7EFeitclub_dad9.html" title="User:Feitclub">Feitclub</a> 06:23, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there is difficulty in titling Wesker as the principal villain within the individual scenarios of each games, I believe that he does fulfill the role as the main antagonist. I think the problem with labelling Wesker with this title is that he is not given the status of most archetypal villains (he has been killed and defeated by all of the primary heroes have knowledge of who he is.) Either way, his feud with Chris Redfield (arguably the series primary hero as he is the character that most fans associate with the series) seems to demonstrate his importance as a villain. -- Jack of Blades</p>

<p>I was doing ok with copyediting till I got to this paragraph:</p>
<p><i>Wesker bunkered down in a small secure monitoring room, safe from roaming monsters and from his former team. Here, he began leading the others to traps. When the opportunity presented itself, he gained Barry's cooperation by <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">blackmailing</a> him with threats against his family. Wesker was also responsible for the death of Bravo Team's leader, Enrico Marini, after finding the truth, using Barry to get to him. However, Jill and Chris eventually learned the truth about Wesker and proceeded to destroy the Tyrant, along with the underground laboratory. The two, along with Barry and surviving Bravo Team member Rebecca, escaped the mansion in a helicopter piloted by a guilt-stricken Brad Vickers, and left Wesker for dead after he was killed by Tyrant, which he had himself awakened.</i></p>
<p>Then my eyes started bleeding because it is so ambiguous and parts do not make sense and ...well. Someone else please help this paragraph because I suspect the ambiguity is due to actual plot info that I don't know about, not being a RE fan and I don't want to change the meaning of anything. --<a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_91cc.html" title="User:Nahallac Silverwinds">Naha</a>|<sup><a href="../../../n/a/h/User_talk%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_c8bb.html" title="User talk:Nahallac Silverwinds">(talk)</a></sup> 20:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't plan on putting this in the wiki although I had thought about it...but its just speculation more than anything so not for now. I was wondering, does anyone else feel like Wesker is the pseudo main character of the entire Resident Evil series? He may not be the hero, but he's technically been in almost every single RE or at least by far the highest amount...and if he's not there physically he at least has an intangible presense usually.</p>
<p>RE0=He's with Birkin, and Bravo Team's dillemna is of course his doing. RE=We all know his part here RE2=He may not have been there in game, but canon wise he was along with Ada for the whole thing...working within the shadows. RE3=He wasn't really there so this is a bit of a stretch, but since he was present in RE2 he must of been looming around the city at least a little, and didn't Nicholai have some connection with him? (Or was he just Umbrella's dog, which would make him a rival of Wesker) RE: Code Veronica=Major role in the plot RE4=Secretly fighting the battle behind the scenes, and playable in Mercenaries.</p>
<p>While his appearance is something, what makes me think of him as the main character in a way is his influence in the series. Even in games that have nothing to do with him such as Outbreak and Gun Survivor Wesker is at least mentioned once...or at least his doings. Also if you think about it...in a way RE is Wesker's story, thats my biggest thought. From the first game to the most recent 4, everything is a step in Wesker's plan or his general escapades. In 0 it was all about getting the Tyrant and using it against Umbrella (for his own purposes of course). From 2 to Veronica..all the events of each game are a backdrop to the real conclusion...Wesker obtaining what he wanted. Even in 4, perhaps more than any other game, the story seems to twist around Wesker's fingers. The cult and everything was used by Wesker (using Ada) so he could obtain what he wanted. The overall motion of the story now is what Wesker is up to.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is a bit wordy, but I was wondering if anyone else shared this sentiment?--<a href="../../../k/i/y/User%7EKiyosuki_aad2.html" title="User:Kiyosuki">Kiyosuki</a> 01:51, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I share your sentiments, however in regards to him being a "pseudo main character", there's nothing pseudo about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only thing I'm hesitant to add to the article, is Wesker's motivation. It's a observation I noted from Wesker's Reports, and from the non-canon novelizations. You see, I think Wesker is a bit paranoid when it comes to <a href="../../../o/z/w/Ozwell_E._Spencer_3018.html" title="Ozwell E. Spencer">Ozwell E. Spencer</a>. Wesker seems to question Spencer's motivations, reasonings, actions, and future plans.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Especially when it came down to Spencer's extravagant research costs. Spencer demanded a stand alone biological weapon that could exterminate an entire population, yet the costs of the research were so high, it made little business sense to Wesker. And yet research continued to find this stand alone biological weapon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wesker even questions why their labs are where they are? Most of their products were extremely adaptable to almost everything, and infected almost everything. The other founder, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Ashford_66cb.html#Resident_Evil_Code:_Veronica" title="Edward Ashford">Edward Ashford</a>, established a lab in the barren South Pole. To Wesker, it seemed Spencer was waiting for an outbreak to occur in the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Arklay Mountains">Arklay Mountains</a> or in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Raccoon_City_f4a1.html" title="Raccoon City">Raccoon City</a>. Why would Spencer risk such a thing, when they have yet to develop the stand alone biological weapon he wants. Wesker keeps questioning why, why, and why.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wesker's collection of Combat Data and Biological Samples (viruses, parasites, and antibodies) give him a lot of leverage, in which to satisfy his possible curiosity, rivalry, or conflict with Spencer. Who knows, perhaps it'll end in a no holds barred war between them, or he'll turn out to be the defender of the world against Spencer.</dd>

<p>Hmm.. A thought occurs to me. Where Umbrella has at the very least been woefully incompotent, negelgant, or whatever else you'd call it. (Namely how close to a population center they dropped a chemical weapons lab, and how poorly they prepared for what looked like a likely scenario) But Wesker has always been cool, calm, compotent and from the looks of things he's yet to fail due to a perosnal error. Frankly, i'd rather not let him be in charge of Umbrella, the Corporation, or anything else.. He'd be far too good at it. Bluegrime 07:59, 4 July 2006 (UTC) Bluegrime</p>

<p>This section needs badly rewritten - most of it is incorrect. Birkin and Wesker didn't work on the T-virus while Marcus worked on his - they only started working on the T virus at Arklay AFTER Marcus was killed and they stole his research, ie they continued it. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParjay_aba8.html" title="User:Parjay">Parjay</a> 22:07, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Birkin and Wesker did work on the T-Virus... Rather pretty much all of Umbrella did. It's all because of the ambiguity of Spencer's dream virus. The thing Spencer wanted, was something that came from the Founder/Progenitor/Mother Virus that had the capability of eradicating populations. The T-Virus was just an unnamed goal at the time. Birkin and Wesker did work with Marcus. They did do work in trying to devlop the T-Virus with and without Marcus. It's like two individuals trying to invent a device that stores electrical energy. Though one was the first to create one and name it a battery, did not the other also work on creating the battery whether individually, cooperatively, or both?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But on the other hand, Marcus was the one to come up with splicing leech genes onto the virus in secret. He created and named the Tyrant-Virus, though one or more people kept trying to spy on his work. He was eventually killed by Birkin and Wesker and his research continued. (However Marcus' work seemed to stop researching on ways to surpass the T-Virus but rather focused on experiments on his evolving T-Virus Leeches. Not that Birkin and Wesker ever continued this particular line of research.)</dd>

<dd>Most of your posted "evidence" from the game only supports what we already know: that Wesker and Birkin where TRAINED at Marcus' facility; this doesnt mean they worked on the virus there.

<dd>I'd have to agree with you on all your points because thats what I said earlier, or at least meant to say and if thats the case I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I made it quite clear that the concept of the T-Virus was a "unnamed goal at the time" in my first paragraph.

<p>It states that the picture in Wesker’s stats screen “after succesfully using him in merc mode” is him back in the days when he worked with Birkin in the lab. I presume the editor is talking about the picture after completing a mercenary level where it displays your ranking and such, but I don’t see anything that suggests it was Wesker in his lab days, as he’s wearing the same outfit he is in Resident Evil 4, and I don’t see anything else suggesting that.

Such as the Resident Evil Archives book. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 22:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you can't link to it, then just provide the book it comes from. If it's not linked or in a book, it doesn't go on Wikipedia. Please read this section here- <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citing_sources.html" title="Citing sources">Citing_sources</a>, it provides the basis for Wikipedia's rules regarding content. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 22:43, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did. Most of it came from the Resident Evil Archives book, by Bradly Games, and there is no other way to view these facts or the content of the book. Because there isn't a source online that would provide it. However, I appreciate your help and advise.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 22:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To add any information that comes from the aforementioned Archives book, cite it rather than stating "fans speculate" or "rumors say". A published source is a published source and is valid. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 22:49, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ah, alright. I'll see what I can do to prove some of the contents that are in the Archives book. As for the other information, I know I have seen them on other sites. But my room mate was the one that found them. Anyways, give me some time to find them in order to prove these theories to be facts or apart of a decent media.&#160;:P <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 22:53, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're dumping unverified and unverifiable fan speculation on this article, when what it needs very badly is to have the plot summary reduced drastically. Please don't just dump content from RE Archives or other books;instead, find third-party analysis or commentary in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (so, not the creators talking to the fans, but books or articles or similar written by people other than the creators) and use that to write this article. Right now, it's nothing but recapping bits and pieces of plot from the RE games, and that's unacceptable.- <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:08, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Actually, not all of them was fan speculations. There are two parts of it that happen to be true. One: The fact that Peter O'Meara will be playing the part of Albert Wesker in Extinction has been verified. (and writen by another user). Two: There are sources that state that Wesker will be in Resident Evil 5 and that he will not be the main antagious. For this resource that Wesker will be in 5, and the other parts, (except about the movie) I will leave out until I can find the reasources for them either online or offline. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 23:17, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

By "Gamehead" on Spike Tv. Which you can find the videos of the show on http//www.youtube.com . They were the first video game show that was on the set of Extinction. Plus, there is another site that has verified this. I can't think of it now, but I'll go get the site. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 23:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hehe...

<p>I don't want to see it, I want to cite it. What episode of the show?

Try typing in the YouTube search "Resident Evil Gamehead Part 2" , and don't worry about citing. I have already did that for you.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 23:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A random Youtube video is not a reliable source. I want to cite this to a reliable source, so that someone who wants to verify this claim can do so in a source that is reliable (unlike a site where anyone can upload anything). If it can't be cited, it's not going in. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:40, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
lol.. You got to be kidding me? The director of the film himself, states that Wesker will be in the next Resident Evil movie, in the video of Gamehead. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 23:49, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then, by all means, find out when the show aired, and use {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_visual_0bd6.html" title="Template:Cite visual">cite visual</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_interview_0c6a.html" title="Template:Cite interview">cite interview</a>}} to cite it.

<p>Dude, I have given you two solid links that proves that Wesker will be appearing in the next Resident Evil movie, and that Peter O'Meara will be playing the part. But you keep on insisting that it isn't a faction because they aren't feasible references by your own standards. I don't know why you don't think the video is evential enough to be proof, and the site that I had provided, which is a timeline of the actor's career, and what movies, TV. shows he's taken part in? You can look this up in any search engine, and it'll state the same thing. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 00:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>-.- What's with the insults? Did I lower my standards when I was speaking to you in my last entry? Because I see nothing of the sort. As for the information I had provided with the sites, and video... It seems that nothing I had for reference seems to be not good enough, and if these are the rules of Wikipedia, then this source isn't the best to turn to. Although, I am still continuing on my search to find anything else that could be used. (I am looking for the facts of the episode of Gamdhead, etc.) Anyways, thank you for your advise once again, Ex-Nintendo. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowFox_S.T.A.R.S._c97e.html" title="User:ShadowFox S.T.A.R.S.">*.:.`ShadowFox` S.T.A.R.S..:.*</a> 00:30, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
