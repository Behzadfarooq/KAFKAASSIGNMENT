<p>That comment about Pujols being one of the best hitters in the game today is not POV...anyone with basic knowledge of baseball can look at his stats and easily see that is one of baseball's best current players.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not to split hairs, but the POV comment I made was mostly about the 'momentous record' phrase. People can easilly draw their own conclusions about that record. Calling him one of the greatest active players twice in one paragraph was more redundant than a POV problem. Just my opinion though. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:12, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Born in poverty in the Dominican Republic"? Pujols himself has been quoted as saying that his roots were middle-class, that he didn't have to make do with the improvised gloves, etc., that feature in some other Dominican success stories. Please document.</p>

<dd>I'm finding a few references to the "born in poverty" thing, not all that great. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1772471" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1772471" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.123celebs.net/a/albert-pujols/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.123celebs.net/a/albert-pujols/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Seems like they might just be working on the assumption that "born in the DR" = "born in poverty". If you have a source for the quote you mentioned, I'd say go ahead and delete the poverty reference in the article. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:51, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be nice to get a picture of Albert in one of the regular jerseys, instead of the retro jersey. The retro jersey kind of gives an incorrect impression that this is what he normally looks like when he's playing day to day. --Booch 17:29, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How often do you see Albert wearing a retro jersey? Everyone knows what his regular jersey looks like. If you can find a fan picture with a GFDL license, then cool. Otherwise more than likely you'll have to put in a copyrighted image, and no copyrighted images should ever be on Wikipedia, and Fair Use should never be assumed. Furthermore, a little etiquette here.

<p>An anonymous user is persistantly adding the claim that Pujols' age is disputed. His sources are A) a message board and B) A work of humor. Because he persistantly added it, he's been briefly blocked for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, but I'd like any opinions about the issue in the hopes of working out a long-term solution, should one be needed.

<dd>Speculation about his age as certainly occurred - a few years ago, there was a rash of Latin American players revealed as older than they claimed. But Pujols came to the US at age 16 (younger than most Latin players) and went to high school then. The speculation has only to do with Pujols being so good so soon and so consistently. It has no basis in fact and doesn't belong in the article. <a href="../../../z/a/f/User%7EZafiroblue05_effc.html" title="User:Zafiroblue05">zafiroblue05</a> | <a href="../../../z/a/f/User_talk%7EZafiroblue05_d06c.html" title="User talk:Zafiroblue05">Talk</a> 22:12, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pujols has been dogged with questions about his age since high school. It is a very common practice in DR to lie about age of young children, especially if they are baseball prospects. The majority of DR players had their ages changed by 2+ years after 9/11 when stricter visa requirements were enforced. Pujols skipped this because he was already a resident of the US. But most people agree Pujols is definitely older than he claims to be. Pictures of him in his late teens, early 20s (allegedly) seem to confirm this best. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.48.8.173 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.48.8.173.html" title="User talk:68.48.8.173">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.48.8.173_6ec7.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.48.8.173">contribs</a>) 06:36, 5 May 2006.</small></p>

<dd>68.48.8.173, thank you for posting on the talk page rather than reverting the article. It may well be a common practice for players from the Dominican Republic to misrepresent their ages; I don't know enough either way on such a claim. Certainly it has happened, but claiming that it is "common" is pushing an unencyclopedic claim; you have to provide a <i>credible</i> source if you want such a claim included in the article. Please read about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> to understand what Wikipedia is striving for. The point is that we <i>don't</i> know for certain that Pujols, or anyone else, has misrepresented his age unless we can prove it. At the very least we need a credible third-party who reports a controversy over disputed ages. Can you find such a source? Claiming that "most people" agree or that pictures "seem" to confirm your opinion simply isn't factual enough for Wikipedia.

<p>Would it be fair to put in the article that many in the media have doubted the validity of his age? Jim Rome for one always makes a comment about his age in a joking manner. I'm sure there's a newspaper article about this somewhere.</p>

<p>What do people think about this section? It's all true as far as I know, and I've added two citations, but I worry that the length given to it is a bit excessive. 2 incidents in 800+ games seems par for the course for one of the best known players in the game. I'm not saying we shouldn't mention it, but if we give too much attention to it, we might present a skewed picture of Pujols, suggesting he's a walking timebomb or something. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 12:57, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The section seems to reflect actual events, but its intent appears to be to skewer Pujols, so I worry about NPOV. Perhaps it would help if we put in another side to the story and/or shortened the section. Pujols comments on the Perez incident here: <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060425&amp;content_id=1416975&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl" class="external autonumber" title="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060425&amp;content_id=1416975&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. He talks about regretting flipping his bat, but from his perspective he was trying to respect the game and let Perez know (in an admittedly immature way) that he shouldn't show up other players. From memory, the incident with Bennett got out of hand in part because Bennett wouldn't let it go -- not that Pujols's behavior is excused, but if he was provoked, that seems relevant. The addition's phrasing ("Pujols has been involved in a number of altercations with other major league players in his career, mostly because of his tendency to admire his particularly well-struck home runs.") implies that Pujols does this homer-and-watch routine more than other players, but that simply doesn't jibe with my observations. Lots of players admire their moonshots. -<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenixrod_d498.html" title="User:Phoenixrod">Phoenixrod</a> 13:53, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess I should have checked your changes more carefully, W.marsh.&#160;:) Your citations seem useful, and mine above is extraneous. In any case, the section does need work. If Pujols has been involved in "a number of altercations," that phrasing makes me think of a long string of serious run-ins, while there is, as far as I know, one punch and one minor bat-flip. Pujols has a good reputation in baseball and among fans; Peter Gammons, in a March 12, 2005 article here <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/gammons/story?id=2011372" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/gammons/story?id=2011372" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> writes about how baseball should market players like Pujols for having good character on and off the field. That was well after the Bennett incident, which ought to be more seriously considered that the Perez one. -<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenixrod_d498.html" title="User:Phoenixrod">Phoenixrod</a> 14:04, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I added the section on on-field incidents, mostly because they happen to be true. I didn't mean to imply that he was Milton Bradley, but I suppose devoting any text to his run-ins with other pitchers is more than you're likely to see with most players' Wikipedia pages. If you think the information is irrelevant, I suppose I wouldn't be too upset if you deleted it. However, Pujols does have a history of treating the confrontation with the pitcher a bit personally, and sometimes reacting in a way that, if nothing else, people notice. I assure you, though, that my intent was not to skewer Pujols. Being from St. Louis, I love the guy. I just wrote up some stuff on him because it was true, and I figured the more information available, the better. This year, Pujols has done the homer-step-toss bat-step-watch routine way more than he used to, which is why it occured to me that his on-field attitude might be noticable, at least.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbish_f11f.html" title="User:Johnbish">Johnbish</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnbish_28ee.html" title="User talk:Johnbish">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnbish_5841.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnbish">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>No, I don't think anyone wants to just remove it, largely because it's written in a neutral tone (no "some fans believe Pujols is a worthless jerk" kind of stuff that creeps into other articles). Criticism certainly has its place in Wikipedia articles, and thanks for adding it. What might be best is to shorten it to a summary of the two incidents, and find a quote from a well-known sportswriter about Pujols' reputation or behavior, to kind of sum it up. But what's there will do for now, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:10, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the first sentence of the on-field incidents section might be misleading. Pujols has "only" been involved in two on-field incidents... I think "only" is meant to imply that two incidents with opposing players that received some publicity is not so many. I admit, my knowledge of the game is fairly narrow, but I can't think of many other players that have been involved in more than one incident in the press regarding on-field conduct, showboating, etc. I know Milton Bradley caught some flak a few years ago when he started unstrapping his batting gloves as he watched his homers. I know Bonds is frequently accused of admiring his homers... every player, it seems, has his own little homer quirk, so to speak (the Boone bat flip comes to mind). But I think Pujols is par for the course where it concerns the homer-strut, not somehow a shining example of humility as the phrase "only two on field incidents" seems to imply.

<p>I think that the stat comparison presented in the article is illuminating, and a great feature that should be placed on the pages of a lot of current players. However, I dispute its selection of "first five years". Pujols had the great fortune that his first five major league seasons were full seasons. Alex Rodriguez was called up for three weeks in 1994, and then was a "September Call-Up" (actually in August) in 1995. His first full season wasn't until 1996. I bring this up because in this chart, his 5-year average game total (103) makes it look like he got hurt a lot, when in fact the LEAST amount of games he's played when he spent the whole season in the big leagues was 129, in 1999.</p>
<p>Long story short, I believe that the chart should use the first five full seasons for all players. If that calculus is used, A-Rod is the only player whose stats change, to: G (145), BA (.315), HR (37), RBI (115), SB (25), R (122). Note that Pujols still comes out looking better in every category but stolen bases. I think this is just a little more accurate of a comparison.--<a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirishis_f222.html" title="User:Eirishis">Eirishis</a> 15:53, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure why the anonymous edit from 24.171.27.52 deleted the pronunciation of his name, but I think it's pretty important. I've heard a couple broadcasters (early on) and several people mispronounce his name (such as <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>:/pudʒolz/).

<dd>The ironic part is that "pooJAWLZ" is the actual correct pronunciation. "Pujols" roughly means "Hills" in the Catalan language (of which I am a native speaker) and I swear each time I hear "pooHOWLZ" I feel like murdering whoever said it. If you don't believe this, check the "Catalan phonology" article and also the "Jordi Pujol" article (he was the president of Catalonia for some years.) The complete history is that since Catalan is not spoken in the DR it's no wonder that Albert Pujols doesn't know how to pronounce his own name, but the fact is that he doesn't know how to pronounce it right. It's kind of like all the German-Americans and Italian-Americans who pronounce their names in totally bizarre ways; or like Don DeLillo who can't even spell his own name right (it should be "De Lillo", with a space) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.43.178.137_7bdf.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.43.178.137">62.43.178.137</a> (talk) 19:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>
