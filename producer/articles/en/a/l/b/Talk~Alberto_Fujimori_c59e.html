<p>I have reverted the heading "Peruvian Civil War (1980-1992)" listed by an anonymous editor. The subheading seems to imply that Civil War in Peru ended by 1992 which is unsubstantiated, moreover the prior heading chronology is illogical in the context of the Fujimori entry. --<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> 19, October 2006</p>

<ul>
<li>Sendero's first political act was the boycott to the 1980's Peruvian Presidential Election. Belaunde labeled them as simple "avijeos" - "cattle thieves".</li>
<li>According to the "Truth and Reconciliation Committee", the most violent period happened during the Garcia Administration. So far, GarcÃ­a, for some estrange reason is not criticized here in Wikipedia.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimael_Guzm%C3%A1n_d00a.html" title="Abimael GuzmÃ¡n">Abimael GuzmÃ¡n</a>, leader of Sendero Luminoso, was captured in 1992. That year marked the political and military defeat of Sendero and the end of the most ruthless violence in Peru.</li>
<li>Remnants of Sendero are still a problem in some areas of the country (mostly in the Jungle), but are not even close to the power that Sendero had before 1992. BTW, GuzmÃ¡n dosn't approve those actions.</li>
<li>Bdean has never criticized Sendero, MRTA and GarcÃ­a. Is that NPOV?</li>

<dd>According to Mr."I-am-a-selfproclaimed-Human-Rights-Advocate", his definition of "Human Rights" does not include any type of criticism to the violence that Sendero created and Alan GarcÃ­a's triumphal return to the same country that he devastated. By "Rule of Law" we can also imply that Bdean's definition doesn't include any type of comment regarding Sendero's disrespect for the Peruvian constitution and laws.

<p>Now to the main argument: I wonder how the government that abolished the mandatory military service in Peru is responsible for the "militarization" of Peru. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 15:52, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I would agree the following sentence could be removed, it has been tagged and is also slightly vague:</dd>

<dd>What is this?

<dd>Hi, regarding the use of dictator linked to "Contrasting Variants of the Populism of Hugo ChÃ¡vez and Alberto Fujimori" by Steve Ellner, I found the following abstract.
<dl>
<dd>"During the 1990s Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Argentina's Carlos Menem were the two main political successes of Latin American populism. Both completed two successive presidential terms, a unique accomplishment in the continent, and overcame the political instability that previously beset their nations."<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=143175" class="external autonumber" title="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=143175" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Accordingly, I would suggest 'dictator' could be replaced with 'president', unless Bdean could supply another quote that gives a different emphasis. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 17:30, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main problem here is that Bdean WANTS the word "dictator" somewhere in Fujimori's article.

<p>Signing one's posts on Wikipedia discourse (especially talk pages) is not only good etiquette; it also facilitates discussion by helping those like myself to identify the author of a particular comment, and to address specific comments to the relevant user(s). I firmly believe that open, transparent discussion is a crucial aspect of collaborative editing as it enables us to better comprehend the development of knowledge. I am proud of my scholarly record and academic achievements, but above all, my unflagging commitment to human rights and social justice. As such, I hope the preceding <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsigned.html" title="Unsigned">unsigned</a> comment added by 65.2.103.216 will further the on-going debate regarding <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a>'s role in shaping Peruvian society, not to mention clarify the serious criminal accusations facing the former President--<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> 22, October 2006</p>

<dd>Yes Bdean, keep throwing flowers at yourself. It is sad to see someone is praising himself, not to mention that your last comment clearly states your political agenda here in Wikipedia. This IP user is making several mistakes by not addressing specifically what is his/her complains about the page, but your narrow-mindedness goes is beyond any doubt. I encourage anyone to rv Bdean's political motivated editions from this article, since I personally don't believe that "Caviar Leftist" can actually do something to improve this page.<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 18:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I don't believe that the article improves with Bdean's contributions. He keeps pushing a political agenda and using "weasel words" and "loaded terms". Do I have to make myself more cleat than that?</li>
<li>I don't have Phd or a MBA, but you don't need to have those college degrees to realize that Bdean's editions are nothing more than biased and politically motivated. What kind of neutrality can a self-proclaimed "Human Right Activist" provide? Next time he will be defending (and who knows, perhaps also praising) <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sendero_Luminoso_cb98.html" title="Sendero Luminoso">Sendero Luminoso</a> violent ârevolutionaryâ campaign and ruthless killing of thousands of Peruvians.

<p>As an American, I don't read much of the <i>Journal of Latin American Studies</i> (a British Publication). I read <i>Latin American Research Review</i> much more often. Both of these journals are very highly respected. I've noticed that a lot of articles that LARR publishes do call Fujimori a "dictator." They also usually have a footnote explaining the various recent works that have categorized Fujimori's power as dictatorial. Consequentially, I think it's legitimate to mention that a large number of leading voices within the Latin American studies community have called Fujimori a dictator. I do not, however, think that wikipedia should just unequivocally say that he was a dictator. It's such a highly contentious issue that I think just saying "Fujimori was a dictator" would subtract from this article, but explaining the entire debate over Fujimori's use of power, especially his creation of clientalistic networks, would add to the overall article. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 00:56, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, a decent starting point from LARR might be Jo-Marie Burt's "'Quien Habla es Terrorista': The Political use of Fear in Fujimori's Peru." That's actually in the most recent LARR. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 01:00, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, what can I say? It's in the journal of the Latin American Studies Association, the absolute best journal on the subject in the entire world. And you haven't even read it.

<dd>The funny thing is that not only are there are several citations to things that Burt wrote in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_Path_bc8e.html" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a> article, and not only does every single one have to do with the brutality of Sendero, but the very article that I first mentioned is one of them. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 04:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does anyone else see the supreme irony in all this.

<dd>So self proclaiming yourself as a "Human Rights Advocate" = impartiality here in Wikipedia? Interesting. I also find the following thing plausible, using Descendall words: because a supposed "large number of leading voices within the American studies community have called <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> a dictator" turns him automatically into one?<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 01:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, but I'd say that if the 50 most promident Americanist political scientists came out and said that Bush is a dictator, some discussion of his use of power might be warranted on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Wouldn't you? --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 01:10, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you will continue to push for having <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> in the Dictator's list? <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 01:11, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would ask what part of Descendall's comment you didn't understand, but clearly it was the word "if". I suggest you re-read what he wrote and not pretend that he wrote something different.</dd>
<dd>I think it is entirely appropriate that we cite and quote academic sources that characterize Fujimori (presumably after the <i>autogolpe</i>) as a "dictator"; it is also entirely appropriate if we cite and quote academic sources that disagree with the assessment; in any case, the word should not be used in Wikipedia's own narrative voice. Similarly for calling Sendero "terrorist", but less of an issue here because this is not the article on Sendero. I personally think both characterizations are accurate, but my opinions don't particularly belong in the article. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having a looked at the article, and reading some of the dispute on this page I have concerns. I'm particularly concerned about this edit from Bdean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alberto_Fujimori&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82814146" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alberto_Fujimori&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82814146" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> which seems to reintroduce a number of unsourced claims, and a couple of sourced claims that overtly stress highly contentious opinions. Almost none of the present wording dealing with these claims and issues would be acceptable to me were they to be applied on the pages I regularly edit and monitor. I suggest that if editors want to keep any of this material, and judging by the action on this talk page it seems they do, then the priority should be to find multiple serious sources. And fast. Because the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a> police routinely scour for such material, and can be ruthless in dispensing justice.

<dd>Thanks Zleitzen, I for one am duly alarmed about the weasel words police. I also echo your suggestion to the extent individual users should just edit to improve portions of the article they have issues with, rather than entirely revert the complicated contributions of individual users or make personal accusations against them. Simply put cite tags on unsourced claims or add other referenced content to accurately and appropriately contextualize referenced if negative information. While the burden of proof for establishing claims is always on the contributor <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence</a>, we can all help Wikipedia run more smoothly by adding more referenced content rather than critiquing and criticizing individual users.

<p>--Dear <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a>, as <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> wisely notes, all of us can help Wikipedia, ârun more smoothly by adding more referenced content rather than critiquing and criticizing individual users.â Given you observation that you âregularly edit and monitorâ Wikipedia, combined with your concerns about the veracity of the substantive content of the Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> and suggestion that the priority of the editors âshould be to find multiple serious sources. And fastâ¦. That is my two centsâ, may I recommend that you assist in advancing knowledge regarding the contentious nature of the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> Presidency (1990-2000). I look forward to your constructive feedback on continuing the open dialogue about <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversial.html" title="Controversial">controversial</a> role in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, and the continued <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal.html" title="Legal">legal</a> challenges that face him.

<dd>I could assist by removing all unsourced claims and weasel words according to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> guidelines, which state that such claims should be removed immediately. Simply keeping "citation needed" tags is not good enough.

A period of grace has been generously bestowed by a number of editors on this material it seems, but this period can and will run out very shortly.

<p>--Dear <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a>, thank you for your constructive feedback. I agree with your suggestions that all unsourced claims should be removed, and keeping "citation needed" tags is simply ânot good enough". Moreover the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> entry would indeed benefit from a careful edit to avoid <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a>. Perhaps the talk page would be an appropriate forum to discus which terms or words have "the effect of, softening the force of a potentially loaded or otherwise controversial statement, or avoids forming a clear position on a particular issue." Given the democratic spirit of the Wikipedia project, I believe that the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_page.html" title="Talk page">talk page</a> would provide an appropriate venue to voice diverse points of view regarding <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>. I do agree with you that the "citation needed tags" confuse the "generalist" reader, and you are right that the burden of "proof" for establishing such claims rests with the contributor. As you will note from my contributions to the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> entry, I am not responsible for the information posted that has the "citation needed tags" (but rather the individual who placed most, if not all of them in the essay). Having said that, I do think a number of the unsourced claims may in fact be "true". I would be happy to try and find reliable sources to substantiate the claims that I believe are "true". I trust that you will do likewise in an effort to advance knowledge. I am a bit confused by your last statement: "We can also help Wikipedia by abiding by policy, and stressing these core policies on the talk page, can we not?" I would be happy to abide by the "core policies" and if I have violated any, I apologize. Any advice would be much appreciated. And thanks in advance for your counsel.

<li>The main problem here is Bdean, someone that clearly follows a political agenda, believes that his "word" is the law, has attempted to use Wikipedia for commercial purposes and has already failed to follow Wikipedia's NPOV rules by sponsoring the use of words such as "dictator". Just by looking at his Fujimori's entry in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a> you can see his true intentions. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 13:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is clear for me, at this point, that there are people here that believe to be "right" in every sense of the word, twisting and adapting facts to their own personal (and who knows, maybe commercial) purposes. <b>I have already declined a meaningless mediation, and I have formally requested that every single contribution that I made in those articles be erased.</b> I'm not going to force anyone to go "my way or the highway", because I know how frustrating that is. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 13:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I already leave a comment in the "Talk Page" of the Administrator that imposed my ban in the Fujimori's article. <b>In this sense, I'm withdrawing myself and leaving from Alberto Fujimori and List of Dictators articles permanently</b>. From now on, Bdean can do whatever he wants here, since apparently he has self proclaimed himself (besides "Human Right Advocate") as judge and jury, ignoring the fact that so far the Peruvian, Chilean and Japanese courts have not stated anything regarding the former President. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 13:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Your suggestion that â[m]aybe the title of the section should be âTerrorism and Fujimoriââ seems to elide the extent to which the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> regime was also allegedly party to acts of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">state terrorism</a>, as demonstrated by the imprisonment of officials of the government, such as <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimiro_Montesinos_939e.html" title="Vladimiro Montesinos">Vladimiro Montesinos</a>, and by the efforts of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peruvian.html" title="Peruvian">Peruvian</a> government to extradite <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>, where he is currently in exile, detained from leaving the country while the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extradition.html" title="Extradition">extradition</a> case against him is resolved. Clearly the civil strife and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_violence.html" title="Political violence">political violence</a> noted during the Fujimori regime (1990-2000) also involved the historically persistent problems associated with <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignorance.html" title="Ignorance">ignorance</a>, and the profound social inequities of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, themselves embedded in the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Columbian_74eb.html" title="Pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial.html" title="Colonial">colonial</a>, and subsequent development of âRepublicanâ or <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern.html" title="Modern">modern</a> Peruvian social configurations.

<p>Hi guys, i am new to wikipedia, and certainly i have no intention to began a edit war as you call it on this site?. But i think this article it is a little bit unbalanced, as i can see one user has been complaining about it. How about if this template {{Unbalanced}} is used on this article?.

<dl>
<dd>I'm a bit confused. The only person who was complaining about imbalance was Messhermit, who was clearly attempting to insert his own bias, to the point where there was a ruling banning him from editing the article, which he continues to try to change through the use of sockpuppets. That is not the sort of situation where we usually use the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnbalanced_cf71.html" title="Template:Unbalanced">unbalanced</a>}} tag. I'd propose removing the tag unless someone can give a cogent explanation of how the article is imbalanced: that is, either something significant that it leaves out, or something that is here that is given disproportionate weight. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:10, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> and suggest the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnbalanced_cf71.html" title="Template:Unbalanced">unbalanced</a>}} tag be removed. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> 1, January 2007</p>

<dd>I removed the tag. As there have been no serious objections on the talk page.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 08:00, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
