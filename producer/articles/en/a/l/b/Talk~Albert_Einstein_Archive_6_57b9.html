<h2><span class="mw-headline">1</span></h2>
<p>In Feb 2006, the talk page of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> filled up with a discussion of an alleged <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity_priority_dispute.html" title="Relativity priority dispute">relativity priority dispute</a>. Mainstream historians say this has been put to rest; others hotly disagree, as became very evident. To free up <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbert_Einstein_dfdf.html" title="Talk:Albert Einstein">Talk:Albert Einstein</a>, I moved the very long discussion to this archive. We encourage all concerned to confine further argumentation about the controversy to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Talk%7ERelativity_priority_dispute_8cd6.html" title="Talk:Relativity priority dispute">Talk:relativity priority dispute</a>, an article created to describe this controversy according to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia NPOV rules</a>.

<dd>I took that out of the intro paragraph. It doesn't belong there, breaking up the flow of the paragraph that introduces the subject of this article. Assuming it's true (I've no reason to believe otherwise), it really belongs in the article about relativity, or maybe the section about relativity here. But not up in Einstein's face, as it were, in the paragraph introducing Einstein in his own article. —&#160;<a href="../../../k/b/h/User%7EKbh3rd_5810.html" title="User:Kbh3rd">Kbh3<sup>rd</sup></a><a href="../../../k/b/h/User_talk%7EKbh3rd_3576.html" title="User talk:Kbh3rd"><font style="font-size:.7em;">talk</font></a> 19:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is a big difference between the <i>theory</i> of relativity and the <i>principle</i> of relativity, just as an aside. When playing with priority disputes (I think they miss the point) we should be sure to clarify which is which and exactly what sort of relativity one is speaking about. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 20:34, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Claim that Poincaré first published the Theory of Relativity</span></h3>
<p>Why is there no mention of the controversy surrounding the origin of Relativity&#160;? Folsing in his authoritive biography of Einstein points out that E=mc2 and the Theory of Relativity were actually first published in detail by the Frenchman Henri Poincare, before Einstein.

<dd>The user making the claim I reverted didn't document it enough for me to determine that it was a valid edit, and since it look questionable I reverted without any further ado. My apologies if this was incorrect. I'll watch more carefully when RC patrolling this article in the future.

<dd>I am concerned that anonymous user 69.22.98.162 is being accused of vandalism, and his edits subject to reverts, for attempting to integrate a mention of Poincare into this article. For example, a recent edit by Prodego has eliminated the Poincare mention, despite the MathPages citation added above. I am not an expert in this area, and so do not feel knowledgable enough in writing an addition re: Poincare here, but I strongly encourage the editors of this article to take the claim seriously. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 01:23, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>susequently to be reverted by several editors (including me). First there is no reason to delete the year and thereference and link to" <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annus_Mirabilis_Papers_ec72.html" title="Annus Mirabilis Papers">miracle year</a>". Second this is not the proper place to introduce speculation about the originality of "Relativity". Can anyone verify the claim that his special relativity paper went unmentioned because of "controversy surrounding its origin"? The current Britannica entry merely says he was <i>awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics “for your photoelectric law and your work in the field of theoretical physics.” Relativity, still the centre of controversy, was not mentioned.</i> It does not say what the controvesy was.</p>

<dd>The controversy was Henri Poincare's already publishing Relativity in detail before Einstein, including e=mc2.

<dd>Because this is nonsense, and we don't publish nonsense. If you understood Poincaré's work a little better, and maybe Einstein too, you'd see that they had different programs even though some aspects of their work were interrelated.

<dd>The reason Einstein was not given the prize for relativity was for a number of reasons; one major one being that it was still regarded as controversial among physicists at the time and the photoeletric theory was a much "safer" achievement. Again, the Poincaré/Einstein priority issue has been tossed around by various anti-Einsteinians for some time but no mainstream historians give it much attention. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:35, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Sir Whittaker's famous book, named above, he has an entire chapter entitled <i>The Theory of Relativity of Poincare</i> and he there repeatedly refers to <i>Poincare's E=mc2</i>.

<dd>The chapter in Whittaker's book is "The relativity theory of Poincare and Lorentz" and in fact the chapter mentions Lorentz as least as much, if not more than it mentions Poincare. I find only two mentions of Poincare in relation to E = mc^2. I don't think Whittaker is very reliable (see elsewhere on this page), but let's get it right. Whittaker credited Poincare <b>and</b> Lorentz. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 11:07, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The link to Bjerknes's crank site actually does not seem contain any Whittaker quotes. So I'm not sure that helps your argument much. The question is not whether or not people over the years have said various things to disparage Einstein (there was an entire movement devoted to just this purpose in Germany if you will recall) but what the mainstream historical and scientific opinion is, which has repeatedly concluded that most such objections misunderstand quite a number of things. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:35, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Keswani is definitive, that what Einstein inaccurately called <i>General Relativity</i> is really only a theory of gravitation, nothing more.<br />
Bjerknes' second book, which he published under the close guidance of Dr. Friedwardt Winterberg, points out that the central equation of General Relativity was published one week before Einstein by David Hilbert. This fact is recognized by Kip Thorne and Stephan Hawking. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.22.98.162 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.22.98.162.html" title="User talk:69.22.98.162">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.98.162_7063.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.98.162">contribs</a>) .</small>

<p>To Fastfission: Keswani and Sir Edmund Whittaker are as mainstream as you can get, and they both agree with Winterberg, and let me remind you that Dr. Winterberg is a professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Nevada who has published hundreds of scientific articles and who received his PhD from <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werner_Heisenberg_ee54.html" title="Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> at world renowned Goettingen University.</p>
<p>Regarding what Einstein called <i>General Relativity</i>, Kip Thorne on page 117 of his popular book <i>Black Holes and Time Warps</i>, writes the following and I quote Kip Thorne: <i>Recognition for the first discovery of the equation must go to David Hilbert</i>. - It was therefore Hilbert who published the equation of <i>General Relativity</i> before Einstein, and this quotation should be inserted into Wikipedia's <i>Einstein Page</i> in the section discussing <i>General Relativity</i>. (Stephan Hawking said the same thing as Kip Thorne in Time Magazine, page 57, December 31, 1999).

<dl>
<dd><i>By 1905 Poincaré's and Einstein's reflections on the electrodynamics of moving bodies led them to postulate the universal validity of the relativity principle, according to which the outcome of any conceivable experiment is independent of the inertial frame of reference in which it is performed.2 In particular, they both assumed that the velocity of light measured in different inertial frames was the same. They further argued that the space and time measured by observers belonging to different inertial systems were related to each other through the Lorentz transformations. They both recognized that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations of electrodynamics were left invariant by these transformations. They both required that every law of physics should be invariant under these transformations. They both gave the relativistic laws of motion. They both recognized that the relativity principle and the energy principle led to paradoxes when conjointly applied to radiation processes.3</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>On several points - namely, the relativity principle, the physical interpretation of Lorentz's transformations (to first order), and the radiation paradoxes - Poincaré's relevant publications antedated Einstein's relativity paper of 1905 by at least five years, and his suggestions were radically new when they first appeared. On the remaining points, publication was nearly simultaneous.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I turn now to basic conceptual differences. Einstein completely eliminated the ether, required that the expression of the laws of physics should be the same in any inertial frame, and introduced a "new kinematics" in which the space and time measured in different inertial systems were all on exactly the same footing. In contrast, Poincaré maintained the ether as a privileged frame of reference in which "true" space and time were defined, while he regarded the space and time measured in other frames as only "apparent." He treated the Lorentz contraction as a hypothesis regarding the effect of the edgewise motion of a rod through the ether, whereas for Einstein it was a kinematic consequence of the difference between the space and time defined by observers in relative motion. Einstein gave the operational meaning of time dilation, whereas Poincaré never discussed it. Einstein derived the expression of the Lorentz transformation from his two postulates (the relativity principle and the constancy of the velocity of light in a given inertial system), whereas Poincaré obtained these transformations as those that leave the Maxwell-Lorentz equations invariant. Whereas Einstein, having eliminated the ether, needed a second postulate, in Poincaré's view the constancy of the velocity of light (in the ether frame) derived from the assumption of a stationary ether. Einstein obtained the dynamics of any rapidly moving particle by the direct use of Lorentz covariance, whereas Poincaré reasoned according to a specific model of the electron built up in conformity with Lorentz covariance. Einstein saw that Poincaré's radiation paradoxes could be solved only by assuming the inertia of energy, whereas Poincaré never returned to this question. Lastly, Poincaré immediately proposed a relativistic modification of Newton's law of gravitation and saw the advantages of a four-vector formalism in this context, whereas Einstein waited a couple of years to address this problem complex.4</i> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a></dd>

<p>Olivier is only pointing out <i>cosmetic</i> differences, no real differences. He is just talking semantics. In addition, regarding any <i>ether</i>, Poincare was actually ambivalent towards any ether, he regarded ether as superfluous, and correctly so. It changes absolutely nothing in the equations. Finally, note that Olivier says Poincare was first, before Einstein. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.22.98.162 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.22.98.162.html" title="User talk:69.22.98.162">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.98.162_7063.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.98.162">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>1. Yes, indeed, that is what Olivier says. This is an argument in your favor, though now with the benefit of reputable reference and citation which cannot be ignored (unlike your previous comments, which were lacking in that department).</dd>
<dd>2. Absolutely none of the above is "cosmetic" or "semantics". Either there is an ether, or there isn't: you claim one, or you claim the other. As it turns out, there isn't any such thing as an "ether"; Einstein helped bring an end to that notion. That's a core, very substantive difference. If you believe this to be "semantics", then it is only semantics in the sense that all substantial issues, including physics, are semantic. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 16:09, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>BTW, 69/Licorne, you may have missed something that you might say was in your favor in Darrigol's quote. "Einstein saw that Poincare's radiation paradoxes could be solved only by assuming the inertia of energy", which might suggest Einstein had read Poincare (1900) - the momentum of radiation paper, and was guided by that to guess that Poincare's "fictitious mass" of radiation had come from the mass of the emiting object, the step that de Kludde claims is really easy. I haven't heard of any proof that Einstein had read Poincare (1900), and don't know if Darrigol means to imply that. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 11:23, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very Good, thank you, for finally adding to the article that Einstein's Gravitational Field Equation was indeed first published by David Hilbert. This equation is what Einstein called <i>General Relativity</i> and yes, it was first published by Hilbert, not Einstein. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.22.98.162 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.22.98.162.html" title="User talk:69.22.98.162">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.98.162_7063.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.98.162">contribs</a>) 05:12, January 8, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Thanks for providing the Kip Thorne source. However his statement needs to be placed in context. According to Thorne, Hilbert published the result five days earlier than Einstein, after "mulling over things he had learned" from a recent visit by Einstein to Gottingen. He goes on to say:
<dl>
<dd>"Quite naturally, and in accord with Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of warpage was quickly given the name the <i>Einstein field equation</i> rather than being named after Hilbert. Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps: the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime, the vision that the law of warpage must obey the reativity principle, and the first 90 percent of that law, the Einstein field equation. In fact without Einstein the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later." (Kip Thorne, <i>Black Holes and Time Warps</i> pp. 117-118)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So Einstein seems deserving of the credit. Perhaps the fact that Hilbert published five days earlier together with the above quote could be placed in a footnote.</dd>

<dd>Einstein submitted wrong field equations on November 4 and 11, 1915. The first set was only invariant under volume-preserving diffeomorphisms while the second was generally covariant, but required the vanishing of the trace of the stress-energy tensor of matter. On November 18, Einstein confirmed the arrival of a postcard (or letter) from Hilbert, probably written on November 16, containing information about Hilbert's work on the field equations. Also on November 18, Einstein submitted his Mercury paper, (wrongly) claiming twice (on p. 831 and p. 834) that the solution is based upon this assumption, while adding (apparently shortly before submission) a footnote stating that this assumption is not really necessary, and that he intended to change the field equations yet another time. This happened on November 25, 1915. See my <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" rel="nofollow">WN wiki survey of the issue</a>.

<dd>Credit is about merit. Temporal priority is important as a means toward determining who merits what, who developed what independently of who. The fact that Hilbert's work was provoked by Einstein seems like a cogent enough reason to give Einstein credit. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 16:23, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hilbert's merit is to have arrived at the correct field equations and also for pointing out that the problem of energy conservation, which was bothering Einstein, has a trivial solution if the field equations are derived from the principle of least action. This became known as the "Noether theorem" later on, and Emmy Noether was of course motivated by Hilbert's work, and acknowledged this in her paper. While it is is possible that Einstein might have arrived at the correct field equations pursuing his earlier line of thought, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that he did so, and there is every reason to believe that his decision to change his November 4/November 11 field equations was motivated by Hilbert's November 16 letter. The fact that Einstein (or Einstein/Grossmann) were the first authors to point out that gravity ought to be described by a pseudo-Riemannian metric doesn not at all change this situation. Theories may have several fathers. For instance, consider electromagnetism. The insight that electricity and magnetism are somehow linked together is totally non-trivial. In a way, the Einstein/Grossmann Entwurf paper can be compared to this insight. It pointed out that gravity should be described by a tensor theory, while people had previously tried to describe it as a scalar theory (like Poincare in his second <b>Sur la Dynamique d'Électron</b> paper). But without the correct field equations, you don't have a useful theory. No one would consider the fact that Maxwell was probably motivated by (inter alia) Faraday and Ørsted as a "cogent reason" to give them credit for the Maxwell equations! Thus, general relativity should be considered to be the work of Einstein AND (probably) Grossmann AND Hilbert. See, for instance, the remarks at the end of <a href="http://physics.unr.edu/faculty/winterberg/Hilbert-Einstein.pdf" class="external text" title="http://physics.unr.edu/faculty/winterberg/Hilbert-Einstein.pdf" rel="nofollow">Winterbergs paper</a> debunking the Corry-Renn-Stachel claims: <b>In summary, one can say that general relativity is the work of three men: 1.

<p>To Referees: It is correctly stated on your <i>Henri Poincare Page</i> that Poincare first published the famous equation E=mc2 in 1900, five years before Einstein. This fact needs to be inserted on your <i>Einstein Page</i> for correctness. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.22.98.162 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.22.98.162.html" title="User talk:69.22.98.162">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.98.162_7063.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.98.162">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>As for the substance of it — if the question is really one of historical dispute, then the dispute itself needs to be mentioned in neutral terms. One does not cherry-pick one POV (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) and use it to stand in as the general truth of the thing. One reason the anon is getting reverted consistently is because he or she is inserting contentious information repeatedly and is otherwise acting like a POV-pusher. I have not pored over this particular question in detail but I don't trust the anon's contributions at all; they have not shown themselves to be anything more than a crank. The misconstruing of Kip Thorne's quote -- which does not simply say that Hilbert had priority, but points to a more complex and nuanced approach -- and "flattening" of it to fit the anon's pre-held POV about it, is simply more evidence of this. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 17:45, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Hilbert claim may not stand up to scrutiny, but the Poincare thrusts seem to have legs -- though I'm not sure if he came up with the E=mc2 principle, unless that's what's meant by "principle of relativity". <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 18:05, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, the principle of relativity is not the same thing as matter/energy equivalence (it refers to the fact that simultaniety is merely a convention. However unlike Einstein I'm fairly sure Poincaré still believed there was an absolute reference even if it was unobtainable. Lorentz surely believed in such a thing. But anyway this can be checked fairly easily), not the same thing at all. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 21:21, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Alright, good to know, thank you. Regarding relativity/absolute: Darrigol points out that Poincare privileged one point of view, the "ether" view, as absolute. But in practical terms, he talked in terms of relativity. Anyway, the merits of Poincare are that he had published "the relativity principle, the physical interpretation of Lorentz's transformations (to first order), and the radiation paradoxes" five years prior to Einstein. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 21:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're quite right that I'm not a physicist. That doesn't mean I can or cannot read sources, citations, or observe when they are lacking. None of these skills are especially unique to physics scholarship (and if they were considered so, I would be worried, since they are quite elementary).</dd>
<dd>One example of where you were lacking in this department is, evidently, your selective ommission from Thorne, as demonstrated by Paul August. Though admittedly it remains to be proven what's going on with your particular "must be given credit" quote, a superficial interpretation of the quote indicates that Thorne thinks Hilbert deserves credit for <i>doing it first</i>, but not overall credit, which involves other factors.</dd>
<dd>Here is another bit of strange scholarship, re: the Time citation of Hawking: <i>"Einstein had discussed his ideas with the mathematician David Hilbert during a visit to the University of Gottingen in the summer of 1915, and Hilbert independently found the same equations a few days before Einstein. Nevertheless, as Hilbert admitted, the credit for the new theory belonged to Einstein. It was his idea to relate gravity to the warping of space-time."</i> What's interesting is that it says the very same thing as the Thorne quote provided by Paul August: that Einstein deserved the credit, because he laid the foundation for what Hilbert did. Quite clear.</dd>
<dd>But as I've indicated, I'm no physicist. Fastfission, on the other hand, is a historian of science. If we go by authority alone, then he has more than you, since credit has more to do with history and less with actual physics.

<li>I think it's reasonable to point out the relative contributions of Poincare and Hilbert, once a review of the literature is completed. Because of Darrigol's comments, I believe there is great substance to the claim that Poincare did a lot of seemingly unrecognized work that predates Einstein. It remains to be seen if he formulated E=mc2, or if anyone really has claimed he did. That'll require a trip to the library. Hilbert's contributions seem minimal given what I've read so far from Thorne and Hawking, but perhaps deserving of some brief mention, as Paul August suggested. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 23:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I've looked up the Whittaker reading. Whittaker does, indeed, state that Poincaré had formulated E=mc<small>2</small> in 1900. The citation is "Archives Néerland. v (1900), p252." This absolutely deserves mention. However, what also deserves mention is that Poincaré <i>never proved it</i>, while Einstein did (at least, for one particular phenomenon). This is mentioned on page 52 of the same source. So Anon's point is a half-truth, but an important half-truth (assuming Whittaker got it right). <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 21:41, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The question in this case has not been whether or not Whittaker (and others) have assigned priority one way or the other over time (it is well known that many people -- usually mathematicians or physicists taking a play as historian -- have made conclusions on all sides of things. Whittaker is apparently one of the rare anti-Einsteinians from the period with no history of anti-Semiticism,<a href="http://physicsweb.org/articles/review/16/4/2" class="external autonumber" title="http://physicsweb.org/articles/review/16/4/2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> good for him!) but 1. whether this priority question is notable enough to worth mentioning and 2. how Wikipedia's article should word it.

<p>To Lucidish: You write that Hilbert's contributions <i>seem minimal</i>&#160;? If you were a physicist you would know better than to say that. Hilbert published the famous gravitational Field Equations of General Relativity before Einstein. - and The Field Equations <i>ARE</i> the theory itself&#160;! Einstein was furious that Hilbert was the first to correctly deduce and publish the Field Equations, because <i>THAT IS</i> the Theory of General Relativity, before Einstein.

<dl>
<dd>I've tracked down your sources, read them, noted what each said. In both cases, the issue is that Hilbert a) used Einstein's ideas, and b) Einstein did the work, anyway (albeit five days later). Unless Hilbert's formulations were in turn read by Einstein, and Einstein used them in the creation of his own formulations, Hilbert's contribution is minimal.

<dd>Yes of course Einstein did read Hilbert's correct derivation of the Field Equations and then Einstein republished them.

In addition, Hilbert in public conference presented the Field Equations five days before Einstein republished them, see Folsing it is all there, search <i>Hilbert</i> in Folsing's index for the pages. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.22.98.162 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.22.98.162.html" title="User talk:69.22.98.162">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.98.162_7063.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.98.162">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>To Lucidish: You need understand some physics here. Keswani (p.276) wrote what any physicist can tell you, that what Einstein inaccurately called the <i>General Theory of Relativity</i> is in fact <i>in no sense</i> a general theory of relativity, it is only a theory of gravity. -This is why Kip Thorne's book on general relativity is entitled simply <i>Gravitation</i>.</p>
<p>To Lucidish: Kip Thorne and Hawking have to say <i>something</i> good about Einstein to get their books distributed, but I am certain that they BOTH know that it was Grossmann who constructed the theory for Einstein. Einstein couldn't do it. It took Hilbert's genious to complete it.</p>

<dd>Grossman is a new name. So is Smoluchowski. I'm not exactly interested in what Google has to say, have you got credible sources on hand for this? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 21:13, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we've come to the end of our reading of Whittaker. He says both a) that Poincare, in "referring to the fact that in free aether the electromagnetic momentum is (1/c^2) times the Poynting flux of energy, suggested that electromagnetic energy might possess mass density equal to (1/c^2) times the energy density&#160;: that is to say, E=mc^2 where E is energy and m is mass", and remarked that this fact would predict that a "Hertz oscillator" would recoil when fired; and b) that "Poincare had suggested this equation [E=mc^2] but had given practically no proof, while Einstein, who had also suggested it, had given a proof ... for a particular case". In the former, you have a very good point. In the latter, at least in Whittaker's estimation, you do not.</dd>
<dd>Alright, most of the rest of these comments are novel allegations with novel sources that need to be looked into. What is the exact title of Folsing's work? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 23:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ask at any bookstore for Folsing's biography on Einstein, it is usually right on the shelf, it is considered the definitive biography of reference. Also, search on the net for <i>The Einstein Myth Ives</i>, to see Ives' publication regarding Einstein's 1905 derivation of E=mc2 which was an incorrect derivation, that nevertheless yielded the correct E=mc2, proving that Einstein was trying to derive what he knew was the correct answer, namely Poincare's E=mc2. -Einstein's 1905 paper derived therefore nothing. See Ives. The book <i>The Einstein Myth</i> reproduces Ives' published paper, and this book is in most major university librairies in the Physics section.</p>

<p>Current version (1/27/06) says that Henri Poincare published the E=mc^2 equation first. As I understand it, this is inaccurate. I believe that Poincare developed results (the Lorentz transformation) which IMPLIED that E=mc^2 but that Poincare did not actually explore this aspect of his own work. I do not think the mass/energy conversion equation had been published in that form prior to Einstein, even if it was 'latent' within Poincare's own work.

<dd>I am no expert in this area, but I can independently verify that this bit of information has been claimed (if not established) in the work cited and discussed above by Sir Edmund Whittaker. Moreover, I have run this particular text by historian/philosopher of science Howard Plotkin, who has indicated that Whittaker's claim seems to have some autheticity to it (though his area of concentration appears to be in astrophysics-related things). I will continue to investigate by presenting other authorities with the Whittaker text.</dd>
<dd>Fastfission is (so far as I can tell) the only one with an interest in this page who is an expert in the field of the history of science, but I believe he is occupied with other duties at the moment.

<p>I did some research with one of the best tools available (wikipedia, that is) and discovered a huge quantity of useful information at <a href="../../../h/e/n/Talk%7EHenri_Poincar%C3%A9_6003.html" title="Talk:Henri Poincaré">Talk:Henri_Poincaré</a>. This issue has been debated extensively there, and it seems to me that crediting Poincare with the basic proportionality that underlies the equation is correct, altho he did not have the contextual understanding that Einstein created. I think the current one sentence statement in the article should be expanded. The whole topic of priority for the E = mc^2 equation is actually worth a whole article of its own, it's a fascinating case study in how complex these issues become when examined in detail. I'd like to see text along the lines of the following in the main:</p>
<p>"Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2 is a consequence of the Lorentz transformations that structure Minkowskian space-time. Henri Poincare anticipated this result in a prescient 1900 paper, but did not have Einstein's unifying perspective to give this proportionality context and significance."<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Kidwell_b545.html" title="User:Ben Kidwell">Ben Kidwell</a> 04:45, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That sentence seems a little too dismissive of Poincare. Try: "In 1900 Poincare had shown, as a consequence of Maxwell's radiation pressure, and Lorentz's theory of electrons, that radiation, when emiited or absorbed, could be considered as a fictitious fluid with an equivalent mass of m = E/c^2. Einstein (1905), working from the variation of mass with velocity, suggested that when a body lost or gained energy of the amount E its mass decreased or increased by the amount E/c^2". This 1905 paper is the last? published in 1905, not the elctro-dynamics one. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 21:35, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is certainly true that Einstein's work built substantially on those who had gone before, and that Poincare and Hilbert both made significant advances in what might be called Relativity. Who exactly 'discovered' it is one of those questions that depends on exactly what you mean by Relativity.

<dd>1. Whittaker talks about "The relativity theory of Poincare and Lorentz" as a chapter heading, sure -- but this is not substance, it is superficial. Actual substance would involve justification, facts. And Whittaker's testimony is, in fact, the opposite of what you attribute to him wrt Poincare. Poincare did NOT fully formulate E=mc2, only arrived at that conclusion with the help of "practically no proof" (which we discussed above). It was Einstein who proved it.

<p>FACT: Hilbert's publication of the Field Equation on Nov 20, 1915 which completed GR is indeed the final discovery of GR, before Einstein(Source: SEE Folsing). -- Also in Folsing: Hilbert sent Einstein a copy of the Field Equation, only then did Einstein later publish it, after Hilbert published it.

<dl>
<dd>According to Thorne pp. 117–118, after "mulling over things he had learned" from a recent visit by Einstein to Gottingen, Hilbert published the correct derivation of the field equation five days before Einstein, going on to say: "Quite naturally, and in accord with Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of warpage was quickly given the name the <i>Einstein field equation</i> rather than being named after Hilbert. Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps: the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime, the vision that the law of warpage must obey the reativity principle, and the first 90 percent of that law, the Einstein field equation.

<dd>Now Corry, from looking at new evidence (some original galley's) calls into question the whether Hilbert actually published the result five days earlier. But even if he did publish first (and that begs the question who actually proved the equations first), by five days, the standard view, as given by Thorne and shared by Hilber, is that Einstein deserves the Lion's share of the credit.</dd>

<dd>I guess you didn't notice, but you have been told above, that even Winterberg gives the credit for GR to Einstein-Grossman-Hilbert (not just Hilbert).

<p>Wikipedia is NOT mob rule, it is rule by SOURCES.

<p>This is completely ridicules; so far I have seen maybe four sites and one book claiming Einstein did not come up with these theories- that's five sources! I can show you at least 100 encyclopedias all claiming the opposite. I'm sorry but you simply can't discredit one of the world's most famous scientists with just that. I suggest we stick the mainstream opinion of how events took place. At the moment this artical is very well written, so stop editing it. If you want, add a note at the end and a link to one of your sources. <a href="../../../g/y/z/User%7EGyzmr_37d9.html" title="User:Gyzmr">Gyzmr</a> 20:35, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is NO BETTER SOURCE than Kip Thorne. and it is a published fact that Poincare derived and published E=mc2 in 1900, five years before Einstein.. 69.22.98.146 20:44, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Lucidish had agreed that GR is <i>only a theory of gravity</i> -- Lucidish approved this -- so do not knock it out. 69.22.98.146 21:00, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, say it is true- this kind of information doesn't belong in the first paragraph- the one that should sum the life of Einstein; I think this note in the body of the article is more than enough: "A few historians of science believe that Einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous Frenchman Henri Poincare had already published the equations of Relativity, a few months before Einstein; most believe their work independent, especially given Einstein's isolation at this time."</p>
<p>OK, but Hilbert should be mentioned in the body as well. 69.22.98.146 21:26, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Second, please stop editing the article until we have reached an agreement! Give the poll a week, and we'll see the general feeling is regarding this subject.</p>
<p>OK, I'll wait some, but the INTRO is simply factually WRONG and must be completely re-written, to conform with facts and with the body of the article. The INTRO makes it sound like he discovered E=mc2 and the Field Equation, which he did not. 69.22.98.146 21:21, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And your edition makes it sound as if Einstein stole it! Here is the passage from Hilbert's article regarding the subject: "Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps: the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime, the vision that the law of warpage must obey the reativity principle, and the first 90 percent of that law, the Einstein field equation. In fact without Einstein the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later." There was a reason Einstein received credit for this work and he deserved every bit of it- the scientific community agrees on that, and as you can see from the poll, so do we. Now if you want, add a small note at the end about Hilbert having published the last bit five days before him- but that's it. <a href="../../../g/y/z/User%7EGyzmr_37d9.html" title="User:Gyzmr">Gyzmr</a> 22:30, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What Kip Thorne will not tell you is that Marcel Grossmann did 90% of the work for Einstein. So why aren't you hypocrits crying for poor Grossmann&#160;?? -- The fact is, neither Grossmann nor Einstein could figure it out. -- That is why Einstein went begging to Hilbert to figure it all out for him. -- Hilbert worked on the problem four or five months and put it all together in the correct Field Equation which Hilbert then published, and ALL SCIENTISTS KNOW that who publishes first gets the credit. The theory of gravity (GR) belongs to Hilbert, So stop your cry baby and correct the INTRO it must be re-written. 17.255.240.78 00:26, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Know what? Noone-nowhere around the world thinks like you. I've read the links from both articles, and none of them mentions the things you say. Why do you think this theory was named after Einstein in the first place? Because everyone likes him? The scientific community was facing the same facts you have- and they've decided Einstein deserves the credit. We all agree with them. I doubt Even Hilbert himself argued. It's you and you alone who wants to change history, and you're just mad because no one here lets you do it. Now either add a note at the end about Himler having published the last step of the theory five days before Einstein, or pray for a majority. <a href="../../../g/y/z/User%7EGyzmr_37d9.html" title="User:Gyzmr">Gyzmr</a> 08:03, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi. I am newly arrived and definitely NOT an Einstein basher. However, I find plausibility in the thesis that to some extent Einstein succumbed to plagiarism. E.g., his 1905 paper, On the Electrodynamics of a Moving Body, contains no references whatever -- odd in itself -- and there is pretty firm documentation that he was aware of Poincare's seminal work on the Principle of Relativity and clock synchronization. Both concepts are featured prominently in his 1905 paper but there is not acknowledgement of Poincare. green 65.88.65.217 19:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I like the 90% of the work done by Einstein/Hilbert made the last step thing above, so Einstein has to get majority of credit. It is similar to what I think about Lorentz and special relativity. Some large % of the work was done by Lorentz and Poincare/Einstein independently took the last step. However, I notice the argument is always about Poincare/Einstein, never Lorentz, which seems a bit strange to me. At least Lorentz has his name on the transformations. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 21:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You cannot claim that Einstein has done 90% of the work. He came up with the correct framework in which to describe gravity, but then failed to find the correct field equations for several years, until Hilbert solved that problem. See my remarks above, or the <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Albert_Einstein" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Albert_Einstein" rel="nofollow">WN Wiki</a> article on the subject.

<p>Indeed the world is cruel. Marcel Grossmann did 90% of the work for Einstein, and is never mentioned. -- In science he who publishes first gets the credit. -- David Hilbert first published the correct Field Equation, so GR belongs to Hilbert, even though Grossmann, and not Einstein, did 90% of the work. -- Hilbert in 1924 stated that GR is <i>MEINER THEORIE</i>-- So the INTRO must be re-written for correctness. 69.22.98.146 22:43, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Mr. 69: What you state above flat-out <b>contradicts</b> what you wrote today on Poincare Talkpage, namely,</p>
<p>"To anyone who may be overly sensitive, I want it clear that I am in no way implying in the article that GR belongs to Hilbert instead of Einstein -- I am simply writing down in chronological correctness for the article. 69.22.98.146 23:19, 5 February 2006 (UTC)"</p>

<p>Further, what your wrote today on this page is a serious distortion of history. Hilbert was put on the path to the field equations by Einstein's profound physical intuition that matter-energy warps spacetime. Moreover, Einstein had been working the problem for many years before contacting Hilbert. These points have been made here and on the Poincare Talkpage. It's a no-brainer; namely, that even if Einstein was unable to derive the equations himself -- and I am not sure this was the case -- the credit for GR must go primarily to Einstein, with some recognition of course and deep gratitude to Hilbert. green 65.88.65.217 01:14, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is no one insisting that Grossmann be recognized, instead of Einstein&#160;? -- Grossmann did 90% of the work, not Einstein. Neither Grossmann nor Einstein could finish the theory. Einstein went begging to Hilbert, to finish it, which Hilbert did. Hilbert called the theory <i>MEINER THEORIE</i>, and the published record fully justifies his doing so. 69.22.98.146 03:37, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How do you know Einstein went "begging"? Were you there? Btw, if Hilbert thought it was <i>his</i> theory, why did he name the field equations, "Einstein's"? I read that somewhere on these Talkpages and it seemed authoritative. I forget the source. green 65.88.65.217 03:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is what Einstein wrote to Hilbert on November 15, 1915: <i>Your analysis interests me tremendously *** If possible, please send me a correction proof of your study to mitigate my impatience.</i> (Volume 8 of the Princeton edition of Einstein's collected papers, document 144). Whether one should call this "begging" is open to dispute, but he clearly asked Hilbert for a copy of Hilbert's paper, and confirmed on November 18 that he received the information he wanted, while Einstein's November 25 field equations paper does not mention Hilbert at all. A clear cut case of plagiarism, no matter what you believe about the details of Hilbert's November 16 letter/postcard.User:De kludde, Feb 6, 2006</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The way I see it is that Einstein and Hilbert collaborated when the former got bogged down in highly esoteric mathematics. No "begging" afaict or guess; rather, an extremely reasonable division of labor. However, as I recently posted, the case for plagiarism is hardly vacuous. Einstein could still have legimately called GR <i>his</i> theory while crediting Hilbert's key contribution. Or they could have negotiated an "Einstein-Hilbert GTR". green 65.88.65.217 04:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They did not really collaborate. Einstein had published several versions of his theory along the lines of the Entwurf paper, and Hilbert started work of his own along the same line, quoting Einstein as the author of the idea to describe graivity by Riemannian geometry. This is a perfectly normal thing to do. For instance, the guys who came up with the electroweak interaction started work on their own, rather than contacting Yang and Mills about possibly writing a joint paper. They should have settled on "Einstein-Hilbert GTR" or "Einstein-Hilbert-Grossmann GTR", depending on what you believe about Grossmann's role. The Entwurf paper was divided in a physics section, written by Einstein, and a mathematics section, written by Grossmann. It is the physics section which contains what was to become the decisive new contribution of this paper, the use of the metric tensor to describe gravity. But Grossmann's role in the invetion is difficult to assess. I dont know how this division of the Entwurf paper came about, nor what is known about the subject. Grossmann may have objected to Einstein's looking for non-covariant field equations, for instance. Given the way Einstein treated Hilbert and Poincare, I am not inclined to believe anything Einsein may have written about the subject, unless it is confirmed by someone else.

<dd>You continue avoiding the question! How do you <b>know</b> he went "begging"? Istm, he did the smart thing. He needed help from perhaps the greatest living mathematician of his time, and if Einstein didn't have something reeeeely substantial, do you think Hilbert would have wasted his (Hilbert's) time?
<dl>
<dd>Hilbert did not waste much time. Wuensch, in the book [Wue05] I am quoting <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper#Wuensch.27s_attempted_reconstruction_of_Hilbert.27s_November_16_letter" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper#Wuensch.27s_attempted_reconstruction_of_Hilbert.27s_November_16_letter" rel="nofollow">here</a>, thinks he sent Einstein a postcard or two, containing the functional to which Hilbert applied the principle of least action, the least action principle itself, and the explicit field equations. She bases her speculation upon Hilbert's personal notes, which have a remark "3 Eq(uations) on a postcard, underlined in blue" on a sheet of paper devoted to the subject. Writing down these three equations would have taken a few minutes at most. But this information would have been sufficient for Einstein to come up with a slightly modified form of the field equations in his November 25 paper. User:De kludde, Feb6, 2006</dd>

<dd>Again you avoid my question. Why did Hilbert originally call it "Einstein's" field equation? Was it not because he understood Einstein's crucial <b>conceptual</b> role. Is this so hard to understand? green 65.88.65.217 04:34, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware that Hilbert ever called his field equations "Einstein field equations". Could you give a source for this claim? Hilbert did mention Einstein as the inventor of the correct framework to describe gravity (ie, as a pseudo-Riemannian metric). He did this in the printer proofs of his field equations paper, as well as in all published versions tereof. But I am not aware of a single line where he attributes the field equations to Einstein. And Hilbert <b>did</b> claim priority for the field equations, see my <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" rel="nofollow">WN wiki</a> article on the subject.

<dd>Thanks. I'll check out your link. I recall reading that claim within the last few days, either here or on Poincare Talkpage I think, but it would be hard to locate. It could be an error. Did Hilbert ever refer to GR as "MEINER THEORIE" as 69 alleges? green 65.88.65.217
<dl>
<dd>Yes, absolutely. His field equations paper was reprinted in the Mathematische Annalen in 1924. He writes: <i>Einstein *** kehrt schließlich in seinen letzten Publikationen geradewegs zu</i> <b>meiner</b> <i>Theorie zurück</i> (<i>Einstein *** in his most recent publications, returns directly to</i> <b>my theory</b>, highlighting made by myself). And in his November 13 letter to Einstein he refers to his paper as <i>meine axiomatische Lösung Ihres großen Problemes</i> (<i>my axiomatic solution to your big problem.</i>) I am quoting Wuensch's book, 81-83, instead of the original sources.

<dd>De Kludde, your paper system seems to have suffered a LaTex crash - the equations are replaced with error messages. However, more interesting to me is your quote:
<dl>
<dd>The version of his paper printed in 1916 contains the sentence "Die so zu Stande kommenden Differentialgleichungen der Gravitation sind, wie mir scheint, mit der von Einstein in seinen späteren Abhandlungen aufgestellten großzügigen Theorie der allgemeinen Relativität in gutem Einklang." "The differential equations of gravity obtained in this way appear to me to be in good accordance with the magnificant theory of general relativity established by Einstein in his later publications", where later (später, highlighted by the author) appears to refer to the fact that Hilbert had submitted the first version of his paper earlier.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This seems to say that Hilbert claimed that his formulas WERE NOT general relativity. Just that they WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH general relativity - a completely different claim. do you have a reference for this version of the Hilbert paper, or are they quoted in the sources you cite there? --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 05:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The TeX problem seems to be caused by the fact that the people who run WN wiki have not installed all the math programs (latex,gs) yet. I will complain to them again. But it works perfectly well for the wiki I run from my hard drive (which is unaccessible to the outside world). It would probably work here as well, but may face quick deletion if I try to post it here. Concerning your other claim, my point of view is that Hilbert, while he held Einstein's achievements as a physicist in high esteem, always insisted upon his priority for the field equations, and that <i>later</i> (<i>später</i>) is his polite way of expressing that Einstein's paper depended on his. See my response to "green 65.88.65.217" above. User:De kludde, Feb6, 2006

<dd>De Kludde, if you create a page called "Hilbert, Einstein and the General Theory of Relativity", I doubt very much that it will be deleted. I even think it's likely that a link in "see also" of the Einstein article will stay there. As far as I can tell, it's only the modifications to the Einstein article intro that get rapidly reverted.</dd>
<dd>My personal conclusion at the moment is that Hilbert seems to have considered the field equations to be *part* of General Relativity, and give Einstein credit for the whole, while he wanted some credit for the part. That doesn't seem like a very controversial issue... --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 07:03, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Saying that the field equations are "part" of the theory downplays their importance way of too much. This is a correct description of the situation only if it is understood that removal of that "part" causes the collapse of the entire edifice. Without the equations, the theory does not make any prediction which you can test experimentally. One could say that Einstein only pointed out the direction in which one should look for a theory and that Hilbert filled this program with life. If this was a mere "part" of the theory, then why did Einstein write paper after paper in his vain attempt to get the correct field equations? Also, look at the plagiarism issue which is involved: Einstein published two papers containing wrong field equations on November 4 and 11, the main text of this November 18 Mercury paper still states that Einstein believed in this theory, while a footnote apparently added shortly before submitting the paper announces that Einstein was going to modify his equations. It is reasonable to assume that Einstein received Hilbert's postcard on November 17, and his November 18 letter confirms its arrival, and the fact that Einstein had read it and compared it to his own theory. So the picture is that Einstein changed his mind on the theory he had developed in early November in the first 24 hours after he received Hilbert's postcard. A clear cut case of plagiarism, in my opinion. Why should Einstein have done such a thing if Hilbert's paper was of minor importance? De kludde 06:46, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hilbert preferred to correctly call it <i>The Theory of Gravity</i>, and he also called it <i>MEINER THEORIE</i> in 1924, and the published record fully backs up his statement. -- GR belongs to Hilbert not Einstein. 69.22.98.146 06:02, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To De kludde, et al: Here's a reputable link from your site, an article written in 2004 by authors at the Max-Planck Institute for the History of Science, that claims Einstein had the field equations as early as 1913 but didn't believe they were correct and hence didn't publish them at that time. The article is 86 pages in length and appears extremely well researched by individuals who know GR well. If the argument is valid, to some non-trivial extent it attenuates allegations of Einstein's plagiarism and mathematical deficiencies.</p>

<dd>I have addressed this issue in <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper#Did_Einstein_develop_the_field_equations_independently.3F" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper#Did_Einstein_develop_the_field_equations_independently.3F" rel="nofollow">section 7 of my WN wiki article on the CRS paper</a> you are referring to. Their claim that Einstein found his way back to the correct field equations he had given up in 1913 is misleading. The 1996 Renn-Stachel paper only claims this to be true on the level of the linearized field equations ("auf der Ebene der linearisierten Feldgleichungen"). The preprint you are quoting does not really modify this assertion, although they state more in the title and in the introduction. The only chapter in it which deals with the notebook in detail is chapter 2 on p. 14, and as far as I can see they cannot pinpoint a line in the notebook where Einstein has the correct field equations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Understanding the notebook is not easy, but it is easy (assuming a modicum of familiarity with the math being used) to form an educated guess about such claims, using Einstein's November 11 paper. On p. 800 he writes:
<dl>
<dd>Dieser Tensor <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><sub><i>i</i><i>m</i></sub></span> ist der einzige Tensor, der für die Aufstellung allgemein kovarianter Gravitionsgleichungen zur Verfügung steht.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I am now translating into English, using the modern <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>i</i><i>m</i></sub></span> instead of <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><sub><i>i</i><i>m</i></sub></span> (in case you try to read the origninal paper, be warned that Einstein denotes something else by <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>i</i><i>m</i></sub></span>):
<dl>
<dd>This Tensor <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>i</i><i>m</i></sub></span> is the only one which can be used to formulate covariant equations of gravity.</dd>
<dd>If we postulate that the field equations of gravity should be
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub>μν</sub> = − κ<i>T</i><sub>μν</sub>,</span></dd>

<dd>then we have obtained generally covariant field equations.</dd>

<dd>(where the scalar <i>T</i> is obtained the same way as <i>R</i>), and then present his case for <span class="texhtml">λ = 0</span> (resulting in Einstein's wrong field equations of November 11)? Jannsen/Renn discuss this November 11 paper on pp. 48-50 without answering (or even posing) this very natural question.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This way of making bombastic and misleading claims seems to be typical of the Renn/Stachel crowd. They make a bombastic claim about the correct field equations beeing found and abandoned in 1912/13, and when you look closer it only applies to the linearized form or something else close to but not identical with the correct field equations. Maybe Einstein could have arrived at the correct form easily, but the simple truth appears to be that he didn't. Another example for their way of making misleading claims is the claim, made in their <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" rel="nofollow">paper with Corry</a>, that Hilbert was allegedly motivated by Einstein's November 25 paper to introduce the trace term (this notion refferring to terms like <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><i>g</i><sub>μν</sub></span> or <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><i>g</i><sub>μν</sub></span>) into his equations. The simple fact is that they have <b>absolutely no proof whatsoever</b> that Hilbert ever wrote down field equations of gravity which have to be corrected by introducing such terms. The extant part of Hilbert's printer proofs no longer contains the field equations in explicit form, but only the correct principle of least action. Most likely this is so because part of the proofs has been cut off, a fact which CRS failed to tell their readers. But even if the missing part of the proofs did not contain the field equations in explicit form, this simply means that Hilbert did not bother to derive this form (which is somewhat unlikely since he wanted to discuss things with Einstein and since he gave a lecture about his work on November 16, of which Einstein btw obtained notes from a third person). There is absolutely no indication whatsoever that Hilbert ever miscalculated the derivative of his action functional.De kludde 06:46, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what Bjerknes' formal qualifications are, or if he is a kinsman of [Vilhelm Bjerknes]. I have both his books and think they are an indispensible item on your bookshelf if you are interested in this matter. It was Bjerknes' second book from which I learned the significance of some remarks in the Mercury paper for the priority dispute over the field equations. However, I am not always happy with his way of presenting things. Part of these problems may be caused by the fact that Bjerknes writes for a popular publisher. <a href="http://termessos.de/LinksEinsteinHilbertdispute.htm" class="external text" title="http://termessos.de/LinksEinsteinHilbertdispute.htm" rel="nofollow">Sommer, Wuensch</a> and Winterberg (who wrote about the field equations issue) all have academic titles in one of the relevant fields. The same holds for Logunov, who is coauther of a refutation of the CRS article and author of a <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0408/0408077.pdf" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0408/0408077.pdf" rel="nofollow">useful book</a> on Poincaré and special relativity, giving an english translation, using modern notations, of Poincaré's E=mc<sup>2</sup> on p. 113. Logunov points out, among other important facts, that Einstein reviewed papers for the Beihefte der physikalischen Annalen in 1905, and that these Beihefte had published a review of the Lorentz transformation paper. This discredits the often made claims that Einstein was working in isolations and did not know about the Lorentz transformation when he wrote the 1905 paper. Bjerknes has interesting ideas and his books are useful if you have some familiarity with the subject, but he often formulates things in a misleading way. It is the Logunov, Sommer, Wuensch and Winterberg works to which I would turn for reliable information. But they all quote Bjerknes, probably because Bjerknes contributed several useful ideas to this debate.</dd>

<dd>It is not known when the cut to Hilbert's printer proofs was made. Wuensch (who is a historian of physics as well as a Hilbert and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Kaluza_fb17.html" title="Theodor Kaluza">Kaluza</a> expert) presents her case for the theory that it was made in modern time, while authors closer to the Renn/Stachel crowd naturally disagree. She thinks it was done by someone without a scholarly reputation to loose (perhaps acting on behalf of others with such a reputation), not by "Corry with his little razor blade". The cut must have been present when CRS wrote their paper, because they would have pointed out the opposite otherwise. The presence of the cut is mentioned by CRS themselves in a later article (but not in the <i>Science</i> article which attracted so much attention) and by Sauer and Winterberg. Bjerknes was informed about the cut by Winterberg.</dd>

<dd>One thing I am not clear about. Did Hilbert's first paper contain the <b>same</b> equations now known as Einstein's field equations, or is there some ambiguity here as well? Was his paper submitted <b>and</b> published first? green 65.88.65.217 19:52, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have explained all this in the <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper" rel="nofollow">WN Wiki article</a> on the CRS paper. Hilbert derived his field equations from the principle of least action. There is no doubt at all that he had the correct action functional in early November 1915. To derive the field equations from this, you have to calculate the derivative of this action functional. As Hilbert rewrote his article and the printer proofs of the original article have been mutilated, we no longer have direct proof that the article contained the field equations in explicit form.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Indirect evidence is, however, overwhelming. Einstein never accused Hilbert of having introduced essential new material not described in his November 16 postcard. Several people have heard his November 16 lecture or received notes from it. Not one of them claimed that Hilbert's theory was lacking an explicit version of the field equations. Calculating the derivative is not that hard (I think Lorentz gave his own calculation when he wrote about the field equations), and it is likely that Hilbert has done it because he gave a talk about his theory and because he wanted to exchange ideas with Einstein.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In Hilbert's published paper, the field equations take the form <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub> − (<i>R</i> / 2)<i>g</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub> = − κ<i>T</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub></span>, from which one obtains <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i> = κ<i>T</i></span> by taking traces. The trace term <span class="texhtml">(<i>R</i> / 2)<i>g</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub></span> can now be identified with <span class="texhtml">(κ / 2)<i>T</i><i>g</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub></span> and brought to the other side. The result is
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub> = − κ(<i>T</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub> − (<i>T</i> / 2)<i>g</i><sub><i>i</i><i>j</i></sub>),</span></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>which is the form in which Einstein formulated the field equations in his November 25 paper. This purely algebraic manipulation was not hard for Einstein to carry out. But Hilbert's paper was only printed in 1916. It is the November 16 postcard, and the fact that Einstein had been given notes of Hilbert's November 16 Goettingen lecture by a third person (which was recently pointed out by Wuensch) upon which accusations of plagiarism against Einstein may be based.De kludde 07:54, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Worst case scenario; Einstein flat-out stole Hilbert's equations. But is it still not the case that it was <b>Einstein</b> who had the crucial physical insight to model gravity as a distortion of spacetime? Clearly, it was a bitch working out the details -- in this case the field equations -- but without the physical insight there would have been no details to work out!

<p>Einstein was presenting versions of the Field Equations during that period, and they were all missing key terms. 69.22.98.146 20:38, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Leo Corry went to Goettingen University with his little razor blade and started slicing up the archives to make it look like Hilbert did not have the Field Equations, but Corry did not cut enough -- Hilbert clearly did have the Field Equations, and as the published record clearly shows, GR belongs to Hilbert not Einstein, and the INTRO must be re-written. 69.22.98.146 12:38, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is another big problem that still no one is addressing, the paper by H.E.Ives (1952) which proves that Einstein's derivation of E=mc2 was a tautology which proved nothing, no E=mc2 in 1905 by Einstein. Einstein was TRYING to derive the E=mc2 that <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Poincare_6e94.html" title="Henri Poincare">Henri Poincare</a> had published five years earlier, but Einstein couldn't do it in 1905. -- The INTRO must be re-written. 69.22.98.146 21:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because I think you're wrong. Poincare never (AFAIK) abandoned the concept of the "unique frame of reference" aka "ether", and Hilbert never (AFAIK) claimed to have invented the concept of "curved spacetime" to describe what he had helped to describe mathematically. Indeed, my impression is that both were extremely impressed with Einstein. Since we have a dispute, the Right Thing is to document it, not to make the Einstein article into a POV for the not-generally-accepted viewpoint. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 14:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"In conclusion, we should all acknowledge the importance of recognizing and recording the facts of the history of the theory of relativity and the history of the "insane publicity" which has promoted and which continues to promote Einstein, virtually to the exclusion of his predecessors. We face a moral imperative to give Einstein's predecessors justice, if only posthumously, and we must acknowledge their legacy. We have an obligation to the science of history to accurately record the past. It was for this purpose of accurately recording the history that I wrote my book. I am quite proud of my Jewish heritage, and if John Stachel wants to change the subject to anti-Semitism, I will join him in condemning it in all its forms, and go about the work of a historian recording the facts surrounding Einstein's career of plagiarism, even if it means enduring Dr. Stachel's petty insults. I do not think that alarmist slogans and attempts to render the subject taboo have any place in a scholarly exploration of the facts." green 65.88.65.217 03:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One other thing; does Poincare's clock synching method consist of using a light source placed equidistant from two stationary clocks? If so, it seems to deny the existence of an ether since such a method implies that the speed of light is the same in both directions regardless of whether the frame is at rest wrt the ether or not. I am confused on this point and would appreciate clarification from any knowledgeable individual. If Einstein adopted this method, he also implicitly denied the ether, as distinguished from just making the ether hypothesis "superfluous". green 65.88.65.217 19:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Add on: If I have correctly stated Poincare's clock synching method (I am not sure of that), and if this is the method used by Einstein in his 1905 paper, then I would have to agree with Anon69 that Poincare <b>denied</b> the existence of a preferred frame (the ether) and that notwithstanding what many commentators claim, so did Einstein. green 65.88.65.217 19:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, it is not the old version of their response. In the old version, they admit that:
<dl>
<dd>the Editors of <i>Science</i> submitted his paper to us for comment, and that we prepared a substantial set of comments that he received. It was on the basis of these comments that his paper was rejected. We quote from the letter of Stewart Wills, Online Editor, <i>Science</i>, dated 9 January 2003.
<dl>
<dd>We have now received a response from the authors of the original paper, which is enclosed for your information. On evaluation of the comment and response, we regret to say that your comment received a lower priority rating than other technical comments under consideration. As a result, we won't be able to publish it. We believe that, at this point- particularly in view of the age of the original article- this discussion is best pursued through new papers and contributions in the specialty history-of-science literature than in the Technical Comments section of <i>Science</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If I interpret this correctly it means that <i>Science</i> has dealt with an accusation of bad scholarship by having it refereed by the <b>authors of the paper it criticized</b>, and then based its <b>rejection upon their opinion alone.</b> A highly unusual way to proceed, unless you have a strong political pressure group trying to defend an otherwise untenable theory against criticism.De kludde 21:10, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is perfectly normal to send a paper criticising a particular paper to the authors of the first paper for comment. Quite often the second (perhaps revised) paper is then published and the authors of the original paper write a rebuttal to appear immediately after. If so both the second paper and rebuttal are sent to referees. Clearly in this case the issue was going to consume a lot of space on an issue of the history of science, in a Journal concerned with science, rather than its history. The editors of Science say that a history of science journal is much better equipped to evaluate this controversy, and they clearly right. It seems a big step to assume "a strong political pressure group" influenced them to do what is perfectly normal. I don't think the paper Science rejected has appeared in a history of science journal, has it? What does that tell us? That Winterberg was discouraged by one rejection and never submitted it elsewhere? <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 21:42, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Winterberg in fact got a revised version of the paper published in a German English-language journal - "Zeitschrift für Naturforschung".

<dd>Thanks to Anon for pointing out that Winterberg's paper was eventually published in a peer-reviewed Journal (as was Logunov/Mestvirishvili/Petrov. I don't think that the way 'Science' dealt with the accusations against CRS was appropriate for a journal devoted to the impartial investigation of facts. Not to mention the fact that a quarter of a page of their source was missing can be construed as bad scholarship, and accusations of this type usually go to an independent referee, not the accused party alone. I am familiar with the procedure as I have seen it in action when someone lost his PhD after his thesis turned out to be based on fraudulent evidence. If 'Science' thinks that a journal devoted to the study of the history of sciences is better equipped to evaluate the controversy, they should not have published the CRS paper claiming to bring a decision of that controversy. CRS basically made an accusation of plagiarism against Hilbert, even though they didn't call it that way, just as the attackers of Einstein don't normally use the p-word. After 'Science' had published such a paper, fairness towards Hilbert would have commanded that they investigate accusations of fraud made against the authors of such accusations. At the very least, they should have published a note pointing out that CRS had failed to mention that part of the proofs was missing, and that a debate about the significance of this fact was going on in journals devoted to the history of physics.De kludde 19:58, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for my suspicion that there is a strong political pressure group behind their efforts to discredit Hilbert, this is what anyone with a modicum of common sense would suspect, given they way this debate proceeds. Moreover, CRS and their sycophants are also making such claims, at least indirectly. They did this in the initial version of their response to Winterberg, and they did it again when they published a polemical article, written by Renn against Wuensch in a daily newspaper in November 2005. On the same pair of pages was an article, written by Wazeck about the Nazi opposition to Einstein on the same pair of pages. Naturally, Renn's allegations about the proponents of Hilbert were rather unspecific and stopped short of being justiciable insults. But at least for me, mentioning antisemitism in the Weimar time and then, in the next paragraph, continuing that one has to keep that in mind ("Dies muß man sich klarmachen") when taking a closer look at the current Einstein-Hilbert debate, is not that far away from accusing Wuensch and Winterberg of Nazi sympathies (see the <a href="http://termessos.de/erwiderungrenn.htm" class="external text" title="http://termessos.de/erwiderungrenn.htm" rel="nofollow">response of the Hilbert proponents</a> containing links to the Renn and Wazeck articles.De kludde 19:58, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ives' 1952 article seems to have appeared in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, for instance - and Bjerknes' response to Stachel's criticism appeared in the magazine "Infinite Energy".

<dd>I suggest you leave the Intro basically as is for the time being, but add a section which lists some of the outstanding disputes that have recently arisen -- such as whether Einstein used Poincare's results without proper citation and the plausibility that he was aware of them; and e.g. whether Ives presents a good argument that E's derivation of the famous equation is wrong. This requires some analysis of Ives' 1952 paper. I also suggest you do this with other editors, and ignore the offensive individual. His view is distorted by an obsessive Einstein hate agenda, like Bjernkes as I am coming to believe, and nothing can be gained by engaging him in discussions. green 65.88.65.217 05:36, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

But it was Einstein, working with Grossman, who had the crucial physical insight to model gravity as a distortion of spacetime using tensor fields. Clearly, it was exceeding difficult to work out the details -- in this case the field equations -- but without the physical insight and the tensor modeling there would have been no details to work out. This is the ultimate reality of the situation. Einstein was open about his progress and problems. He gave several lectures at Goettingen in 1915 about GR which Hilbert attended. Without Einstein, Hilbert would not have known about the theory, its progress and problems. Without Einstein there would be no GR. green 65.88.65.217 16:29, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To De kludde: I didn't mean to give the impression that the discovery of the field equations was a mere detail. Hardly. <b>If</b> Einstein used Hilbert's solutions, he should have given Hilbert credit. But since there was so much work that anteceded their discovery, I think name-sharing would have been appropriate in this case -- to wit, the Einstein-Hilbert field equations. If you take Einstein's irate comment at face value -- what he was sharing with a friend, not intended for posterity -- apparently he (Einstein) believed he had derived the equations on his own and that Hilbert was trying to get credit for the entire theory. It is therefore conceivable that both derived the equations independently. Otherwise, why would Einstein have been so irate? green 65.88.65.217 03:36, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that name-sharing would have been appropriate. But Einstein's irate reaction can easily be explained by assuming that he did not want to share his fame with Hilbert. While it cannot be ruled out Einstein developed the field equations independently, a look at the November 18 Mercury paper makes that unlikely. I am not going to discuss this here, as it might be more appropriate for the Talk on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disputes_about_Einstein%27s_claim_to_the_relativity_theories_1cce.html" title="Disputes about Einstein's claim to the relativity theories">Disputes about Einstein's claim to the relativity theories</a>.</dd>

<dd>That this is not the case can be seen from the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">Wikipedia definition of "scientific theory":</a></dd>
<dd>In various sciences, a theory is a logically self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of a certain natural or social phenomenon, thus either originating from or supported by experimental evidence (see scientific method). In this sense, a theory is a systematic and formalized expression of all previous observations made that is predictive, logical, testable, and has never been falsified.</dd>
<dd>The Einstein-Grossmann <i>Entwurf</i> paper is, of course, a theory in this sense because it contained field equations. However, it is a theory which had to be abandoned. Take the Einstein-Grossmann paper and remove the field equations, you no longer have a theory (because no falsifiable predictions can be made without the field equations) but a mere program for building a theory. It was Hilbert who finished this program, creating the modern theory of gravity. Therefore, credit for this achievement should go to both Einstein and Hilbert.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Whittaker's credibility</span></h3>
<p>To Alvestrand. You probably know from the Poincare page that I think Whittaker is a tad one-sided on the E = mc^2 issue. On p.51 Whittaker writes</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1900, referring to the fact that in the free aether the electromagnetic momentum is 1/c^2 times the Poynting flux of energy, suggested that electromagnetic energy might possess density equal to 1/c^2 times the energy density: that is to say E = mc^2."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whittaker did not mention that Poincare did not believe this result and advanced it as a criticism of Lorentz's theory. He did not mention that Poincare called it a "fictitious" density and that Poincare had no idea where the mass came from; it was just created and if it was real mass this creation would violate the conservation of mass principle. Nor did Whittaker mention that Poincare retained this view until 1904 at least, since he discussed this problem a number of times in his popular science books from 1902-1904. (I am not knocking Poincare, just pointing out that Whittaker did not mention all this). On the next page Whittaker jumps to a paper by Lewis (1908) where he says that Lewis "affirmed" that a body absorbing energy dE increases its mass by dE/c^2, and</p>
<dl>
<dd>"affirmed that the mass of a body is a direct measure of its total energy, according to the equation E = mc^2. As we have seen, Poincare had suggested this equation but had given practically no proof, while Einstein, who had also suggested it had given a proof (which however, was put forward only as approximate) for a particular case [if Einstein's case is particular, then Poincare's case is even more so - e4] (Whittaker 1953, p 52, comments in [] by me)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>You will notice that Whittaker does not mention that Lewis was affirming Einstein’s (1905) and Planck’s (1907) result and suggests he was affirming Poincare’s result. Apart from the downplaying of Einstein's efforts, Whittaker is wrong to say that Poincare had suggested this equation in the sense that (Einstein and Planck and) Lewis had meant. Poincare (1900) had meant nothing of the kind, and had no idea of it in his book of 1904 (This result would have solved the whole problem of mass violation, energy violation, momentum violation that Poincare couldn’t solve and which he still in 1904 thought cast doubt on Lorentz’s theory). Nor did Poincare mention E = mc^2 it in his 1905 paper or his 1906 paper (I may have missed it in the 1906 paper, can anybody else find it?). It seems very difficult to imagine that Whittaker couldn't see the difference between Poincare's "ficititious fluid of radiation" and the different idea that a body had less mass when it cooled down (lost heat by any means, so I conclude he sees what he wants to see. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 22:51, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>E4mmacro, do you really want us to believe that <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span> in the sense of Einstein and Planck is difficult to guess if one has the result of Poincaré? If a body cools down, it emits electromagnetic radiation which Poincaré tells us can be considered as a fluid with mass density equal to the energy density divided by <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>. The total mass of the fluid is the energy divided by <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>. Isn't it natural to assume that this is the mass lost by the body as a result of cooling down? The more intelligent high school students would we able connect the dots, when informed about Poincaré's work. And for this reason, Whittaker was justified to treat the Einstein, Planck and Lewis papers as part of a development started by Poincaré (and, perhaps, JJ Thomson).De kludde 23:47, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may appear easy now, but the fact is that Poinacre never did connect the dots in the easy way you say. So I guess it was not so easy then. Poincare is on record in 1904 as being baffled by Madame Curie's radium experiments. He had no idea where the energy came from. And the technical reason why he couldn't get Einstein's results is that, although Lorentz had shown mass varied with velocity in 1899, Poincare still did not believe it until 1905. You need the mass being <span class="texhtml">γ<i>m</i></span> before you can get Einstein/Planck result. And even when Poincare did believe it, 1905 and 1906, he still did not produce Einsteins's or Planck derivation. So Poincare did not do everything, what's the big surprise? <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 00:42, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whittaker has little credibility on this issue, and one day it might be worth listing all the mistakes of facts, as well as the correct things, in his chapter on "The relativity theory of Poincare and Lorentz". It will be worth only when those who use Whittaker as an infallible published source are taken too seriously. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 22:51, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On another point De kludde. A body can cool down by convection or conduction, not just by emitting radiation. Einstein (Ann. der Phys, v17, 1905) started with a radiation process "if a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c^2" and immediately extended to any form of losing energy. "The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of radiation evidently makes no difference, so that we are led to the more general conclusion that the mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content." Whether one agrees with the reasoning or not it is clear he is talking about something very different from Poincare's 1900 "momentum of radiation", and Whittaker should have realised that.</dd>
<dd>Einstein then immediately applied the new result to the Madam Curie/radium problem that Poincare (1904, Science and Method) had no answer to. Thus: "It is not impossible that with the bodies whose energy-content is variable to a high degree (e.q. with radium salts) the theory may be successfully but to the test (Einstein 1905)". Einstein finishes off by going back to the radiation process "If the theory corresponds to the facts, radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies". He means the mass (inertia) lost from the emitting body, is gained by the receiving body. Poincare, on the other hand, said the "ficitious mass" was created (appeared from nowhere) when the radiation was emitted and was destroyed (disappeared to nowhere) when the radiation was absorbed. Poincare never suggested that the mass of the emitter or the receiver changed when radiation was emitted or absorbed. Now you can argue that Einstein should have mentioned Poincare's "fictitious fluid", or J. J. Thomson or any others who nearly got the result in Einstein's sense, and you may argue that Einstein "must have known" of these results. Einstein might counter claim that the "momentum of radiation" was as old as Maxwell's radiation pressure and required no reference and in any case Poincare never repeated or used his equation again after 1900, and that he (Einstein) was unaware of Poincare (1900). But Einstein is not my point here, Whittaker is: Whittaker never mentioned all the above things which show Einstein (1905), Planck (1907), Lewis (1908) meant something different from Poincare (1900); Whittaker never clarified what Poincare meant or said. These are more reasons why I say Whittaker is not a reliable source on the issue of Poincare/Einstein and E = mc^2. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 02:09, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One point I tried to make was that Whittaker's sentences are ambigious enough to make the casual reader think that Poincare had suggested that "mass of a body is a direct measure of its energy content, accoding to the equation E = mc^2", something Poincare never suggested. Either Whittaker was careless, or lacked some easily gathered knowledge of Poincare's writings, or lacked good enough judgement to assess the material available, or something worse. In any case, I caution against relying on Whittaker's word as definitive.

<dd>If anyone cares about it, perhaps they think Riesman and Young's paper is enough. You may as well ask why hasn't the anit-Einstein lobby published dozens of articles proving Einstein's derivation was wrong (rather that just quoting Ives). The answer would be, because these supposed papers would be nothing new, if they merely repeated Ives. So we have two published papers which contradict each other - an insoluble dilemma for anyone who thinks anything published is auotmatically correct. Everyone else has to read Einstein, read Ives, read Riesman and Young and read Ives's answer to them, try seriously to understand what each is saying, and come to a reasoned judgement. You can see above a reasoned analysis of Whittaker. One doesn't have to agree with it, but it shows what is required. i.e. something different from the endless repetition of the parrot cry "Whittaker called it Poinacre's E = mc^2", something that isn't diened in the above analysis of Whittaker.</dd>

<p>Regardless of what one assumes about the content of Hilbert's November 16 letter, Einstein's accusations against Hilbert are brazen beyond any comparison. The only thing Einstein knew at this time was that Hilbert had started his own research in a field started by Einstein, a procedure which is perfectly normal in science, and that he intended to publish his results. The preserved part of the printer proof mentions Einstein's previous work. The only reason for which Einstein may have feared that Hilbert might not duly mention him is perhaps the example given by his, Einstein's, use of ideas of Henri Poincaré without attributing them to their author. The November 1915 events are indeed a good lesson about the wretchedness of mankind, but is was Einstein's own wretchedness which resurfaced after it became apparent earlier when Einstein plagiarized Poincaré.</p>

<dd>I really must read additional analyses of this issue before reaching a definitive conclusion. However, istm pretty clear that we would have no GR were it not for Einstein. He was the prime mover and had been for around 10 years. As I indicated above, he gave several lectures at Goettingen in 1915 which Hilbert almost certainly attended, giving the state of his research and its problems. I see them as a "heads-up" for Hilbert, to catalyze his work (and Noether's) as a collaborator -- someone that Einstein solicited when his theory was near completion. It would not surprise me if Hilbert solved the field equations first, given that that was what he was tasked to do. Nonetheless, I think the theory owes its existence to Einstein. As for the 1905 paper, one of its original features is that Einstein derived the LT's from the two postulates of relativity, not from physical hypotheses related to an ether. There is no evidence this was done by Poincare. If this is an incorrect assessment, then someone should be able to produce a link to Poincare's paper where he does so. But so far, there are no links, only repetitious bombastic claims. Poincare was already a very famous fellow in 1905, when Einstein was an unknown. If Einstein had simply reproduced Poincare's results, it is certainly odd -- indeed egregiously implausible -- that the scientific establishment didn't notice Poincare's achievement and defaulted to Einstein. green 65.88.65.217 23:01, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Einstein's paper had, for example, the relativistic Doppler formula, Poincare's 1905 did not. Einstein took a different approach to the force on a moving charge.

The idea that Einstein had the opportunity from 9 or 11 June (when Poincare's 41/4 page paper appeared) to 30 June (when Einstein submitted his paper to Annalen der Physik) to plagarise Poincare's paper (published in Paris) seems far-fetched. On the other hand Einstein could have had plenty of time to read Lorentz 1904, the acknowledged expert on electrodynamics at the time (I am not saying he did). It seems your pro-Poincare stance stops you taking the best anti-Einstein stance available to you.

<p>To E4: I need to correct my previous comment. I was interrupted in my editing -- otherwise this comment would have appeared earlier. The famous equation appears in Einstein's <b>last</b> paper in 1905. This, together with the fact that Poincare never mentions said equation in his <b>unique</b> 1905 paper, makes the latest Intro (edited by Anon) unconscionably misleading. It gives the fallacious impression that Poincare's relativity is identical to Einstein's relativity. As we have discussed ad nauseum, Einstein gave a dramatically <b>different</b> interpretation to the famous formula which is clearly part of relativity theory. Also, as an aside, I am pretty sure that Poincare did <b>not</b> derive the LT's from postulates as Einstein did in his 1905 paper on Electrodynamics, the one that Anon is comparing to Poincare's unique effort that year. If he did so, why would a complete unknown (like Einstein in 1905) have been given accolades, whereas an already <b>famous</b> man, Poincare, was ignored for that achievement? It makes no sense whatsoever, because it didn't happen that way! I have to leave soon so I suggest that someone else correct the Intro. green <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.136.26.226.html" title="User:64.136.26.226">64.136.26.226</a> 00:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To 64: It depends what you mean by the Lorentz transformations. If you mean only x',y',z',t' = f(x,y,x,t) then Poincare did not derive them at all. He got them from Lorentz (but he used a slightly new notation and re-arranged them algebraically, and named them the Lorentz transformations). Unknown to Poincare the LT had beed published in 1897 by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Larmor_6d87.html" title="Joseph Larmor">Joseph Larmor</a>. Poincare (1905) pointed out that these transformations formed a group and satisfied the principle of relativity. If by LT you mean x',y',z',t' = f(x,y,x,t) plus something extra, the way Maxwell's equations transform, then Lorentz made at least one mistake in the second bit, which Poincare corrected. Poincare does seem to have been guided by the Principle of Relativity in the way he corrected the mistake. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 11:07, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To 64: You also ask why was an unknown like Einstein given accolades, when a famous man like Poincare was not? I think the answer is that generally the theory was at first considered to be Lorentz's theory (not Poincare's not Einstein's). Some like Planck noticed Einstein, but Poincare consistently referred to it as the "Lorentz's new mechanics"; Poincare never claimed it was his theory. In the 1912/3 edition of a German book book "The principle of relativity" the author list was Lorentz, Einstein and others (with no Poincare). When GR was confirmed in 1919 (Eddington's eclipse experiments) Einstein became world famous and the de facto "owner" of relativity in the public mind. The later editions of "The principle of relativity" had the author list as Einstein and others. Anyone new to the theory who tried to read GR was naturally puzzled and then tried Einstein's 1905 paper which was easier to understand. Since that paper had not a single reference (which was a bit lax of Einstein and the journal, did they not have referees in 1905?), it appeared to readers in the 1920s that the SR came from nowhere, with perhaps a lingering bafflement as to why the principle equations were called the Lorentz transformations. I think I got this interpretation of the history from Herbert Dingle. It sounds plausible to me. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 11:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Malice or poor prose?</span></h3>
<p>I draw your attention to the following excerpt, especially the last sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Max Planck had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black-body radiation law, published in 1901, but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick. <i>The photoelectric effect thus provided a simple confirmation of Max Planck's hypothesis of quanta.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can I suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Max Planck had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black-body radiation law, published in 1901, but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick. The photoelectric effect was thus afforded a simple confirmation by virtue of Max Planck's 'trick'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That preserves a relationship in the subject of the two sentences, without the absurdity of implying a <b>mathematical trick</b> is a theory.</p>
<p>There's other examples of this sort of hack in the text: it's not looking too good right now.

<dd>My understanding is that Planck assumed something a little different. He assumed that a vibrating system (the atoms in the walls of the black-body container) could change their energy only by a discrete amount. That is, he assumed the vibrational states of the oscillators were quantized, so the energy of oscillation of the matter could be <span class="texhtml"><i>j</i><i>h</i>ν</span>, for integer values of j only. He did NOT assume that the electromagnetic energy in the black-body container was quantized. It is a slightly different thing to say energy was absorbed or emitted from the oscillators in discrete amounts, those amounts depending on a physical property of the oscillator (the matter) - its natural frequency <span class="texhtml">ν</span>. My understanding is that Einstein (in the photo-electric paper) turned it around, or extended it to the radiation, introducing the photon at the same time. Well that is what I think I was first taught, anyway. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 07:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>A small point: did someone have a specific objection to the statement that Einstein became world famous after the 1919 eclipse expedition (rather than the 1915 paper) or did it just get changed back as part of the revert wars? I think "world famous" means having the NYTimes write the headlines shown in the article. I doubt there were similar headlines in 1915 when a theory was published in a germany language scientific journal.

<dd>I assume you are referring to the Winterberg paper. If I recall, he does <i>not</i> say that the proofs contain the field equations in full; his entire argument is based on the fact that part of the Hilbert proof he looked at was simply <i>missing</i> and thus no answer could be easily drawn from it. I'll give you some time to review the article yourself and decide on what you want to insist on, before calling you intellectually dishonest again. I'm happy to provide a copy of the Winterberg paper to anybody who wants it by e-mail, though I don't think it is of very much value. (For the record, the authors of the original article think that Winterberg concentrated on something completely inconsequential, and ignores all of the other differences in the proofs.<a href="http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/texts/Winterberg-Antwort.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/texts/Winterberg-Antwort.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Personally I think the fact that Winterberg cites his major contributor to the paper as being the certified nutball Bjerknes does not help his credibility, and neither do his ties to <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a>, but that's just my take on things.) --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:25, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is true that part of the paper is missing. But the fact, pointed out by Winterberg, is that Corry/Renn/Stachel made their argument without pointing this out to their readers, a clear and dishonest violation of principles of scientific research, similar to an experimental physicists mentioning only the results he likes while keeping silent about the facts he dislikes. By contrast, Winterberg simply points out that the missing part of the proof may have contained the equation, and presents his argument (based on a comparison of text preceeding the gap with text from the published paper) that it has contained the field equations in explicit form. Wuensch does the same thing, and bases her attempt to reconstruct the missing text upon the preserved text of lectures of Hilbert on the subject. If CRS had done the same thing, presented the facts they have together with their speculation that the missing piece did not contain the explicit field equations, no one would have critized them.De kludde 17:11, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, they claimed it wasn't relevant to their argument. I haven't gone over the technicalities of it very closely, but it doesn't seem like an inplausible reply, and they also go into some detail in their long-reply looking at some of Winterberg's assumption as well. I'm not sure who gets the "bad behavior" award (Winterberg calling them frauds, them calling Winterberg paranoid), but in any event I brought this up primarily to emphasize that unlike Licorne's claim, the Winterberg paper does not settle things -- at best, it indicates towards the conclusion that the CRS paper does not settle things, at worst, it does not do even that. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 17:54, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It does not surprise me at all that they say it is not relevant. This is so because the fact that part of the proofs is missing is hard to overlook. And if they failed to mention a fact to their readers which is relevant and inconvient to them, and which is hard to overlook, this means that they violated the principles of good historical research. It is in a way close to fraud, and could totally destroy their reputations as historians of science.De kludde 22:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I wonder how I have to understand your assertion that you have not gone over the technicalities of it very closely. Do you understand what the principle of least action is, and what it means to calculate a variational derivative? But even so, you can look at the formulation of the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein_field_equations.html" title="Einstein field equations">Hilbert field equations</a> (wrongly attributed to Einstein) in the Wikipedia article on the subject. They clearly fit on the missing piece of paper, which means that CRS have to come up with some argument supporting their assertions that they have not been there. This they failed to do, however. And even if they had done it, it would still have had the character of a speculation, contradicted by practically all the other facts around the issue.De kludde 22:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't really matter what I individually understand about the mathematical disputes -- it is not our job on Wikipedia to discern out the "ultimate truth of these things" but rather to report on the state of the mainstream research primarily, and fringe research secondarily if at all (see our policy on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>). I find the boundary-work here ("who gets to write about these things?") fairly humorous, since half of this involves physicists pretending to be historians in the first place.&#160;;-) But seriously, what matters here is assessing what is the mainstream POV and what is not. I think it is pretty clear that Winterberg and Bjerknes are not the mainstream POV in this case, whatever one thinks of their ultimate accuracy (I'm doubtful of it, myself). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:10, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure about the ties between Winterberg and LaRouche. Could you give further comments? While I hold LaRouche in low esteem, I do not see why such ties necessarily discredit him as a physicist. As for Bjerknes, he is never listed as a substantial contributor to the Winterberg paper. Winterberg pointed out to Bjerknes what CRS failed to mention in their paper. Bjerknes then wrote a book about relativity, which for the first time reprinted the extant part of the printer proofs. Bjerknes also brought the Logunov paper to Winterberg's attention, and read the manuscript before its final publication. It was perfectly natural to mention him for this.De kludde 17:11, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I bring up Bjerknes simply to emphasize that Winterberg is not working here with respected historians -- he's working exclusively with a fellow who is known to have a major anti-Einstein bias, self-publishes, and has no positive reputation within the historical or physical community whatsoever. Whatever one thinks about what that indicates for his overall reputation, I think it indicates strongly that Winterberg should not be considered a "consensus" historical opinion, but is rather somewhat more fringe. As for the LaRouche connection, when I get home later today I'll be happy to write up a summary of it with some citations (I am away from my home office at the moment, where my books relating to the subject are). I stumbled across Winterberg and his LaRouche connections some time ago in connection with other research I was doing. Personally I think it again serves to bode poorly on his historical aptitude (I make no judgments of his aptitude as a physicist, of course, but he would not be the first physicist who made a poor historian). My memory of it is that he got connected with the LaRouche people in the 1970s as part of their fusion power advocacy wing, wrote a book for them, and then got involved in some issue relating to whether certain German scientists had done bad things during World War II. This is discussed in Dennis King's <i>Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism</i>, though I don't have the exact page numbers on me this minute (but I have the book at home). There's a nice picture of LaRouche and Winterberg in one of LaRouches' "autobiographies" too, if I recall. But anyway, I'll write that up in a little more detail. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 17:54, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you will find that "the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science has decided to replace the original" after Prof Winterberg complained - the authors seem to imply they would leave it there, if it were up to them. In my opinion the short reply is more effective than the longer reply which was marred by insults (I remember when I first read the long reply last year sometime I was a little doubtful about which side to believe because both sides seemed to have reached the paranoid stage). I think there is lesson for all those who like to indulge in personal attacks - the attacks just detract from one's argument.

<dd>fastfission you are wrong on all counts. Z.Naturforsch did NOT refuse to publish a response by Corry - Corry withdrew his response and could find NO ONE who would publish it anywhere. Also, the Field Equations are still in the proofs in several equivalent forms -- Corry was not smart enough to realize that not enough had been cut off by someone with their little razor blade. Also Winterberg is a top notch theoretician, who received his PhD from Werner Heisenberg at Goettingen University (Germany's MIT). <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 05:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Z.Naturforsch refused to publish <i>without modifications</i>. I don't know the nature of those, but anyway one can read Corry's full account in the link above of his side of the story. I never, by the way, disputed that Winterberg was a physicist; my comments are merely on his reliability as a historian. Both of my assertions about him (the LaRouche connection, the reliance on Bjerknes) are true and verifiable. In connection with the question of his respectability as a historian, it should also be noted that the one other time I am familar with his "historical" contributions it has had something to do with denying the culpability of accused German war criminals or something along those lines (it has been some time since I looked into him, for totally different reasons than this).

<dd>Alvestrand, if you contacted Stachel, would be willing to contact Fölsing as well? The <a href="http://termessos.de/erwiderungrenn.htm" class="external text" title="http://termessos.de/erwiderungrenn.htm" rel="nofollow">opponents of CRS</a> (and thats not just Winterberg, in case you haven't noticed yet) quote him as saying that not to mention the cut to the printer proofs is comparable to an experimental physicist omitting unconvenient data. Fölsing is, as far as I can see, not publisher of a research paper on this subject and for this reason he is more likely to be an independent witness than Stachel. Stachel can probably be considered to be biased towards his own party.De kludde 17:11, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Stachel says the main reason for withdrawing the original response was the fact that Winterberg felt insulted. This may well be the case. The original version of the Winterberg article was sent to CRS by <i>Science</i> and then rejected based upon their opion alone. A predictable response, given the fact that Winterberg's claims can well be construed to be an accusation of bad scholarship against these authors. Winterberg must have perceived this as an indication that there is a movement for falsifying the historic record about the matter, and added suspicions about forgery and a few comments about scientific hoaxes like the Piltdown man hoax at the end of his paper. Note that his comments were still not political in nature and did not mention Jewish or Zionist interests. It is the CRS response which completely dragged things on the political arena by making comparisons with "german physics" during the 1930s and "bourgeois genetics" in the Soviet Union. Renn has done a similar thing recently, in the newspaper article discussed <a href="http://termessos.de/erwiderungrenn.htm" class="external text" title="http://termessos.de/erwiderungrenn.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The pattern in both cases is that one of the authors of the CRS papers is attacked of using unscientific methods (justifiably so, given their silence about the missing part of the proofs and their absurd claims that Hilbert introduced a trace term into his equations in December 1915), to which they respond by attempts to swing the nazi club against their opponents. Now, who is obstructing the free exchange of ideas?De kludde 17:11, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Harald you are the only one I have any intellectual respect for there. You display intellectual integrity at times. I suggest this to you Harald, that the Intro be re-written <i>vaguely</i> by saying simply that Einstein made <i>contributions to Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, etc etc.</i> -- Also, Hilbert should definitely figure prominantly and by name, in the GR section, as soon as the Field Equation is mentioned. -- And Kip Thorne's reference number 9 does NOT suffice, it is wrong. -- Hilbert clearly did NOT credit Einstein as Thorne's quote states. <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 05:10, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Harald: The Intro is flatly contradicted by the published record which indisputably credits Hilbert with the discovery of General Relativity on 20 November 1915.

<dd>I disagree. The "dispute" is not something taken seriously by most historians, and most of the people on the "dispute" page who promote the idea of the "dispute" are not historians and are not respected in the historical community. If mentioned at all, it should be mentioned in the context of the disputed things themselves, later in the article where they appear in more detail. The intro is for the basics.

<dd>My German is not so great (I'll go over the parts I'm having trouble with with a dictionary later when I get the chance), but it seems to me that on page one he refers to the "general relativity theory of Einstein" and says that <i>his</i> contribution is putting it into a more simple and natural expression of it. (<i>Die gewaltigen Problemstellung und Gedankenbildungen der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie von Einstein finden nun, wie ich in meiner ersten Mitteilung ausgefürht habe, auf dem von Mie betretenen Wege ihren einfachsten und natürlichsten Ausdruck und zugleich in formaler Hinsicht ein systematische Ergänzung und Abrundung.</i>) Though I think all of this is rather inconsequential to the decisions made regarding this encyclopedia article (this definitely crosses the lines of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), especially as the crucial question is not what Hilbert may have claimed at one point, I'm somewhat curious about it in general. The selection with the "meiner Theorie" is part of a longer paragraph, and I'm having some difficulty figuring out whether or not Hilbert is intending at all to weigh in on the priority issue. The paragraph in question is:
<dl>
<dd><i>Seit der Veröffentlichung meiner ersten Mitteilung sind bedeutsame Abhandlungen über diesen Gegenstand erschienen: ich erwähne nur die glänzenden und tiefsinnigen Untersuchungen von Weyl und die an immer neuen Ansätzen und Gedanken reichen Mitteilungen von Einstein. Indes sowohl Weyl gibt späterhin seinem Entwicklungsgange eine solche Wendung, daß er auf die von mir aufgestellten Gleichungen ebenfalls gelangt, und andererseits auch Einstein, obwohl wiederholt von abweichenden und unter sich verschiedenen Ansätzen ausgehend, kehrt schließlich in seinen letzten Publikationen geradenwegs zu den Gleichungen meiner Theorie zurück.</i></dd>

Besides, the question has never been what Hilbert thought about it, but what independent historians have concluded (see our policy on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>).

<dd>Oh yes, it's quite <i>obvious</i> that you were happy to quote Thorne, cite him as an authority, ask if others had read him, etc., as long as people didn't actually quote him completely. You <i>never</i> indicated that it was taken out of context until it was pointed out to you, and then you made up excuses for why Thorne was wrong. Don't you agree that such behavior is a cause for suspicion? That it looks like you were trying to intentionally mislead? And yet, you have never admitted to it, or provided the slightest explanation -- all you do is make excuses for Thorne, rather than offer accounts of your own errors.

<dd>My German isn't so hot (babel de-1), but I read "den Gleichungen meiner Theorie" as "the equations of my theory". My sense of the logic of the paragraph is that Einstein's been wandering all over the place, trying different things, but has now in his last publications returned to the equations of Hilbert's theory. Note that I don't accept the theory that equation = theory; theories have text that relate them to the real world, not just equations. So Hilbert could have a theory that contained an equation that Einstein wanted to use in his theory, without the two theories being equal. I think. (BTW, I upgraded this para from 4th level to 1st level - it seems separate from the above topics, and the ToC looks awful) --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 21:45, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Einstein, Smoluchowski and Brownian Motion</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Anon69, in the discussion above you claim that "Einstein's solution for Brownian Motion was copied line for line from Smoluchowski." Could you give more details? Which paper(s) of Smoluchowski did Einstein copy from? Did Smoluchowski have <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/1/8/f18611276e9df65047e6b749f8e097a2.png" alt="E[x_t^2]=\frac{kT}{3\pi\eta r}t" />, the equation used by <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin_9755.html" title="Jean Baptiste Perrin">Jean Baptiste Perrin</a> to determine <span class="texhtml"><i>k</i></span>?</p>
<p>I attended a conference in Paris about three years ago by Jean-Paul Auffray, with Jules Leveugle, they both were aware of this fact that Einstein copied line for line <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoluchowski.html" title="Smoluchowski">Smoluchowski</a>'s equations for Brownian motion. If you contact them I'm sure they have your precise answer. Max Planck credited <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoluchowski.html" title="Smoluchowski">Smoluchowski</a> with the solution of Brownian motion, not Einstein. This is on page 258 of Jules Leveugle's magnificent book at the Ecole Polytechnique, for consultation. Copies of Leveugle's book are in other major Physics libraries in Paris, for consultation, I believe at the Institut Poincare, and probably the Bibliotheque Nationale. It is Leveugle's unabridged book <i>Poincare et la Relativite: Question sur la Science</i>. I believe Jean-Paul Auffray speaks perfect English, Jules Leveugle reads several languages including English. <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 03:52, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Hilbert states categorically it is his theory, which Einstein later republished" — even if we go by Hilbert's article, he only says that Einstein, in deriving general relativity, used the equations of some theory of Hilbert. So, the question is: which theory? It cannot be general relativity, because Hilbert himself says that GR is Einstein's theory.</dd>
<dd>I do agree that Einstein used the help of Hilbert and others to complete the mathematical formulation of GR. That's how science works: nobody creates a theory solely by himself. However, Einstein established the field of GR, thus, he is the author / creator / father / founder (if you disagree with "author", is there any other word you would agree with?). -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:32, 16 February 2006 (UTC) (via edit conflict)

<p>Does anyone have a quote for the source of the name "relativity" for the Special Relativity theory? The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_special_relativity.html" title="History of special relativity">History of special relativity</a> article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The original title for Einstein's paper translates from the German as "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies". Max Planck suggested the term "relativity" to highlight the notion of transforming the laws of physics between observers moving relative to one another, and the term 'Special' was later given to it by Einstein in order to distinguish it from the general theory of relativity.</dd>

<dd>Poincare used the phrase "Principle of relativity motion" a number of times from 1900-194 when discussing Lorentz's work. He sometimes means it is Newton's principle, he sometimes means what we now call the principle of relativity. i.e he was wondering whether electro-magnetics violated the principle of relative motion and was interested in Lorentz's work which kept rescuing the principle, but he thought perhaps Lorentz was trying to hard - "too many hypotheses". In 1904, (St Louis conference) when he was discussing the principle results of Lorentz 1904 he used "The principle of Relativity" since by then Lorentz had produced a theory which obeyed it exactly, well Poincare noticed a small mistake later. (If we couldn't see that Poincare was discussing Lorentz from the 1904 paper itself, he mentions this to Lorentz in his first letter to Lorentz 1905 - I mention this because Poincare-only fans never mention that Poincare 1904 was discussing Lorentz 1904). <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 21:36, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no false statement in the paragraph about e=mc^2 on the Einstein page, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;diff=40812359&amp;oldid=40805797" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;diff=40812359&amp;oldid=40805797" rel="nofollow">reverted by FastFission</a>. Planck did not say Einstein was wrong - he said Einstein's derivation was approximate as did Einstein ("ignoring terms of ...") and Planck produced what he thought was a better proof of Einstein's result (not Poincare's different result). The whole issue has been discussed <i>ad nauseaum</i>, so I can write Licorne's response for him: "Whittaker called it Poincare's E = mc^2". Thanks, but we know that. Whittaker is adequately discussed above under "Whittaker's credibility". <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 04:42, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't do that. On the Poincare page (which was the result of a tug-of-war between you and me) the emphasis is on Poincare's DIFFERENT result and why it is NOT the same as Einstein's result. You made the last edit (a deletion of Einstein's name) so that the final (frozen) text seems to imply that Poincare obtained Einstein's result. The Einstein page (as left by fastfission) accurately states Einstein's result that the energy of a body at rest is mc^2. This result was NOT derived by Poincare. If you want to denigrate Einstein with a footnote about Ives, I suppose you can, and I will add to the footnote Reisman and Young contradicting Ives on this point, but there is no point lengthening the article in this way. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 05:01, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, Licorne, if Macrossan wants to change it, he's more than welcome to -- he's someone I trust to do things the right way. You, on the other hand, seem to make a consistent habit of misrepresenting sources as well as other editors. And it should be noted, as illustrated by Macrossan's link, is remove the statements about what other people thought about Einstein's work. I'm not convinced that those are representative of the larger scientific reaction to it, and as such I'm not convinced they should be in Einstein's biography (as opposed to, say, the article on <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc2.html" title="E=mc2">E=mc2</a>, where details about individual assessments, whether representative or not, could be relevant). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 05:08, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think English-speakers such as myself have always been told or thought Newton was "the greatest", which is understandable. But here are some quotes from Einstein (as quoted by by James Gleick in a book "Isaac Newton" 1988) which suggest to me that leaving Einstein as "one of the greatest of all time" (rather than the greatest) is OK by Einstein. "Let no one sippose that the mighty work of Newton can really be superseded by this or any other theory. His great and lucid ideas will retain their unique significance for all time as the foundations\ of our whole modern conceptual structure in the sphere of natural philosophy" (What is the theory of Relativity? Times of London, 28 Nov 1919, reprinted in "Out of My Later Years"). "We have to realize that before Newton there existed no self-contained system of physical causality which was somehow capable of representing any of the deeper features of the empirical world" (Ideas and Opinions). <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 20:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Einstein and Newton are the only credible possibilities for the title of "greatest of all time". I can't think of another physicist anywhere close to their stature. Maxwell would be my third choice, but a distant third. So I think the phrase should read "one of the two greatest". "One of the greatest" sounds like there's a bunch of others with a legitimate claim and it just isn't so. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarityfiend_3736.html" title="User:Clarityfiend">Clarityfiend</a> 08:11, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton are the greatest scientists of all time. <i>There are two figures who are simply off the charts. Isaac Newton is one. The other is Albert Einstein. If pressed, physicists give Newton pride of place, but it's a photo finish—and no one else is in the race. Newton's claim is obvious. He created modern physics. His system described the behavior of the entire cosmos, and while others before him had invented grand schemes, Newton's was different. His theories were mathematical, making specific predictions to be confirmed by experiments in the real world. Little wonder that those after Newton called him lucky—"for there is only one universe to discover, and he discovered it." But what of Einstein? Well, Einstein felt compelled to apologize to Newton. "Newton, forgive me," Einstein wrote in his Autobiographical Notes. "You found the only way which, in your age, was just about possible for a man of highest thought and creative power." Forgive him? For what? For replacing Newton's system with his own—and, like Newton, for putting his mark on virtually every branch of physics. Einstein transformed humankind's understanding of nature on every scale, from the smallest to that of the cosmos as a whole (for special relativity is embodied in all motion throughout the universe), through fundamental problems about the nature of energy, matter, motion, time, and space—all the while putting in 40 hours a week at the patent office. (In 1905, Einstein is 26, a patent examiner, working on physics on his own.) The problems he could not solve remain the ones that define the cutting edge, the most tantalizing and compelling. Who's smarter? You can't touch that. No one since Newton comes close.</i> (<i>Genius Among Geniuses</i> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>)</p>
<p>The following shows that to say that he is widely regarded as the greatest scientist of all time is not POV pushing.<i>Albert Einstein is considered one of the greatest and most popular scientists of all time.</i> (Encarta Encyclopedia<a href="http://encarta.msn.com/media_461533337_761562147_-1_1/Albert_Einstein.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/media_461533337_761562147_-1_1/Albert_Einstein.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) Others who support this claim: The famous Russian physicist <a href="../../../l/e/v/Lev_Landau_9b86.html" title="Lev Landau">Lev Landau</a> ranked Einstein in a "superleague" of his own, beyond all others, at a 1/2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521435323/sr=8-1/qid=1141037350/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-1007708-9443846?%5Fencoding=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521435323/sr=8-1/qid=1141037350/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-1007708-9443846?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> A survey among today's leading 100 physicists put him as the greatest. <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/einstein.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crystalinks.com/einstein.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> To state that he is merely the greatest scientist of the twentieth century is insulting; note that Maxwell is a very distant third to these two giants. --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.253.120.206.html" title="User:24.253.120.206">24.253.120.206</a> 02:50, 27 February 2006</p>
<p>Yes I agree, Einstein is one of the greatest scientist to have ever lived. No one doubts that. But to say he is widely regarded as being perhaps the greatest of all time is not only a badly written piece of the intro, it isn’t true. He is considered the greatest by some but the majority would give Newton that title. As for the poll, Newton has been ranked number 1 in nearly all polls over the last couple of decades. But in my opinion Newton and Einstein should both be described as one of the greatest ever scientists in their articles - Arthur Rimbaud</p>

<p>No secret at all, it was right on national French radio, but now you're asking me to brag about myself, which you know I never do. But I had a large enough impact that the French Minister of Education wrote an article entitled <i>Poincaré le Grand</i> in which he made reference to my radio interviews. I pointed out in my radio interviews how many years later, Einstein claimed to have a <i>General</i> theory of Relativity, which was only a theory of gravity, and that he called it <i>General</i> just to try to steal credit for <i>Relativity</i> from Poincare.

<dd>This why everyone has so much trouble with your contributions, Licorne. You can "read between the lines" and are prepared to quote your imagination as an authorative source. I think the sensible strategy from now on is not to accept anything you say unless you give complete quotes, sources that anyone can check easily. Given that the chances are that you have read between the lines again, there is little incentive for anyone to go to the trouble of finding the originals (we are "not your secretary"). In summary: You have to realise that "in so many words" is not the same as "between the lines", it is the opposite. You cannot claim that an author said something ("in so many words") if you have only seen these words "between the lines". If it was just a typing error and you ment to say "not in so many words", I apologise. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 21:36, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is one thing to show the ascertainable facts about when things were published and when they were submitted, but that isn't enough to prove plagarism. There are many cases throughout the history of science of simultaneous discovery. We know Larmor, Lorentz and Poincare published the LT before Einstein, We know Einstein submitted 25 days after Poincare's paper was read to the Academy in Paris on 5 June 1905. I think the consensus view is that Einstein, working in isolation in the Swiss patent office, (<i>i.e.</i> not in Paris, not in Berlin) wrote his 1905 papers independently of Poincare's 1905 paper. He knew from his student days that using electromagnetics to detect the earth's motion through the aether was a big issue. He could know from his student days that statistical mechanics (Maxwell-Boltzmann stuff) was a big issue. He could have discovered these things independently. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 21:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe the French have some material indicating that there was a correspondence between Einstein and Poincaré in 1905, just like the exchange of ideas between Einstein and Hilbert in 1915? Unfortunately, Licorne only quotes Auffray and similar authors, but does not attempt to outline their line of thought in the [Priority disputes about Einstein and the relativity theories|Priority dispute article]. Of course, Einstein's 1905 Elektrodynamik paper and Poincaré's second 1905 paper are quite different. Logunov thinks that Poincaré's is the BETTER article, for instance. This of course is an argument against the theory that Einstein plagiarized from Poincaré's large paper, but he may have had some information about the <i>Comptes Rendues</i> paper. Note that I base my claim that Einstein plagiarized Poincaré not on such speculations but upon the fact, which we know for sure, that he was familiar with Poincaré's position on simultaneity.De kludde 12:45, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There was no correspondance between Einstein and Poincaré, why should Poincaré have wanted to speak to a little crapper like Einstein down there at some Swiss Patent office, what for&#160;? -- Also, compare the two 1905 papers, the structure and sujects are far too similar to have been coincidental, and Einstein even used phrases like <i>these form a group</i> which were mathematician's phrases that Einstein clearly lifted out of Poincare's paper. -- <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 13:59, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Without a correspondence, I don't see how Einstein was able to plagiarize one (or both) of Poincaré's 1905 papers. By dowsing? From some conspirator on the editorial board of the journals, xeroxing Poincaré's papers and sending them to Einstein? I agree that Einstein plagiarized Poincaré's rejection of absolute space and time, and may have plagiarized the clock setting procedure and <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</span> But without any specification of the channel through which Einstein is supposed to have obtained the knowledge of Poincaré's 1905 papers, I don't see how one can claim that he plagiarized them.</dd>
<dd>Concerning the group theoretic language: One has to be careful, because what Einstein wrote is not what Poincaré wrote. Einstein considers Lorentz transforms belonging to movement in one direction, which form a one-parameter group:
<dl>
<dd>... man sieht daraus, daß <b>solche Paralleltransformationen</b>, wie es sein muß, eine Gruppe bilden.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Highlighting is by myself. See the last dozen lines of Part I of Einstein's paper. Note that Einstein carfully avoids the wrong claim that all the Lorentz transformations in dimension 4 form a group. Now, this is what Poincaré writes in his 1905 Comptes Rendues paper:
<dl>
<dd>L'ensemble de toutes ces transformations, joint à l'ensemble de toutes les rotations de l'espace, doit formener un groupe...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>More precisely, if <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> is the (compact) group of rotations and <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> the set of Lorentz transforms for the given choice of space and time variables, then <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i> = <i>K</i><i>P</i> = <i>P</i><i>K</i></span> is a group (the Poincaré group), and the decomposition <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i> = <i>K</i><i>P</i> = <i>P</i><i>K</i></span> is a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartan_decomposition.html" title="Cartan decomposition">Cartan decomposition</a> of that group. Note that the Cartan decomposition was not known in 1905, but Poincaré, being one of the greatest mathematicians ever, was probably familiar with examples of it. Einstein wasn't, and apparently had no idea of the symmetry group involved, at least not in 1905. This is one of the reasons why Logunov thinks that Poincaré's 1905 papers are SUPERIOR to the Einstein Elektrodynamik paper, and I tend to agree.<a href="../../../1/4/4/User%7E144.92.82.21.html" title="User:144.92.82.21">144.92.82.21</a> 14:51, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why copy Lorentz? Well, according to one of your favorite sources the theory of relativity belongs to "Poincare AND Lorentz" (Whittaker 1953). It seems to follow (if Whittaker is right) that if Einstein stole the theory of relativity from anyone it must have been Poincare AND Lorentz (I am not saying that Einstein did do so). Is this some sort of French pride thing: because Poincare is French and Lorentz is not?

<dd>I think the reason is that Poincaré was willing to give up absolute time, while Lorentz was not, at least if Whittaker is correct. Also, Poincaré apparently was the first one to actually use the condition of Lorentz invariance as an important design criterion for a physical theory (his 1905 theory of gravitation).De kludde 12:45, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You didn't ask about Larmor, but I will answer anyway. According to your standards of proof (published second with no footnotes=plagiarism) Poincare and Lorentz plagiarised Larmor. Larmor published the Lorentz transformations in 1897; we have evidence in Poincare's books and Lorentz's papers that each knows of Larmor (each mentions Larmor). Neither Lorentz or Poincare credited Larmor with the Lorentz transformations. So it seems to me that, by your logic, this should be more than enough proof that Poincare and Lorentz (the originators of relativity, according to Whittaker) plagiarised Larmor (though I am not saying that). <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 07:33, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I read a paper about Larmor a couple of weeks ago and think it says that Lamor's article only contained the Lorentz transformations in an implicit form. You had to carry out some substitutions to arrive at the explicit version. This may explain why the importance of this paper went unnoticed (eg, by Whittaker, who claims that Larmor only had the correct second order transformations). In Einstein's case we KNOW that Einstein was informed about Poincaré's position on absolute space and time, and nevertheless did not quote Poincaré. Moreover, it is at least not unreasonable to assume that Einstein was familiar with the Lorentz transformation from the review the Beiblätter of Physikalische Annalen, as Einstein was a frequent contributor of reviews for this journal in 1905 (Logunov's argument).De kludde 12:45, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said above in "Whittaker's credibility" that it might be worth pointing out <i>all</i> the mistakes Whittaker made, if people take him too seriously. Whittaker was wrong on Larmor and hadn't noticed that Larmor's form of the Lorentz Transformation is exactly Lorentz's form, the same equations that Poincare called "the Lorentz transformation". Larmor called his transformation "the second order version", and maybe Larmor himself never realised what he had. Whitakker's credibility would be greater if he had noticed two sets of equations (Larmor's and Lorentz's) were the same (except Lorentz had a term l = 1, scattered throughout). Please don't now quote Ives again saying Lorentz was wrong and Poincare corrected him (and also Larmor). We have been thru it many times - Poincare was correct to say the equations he (Poincare) wrote (the coordinate transformations) are the same equations as Lorentz's transformations (the same once you realized that Lorentz and Poincare used a different notation, a different meaning for the term x in each equation, and it is only this different notation which makes them appear different - this is the "substituion" de KLudde refers to above, which de Kludde's unnamed source appears to misinterpret). Read <a href="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00002307/" class="external text" title="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00002307/" rel="nofollow">"A note of relativity before Einstein"</a>. Please don't quote again the statement in Poincare 1905 "a little different from Lorentz" where he was refering to the convection current and the forces on a moving charge, not the coordinate transformations. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 20:07, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Licorne does not have to quote Ives, as Lorentz says the same thing (Acta Math. 38(1921), p. 295): <i>En effet, pour certaines des grandeurs physiques je n'ai pas indiqué la transformation qui convient le mieux. Cele a été fait par Poincaré et encore par M. Einstein et Minkowski.</i> I think this refers to the tranformation rule for <i>j</i>, the 4-current, as you mention above.De kludde 09:41, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have not read the Larmor paper(s). If I remember correctly, you had to introduce a scale factor for x and t into a first stage version of the transformation to obtain the correct form. It was easy to see, and Larmor must have noted this when the Lorentz paper appeared. But did he give the correct transformation for the quantities entering the Maxwell equations?De kludde 09:41, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why don't you just list all mistakes of Whittaker? At the moment, Whittaker does not have a section in the "Attackers and defenders" part of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priority_disputes_about_Einstein_and_the_relativity_theories_2ba1.html" title="Priority disputes about Einstein and the relativity theories">priority dispute article</a>. I think you are overblowing your case by making a big credibility issue out of the fact that Whittaker failed to notice something in Larmor's paper which, as you admit, has escaped the attention the other contemporary authors and perhaps even of Larmor himself. I will perhaps say more about this credibility issue below.De kludde 09:41, 27 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>de Kludde, my case against Whittaker's credibility was stated in a previous section above (see the contents at the top of the paper) and it had nothing to do with Larmor. Larmor was just a side issuse for Licorne to show that his simplistic "arguments" "prove" not only that A.E. plagarised Poincare (who got it from Lorentz), but that Lorentz (by Licorne "logic") must have plagiarised Larmor. The issue of the Lorentz coordinate transformation has been covered mant times in these pages and the Poinacre talk pages. If you want the exact form of what Larmor, Lorentz and Poincare wrote for the coordinate transformation, in one short paper (so you can check the simple alegbra to see why they are the same coordinate transformations) then I recommend a journal paper <a href="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00002307/" class="external text" title="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00002307/" rel="nofollow">A Note of Relativity before Einstein</a>.

Is the prediction that dynamic electromagnetic processes run slower in a moving system (a prediction published in 1897) insignificant? Maybe, but I confess it sounds significant to me.

<dd>What more could Hilbert do? How about publishing a refutation in any of the physics or math journals? As the foremost mathematician of his time, it wouldn't have been difficult. It's also strange that none of the readers of Hilbert's article noticed the "theft". Plagiarism of this magnitude is absurd - in the small, closely-knit community of physicists, it's just too difficult to hide. Plagiarism in general can only succeed when you steal from somebody who is obscure, not someone as famous as Hilbert.</dd>

<dd>The rest of your allegations show that you can't be the physicist I believe you claim to be. Sure, the photoelectric effect is taught in high school now. So are Newton's laws. By your "reasoning", Newton is just as overrated. Maybe he stole HIS ideas from some other Frenchman! And if the effect was so obvious, how come other physicists didn't come up with the explanation first? As for the EPR paradox, it took a lot of hard thinking before the flaws were uncovered. If Einstein didn't have a deep understanding of QM, it should have been trivial to demolish. I don't know about Smoluchowski, but I guess you're implying the Nobel award committee was made up of gullible fools for giving Einstein the prize instead of this other fellow. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarityfiend_3736.html" title="User:Clarityfiend">Clarityfiend</a> 08:37, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Concerning Einstein and plagiarism, we have Solvay's testimony that Poincaré's reflections on absolute time in <i>La science et l'hypothèse</i> had been discussed in the circle around Einstein and Habicht. This means that Einstein would have been obliged to quote Poincaré in the first two sections of his 1905 Elektrodynamik paper. The same holds for the clock setting procedure, assuming that Einstein knew Poincaré's 1900 paper or the 1904 St. Louis paper. We know that he knew [Poi1900] in 1906. E4mmacro, you make a big issue out of the fact that Einstein worked in isolation. But Bern had a university at that time, and Einstein was almost certainly able to use its library. As <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0408/0408077.pdf" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0408/0408077.pdf" rel="nofollow">Logunov</a> points out (page 142), Einstein wrote reviews for the <i>Beiblätter</i> of <i>Annalen der Physik</i>, the review section of that Journal. Einstein contributed 21 reviews in 1905. According to Logunov, Issue 4/1905 (of 24) contains a review of Lorentz' 1904 paper, and this review contains the Lorentz transformation.De kludde 09:41, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, de Kludde, I said "mainstream opinion" says he worked in isolation. I am always happy to hear of any proof that he didn't. But I am dead against accepting Licorne's imaganation as proof. What is the 1906 reference where Einstein knows of Poincare 1900? <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 22:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And if you care to track down anotehr lead, I recall somewhere, someone who attended Minkowski's lectures round about 1905 or before saying they studied papers by Lorentz and Larmor (and he may have said Poincare). He went on to say that it wasn't till he read Einstein 1905 that it all becamse clear. I can't remember who said this or where, so it is not much of a lead for you. But Einstein did attended lectures by Minkowski didn't he? <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 22:48, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>For all these reasons, it is not unreasonable to assume the Einstein was familiar with most of the papers of Poincaré and Lorentz on the subject published in 1904 or earlier. Of course, the only case in which we have a clear-cut proof (provided by Solvay's recollections) is Einstein's familiarity with <i>Science and Hypothesis</i>. In principle, Einstein may have overlooked the review of the Lorentz 1904 article, or he may have found his clock-setting procedure independently. But should we really believe this, given the similarity between Einstein's and Poincaré's procedure and the fact that we have a clear-cut proof that Einstein knowingly failed to quote similar work of Poincaré? By "not unreasonable" I mean that a PhD student doing a similar thing would probably be in serious trouble. Most plagiarism guidelines seem to make it easy to convict, according to the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">Plagiarism</a>:De kludde 09:41, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is also <b>accidental plagiarism</b>. One case involved a boy whose mother had repeatedly read to him a story as a very small child. Later in life he was writing a story for an assignment, and a story 'came to him', but the story turned out to be exactly that which his mother had read to him as a small child, though he had no recollection of her reading it to him.</dd>
<dd>However, due to their <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawsuit.html" title="Lawsuit">fear of litigation</a>, many editors refuse to recognize any difference between either simultaneous or accidental inspiration and true plagiarism. In many academic settings intent does not even enter into consideration. <a href="http://www.rbs2.com/plag.htm#anchor111111" class="external text" title="http://www.rbs2.com/plag.htm#anchor111111" rel="nofollow">Princeton</a> dismisses intent as "irrelevant", and <a href="http://www.doug-johnson.com/dougwri/isit.html" class="external text" title="http://www.doug-johnson.com/dougwri/isit.html" rel="nofollow">Doug Johnson</a> says that intent is "not necessary for a work to be considered plagiaristic, and as one respondent put it, 'ignorance of the law is no excuse.' (Of course, this is a fallacy, as plagiarism is not even legally recognised as an offence.) Some universities will even <a href="http://www.rbs2.com/plag.htm#anchor777777" class="external text" title="http://www.rbs2.com/plag.htm#anchor777777" rel="nofollow">revoke a degree retroactively</a> if an alumnus' plagiarism comes to light within a year after graduation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that in Einstein's case we have Solvay's recollections which exclude the cryptomnesia excuse and prove conscious malpractice, while students could easily get into serious trouble for less. If Einstein had been unaware of Poincaré's other articles, he should at least have given him due credit later on. Compare his behaviour, for instance, to Lorentz' willingness to give <a href="../../../w/o/l/Woldemar_Voigt_d053.html" title="Woldemar Voigt">Woldemar Voigt</a> credit for the Lorentz transformation despite the fact that Voigt's transformation differs from the correct one by a scale factor.De kludde 09:41, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Add to this the Einstein-Hilbert isssue. Regardless of the precise content of Hilbert's November 16 letter, Einstein should have mentioned this letter somewhere in his publications, either to point out the differences between the letter and the final field equations or to acknowledge Hilbert's influence upon his own work. Should we really exonerate someone of plagiarism against so many odds?</p>

<dd>It's not a trivial matter to many people, some of whom don't like that he is identified as German when he clearly didn't want to be German, and things of that nature.

If it's proven wrong, France will say I am a German and Germany will say I am a Jew." But anyway, since there is no way to create a brief, one-or-two adjective version of this, I don't think it is too incorrect to have two short sentences about it early on.

<p>E4mmacro, I would like to address some of your complaints against Whittaker. I quote from his passage about <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>, omitting most of the footnotes: <i>As we have seen, J. J. Thomson in 1881 arrived at the result that a charged spherical conductor moving in a straight line behaves as if it had an additional mass of amount (4/3c<sup>2</sup>) times the energy of its electrostatic field.</i> At this point, Whittaker adds a footnote to Fermi, Lincei Rend. xxxi<sub>1</sub> (1922) pp. 184, 306 for a paper of Fermi pinpointing the mistake in Thomson's deduction, arriving at the correct value of c<sup>-2</sup>) times the energy. <i>In 1900 Poincaré, referring to the fact that in free aether the electromagnetic momentum is (1/c<sup>2</sup>) times the Poynting flux of energy, suggested that electromagnetic energy might possess mass density equal to (1/c<sup>2</sup>) times the energy density&#160;: that is to say, E=mc<sup>2</sup> where E is energy and m is mass&#160;: and he remarked that if this were so, then a Hertz oscillator, which sends out electromagnetic energy preponderantly in one direction, should recoil as a gun does when it is fired.</i> Whittaker now quotes a 1904 paper of F. Hasenöhrl (1874-1915) considering a hollow box with perfectly reflecting walls filled with radiation, and arriving at an excess mass of (8/3c<sup>2</sup>) times the energy, which Hasenöhrl corrected to (4/3c<sup>2</sup>) times the energy in 1905, to which Whittaker adds to comment quoted by Licorne: <i>... that is, he [Hasenöhrl] agreed with J. J. Thomson's E=(3/4)mc<sup>2</sup> rather than with Poincaré's E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</i> He then quotes Einstein's famous paper <i>that when a body is losing energy in the form of radiation its mass is diminished approximately (i.e. neglecting quantities of fourth order) by (1/c<sup>2</sup>) times the amount of energy lost.</i>De kludde 11:13, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I could have quoted this in more detail but don't want to risk a copyright violation. In your above criticism of Whittaker, you claim <i>that Whittaker's sentences are ambiguous enough to make the casual reader think that Poincare had suggested that "mass of a body is a direct measure of its energy content, according to the equation E = mc^2", something Poincare never suggested.</i> This assertion is difficult to defend, in my opinion. Whittaker's comment <i>: that is to say, E=mc<sup>2</sup> where E is energy and m is mass&#160;:</i> (at least as I would read it) simply means that formally integrating Poincaré's proposal for the energy density gives =mc<sup>2</sup>. And Whittaker added this remark not in the intention to mislead his readers but to point out the difference between Thomson's and Poincaré's result, which have a different <span class="texhtml">λ</span> in <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = λ<i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>. Whittaker is calling it <i>Poincaré's E=mc<sup>2</sup></i> in the comment on Hasenöhrl for a similar reason, to point out that Poincaré has <span class="texhtml">λ = 1,</span> and the reader of Whittaker is not likely to be misled, as Whittaker had given a correct description of Poincaré's statement previously. Of course, it is possible to quote this <i>Poincaré's E=mc<sup>2</sup></i> out of context, but Whittaker is certainly not responsible for this. It is, however, correct to claim Whittaker considered Einstein's paper as a mere step in a development of ideas going from Thomson via Poincaré, Einstein and Planck to Lewis. And this is an opinion which I share, since Einstein's result is what one would guess when reading Poincaré's 1900 paper and accepting Lorentz' theory, which Poincaré did by 1905. Whittaker's <i>is diminished approximately</i> in connection with Einstein's work may merit further comment, but I don't have the time for this now and the remark is certainly not germane to the question of whether or not Whittaker tried to obfuscate the difference between Einstein's and Poincaré's version of <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>.De kludde 11:13, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bit of Whittaker that I think shows his sloppiness and unreliability and lack of credibility is where he says that Lewis
<dl>
<dd>"affirmed that the mass of a body is a direct measure of its total energy, according to the equation E = mc^2. As we have seen, Poincare had suggested this equation ...".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>While it is technically true that Poincare had suggeested this equation, it is wrong to imply, as I think Whittaker's sentence does, that Poincare had suggested the mass of a body is a direct measure of its energy content. This is something Poincare (1900) did not do. Also the later claim that Einstein's result was a "particular case" (I think Einstein's case was rather general) with no mention that Poincare's case is very particular (restricted to momentum of radiation) again shows Whittaker has odd views. One could almost think Whittaker deliberately wrote this way to take some credit from Einstein and give it to Poincare. But let's just say Whittaker is unreliable, makes mistakes. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 23:45, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Or the large Wikipedia article, which gives you the impression that <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>was a totally new result in 1905, whereas in fact at least four authors (Thomson, Poincaré, Hasenöhrl, de Pretto) had published articles with closely related results, save for the different <span class="texhtml">λ</span>, by 1905?

<dd>Einstein in 1905 was simply trying to rederive Poincare's E=mc2. -- To De Kludde, Ives' paper said Planck <i>questioned the reasoning</i> in Einstein's derivation. Ives said Einstein's derivation was a tautology, which is something far worse than just a simple approximation. Could you expound on why it was a <i>tautology</i> please, thank you. <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 14:03, 27 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I cannot expound on the Ives issue because I am not familiar with Ives' paper. But in any case I don't think that one can dismiss Ives' view as outlandish, comparable to flat earth. For instance, as <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0408/0408077.pdf" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0408/0408077.pdf" rel="nofollow">Logunov,</a> p. 121 points out that Max Jammer ("The concept of mass in classical and modern physics") accepted Ives' criticism. And of course, Logunov himself also accepts it.De kludde 22:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In any case, it is true that Max Planck considered the reasoning in Einstein's 1905 E=mc<sup>2</sup> paper to be only approximately valid. In footnote 1 §17 of "Zur Dynamik bewegter Systeme", p. 204 vol. II of his collected works, he points out that Einstein's reasoning is valid "unter der nur in erster Näherung zulässigen Voraussetzung, daß die gesamte Energie eines bewegten Körpers sich additiv zusammensetzt aus seiner kinetischen Energie und aus seiner Energie für ein in ihm ruhendes Bezugssystem" - "under the assumption, which is valid only in first approximation, that the total energy of a moving body is the sum of its kinetic energy and its energy in an inertial system at rest in the body". I think this is absolutely correct. As far as I understand it, the problem here is that, in the classical approximation and for a body composed of many particles with masses m_i, one can identify the difference of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/0/0/300fd4d144f86f830e736dcedfc3ced3.png" alt="\sum\frac{m_i}{2}v_i^2" /> and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/d/2/6d2de7be31762061a93edb8a186b112b.png" alt="\sum\frac{m_i}2v_i^{(o)2}" /> (where the superscript <i>(o)</i> denotes speeds in the inertial system where the body rests) with <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/3/0/730b48a08e2333858eaa4d74d0eca745.png" alt="\frac{m}{2}v^2" />, formed using the body's mass and speed. For the classical situation, using <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/3/0/730b48a08e2333858eaa4d74d0eca745.png" alt="\frac{m}{2}v^2" /> and the classical addition of speeds, this is easily seen to be valid, but for relativistic speeds the situation is more complicated. The fact that Einstein lets <i>v</i> tend to zero does not help because the quotient <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/c/b/2cbd32919b4817bd62392debfd2d9bff.png" alt="v_i^{(o)}/c" /> may still fail to be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/d/a/eda0c9a1a15d81f79f42bf78a7203b37.png" alt="\ll1" />. Therefore, Planck's assertion that there is a problem of relativistic thermodynamics which has to be addressed is imho correct. Actually, the result at which Planck arrives, and to which the footnote I quoted refers, is his equation (48)

<dd>Poincare should be there, not de Pretto. Also, Whittaker is considered the greatest British historian of science of the 20th century. Whittaker called it like it is, he had integrity unlike Fastfission. <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 14:22, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Fastfission, I was writing this in response to e4mmacro's earlier criticism of Whittaker. Apparently e4mmacro thought that simply stating that Whittaker "is considered eccentric by most historians" may not suffice, given <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Taylor_Whittaker_da24.html" title="Edmund Taylor Whittaker">Whittaker</a>'s undoubtedly excellent reputation as a mathematician. I never said that my attempt to address e4mmacro's criticism should occupy a prominent space in the Einstein article. In fact, I never tried to push large changes to the Einstein article on this Wiki. But note that the NPOV states that "Texts that present multiple viewpoints fairly, without demanding that the reader accept any one of them, are liberating." For me, this means that the fact that a dispute exists should not be denied, and the positions should be stated. I think this means that the dispute page should be linked to a place in the Einstein article where people looking for details (other than date of birth/death,...) will find it.De kludde 22:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would also like to point out NPOV specifically states that "Facts ... are not <i>Points Of View</i>". That the papers of Thomson (1881) and Poincaré (1900) quoted by Whittaker exist probably is a fact ("a piece of information about which there is no serious dispute."), unless someone wants to claim that Whittaker misquoted them. And that they are part of the history of <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc%C2%B2.html" title="E=mc²">E=mc²</a> may also be quite non-controversial. I don't know whether e4mmacro (or you) want to disagree here. In this case, it would be a fact that the history of <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc%C2%B2.html" title="E=mc²">E=mc²</a> started in 1881 and that the article I was quoting, which in its current form has the history of this equation starting in 1905, has to be rewritten.De kludde 22:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would be most interesting to study Ives's paper, I only have excerpts, I wonder if it is on the internet complete&#160;?&#160;? -- In the excerpts Ives points out that Einstein <i>built in</i> E=mc2 then derived it <i>back out</i>, in other words he derived nothing at all, a tautology. --Einstein just essentially stated what he wanted to prove, namely, Poincare's E=mc2.--<a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicorne_2bcc.html" title="User:Licorne">Licorne</a> 22:48, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Ives's paper</span></h3>
<p>There is a copy of Ives's paper in a Book called "The Einstein Myth and the Ives papers" (a complete collection of Ives relativity papers. Licorne said somewhere this book is in every University Library, if that is any help. There is something odd about Ives's criticism. Ives claims that Eisntein assumption that the energy = rest energy + kinetic energy (the assumption Planck questioend and de Kludde discusses above) "builds in the relation E = mc^2". If this were so one would think that Einstein would then derive E = mc^2 exactly. However Einstein does not derive it exactly, he has to approximate the term <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/b/3/1b370ee35e4632203e662e0466c89a04.png" alt="\left(1 - v^2/c^2\right)^{-1/2} -1" /> as <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/4/1/341f144ffdfb542817742d8a9036c5a7.png" alt="\approx \frac{1}{2}v^2/c^2" />, so I am not entirely satisfied with Ives's criticism (why doesn't the results "fall out" exactly if it were "built in". On anotehr point, I don't think anyone has claimed that Planck's rederivation was not correct and in fact better than Eisntein's. But Planck never claimed to have priority in suggesting the mass-energy equivalence. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 07:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The published record is crystal clear, Poincare discovered Special Relativity, which is the only theory of relativity, because so called GR is just a theory of gravity, that was discovered by Hilbert. -- And Einstein could not even derive E=mc2, even when Poincare had first given the correct formula.</dd>
