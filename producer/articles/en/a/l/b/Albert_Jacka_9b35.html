<p>Albert Jacka enlisted in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Imperial_Force_f632.html" title="Australian Imperial Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">8 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, with the rank of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_%28rank%29.html" title="Private (rank)">private</a>. Jacka was assigned to the 14th Battalion, 4th Brigade, 1st Division and finished his training in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> became a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> ally the 1st Division was sent to <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to defend the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_Canal_ab3c.html" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>. Albert Jacka and his battalion arrived at Alexandria on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">31 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>. During ten weeks of training south of Cairo the 4th Brigade was merged with two <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> brigades and merged with the 1st Light Horse Brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division (NZ&amp;A) under Major-General Alexander Godley.</p>
<p>Albert Jacka fought in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a> that started on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">25 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> when his new division landed at <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzac_Cove_149e.html" title="Anzac Cove">Anzac Cove</a> on the 26th in the Dardanelles, fighting against Turkish defenders on a narrow beach. The NZ&amp;A-held position that was a series of trenches became known as Courtney’s Post where Jacka won the Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">19 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> the Turks attacked Courtney’s Post and captured a portion of it. The NZ&amp;A failed to recapture it in a counter attack. During the conflict Jacka and three men moved to outflank the Turkish position. Albert Jacka was the only man to make it (one was wounded and the others were pinned down by machine gun fire) and Jacka charged the Turkish position over open ground and jumped into a Turkish held trench behind the Turkish soldiers. In the resulting conflict Jacka shot five and <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayoneted.html" title="Bayoneted">bayoneted</a> two Turkish soldiers and then retreated back to his own lines. Jacka took up a trench position and held the trench alone for the remainder of the night. Jacka’s platoon commander found him the next morning and for his actions awarded him the Victoria Cross.</p>

<dd>On 19/20 &#160; May 1915, at "Courtney's Post", <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Corporal_32e6.html" title="Lance Corporal">Lance Corporal</a> Jacka, while holding a portion of our trench with four other men, was heavily attacked. When all except himself were killed or wounded, and the trench was rushed and occupied by seven Turks, Lance-Corporal Jacka most gallantly attacked them single handed, killing the whole party, five by rifle and two with the bayonet.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Albert Jacka survived the battlefield and was promoted to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal.html" title="Corporal">corporal</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">28 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, and was promoted to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a> four weeks later. During the following November he became <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_sergeant-major.html" title="Company sergeant-major">company sergeant-major</a> of Company C. Jacka saw much fighting at Gallipoli where during August 1915 at a battle at Chunuk Bair, Hill 971, and Hill 60, his battalion was still trying to break the beachhead. Jacka recorded in his diary that his battalion had 600 of 800 casualties after only a few days fighting. After nine months of fighting in December 1915 and after 26,111 Australian casualties the Allied forces began to evacuate the peninsula where Jacka was reassigned with the 14th Battalion to Lemnos.</p>
<p>Jacka was reassigned to Egypt with newly formed brigades, and he stayed with 14th battalion in one of the two new brigades from the split of his original brigade. With the new reorganization completed during March 1916, Jacka was commissioned as <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_lieutenant.html" title="Second lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">19 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. After these events, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">1 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> the Australian contingent was reassigned to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> to fight the Germans.</p>
<p>Albert Jacka and his unit was assigned to the Allied trenches near <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenti%C3%A8res.html" title="Armentières">Armentières</a> and saw heavy fighting. Jacka’s unit was originally a diversion to distract the Germans for the Somme offensive, but after the disaster that lost 57,470 British and Canadian soldiers the first day of fighting his unit was transferred to the Somme offensive and saw some of the conflict during that disaster.</p>
<p>Jacka’s Australian division, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>, was involved in the attack of <a href="../../../p/o/z/Pozi%C3%A8res.html" title="Pozières">Pozières</a> planned by Major-General H.B. Walker. The Australian division suffered 5,286 casualties after three days of fighting. The Australian force captured Pozières, but the fight was so bloody that the Australians could identify their trenches by the bodies of their comrades showing their red-and-white shoulder patches. The Germans counter-attacked with five battalions with orders to recapture Pozieres.</p>
<p>During the counter-attack Jacka as platoon commander and seven of his men surprised and attacked 150 Germans who had 40 Australian prisoners of the 48th Battalion. The attack was successful with Jacka and all of his men wounded with Jacka wounded seven times. Jacka was credited with killing between 12 and 20 Germans. Jacka was left for dead on the battlefield after he lost consciousness. He regained consciousness and crawled back to friendly lines where he was found and evacuated to England due to battle wounds.</p>
<p>Jacka was awarded the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Cross_3e00.html" title="Military Cross">Military Cross</a> for his actions at Pozières.</p>
<p>After four months of recovering from his wounds he was reassigned to the 14th Battalion on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">9 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. Jacka was also promoted to the rank of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a>.</p>
<p>In April 1917 Jacka’s brigade was ordered to attack Bullecourt in support of the British 5th Army attack on Arras. Jacka was the battalion intelligence officer and would perform solo missions into no-man’s-land to reconnoiter enemy trenches. At Bullecourt 2,339 men were lost and another nearly 2,000 were taken prisoner.</p>
<p>Jacka was awarded his second Military Cross for his one-man patrols at Bullecourt and for personally guiding the British tanks into position.</p>
<p>Jacka was given command of D Company, 14th Battalion and survived deadly conflict in France and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. In July 1917 Albert Jacka was wounded by a sniper with a leg wound and evacuated to England. After healing he was returned to the front lines.</p>
<p>Jacka was finally removed from the conflict by a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_gas.html" title="Mustard gas">mustard gas</a> attack on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">15 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> outside the village of Villers Bretonneux. He was evacuated to England for a third time and underwent surgery twice to save his life. Jacka was still recovering from his wounds when the Armistice was signed on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> that ended the war.</p>

<p>Jacka’s wounds kept him in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and he did not return to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> until mid-October 1919 where he was formally discharged from the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Imperial_Force_f632.html" title="Australian Imperial Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> during January 1920.</p>
<p>After the war Jacka initially worked in a private business importing and selling electrical goods set up in partnership with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wren_5263.html" title="John Wren">John Wren</a>. His business collapsed with the Depression of 1929. He was elected to the St. Kilda council in 1929 and then became mayor of the town.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">14 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> Jacka collapsed after a council meeting and was admitted to Caulfield Military Hospital. At age 39 one week after his birthday he died on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">17 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> due to his First World War wounds.</p>
<p>Albert Jacka was buried at St. Kilda Cemetery with eight other Victoria Cross recipients acting as pallbearers with an estimated 50,000 witnesses to the burial as Jacka’s body passed en route to the cemetery. There is a commemorative service held every <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">17 January</a> in St. Kilda to honor Albert Jacka as Australia’s greatest warrior.</p>
