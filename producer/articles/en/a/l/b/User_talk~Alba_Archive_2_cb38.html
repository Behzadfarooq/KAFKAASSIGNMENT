<p>Hi Alba: I'm not so good at doing redirects; actually some of the things that are redlinked shouldn't even be there; Aethelred of Mercla (with an l) is a misspelling and a redirect would not be helpful; that redlink should probably be deleted. There are some redlinks that are probably legit variant spellings, though. Sorry I'm not terribly helpful. If you can tell me a quick way to do redirects, I can try to work on them. Thanks, <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFeanorStar7_4f75.html" title="User:FeanorStar7">FeanorStar7</a> 00:41, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The bot will, in 3-4 weeks begin to maintain the <a href="../../../s/c/_/WP%7ESC_5cc9.html" title="WP:SC">WP:SC</a> page doing automatic counts. To be honest I forgot about this...I am still willing to do it though!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever percent difference you want...be it .1% or something else, I don't care. (Does not affect my program at all, besides limiting which articles it changes)</li>
<li>Yes I can program the bot to do all three tasks. (the third will take the longest, though It will probably only take about 50 or so lines of code) The other two are basically 2 if than statements:-), as the framework is already installed.</li>
<li>It is my bot, I will run it...especially on the first couple runs...as I need to make sure that my code does no harm to wikipedia.:-)
<ul>
<li>It does no harm now...just I must make sure that no harm is done when the new code is added.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 22:13, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>...Alba...Do you have any idea of the regex for pages with lists on them...(do they all have a specific template of some kind...some kind of unique formatting...something that seperates them from normal articles.) I have the disambig already written...I forgot that I wrote it about 2 weeks ago!!!:-)<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 22:27, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok I like the idea with the lists, perhaps, if you know how, you can start fleshing out some regex statements for me???</p>
<ul>
<li>I programmed Gnome so that it will discrimminate between links to pictures, interwiki links, and category links(<b>plus of course just normal links</b>!!!.
<ul>
<li>The percentage will be done only on the number of normal links. <i>If you don't like this holler, but the way I see it we don't want to pick up every picture and interwikilink, we want the links to wikipedia.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I will change the regex from <b>//[//[</b> to <b>//[//[.*?//]//]</b></li>
</ul>
<p>for lists:</p>
<p>1)it looks like if there is more than X bullets than mark as list...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Help me define what X is....</dd>
</dl>
<p>2)if article has section with <b>== .*? [Ll]ist .*? ==</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thats pretty clear...</dd>
</dl>
<p>3)I can't think of the pattern for tables, please help me here!!!</p>

<p>Oh and for <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> we are going to have to mention the bot on <a href="../../../c/u/_/WP%7ECU_027e.html" title="WP:CU">WP:CU</a> and get agreement that the bot is a good idea there...We can do this now...

<p>Here is the translation: if the Articles contents contain ==&lt;something or nothing here&gt;list&lt;something or nothing here&gt;==. This is case insensitive, In other words this could be List, liSt, ect.</p>
<p>Than: find and replace every instance of {{Cleanup}} with {{Cleanup-List}}</p>

<p>Agian, just tell me if this is what we want...or am I missing something.(remember this is one out of 3 for the lists.) I still have to write something to detect a table and something to count bullet points.</p>

<p>Ok here we go...If: the number of *'s (bullets) in the article is more than the number that I put into the bot before running (right now Defult is 5...if we change this it should go up...)</p>
<p>Than: Replace every instance of Cleanup with Cleanup-list.</p>

<p>I think you got the drill here...tell me what you think...is there something out of place ect.(is this what you want).</p>
<p>P.S. We need to be carefull with this...particurally the statements that find lists...What if the list is only part of the article...Say it is section 5 out of 5...That is some false positives that we don't want...</p>
<p>My suggestion to fix is this... if the article has more than X words than don't apply this and add to a list for human review. Tell me what you think...I can even give you the lists...:-)<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 01:46, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Or we can count the number of times that ==&lt;something&gt;== shows up in an article. That number exeedes a certian value...we put it on a list for human review...</p>
<p>The lists will look like this...click on the following link... <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Novels_Book_to_novel_autolist_9b20.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/Book to novel autolist">Book stubs → Novel stubs</a> (this is an actual list generated by Gnome (Bot) for <a href="../../../n/o/v/WP%7ENOVEL_3f84.html" title="WP:NOVEL">WP:NOVEL</a> doing basically a simpler version of what you want.</p>

<p>On the lists we may need human review to start. With the disambig and the wikify we don't.

<p>Would you please defend your use of the word "obviously" in your delete vote, with specific reference to the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is absurd to say a proof on its own is not an encyclopedia article. What about all of the <b>other</b> pages devoted mainly to mathematical proofs? Will you nominate <b>ALL</b> of them for deletion?</li>
<li>What about <b>ALL OF THE ARTICLES IN <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pi_topics.html" title="List of pi topics">list of pi topics</a></b>? Should the <b>ALL</b> get merged into <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a>? That is absurd. Wikipedia is NOT supposed to be only for beginners.</li>
<li>22/7 is of course one of the earliest convergents in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continued_fraction.html" title="Continued fraction">continued fraction</a> expansion of π. By contrast, those decimal expansions (e.g. "3.14") are rather arbitrary.</li>
<li>This proof is startlingly simple, elegant, and enlightening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forgive my exasperation, but I can't help but suspect that these "delete" votes are coming from non-mathematicians. This article has great esthetic charm. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:26, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You must be <b>COMPLETELY</b> unaware of Wikipedia's extremely extensive coverage of mathematics. Probably more than a thousand mathematicians have worked on them. It's probably the field in which Wikipedia is most successful. <b>MOST</b> of the MANY THOUSANDS of mathematics articles are comprehensible only to those who've done some graduate work in mathematics.

To see how bizarre such a suggestion is, please go to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_lists.html" title="List of mathematics lists">list of mathematics lists</a> and browse. Click on a variety of these. Also, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematical_proofs.html" title="List of mathematical proofs">list of mathematical proofs</a>, which lists mathematical articles devoted only to specific proofs. Will you delete all of <b>those</b> too?

<p>its not a wreasling match, I just did it for the fun of it!!!</p>
<p>Any way you said the Blue bot can do it... You are right, I looked it up on it's talk page, but it only does it when there are no other templates...Apparently that is a tad controversial for it's stated mission.</p>
<p>My bot doing it should not be a problem here as it will only change articles with cleanup to wikify.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I got that part of the code going today!!!! look at WP:CU for more info and suggestions...I do suggest that we get as many features as possible before we propose. Keep them comming!!!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>P.S.S. We need to make sure that WP:CU is in agreement that the bot is a good idea...in other words, can you get mention of gnomebot posted to a more prominent place...Something like go here to check out proposed bot actions. (If I can prove that the majority if not all of the wikiproject supports, going to WP:BOT will be so much easier.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 03:40, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
In addition i suggest that you mention my bot on the Cleanup proposal, (i found the link), I really don't want to program this and than have my work be useless...(will there be a place for Gnome (bot) when all is said and done??)</p>

<dd>Seeing the urgency of the matter I will get this bot up and running <b>ASAP</b>.

<dl>
<dd>Please look at one of the proposals on WP:CU's talk page...It involves removing the cleanup link after a set time period..., perhaps with a bit of inovative thinking the bot can do this as well.
<dl>
<dd>I am dead serious about this...I did not realize the magnatude of the problem...Right now I am going to go FULL SPEED AHEAD...As soon as I can make sure the bot is operating right...I will <b>PUSH</b> this through WP:BOT...With the crises, there is no way they will turn this bot down.:-) <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk)</dd>

<p>It's actually a pretty modest writeup; some people have credentials so substantial that anything accurate and reasonably comprehensive they write about themselves will be seen as self-promotional. If anything, the article should be beefed up to give more extensive descriptions of his work and achievements, not toned down. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was reading your vote for deletion on the article I wrote about Ron Horsley, an author whom I've both read and corresponded with in the past. I wrote the article, not Mr. Horsley, and though he's aware of it and was willing to provide one of his book cover design images for it, it's not a vanity article in that he didn't write it and I didn't write it because he's a family member or direct business associate or something. I wrote it because he's a genuinely good author and artist who has been working to make a serious mark on horror-writing and publishing quality, as well as doing some good work in his own writing. That's all. Even the wiki rules say that levels of fame are subejctive and not necessarily guidelines for deleting an article just because the subject isn't widely-known.</p>
<p>In reading the Wiki rules about this, I don't see it as a violation of those concepts though I agree that it could be debatable, but no more so than some other authors similar to him who are also featured on Wiki. As far as the vandals go, doesn't Wiki have options for warning them and reversion without having to delete the article? It seems to me that if vandals only editing an article once every few months for maybe a day or two at a time can get an article deleted completely, it's saying that Wiki can be coerced into removing an article rather than just blocking it if enough people with some timeon their hands waste it vandalizing pages.</p>
<p>Thanks. just wanted to get a chance to talk to you about it. I do genuinely believe there's value in recognizing his work, and I didn't do it to promote some specific product or website of his.--Zeppelin85</p>

<p>Gnome bot is now able to recognize everything on our list...We just need to sit down and deciede what the limits will be.</p>
<p>Here is what Gnome bot will do to start...At the end I will put new stuff that is not programmed, but will not be hard to do so.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b> when I mention cleanup I mean {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-date_744c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-date">cleanup-date</a>}}</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b> examples come from [[Category:Cleanup from April 2005]]</p>
<p>1) <b>If</b> the article has less than &lt;X&gt; words <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}}</p>
<ul>
<li>I suggest X = 100 or 200, somewhere in there.</li>
<li>NOTE this has not been discussed.. I only put it in when I saw these articles
<ul>
<li>Examples <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser_Division_13_63a6.html" title="Cruiser Division 13">Cruiser Division 13</a> (78 words), <a href="../../../d/-/s/D-separation.html" title="D-separation">D-separation</a> (138 words), <a href="../../../d/a/i/DAIWA_Securities_a803.html" title="DAIWA Securities">DAIWA Securities</a> (29 words), <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzanryu.html" title="Danzanryu">Danzanryu</a> (27 words).</li>
<li>I could go on and on...I think what I will do is create a list of those articles that fit the criteria and post them somewhere where the stub sorters can get to. (I really don't want to overflow {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}}, as this will have serious potential to do so)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2) <b>If</b> the article has {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">Disambig</a>}}, <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig-cleanup_9c4d.html" title="Template:Disambig-cleanup">disambig-cleanup</a>}}</p>
<p>3) <b>If</b> the title contians "list", <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-list_d6cd.html" title="Template:Cleanup-list">cleanup-list</a>}}</p>
<p>4) <b>If</b> There is only one section, whose name contains "List", <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-list_d6cd.html" title="Template:Cleanup-list">cleanup-list</a>}}</p>
<ul>
<li>we can modify this so it states if there is 2 or fewer sections...as some lists have a title(section) and than the list(section). Agian this is probably not the right time for this... but remember that we can tweak all of these. (each one is only 3 lines of code)....backed up by about 300:-)</li>
</ul>
<p>5) <b>If</b> Article contians more than &lt;MaxBullet&gt; bullet points, <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-list_d6cd.html" title="Template:Cleanup-list">cleanup-list</a>}} 8)* As agreed elsewhere MaxBullet = 20, with tweaking as time goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This one I am going to have the bot put every article that qualifies into a seperate list, so that you and I can go over and make sure that my code did what it is supposed to do. (I will only generate this list once...THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THE BOT WILL DO EVERY TIME IT RUNS...only during it's first trial run...untill I am satified.:-).</li>
</ul>
<p>6) <b>If</b> Article contians 0 sections <b>and</b> Article has &gt; &lt;X&gt; words <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../s/e/c/Template%7ESections_e49a.html" title="Template:Sections">Sections</a>}}</p>
<ul>
<li>X = 2000, to start with...this can be changed as you know. (just a reminder)</li>
</ul>
<p>7) <b>If</b> less than &lt;MINWIKI&gt; of its content is a wikilink <b>than</b> replace cleanup with {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}} <i>(probable text dump)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>MINWIKI = 0.1%...We will definatly be tweaking this...(up or down, I don't know):-)</li>
<li>After I am satified with #5, I may have the bot generate a list of articles that fit #7's criteria...That way we can get a feeling for how many articles are we picking up. (Agian the list is not permenent...Think of it as a gauge, It lets us know EXACLY how many articles fit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE</b> I am still looking for where to find out what namespace an article is in...I have an idea...I will have this done very soon. Applies for the next 2</p>
<p>8)If page is in the Category: namespace, change tag to {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-list_d6cd.html" title="Template:Cleanup-list">cleanup-list</a>}} <b>This I am putting on hold, as implenting it will require a extensive rewrite, right now my program does not even open articles that are in any other namespace, this will be a feature we can add on later to pick up the 10 or 15 articles that qulify under this</b></p>
<p>9)If page is in the Image: namespace, change tag to {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-image_978d.html" title="Template:Cleanup-image">cleanup-image</a>}} <b>See the bold above</b></p>
<p><b>Speculation</b> If you comment on anything in this post...Comment on what is below here!!!</p>
<p>Regarding autocategorization...If we choose generic categories...like music, geography, science, ect....The bot can simply look at what categories an article is already in...and than put the article in the apropriate cleanup category...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pros</b>---The bot will almost never be wrong...as long as the humans who put the article into say Category:chemistry are right.</li>
<li><b>Cons</b>---As there are almost infinate categories on wikipedia the bot will not be able to match each one...We would just program the 50-100 or so categories that are most commen in the cleanup backlog and go from there. (As this gets moveing I can expand from the initial 50 or so into however many we need.</li>
<li><b>Catch</b>---We have to keep our categories very broad, needed for any robotic assistance (start with a category for each portal) you know...science, math, ect. (we could end up with 20 effective categories.)...As long as we keep our scheme simple the bot will be able to do this very easily.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Second idea regarding auto categorization...Agian with generic categories. Useing this idea the bot will look thought the WHOLE article for keywords...Than the bot will put the article into the appropriate category based on this.</p>
<ul>
<li>This I think was what you thought I was thinking....when you posted about having a high margen of error....I mention this only to contrast with my, (i think, better) idea above.</li>
<li>Lots of cons, few pros... The idea above is far better...and easier to program:-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest at a minimum put the 1st idea up on WP:CU or equivalent location. (that way when we come up with a categorization scheme....) we can make sure that the bot can match up correctly the infomation.!!!!! Please get on this idea....I have put much thought and effort into it...:-).<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 16:22, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>NOTE IF AUTOMATED CATEGORIZATION IS TO BE POSSIBLE...we must make sure that the categories are "bot friendly" look at my first proposal for Ideas...Bassically keep the categories broad, and the rest the bot can do with out one human eyeball!!!!</p>
<p>At minimum...at least comment on the above.</p>

<p>I think the NINWIKI needs to be increased from 00.1% to something like <strike>00.5%</strike> <b>1%</b>. In other words instead of putting wikifiy on articles if fewer than 1 out of 1000 words are wikified, I suggest that it be upped to 1 out of <strike>200</strike> 100 words.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the programmer all I can do is ask you to trust me on this...You know by now that I won't indiscrimminatly harm wikipedia. The increased limit is because of a pattern that my program has detected...(the program actually recomends 1.34%).</li>
<li>I put in about 50 lines of code to analyze what the bot is seeing... so we can optimize its preformece faster.</li>

<p>I am not confident on replacing cleanup with cleanup list based on Gnome bot's test run(I did no edits).</p>
<p>Here are the problems.</p>
<p>1)large articles will be classified as lists</p>
<ul>
<li>some articles have 2500 words or more and have 32 bulletpoints. Based on our system, the bot will quietly make it a list...something it is not.
<ul>
<li>Solution #1, make it a percentage of bullet points, &lt;bullet points&gt; /(divided by) &lt;number of words&gt;.</li>
<li>Solution #2, compare the number of links to the number of bullet points. If the ratio is above a certian number than classify as list.</li>
<li>Solution #3, Has not been thought up yet, thats your job!!:-)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Untill we get this problem fixed, when the bot runs it will generate a list of what articles it made into lists based on this criteria</b> <i>Of course we will phase out the list as time goes by, and I don't find any more flaws.</i></p>

<p>The way the code is set up now, the bot will look and see...ohh not enough words. that makes it a stub. Then it will look and see, ohh not enough links, that makes it fit in wikify. Then it will look at the title of the article, ohh it has list, that makes it a cleanup-list. Then....and so on.</p>
<p>Sorry about the messy entrence there, but we need to pick witch of our criteria should be checked for first. If one criteria is true, the bot needs to do it, and then stop, save the article, and move on.</p>
<p>give me ideas. like this...hypothetical only</p>
<p>1)check and see if {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}} is in the article. (than we change it to disambig list and leave the rest be)</p>
<p>2)check and see if it has list in title. (pretty much a list can only be a list)</p>

<p>Ok here we go. Generally the more big words that are in an article, the more complex that peice of writing is. Alot of technical jargon involves useing big words. These are the cases where here at wikipedia we request an expert look at it.</p>
<p>Here is what I suggest.</p>
<p>NOTE: &lt;avg word size&gt; = &lt;length of article&gt; /(divided by) &lt;Number of words in the article&gt;</p>
<p><b>If</b> &lt;avg word size &gt; &lt;X&gt; <b>Than</b> replace {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} with {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}}</p>
<ul>
<li>X can be equal to any number, it represents the number of letters in a word. ( I would suggest something like 6 or 7) I will make up a test list to show you exactly what this will do.</li>

<p>This list only shows the logic behind Gnome bot.</p>
<p>When the bot runs It will do the first thing that is in italics. (The others just indicate that the article fits some of the other critiria as well.

<p>I would post this...It was looking good earlier, but now, parden my language I can't squash this damn bug.

<p>I fixed the bug...here is a look at what the bot detects, I was bored and wanted to see if my code worked right(a good thing) so I went crazy and triggered as many of the <b>if</b> <b>than</b> statements as I could. The bots output here looks like nonsense because I intended to see that the bot could trigger correctly each of the conditions.

<p>I am taking a break from wikipedia... this is due to misunderstanding between me and some admins(who will remian unamamed). Adimins when I return I hope that you look at the <b><a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a></b>, especially in regards to my mistake on some of the criteria with User:Gnome (Bot). The bot was blocked 30 minutes after it stoped operating...(that was ok), and than agian a full 24 hours after the first block(while the bot was still blocked) for continuing to run the bot...The problem is that my bot could NOT have done any more edits as it was already blocked. But yet on the admin's notice board NONE of the admins choose to look at the situation. (or the links to pages contianing discussions supporting Gnome bot. <b>IN ESSENCE I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE A VANDAL</b>. <i>I have never knowingly wandalized a page in my life!!!, and as soon as I realized there was a problem with the bot I stopped it and reprogrammed it...When I return, I may try and run it agian...or I may not...depends on how much I feel like putting up with admins</i></p>
<p><b>I was blocked with no understandable reason.</b>...Twice in fact... as if the first was not enough (NOOO we had to throw fuel in the fire. <b>THANKS ADMINS, NICE TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE WATCHING OUT FOR US "NORMAL" USERS)</b></p>
<p>NOTE::I spent an hour on IRC trying to get admins to realize that I wanted to do good and make a comprimise....I finally found a few people who were willing to discuss... But It is rediculous that I had to "prove" mulitple times that I was working in good faith.</p>
<p>Please parden me for my rant above...These feelings I have toward ADMINS are not helping the encyclopedia...Thus rather than going crazy and denouncing admins in general or going around and making <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTs</a>, I am going to take a vacation.

<p>I think Eagle 101 is taking this way too seriously. There is a very strong disagreement about how the Gnome bot is acting in its removal of cleanup tags and replacing them with stub tags. This is something that should not be done with a bot, because usually the cleanup is grammatical, tone, wikification in nature and not the length of the article. If you can remove the cleanup -&gt; stub language from the bot, there's no reason to keep it blocked, but that behavior was very unnerving, to say the least. Nobody has botophobia, it's what the bot is doing, not that it's a bot itself, that people had problems with. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:19, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
