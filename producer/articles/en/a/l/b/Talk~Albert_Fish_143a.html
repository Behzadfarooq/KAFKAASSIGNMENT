<p>I spent ages reformatting this page so that it would flow better. Then some idiot went and changed it again, but still using most of my work - yet still managed to make it as disorganised as before. THIS PAGE IS NOT CRONOLOGICAL, NOR DOES IT FLOW PROPERLY</p>
<p>Plus, Fish has been proven to be the Brooklyn vampire. And whatever fool thinks there were 5 victims of the vampire is sorely mistaken - there were only four. Stop changing what is correct and good for the article.</p>
<p>I shall make my changes in due time. --<a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaylor182_6629.html" title="User:Naylor182">Naylor182</a> 12:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know anything about the Brooklyn Vampire, I haven't seen any references in the newspaper archives.</p>
<p>There is at least one other person that was killing children in New York City during the same years, Peter Kudzinowski and he was a suspect in the Gaffney murder. Fish confessed to three murders and was convicted for one. He said he stabbed two others starting in 1910.</p>
<p>King had at least three other people who were suspects in the Budd murder and two were arrested, and one stood trial and was found innocent.</p>
<p>References to primary and secondary sources are much more accurate than tertiary sources. Crime library has the best written tertiary source that doesn't make sensationalist claims, the New York Times and the Washington Post coverage is the most dispassionate, and never mentions the Brooklyn Vampire at all. They use the "gray man" and "wusteria murder" and "wusteria werewolf". I have downloaded 16 articles on the murders and the trial. King had many theories that turned out to be completely wrong, and any theories should be attributed to their sources, and should NOT be presented as fact. Fish also told many stories, some backed by facts and by witnesses, others that didn't fit the forensic evidence. Please always cite sources and attribute info to that source whenever you can.<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid: Fish raped over 100 children.</li>
<li>Better: Fish told his psychiatrist that he had raped over 100 children.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid: Fish was the Brooklyn Vampire.</li>
<li>Better: Detective King believed Fish to be responsible for the killings of several children in New York City that were never solved.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Each time the phrase is put in context so the reader can judge the value and reliability of the sources. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 19:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The spelling of the word stayed is, in fact, "staid" in the original letter.

<p>For future reference, Albert Fish was not the inspiration for Hannibal Lecter.</p>
<p>Here is an exercept from CrimeLibrary.com refering to Harris' inspiration "...that Harris once told a librarian in his home town, Cleveland, Mississippi, that Lecter was inspired by a murderer named William Coyne, who had escaped from prison in 1934 and gone on a rampage in Cleveland that included acts of murder and cannibalism. Coyne’s exploits were the stuff of local legend when Harris was growing up and might have planted the seed for Lecter in the author’s mind."</p>

<p>From my superficial knowledge of the case, it would seem that Fish was a masochist who abducted and murdered a number of children. He also claimed to have eaten them, and probably claimed to have killed a larger number and tortured more still. The body of Grace Budd as recovered, but which other disappearences were linked to him by physical evidence? A number of witnesses in child disappearences, or attempted abductions, identified him, which ones? Do we definately know he killed 15 children? Do we definately know he was a cannibal?

<p>I've quickly re-read the CrimeLibrary linked article, and fixed up a few things in our article which differ (6 children not 5, Edward budd advertised, not Fish.) I've removed some of the claims that don't seem substantiated, many of the rest are founded on Fish's testimony alone. However we don't mention Billy Gaffney of any of the other victims, nor the strange trial.

What do we know for certain about this case? Should we request expert attention?.</p>

<p>Though a convinced <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a>, I am still inclined to respond <b>amen, brother</b> to the above comment.

<p>On another note, take a look at Sagawa's wikipedia entry talk page for some compelling arguments on the removal of lurid descriptions of cannibalism from wikipedia. How is posting Albert Fish's description of cannibalising a little girl any different to detailing acts of pedophilia on the relevant wp entry?

<p>His last words are said to have been "I don't know why I'm here". It was reported that the first jolt of electricity did not kill him, and that a second jolt was needed.

<p>I am not a lawyer but with "King was not allowed to bring the murders up as evidence in the trial because the District Attorney wanted Fish to be found sane, and given the death sentence" I don't think hearsay evidence and speculation can be brought up in court to prejudice a jury. Fish was never formally charged with the crimes, even if they never went to trial, if there was strong evidence, they would have formally charged him. Suspicions by an investigator can't be brought up in court.</p>
<p>"The modus operandi of the vampire was to lure little girls into a basement, flog them, then garrote them with a rope." Gaffney was killed in a garbage dump, and Francis X. McDonnell was found strangled in the woods with his own suspenders. Neither were in basements. Two of the victims were boys, and one girl was age 16, a teenager.

<p>A lot of the Fish stories come from his interviews to be declared insane. He told stories of molesting hundreds of children, but could only provide details, and confessed to three of them according to the New York Times. Most stories never matched up with his timeline of travel except the three he confessed to, and the one where he was painting a house in the same area.</p>
<p>I want to move the Vampire stories down to the section on "potential victims" since he was never charged with the murders or confessed to them, other than Gaffney and McDowell and the two or three stabbings from 1910-1920, where it isn't clear from the sources if they died. There are lots of websites claiming more victims. And police like to take all unidentified killings and attribute them to current convicted killers to clear up the caseload. Murders should be attributed to him if 1) he confessed 2) or, there is forensic evidence linking him 3) or, he is found guilty in court. Suspicions should be placed under the proper header.</p>

<p>"When and where Fish first became a murderer is unknown. He confessed to six killing and referred vaguely to dozens more, although the victims, dates and places were lost to his hazy memory. He did confess to murdering a man in Wilmington, Delaware; mutilating and torturing to death a mentally retarded boy in New York in 1910; killing a Negro boy in Washington also in 1919; molesting and killing four year-old William Gaffney in 1929; and strangling to death five year-old Francis McDonnell on Long Island in 1934. The most sensational murder carried out by Fish was the abduction and horrific slaughter of Grace Budd in 1928. Her abduction led to a man hunt that lasted for six years. The police have given up hope of ever solving her mysterious disappearance until a slender clue, gleaned from an anonymous letter sent to the girl's parents, led detectives to Albert Fish." <a href="http://www.prairieghosts.com/fish.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prairieghosts.com/fish.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>"Albert Fish (15) Meet the patron saint of sadomasochism. Albert Fish, the granddaddy of the deranged, enjoyed implanting needles in his genitalia, stuffing his asshole with flaming alcohol balls, eating shit, killing children and making stews out of their remains. The father of six, Albert lost it after his wife left him for another man. Despondent Al asked his kids to beat him with a nail-studded paddle until he bled. He thought that he was Christ and that God had ordered him to castrate boys. Good Al did was he was told, and enjoyed it thoroughly.

<p>I was going to fail this article as GA candidate, but ironically, another editor promoted it while I was writing up my concerns. Although the article is in pretty good shape, I believe it fails the GA criteria on a couple of points. These need to be addressed if the article is to remain categorized as a good article.</p>
<p>1. The article isn't that well organized. Some events are presented chronologically, but others are out of order, and the biography is broken down into too many sections.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The events are written in the timeline of his capture, earlier murders are only confessed to at a later date. Thats how Crime Library handles the timeline, and the book on him. Both present the information in the order of their discovery, not in real time. Thats because the information wasnt determined until his confession.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. Apart from the biography, there is little well-organized information. In particular, the trivia section bugs me -- some of those entries seem utterly unimportant, while more important ones are missing (wasn't Fish, along with <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Gein_9bdd.html" title="Ed Gein">Ed Gein</a>, the model for <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannibal_Lecter_7e1d.html" title="Hannibal Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a>)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No! Harris has never divulged any influences for creating Lecter, all is speculation.
<dl>
<dd>Still, perhaps notable speculation? (Especially if it can be said definitively that Harris has not divulged his influences.)</dd>
<dd>I don't think an encyclopedic article should have speculation.</dd>

I don't like the use of so many extensive quotes. The letter Fish sent to Budd's mother is worth including, perhaps, but the other quotes seem excessive.</p>
<dl>
<dd>All removed</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. I'm a bit concerned about the images in this article -- they don't have a clear source (IMO, probably copied from crimelibrary, where I saw them before). I'm not sure the images are copyrighted, but I'm not sure they're free, and the ones that are tagged as copyrighted now don't really have fair use rationales, which they should. (This alone would not cause me much concern, but it's worth bringing up.) The 1903 image is PD, the mugshot falls under mugshot fair use, and the grace budd image is in dozens of books and also in the Corbis archive as origin unknown, it was released when she went missing by the police.</p>
<p>Good luck on improving it, I think it's a worthy topic and a good start.

<dd>Ok, no one's been addressing these issues, so I've delisted the article. Feel free to renominate if the issues are addressed.

<p>This article was a former GA article so there shouldn't be too many problems. Here's some of the suggestions I have before I'll return it to GA.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> Very good but fix the redirects, add wikilinks, and fix the sentences listed below.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Fix redirects for: child molester, Washington, District of Columbia (also in the infobox), death penalty, religious mania, heart attack, Washington, DC, homosexual, prostitute, St. John, San Francisco, Brooklyn, New York, boogey man, psychiatrists, urophilia, masochism, Frederic Wertham, death sentence, Far Rockaway, Queens, Frederic Wertham, sadism and masochism, genitals, &amp; sado-masochism.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
: is this Wikipedia policy or a personal obsession? I can see if the redirect is a mispelling such as the link to Wertham, but changing valid synonyms to match exact article titles seems unusual. What purpose does it serve? Can you quote the exact policy?
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Wikilink of further explain the following: orphanage, erection, brothel, porter, fully wikilink the Equitable Life Assurance Company while avoiding the redirect, &amp; trolley.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:linked
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The intro paragraph has to many "He"s at the beginning of the sentences, try varying it up more, such as "authorities stated that he..."</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:fixed
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Remove some of the phrasing throughout the article of "he said", since sources are mainly used, not just his personal accounts. Examples: "By 1890, Albert had arrived in New York City, and he said he became a male prostitute." &amp; "He said he had been named after Hamilton Fish, a distant relative."</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:It is written this way because there is sometimes a big gap between what he said and verifiable facts. Sourcing it to a book will not distinguish it for the reader whether <i>he said it</i> or it is a verifiable fact. For instance he said he molested 100 children, but that doesn't fit into the known facts and timeline. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 05:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>After semicolon, remove capital F: "Following this rejection, Fish began to hear voices; For example, he once wrapped himself up in a carpet,"</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:fixed
</pre>
<ul>
<li>In the last two paragraphs of his early life, the years are out of sequence, correct them so they are in a proper timeline.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:fixed
</pre>
<ul>
<li>If you can, further explain his attack on Thomas Bedden. How did he attack him? Was he injured/killed?</li>
</ul>
<pre>
: nothing more is known
</pre>
<ul>
<li>In the Billy Gaffney section, the first statement has "with with" in it, fix that.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:fixed
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Combine some of these sentences or add more detail as it appears too choppy: "Billy's parents were Elizabeth and Edward Gaffney. Elizabeth visited Fish in Sing Sing to try and get more details of her son's death.[16] Fish confessed to the murder."</li>
</ul>
<pre>
:fixed
</pre>
<ul>
<li>"After being sentenced Fish confessed to the murder of eight-year-old Francis X. McDonnell, killed on Staten Island." change to "who was killed on Staten Island"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> It appears that there are a lot of sources and inline citations, which is good. If possible, you should add some inline citations to the Paraphilias section.</dd>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> Covers all aspects of his life and crimes, good job here.</dd>
<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> Appears NPOV, make sure it stays that way.</dd>
<dd><b>5. Stability?:</b> Don't see any problems, nor foresee any in the future.</dd>
<dd><b>6. Images?:</b> Good source of images, but either add a fair use rationale to <a href="../../../f/i/s/Image%7EFish9.jpg_239d.html" title="Image:Fish9.jpg">Image:Fish9.jpg</a> or change the license (if it's over a hundred years old, use the other license in the first image). Expand on the fair use rationales for the other images if they need them. Three words isn't enough to cover it. Look to similar articles of GA/FA status for examples.</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
:fixed
</pre>
<p>Overall, this article will easily return to GA once the above suggetions are fixed. I'll give you up to seven days to fix them, where I will then either pass or fail the article. Let me know on my talk page when you finish fixing these or if you have any questions.

<dd>You can probably add some of the Paraphilias section back into the article if the image supports the information. Don't include anything that is not sourced. Also, break up the headings so the majority of the article doesn't fall under biography. Perhaps don't use biography as a heading, just go straight into early life, and include the early attacks and victims under a single heading that you decide on. You could also split up the trial and execution into a single heading if possible. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 20:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
