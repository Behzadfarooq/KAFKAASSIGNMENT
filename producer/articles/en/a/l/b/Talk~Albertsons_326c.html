<p>I just reworked the article to give more detail and prominence to the pending acquisition. Once the sale is complete, the article will need to be redone to reflect its transition from company to brand. Unless someone else finds or creates an infobox for brands, it looks like the infobox will need to be replaced in favor of a simple image of the brand's logo. 66.167.252.117 09:58, 5 March 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>There appears to be a slow edit war on this article over various details. I don't like seeing insertions of apparently factual data removed with a simple edit summary of "rv" and without discussion on the talk page. Can we please have some discussion of this situation instead of these continual reversions?

<p>Hopefully I have not violated the rules by correcting an Albertsons item regarding "check out while you go" - under Technology. My apologies if I have. Albertsons installed a series of "check out while you go" lines in their San Francisco store at Petrini Plaza about two years ago. To this day, it is a gamble whether check out is actually faster if you do the work yourself, or simply go through regular check out lines. The "check out while you go" lines have to be watched by employee checkers to help customers with problems. Problems range from improper bar codes, unreadable bar codes, bar codes that do not reflect price specials, and the many difficulties customers have using a computer system with which they are not familiar. Problems can bring the line to a dead halt. No doubt this enables Albertsons to reduce the number of employees, but it does not increase customer satisfaction with the store.</p>

<p>It appears that Wikipedia user Caldorwards4 is manipulating the facts of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertsons.html" title="Albertsons">Albertsons</a> familiy of companies by deleting factual edits. Further, by deleting these factual edits, user Caldorwards4 distorts factual and relevant information in an attempt to manipulate the share price of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertsons.html" title="Albertsons">Albertsons</a> (ABS) and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervalu.html" title="Supervalu">Supervalu</a> (SVU) stock by removing factual and current information about the company. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commisssion (SEC) becomes involved when individuals tamper and remove correct information about a publicly-traded company and/or companies for personal gain. It appears Caldorwards4 actions by removing factual information about Albertsons is an attempt to mislead the Wikipedia users by removing correct information about the company in order to manipulate the share price. Since Wikipedia is public, buyers of Albertsons stock may be less inclined or even stop from purchasing any shares in the company beacuse of the false information.</p>
<p>User Caldorwards4 also falsely posts that Lucky is a current operating division of Albertsons. All Lucky locations were converted to Albertsons in November 1999 and the Lucky name was retired. In April 2006, Albertsons elected to bring back the use of the Lucky name by way of newspaper advertisements that appeared throughout the Northern California Division and at the www.albertsons.com home page. However, Albertsons does not operate ANY locations that use the name Lucky.</p>
<p>Other false information removed by user Caldorwards4 concerns current operating companies owned and operated by Albertsons.</p>
<p>Jewel Food Stores and Jewel Express fuel centers. Jewel has operated free-standing Jewel Food Stores for several decades and they continue to operate today under the "Jewel" name and not as "Jewel-Osco". Jewel Express are fuel centers that reside in the out lot of a Jewel-Osco location.</p>
<p>Lazy Acres was recently acquired by Albertsons and continues to operate under the Lazy Acres banner.</p>
<p>County Line Liquor are free-standing liquor stores adjacent to Albertsons. These stores have operated for many years and continue in business today, owned and operated by Albertsons.</p>
<p>Grocery Warehouse and Max Foods are also owned and operated by Albertsons and each of those named stores continues in operation.</p>

<p>While the company's logo does not use an apostrophe (e.g., Albertsons), note that the company's actual name does include it (e.g., Albertson's). Press releases, finacial documents, etc. show an apostrophe. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClipper471_09f9.html" title="User:Clipper471">Clipper471</a> 03:07, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Clipper47 is correct. In official documents (SEC filings, etc.) it is spelled with the apostrophe. see: <a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/3333/000095012306006636/l20440ae8vk.htm" class="external free" title="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/3333/000095012306006636/l20440ae8vk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/3333/000095012306006636/l20440ae8vk.htm</a> It looks like they do Albertson's, Inc. / Albertsons. Of course, there is a strong possibility that within a couple weeks, it is not going to matter... There will no longer be an Albertson's, Inc., just Albertsons as a service/trade mark. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVik-Thor_5caa.html" title="User:Vik-Thor">VikÞor</a> [[User talk:Vik-Thor|Talk]] 04:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It does seem that the holding company uses the apostrophe, while the trademark does not... <a href="http://www.albertsons.com/abs_news/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertsons.com/abs_news/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClipper471_09f9.html" title="User:Clipper471">Clipper471</a> 14:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When using "Inc." the name should have an apostrophe. Caldorwards recently added "Inc." to the companyname in the infobox, thus, an apostrophe now needs to be added to "Albertsons" <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClipper471_09f9.html" title="User:Clipper471">Clipper471</a> 02:51, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I notice their generic store products also use "Albertson's" with the apostrophe. Another company, Macy's, uses an asterisk in place of the apostrophe for marketing purposes as well. Most media use the apostrophe in their reports as well. A Google News search turned up 1010 hits of Albertson's, while there are 829 hits of Albertsons. I think instances of Albertsons in this article should be edited with an apostrophe, and the page be moved to Albertson's, as was attempted in November 2005. References to Albertson's in the article were edited in April 2004. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClipper471_09f9.html" title="User:Clipper471">Clipper471</a> 00:37, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have changed the headquarters location back to Eden Priairie, Minn. as this is where all senior executives of what was Albertsons are now based. The highest ranking exceutive who is responsible for the Supervalu Support Campus in Boise is Duncan Mac Naughton, Executive Vice-President of Merchandising &amp; Marketing.

<p>Is <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertsons_LLC_1081.html" title="Albertsons LLC">Albertsons LLC</a> a separate company? I'm confused by the two articles. --<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalaxiaad_9067.html" title="User:Galaxiaad">Galaxiaad</a> 05:33, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes they are two separate companies <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertsons%2C_Inc._e777.html" title="Albertsons, Inc.">Albertsons, Inc.</a> is owned by <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervalu_Inc._bda1.html" title="Supervalu Inc.">supervalu Inc.</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertsons_LLC_1081.html" title="Albertsons LLC">Albertsons LLC</a> is owned by <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerberus_Capital_Management_2916.html" title="Cerberus Capital Management">Cerberus Group</a>.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicheal21_a9b4.html" title="User:Micheal21">Micheal21</a> 19:03, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm seeing an apparent contradiction between this article and the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> article. I suspect what's going on here is that some information is more up-to-date than other information. (Some of the discussion here seems to indicate there have been significant changes.) Nonetheless, there is no direct clarification in the article, and there probably should be, because it's confusing. Here is what I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Albertson's, according to this article, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Supervalu.</li>
<li>Albertson's has a Fortune 500 ranking of 47.</li>
<li>Supervalu has a Fortune 500 ranking of 113.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those are all true at the same time, something very weird is going on. Normally a company can't have a smaller gross revenue than its wholly owned subsidiary. Maybe this will resolve itself when the 2007 Fortune rankings come out, but meanwhile it's very confusing, and perhaps something should be done meanwhile to clarify what is going on, e.g., if the link in the Fortune 500 article was meant to point to an article on the larger pre-January-2006 company, perhaps some note should be made in that article to the effect that the company in question no longer exists as such. As it stands, the implication is that the Albertson's that is the subject of this article is a Fortune 50 corp and much larger than Supervalu, but that makes no sense if it's a subsidiary of Supervalu. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a>, 2006 Dec 15.</p>
