<p><i>Many ethnic Albanians also live in the bordering countries of Serbia and Montenegro (around 1,850,000; of that, around 1,800,000 in Serbia, around 1,700,000 in its province called Kosovo and around 50,000 in Montenegro) and the Republic of Macedonia (around 500,000) although a lot of Albanians believe that the number might be higher. Also a small number of ethnic Albanians live in Greece which are called Çam or Cham. Claims over Çam numbers have ranged from 20,000 to over 200,000 but are believed to be understated because Athens has not considered the local Albanians to be a separate ethnic group.</i></p>
<p>Without prejudice to the validity of the information above, it seems to be irrelevant, because the article is about Albania (the country) rather than the Albanian people in general. I therefore propose moving the extract to some more appropriate entry. Doing so would produce a more focussed text, similar to the ones about the demographics of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Conversely, if the information remains as is, it might be argued that the article promotes irredentist ideology by blurring the distinction between country and nation. For all the reasons above I plan to remove those sentences on May 21st, unless there are any convincing counter-arguments. I would appreciate any suggestions as to where this information might be more usefully presented. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheArchon_13e5.html" title="User:TheArchon">TheArchon</a> 11:31, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So what ever happened to that? The article on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a> seems like a well-developed article, and a good place for the information you think should be deleted/moved (if it's not already there). I was only going to make a note on this talk page about the Çam, since a people who used to live in Greece would seem to have nothing to do with the current demographics of Albania, but you rightly point out that neither does anyone else not living in Albania.--<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a> 06:03, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would go along with that- this section belongs elsewhere as it's not strictly about the people within Albania. I think this is covered already in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a> article. Has anybody got a good argument for retaining it, or is there anywhere else it might better fit? Otherwise I agree with the previous two users that this should be removed.<a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagubov_1181.html" title="User:Zagubov">Zagubov</a> 10:19, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I got rid of the Çam bit. I didn't get rid of the Serbia/Greece/etc. part (not bold enough?) but it's not too long to be distracting.

<p>I am curious to read from what sources the history part is written.Especially the one stating that the Albanian fascists helped the Italians against the Greek and after helped the Germans (against who?) and no mention of the Albanians having faught against the Turks for the independence of Greece or for liberating Yugoslavia . I hided a part of it but it is still there. Nervi modest 19:58, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems to me that the history section in this article should be a bit longer to get the information a bit more specific and accurate. For instance, as to the World War II, Italian occupation is mentioned but the German occupation isn't, and this tends to imply that there was no other occupation. Or from the first paragraph you get the impression that there never was any Albanian rule betweem Ancient times and 1912, but what about Scanderbeg?.</p>

<p>I am just wondering whether this would make the article too long. But them maybe the list of districts and the list of holidays could be moved to another place.</p>
<p>And I also think that the most important (or all) cities should be mentioned right in the article because they are of primary interest, not the districts. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 19:24, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I put the holiday table in there because it seemed to be part of a template (lots of countries have it), so I would let that stay on the main page. I have also seen Districts/Counties/Whatever on the front page. There is a link to the cities so I don't think that is much of an issue. I just want it to be consistent with the other country pages. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 23:07, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point. I checked some other country articles. Many of them contain the holidays section, some don't. The article about the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> has it in the article <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_States_a6a3.html" title="Culture of the United States">Culture of the United States</a>. It is certainly useful but it need not be in the main article. Anyway, this is not that important, and the template is not that uniform. Besides, the article about United Kingdom does not list the administrative divisions lower than countries and has instead separate articles for the lists. So there are options here too. (In the case of the United States the list of States is natural. But this does not mean that an equivalent of it is as natural for every other country. My point is only that if we find it better, we can modify the "template".</dd>

<dd>It's true that we cannot deviate much from the overall conventions of country articles but we can question the conventions and suggest changes. There are things that strike me as really strange. The amount of information about history and geography is reduced to nearly nil, and long detailed tables are longer than those fundamental topics. Of course, this is just my personal opinion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 19:52, 24 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

Dori, Andres, you might want to take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countries_3570.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries">WikiProject Countries</a>. The template, which we try to apply to all countries is specified there. The length of the individual sections is not exactly determined, but it shouldn't be more than, say, two or three paragraphs. Looking at the Albania article, especially politics and geography could use some more information. If there are inaccuracies in the other texts: go ahead and edit them of course. But when you have to go into too much detail, just edit the subarticles.</p>
<p>All that is just for your consideration of course, you can just "be bold". <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a> 06:51, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the Ottoman Rule part it says that Albanians managed to keep their culture and religion.

<p>Response to the above comment. Hmm, let me think. So the Albanians fought tooth and nail against the Ottoman Turks in the middle ages only to "peacefully" convert later into the muslim faith??? Actually Albanians converted gradually, and every conversion was forced either physically or economically. It always happened after a war. After Skanderbeg died, after the Turkish-Russo war, etc. JohnStovec--Johnstovec 00:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Albanians were forced to become muslims by turks. Stop with this muslim propaganda!</p>

<p>The word Albania in albanian "Shqiperia" means the land of the eagle which is also realated to the flag which is a two headed eagle.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It could be I suppose. I guess it's an eagle or the egg problem&#160;:) Did the word shqipe first signify the language or the bird? The most used version is the one about the eagle (as enhanced by the flag), so that is what I used. Also, before being called Shqipëria, Albania was called Arbëria (tosk) or Arbënia (gheg) and Albanians were called Arbër (note the Albanians that migrated to southern Italy call themselved Arbëresh<a href="http://www.arberia.it/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arberia.it/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I would guess the word for the eagle existed before the name change, which is why the first explanation is more likely in my opinion. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 14:59, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Scientific etymologies, as a rule, are hypotheses, though of different degrees of probability. And as to the folk etymologies, there is no question of truth. It's a fact that for modern Albanians, <i>Shqipëria</i> means 'The Land of Eagles'. But that does not mean that the word <i>sghiptar</i> (which I think is older than the name of the land) is etymologically related to the name of the bird. I think that probably both originally existed apart, and then became to be associated.</dd>

<dd>Now, the problem is that when we say what <i>Shqipëria</i> means then this is ambiguous between the etymological meaning and the cultural meaning for modern Albanians. For instance, I would take it for the etymological meaning if I were ignorant of the problem.</dd>

<dd>I am not sure I understand what you are saying. Are you saying that the name of the bird and the name of the language just happened to be the same and they were not derived from the same word? I would think that the most likely answer is that the name for the bird came from some language (Albanian or otherwise), Albanians came to be associated with the bird (maybe the name of some tribe), and then the language was subsequently associated with the bird. I don't know the technical words as this no where near my field of expertise, but logically it makes sense to me. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 17:23, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I mean that originally the words <i>shqiptar</i> and others just happened to have the same sound as the word for the eagle, and later on Albanians "found a hidden meaning" in this similarity. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 22:30, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The authors of the Albanian history volume that I have seem to believe that the name probably derived from the adverb <i>shqip</i> which means to speak clearly, openly, bluntly and predating all other forms, and that the change in the name happened around the end of the 18th century. No mention is made of the word for eagle. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 18:37, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it has. The state emblem I believe is a bit similar, but I have not seen the image posted anywhere.

<dd>The site is not coming up for me right now, but I know that it is the ministry of information. Does it specifically say that it is the coat of arms and not some other emblem? The reason I asked for the site and copyright is that the Albanian law is even more strict than the American or European ones (that's the impression I have gotten). Also, most gov't sites of Albania reserve all the rights to all their material (using <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021023075947/mininf.gov.al/shqip/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20021023075947/mininf.gov.al/shqip/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I see that it says "Copyright (c) 2002 - Keshilli i Ministrave i Republikes se Shqiperise - Departamenti i Informacionit"). I think if the material is used in a court case or something similar it becomes public domain, but I am not sure.

<dd>That is interesting how the skanderbeg crown is in the shield and not on top of it from the other government site. It seems we have a mystery on our hands! I do know that I have seen some variation on the theme. I thought I read somewhere on wikipedia that government emblems were public domain, as with the information for countries from that CIA online source. Also, I have seen the crowned shield on recent Albanian paper money, 1,000 Leke from about 10 years ago, with swords too. <a href="../../../s/c/y/User%7EScythian99_a08a.html" title="User:Scythian99">Scythian99</a></dd>

At the top of the shield, in gold color, is the helmet of Skanderbeg (1)." So maybe the Skanderbeg crown is on the arms and not on top?

<dd>Coat of arms is taken from heraldry since it started as individuals or families having coat of arms. Many state emblems have their roots in heraldry and use the rules of heraldry in their creation. Coat of arms and state emblem are often used interchangeably although some country's coats of arms aren't really coat of arms. What do you think of my addition of the crown on your shield. Maybe you can do a better job? &#160;:) <a href="../../../s/c/y/User%7EScythian99_a08a.html" title="User:Scythian99">Scythian99</a> | <a href="../../../s/c/y/User_talk%7EScythian99_dff3.html" title="User talk:Scythian99">Talk</a></dd>

Albanians are the oldest people in Balkans. Albanians are descent to Illyrians theirfore to the Pellasgians. Illyrian tribes are mentioned in Homeros poems.

<p>bla bla bla you know nothing about the history, there are many evidences about pelasgic origine of Albanian and the old "Greeks" which actually have the same origin , if you are interested you must know that with the Albanian language Nermin Vlora transleted with to day Albanian language 5000 old pelasgic transcript found in Greece, Aristidh Kola ( is in greek transleted)says that we have to protect Albanian language because is the language of Gods and heroes of Greece , he many other scholars explains the pelasgic origin of Albanian and the Albanian language as the base of other Europian Languages English included, and this my friend it is not nationalism but the truth which of course doesn't suite to some like you .

<p>"The name of Albania prior to the Turkish invasion was "Arbëria," the Albanian dialect Gheg became involved and later became Arbania, for example the Tosk word for voice is Zëri and the Gheg word for voice is Zani, anyway it became later changed to Albania. The Arbëresh community who live in Italy still speak the old style of Albanian and still call their homeland Arbëria."</p>
<p><br />
I think this part of the section on the 'Origin and history of the name' Albania needs to be deleted or at least revised, because there's no historical evidence that coroborates this theory, at least not in the 'External Links' section of the article.</p>
<p>Also, if Arbëria really was the name of Albania before the Turkish invasion, then why did it change to Shqiperia? And what were they called before being called Shqiptar? I think these are important questions that need to be addressed by this article.</p>
<p>Well, I can answer to all of your question but have become bored after discussing this with many.

<p>I know Enver Hoxha had many alleged problems with Human Rights, but I might also note that the economy of Albania was socialist. Unemployment, poverty, and starvation were illiminated. Hoxha didn't severe relations with the USSR for "his own interest", he did because the USSR went back to capitalism in his opinioin. It seems some of this is just stating what has been said about Hoxha, but a lot of it seems to be corporate/capitalist propaganda. I offically dispute the nuetrality of this article....</p>
<p>This in not propaganda. Hoxha tried to assert maximum control over its citizens by having them on a short leash. If thousands of unjustifiably dead are not human rights violations, I don't know what is.</p>

<p>Dear Jsone,</p>
<p>U wrote: "Well genetic research shows common blood within Greeks and Albanians." Did u notice that the populations of the samples where too small? What if the most of the "Albanian sample" was from southern Albania (our northern Epirus)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sample comes from Albanians, whether from southern or northern Albania. And most likely the samples were taken from the state capitol, Tirana. Where there is the heaviest concentration of Albs. <a href="../../../t/p/i/User%7ETpilkati_7168.html" title="User:Tpilkati">Tpilkati</a> 06:17, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-There is the big Greek minority of Albania!- Moreover there are olso Greek Orthodox Albs so mixed with Greeks that u cant say if they are Albs or not! Like Gegides.Albs live there about 9 centuries, we have come together anyway.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There it stated Albanians, not Greeks. If the people were Greeks, then they would not be tested.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your second statement is a wrongful assumption, the "inter-mixing" process has not occured until some small times during communism, which failed. And Northern Epirus is only a small part of Albania on top of that it is not too concentrated and difficult to access. <a href="../../../t/p/i/User%7ETpilkati_7168.html" title="User:Tpilkati">Tpilkati</a> 06:17, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For excample for Albanians where only 51 people and for the Hellenes only 76!! I believe that the numbers are not big enought to proove any serius theory..</p>

<p>I am patriot, not a nationalist as u said. I am happy that the survey u link, shows that the Greeks have almost all the kinds of polymorfismos in a prety good percent each every one of them!</p>

<p>It is indeed a Serbian propaganda. The first thing you see when you open Albania’s page is that phrase, and then latter on there is talk about how some historians believe that Albanians came from that region. What impression do you think this will have on someone who doesn't know anything about Albania? I don't want to revert it back, but you will have to decide whether you want to remove the reference in the body or this sentence.

If there are any, do they follow the Canon of Lek?(SomeAlbanianDude)</p>

<dd>I've added emphasis to my previous post, apparently needed. Thanks for responding. We would love new, objective and accurate data for the religions of Albania, but we can't accept numbers based on someone going to the country and "seeing how many of them live according to the Quran, Bible, or Torah." If the numbers are your personal estimates, we simply can't accept them. If they are from a reputable source, then we will welcome them, but we need a citation for the source. Meanwhile, if the CIA numbers are all we have, then we (meaning probably I) will have to edit the section to make it clear that these are old estimates and that current, reliable data is not available. --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a> 00:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This sounds like a Hoxha quote: "The religion of Albania is Albanianism," or something like that - not something a democratic government would want around, even if it ever was the national motto. "Free and strong" is more likely to be the right one. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertR_0869.html" title="User:AlbertR">Alr</a> 04:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To come back to the motto: is <i>Free and strong</i> even correct? I could find no reference apart from wikipedia and mirror sites. I don't speak a word of Albanian, but my guess is that the <a href="../../../../sq/s/h/q/Shqip%C3%ABria.html" class="extiw" title="sq:Shqipëria">Albanian Wikipedia</a> says that it doesn't have a motto ("Moto Kombëtare: s´ka").

<p>Current note on language under "Demographics" reads something like "many Albanians are also fluent in English, Greek, Italian". Was changed to "many also speak Italian" which raised the question in my mind: How many Albanians are there who speak a mother language other than Albanian? Surely this is more relevant to Demographics than how many people have studied English in university. Is there a Greek community in Albania, for example? Shouldn't we at a minimum note that some of these languages (certainly English) are second languages learned at school? --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a> 22:31, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no statistics, but I grew up in Albania and my personal impression is that more people speak Italian as a second language than anything else, certainly far more than both English and Greek combined. Even I could understand Italian-language television because my family watched it so much. There is some Greek influence in the south of the country, but I'm not sure to what extent the Greek language is spoken there. As for what's learned at school, I would suppose English would be the most popular, but Turkish is up there as well.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 22:52, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Greek speaking population currently living in Albania is under dispute by both Greeks and Albanians. If such figures are to be added to this article I would suggest that citations from both sides of the argument are included. --Toni78 05:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've always felt there was something amiss with the sections covering the earlier parts of "Albanian" history. And after seeing the repeated creation of links by various IP addresses to <a href="http://unitedalbanian.com/" class="external free" title="http://unitedalbanian.com/" rel="nofollow">http://unitedalbanian.com/</a>, and visiting said website, and noticing identical text, I started to dig into when all that text got added. Well, I found where it got added -- everything covering "Albanian" history prior to Roman rule: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albania&amp;diff=77280701&amp;oldid=77276422" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albania&amp;diff=77280701&amp;oldid=77276422" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You might take a look at the other contributions of this IP address user; rather a mixed bag with regard to usefulness, but obviously strongly nationalistic.</p>
<p>Anyway, the identical text presents a problem. I don't know which way the copying went, but given the fact that it was all added to WP in one chunk, and that unitedalbanian.com has texts on other periods and subjects that do not seem to appear in Wikipedia, I think the copying probably went from UA.com to WP, in which case it could be a copyright violation. (If the copying went from WP to UA, then there should be no links to the UA site in this article, of course). Add to that the question of whether it's really appropriate to talk about Stone Age and Bronze Age man in an article about a modern-day country, and... we have a lot to think about, I guess :-) Any thoughts on these sections? --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a> 06:39, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right now they are a big problem because they are too generic. They belong in a human history article, not an Albanian history article.

<p>There is a question of how/whether we should describe the fact that Albania borders <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, and thus <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>. The three possibilities I'm aware of are: it borders Serbia; it borders Kosovo; and it borders the Serbian province of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Some use the argument that, since we simply say that the U.S. borders Canada, rather than enumerating the provinces it borders (true enough, in a comparable context), that we should do the same with Serbia. However, the reason we don't get so specific/detailed in cases such as the U.S. and Canada or most others is because it is simply not interesting or particularly significant. However, the bordering with Kosovo is very interesting for several reasons. For starters, it is the <i>only</i> province of Serbia that borders Albania. As Kosovo has become very well-known on the world stage, it is very useful to know that this Albanian-majority region is contiguous with Albania. Finally, Serbia at this time does not have administrative control over Kosovo, so effectively there is no contiguity with the geographical region controlled by Belgrade.</p>
<p>To simply say that Albania borders Serbia, then, is to effectively sweep some very encyclopedically important information under the rug, ostensibly in the name of consistency. Consistency does not trump informativeness and usefulness, and neither, I hope, does political sensitivity. --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a> 07:42, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>===Sali Berisha - The First Democratic Albanian Government=== <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sali_Berisha_42e9.html" title="Sali Berisha">Sali Berisha</a> was the first post-communist president elected. He, himself a doctor to the highest ranked communists, had been able to make a great turn and embrace the democracies of the Western world. Accused of setting up pyramid schemes, the comunist-driven gangs of southern Albania rose against him in 1997. 2000 people died in southern Albania that year. In order to avoid bloodshed, Berisha resigned. The democrats, politicaly the succesors of the Communist Party, took power again and held it for 8 years. But Berisha lead another assault against the left. He is now in power and serves as the Prime Minister of Albania</p>

<dl>
<dd>There are some serious flows in the above section about Berisha. It's ambiguous and in many cases not correct and it should not be included in any part of this article. Especially the description of the events in 1997 has misleading statements.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, Berisha did not resign. He was forced out of power. He himself considered the parliament elected after he lost his position as outlaw and a parliament brought to power by force. Indeed he didn't recognize the successive parliament until several years later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, Berisha did not resign to avoid bloodshed during the confrontation of the army and with the "communist-gangs". It is well known that he already gave to the army the order of entering by force in several cities like Vlora etc. in which he had lost control. This would have caused much more bloodshed. The army just refused to do it and deserted. He left the presidential residence only after the institutions he controlled collapsed completely (police, teachers etc. did not go anymore to work, army refused to follow his orders) and he had no kind of protection except a handful bodyguards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Third, it's true that there were gangs organized and directed from the opposition however they were not communist or had no communist ideology leading them and they played a minor role compared to the chaos that resulted from the uncontrolled anger of the population from the collapse of the financial pyramid schemes.</dd>

<p>Do you have any suggetion if not please leave.The articul must define clearly the pelasgic origine of Albanians .There are many evidences about pelasgic origin of Albanian and the old "Greeks" which actually have the same origin , if you are interested you must know that with the Albanian language Nermin Vlora transleted with to day Albanian language 5000 old pelasgic transcript found in Greece, Aristidh Kola ( is in greek transleted as well)says that we have to protect Albanian language because is the language of Gods and heroes of Greece , he many other scholars explains the pelasgic origin of Albanian and the Albanian language as the base of other European Languages English included.
