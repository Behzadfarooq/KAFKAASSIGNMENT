<p>In the fictional <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a> universe, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Century_fda9.html" title="Universal Century">Universal Century</a> continuity, <b><i>Albion</i> (MSC-07)</b> is the seventh <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus-class_assault_landing_craft.html" title="Pegasus-class assault landing craft"><i>Pegasus</i>-class assault carrier</a>, and the first of the <i>Albion</i> subclass. The carrier was first designed by <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoji_Kawamori_0aca.html" title="Shoji Kawamori">Shoji Kawamori</a> and was eventually refined by Mika Akitaka. <i>Albion</i>'s debut came in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>—<a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> <a href="../../../o/v/a/OVA_586b.html" title="OVA">OVA</a> <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_0083%7E_Stardust_Memory_4547.html" title="Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></i>, and was featured in the 1992 movie follow-up <i>Last Blitz of Zeon</i>.

<p>During the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Year_War_b652.html" title="One Year War">One Year War</a>, technology advanced quickly, and ships ordered during the war quickly became obsolete as developments in mobile suit technology rapidly outpaced ship weaponry. <i>Albion</i> was not actually commissioned until three years after the war ended, in UC 0083, though the carrier was commissioned in time to respond to and adequately deal with the final <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Zeon_b8c9.html" title="Principality of Zeon">Principality of Zeon</a> offensive, <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_0083.html" title="Gundam 0083">Operation Stardust</a>. <i>Albion</i> looks very different from her earlier sisters, such as <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Phantom_21ad.html" title="Gray Phantom">Gray Phantom</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Base_abe8.html" title="White Base">White Base</a></i>.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> UC 0081, the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_Federation_316a.html" title="Earth Federation">Earth Federation</a> passed the "Federation Forces Reconstruction Plan", aimed at get the Earth Federal Forces back into shape. As part of this plan, the "Gundam Development Plan" was secretly started, with the expressed purpose of developing <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Suit_e5ac.html" title="Mobile Suit">Mobile Suits</a> that could outperform the Zeonic Company's MS. Included in the Gundam Development Plan were designs for the next generation of the <i>Pegasus</i> class assault carrier: The <i>Albion</i>.</p>
<p><i>Albion</i> was a departure from the original <i>Pegasus</i>-class ships in several ways. Through extensive use of computers and automation, most of her weaponry could be controlled from inside the ship's hull, reducing the risk placed on crew members responsible for defending the ship. <i>Albion</i>'s standard <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Century_Technology_bf6e.html" title="Universal Century Technology">Minovsky propulsion system</a> was augmented by an experimental Laser Propulsion System that used mirrored receptors to catch <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> bursts from the moon, which allowed <i>Albion</i> to escape from the moon's gravitational hold more easily. But the most drastic change was in <i>Albion</i>'s mobile suit launch procedure: rather than exposing the hangar deck to flight operations and combat conditions, <i>Albion</i> had a lift system that moved mobile suits topside to the external launch catapult, thereby protecting the MS hangers and field personnel inside. The lift system became an instant hit with the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_Federation_316a.html#Earth_Federal_Space_Forces" title="Earth Federation">Earth Federal Space Force</a>, and became standard equipment on refitted <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamis_class_cruiser.html#Salamis_class" title="Salamis class cruiser"><i>Salamis Kai</i></a> class ships.</p>
<p><i>Albion</i> launched from the lunar city <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Century_Locations_3f2a.html" title="Universal Century Locations">Von Braun</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">7 October</a> UC 0083, with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> Eiphar Synapse commanding. <i>Albion</i> received both the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_Development_Project_65ca.html#RX-78GP01A_Gundam_.22Zephyranthes.22" title="Gundam Development Project">RX-78GP01A Gundam <i>Zephyranthes</i> (Unit 1)</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_Development_Project_65ca.html#RX-78GP02A_Gundam_.22Physalis.22" title="Gundam Development Project">RX-78GP02A Gundam <i>Physalis</i> (Unit 2)</a>, and orders instructing Synapse to take his ship to Torrington base in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where the new suits could be field tested under Earth's gravity. Captain Synapse arrived on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> as scheduled, and presented Torrington's base commander with paperwork instructing him to load both suites with live ammunition — and the paperwork instructing Torrington's base commander to load Unit 2 with an MK-82 tactical <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear warhead</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after sunset, the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaz_Fleet_1a0c.html" title="Delaz Fleet">Delaz Fleet</a> commenced <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Stardust_ca91.html" title="Operation Stardust">Operation Stardust</a>, beginning with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anavel_Gato_8508.html" title="Anavel Gato">Anavel Gato</a>'s hijack of Gundam Unit 2. Once the terrestrial Zeon remnants confirmed Gato had secured the Gundam, MS-09F/trop Dom Tropens and one YMS-16M Xamel launched a raid against Torrington to help divert the Federation's search parties. Although Gato was pursued by Kou Uraki, who commandeered Gundam Unit 1, he managed to escape from Torrington through the aid of a friendly Zeon <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarine</a>. <i>Albion</i> was heavily damaged in the raid, thanks in part to powerful multi-missiles fired from the same Zeon submarine. While undergoing repairs at Torrington, Captain Synapse received a change in orders: Ascertain the location of the stolen Gundam, and if necessary, destroy it. Along with those orders came a full complement of Mobile Suits and pilots: Chuck Keith and <a href="../../../k/o/u/Kou_Uraki_7b5b.html" title="Kou Uraki">Kou Uraki</a>, originally stationed at Torrington, were reassigned to <i>Albion</i>, along with Bernard Monsha, Alpha A. Bate, and Chap Adel. Commanding the newly formed <i>Albion</i> MS contingent was <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Burning_d018.html" title="South Burning">Lt. South Burning</a>.</p>
<p>Following the last known course of the Zeon submarine, <i>Albion</i> departed from Torrington on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">14 October</a> and arrived in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">16 October</a>. One week later <i>Albion</i> succeeded in locating the stolen Gundam, but failed to secure it. Zeon's Kiberlite Base MS unit, composed of about six Zaku II F2's and four Doms Tropens, engaged <i>Albion</i>'s MS units, buying enough time for Anavel Gato to escape into space aboard a Heavy Lift Vehicle (HLV). Once in space, Gato and the stolen Gundam Unit 2 were caught in the crossfire between three of the Federation's <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamis_class_cruiser_%28Gundam%29_5738.html" title="Salamis class cruiser (Gundam)"><i>Salamis</i> class cruisers</a> and a pair of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musai_class_cruiser.html" title="Musai class cruiser"><i>Musai</i>'s</a>, which included Gato's <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flagship.html" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, the <i>Peer Gynt</i>. Using the position of this battle as a starting point <i>Albion</i> proceeded into space and requested additional help with the task of locating the stolen mobile suite. General Kowen granted the request, assigning two <i>Salamis</i> class cruisers to assist; both were destroyed and the Gundam heavily damaged by <a href="../../../c/i/m/Cima_Garahau_d66b.html" title="Cima Garahau">Cima Garahau</a> and her men.</p>
<p><i>Albion</i> proceeded to <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Century_Locations_3f2a.html" title="Universal Century Locations">Von Braun</a>, where the ship was docked for resupply. During this port call Anaheim Electronics took custody of the damaged Unit 1, upgrading it into the RX-78GP01Fb Gundam Zephyranthes Full Vernian — a version refitted for space combat. Departing Von Braun on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">4 November</a>, <i>Albion</i> proceeded to the Sea of Solomon to resume its search for the missing Gundam Unit 2. Between <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">4 November</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">6 November</a> <i>Albion</i> supported Gundam Unit 1 as it conducted weapons tests with an experimental beam rifle. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">6 November</a> <i>Albion</i> detected a <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_class.html" title="Papua class"><i>Papua</i> class resupply ship</a> and began pursuit of the vessel after it failed to respond a message requesting that the ship identify itself.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Believing the ship to belong to the Delaz fleet, Captain Synapse ordered <i>Albion</i> to begin pursuit and launched mobile suits at the fleeing vessel. During the MS launch a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chivvay_class.html" title="Chivvay class"><i>Chivvay</i> class</a> ship opened fired on <i>Albion</i>, disabling one of the launch catapults. Despite the damage <i>Albion</i> and the <i>Chivvay</i>-class ship began to exchanged fire; meanwhile the disabled catapult became functional and Gundam Unit 1 was launched into battle. Unit 1 opened fired on the <i>Chivvay</i>-class vessel, striking an ammunition storage bay and prompting the crew of the <i>Chivvay</i>-class ship to abandon ship; however the vessels was sped up in an effort to make a <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a> attack. At the last second, <i>Albion</i> opened fire with her main gun, destroying the <i>Chivvay</i>-class ship with 1500m to spare. Although damaged during the battle <i>Albion</i> continued on to the Sea of Solomon to resume her search for the missing Unit 2.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">8 November</a> Admiral Green Wyatt, the supreme commander of the Earth Federal Space Force, rendezvoused with <a href="../../../c/i/m/Cima_Garahau_d66b.html" title="Cima Garahau">Cima Garahau</a> and her men in what was meant to be a covert meeting. While both parties were meeting, <i>Albion</i> inadvertently wandered into to the rendezvous area. Unaware of the ongoing secret meeting and believing Admiral Wyatt's battleship to be under attack Synapse ordered <i>Albion</i>'s MS unit to launch. Cima and her men promptly retreated from the battlefield, but their <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanzibar_class_cruiser.html" title="Zanzibar class cruiser"><i>Zanzibar II</i> class cruiser <i>Lili Marleen</i></a> was unable to outdistance itself from <i>Albion</i>'s MS units, so Cima and her men launched from their ship to provide cover fire. To support the illusion that <i>Albion</i> was protecting the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a> <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_class_battleship.html" title="Birmingham class battleship"><i>Birmingham</i></a> Admiral Wyatt ordered <i>Birmingham</i> to fire her main guns at the retreating <i>Lili Marleen</i> while making sure that the shots missed. <i>Birmingham</i>'s shot missed <i>Lili Marleen</i>, but did hit one of Cima's <i>Musai</i> class cruisers (the Nibelung), thereby ensuring Cima's escape. Cima and her MS team engaged Lt. South Burning and his MS team, during which time two MS from <i>Lili Marleen</i> were lost. During the battle Lt. Burning recovered a suitcase containing valuable information on Operation Stardust; however, while returning to <i>Albion</i> his Mobile Suit exploded as a result of damage incurred while battling Cima. The death of Lt. Burning came as shock to those aboard <i>Albion</i>, especially to the MS pilots Bernard Monsha, Alpha A. Bate and Chap Adel, as they had all served under Lt. Burning in the 04th MS Team during the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Year_War_b652.html" title="One Year War">One Year War</a>. Following Lt. Burning's death Captain Synapse exercised his command authority and promoted Alpha A. Bate and Kou Uraki one rank.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">10 November</a>, <i>Albion</i> was en route to the Naval Review when the missing Gundam Unit 2 was suddenly spotted heading directly toward the Federation fleet. <i>Albion</i> went into hyperdrive, launching all of her mobile suits in an effort to intercept Unit 2 before it reached the review, but the Mobile Suits failed to catch up in time, and Gundam Unit 2's MK-82 nuclear weapon was launched into the middle of the Federation's fleet. Fully 2/3rds of the Federation's fleet were destroyed or disabled. At the same time, two <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Colony_%28Gundam%29_2866.html" title="Space Colony (Gundam)">colonies</a> were hijacked in mid transfer, sending one toward the moon. Captain Synapse ordered <i>Albion</i> to sail for <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Vie_en_Rose_%28Gundam%29_72c6.html" title="La Vie en Rose (Gundam)"><i>La Vie en Rose</i></a>, where he (forcefully) acquired the experimental <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_weapons.html#Mobile_Armour" title="Mobile weapons">Mobile Armour</a> <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_Development_Project_65ca.html#RX-78GP03_Gundam_.22Dendrobium_Orchis.22" title="Gundam Development Project">RX-78GP03 Gundam <i>Dendrobium Orchis</i></a>, then departed at high speed toward the Delaz Fleet's hijacked colony, which was now headed for Earth. As <i>Albion</i> approached the colony Synapse received new orders from Bask Om to defend the Solar System II deployment with Cima's fleet. Synapse reluctantly complied, and ordered Gundam Unit 3 launched against the Delaz Fleet. Despite heroic effort from Kou Uraki and the Gundam Unit 3, the colony crossed over the point of no return, eventually impacting the American Midwest, none-the-less a heavily damaged <i>Albion</i> continued fighting until the last.</p>
<p>With the conclusion of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Stardust_ca91.html" title="Operation Stardust">Operation Stardust</a> the Federation opened <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courts_martial.html" title="Courts martial">courts martial</a> against certain people for actions undertaken during the crisis. For stealing Unit 3, Kou Uraki was sentenced to one year of hard labour, and Synapse was sentenced to death. Since the development of nuclear weapons was in violation of the Antarctic Treaty, all records of Gundam Unit 2 and subsequent events were deleted from official records, and the sentences likewise suspended.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the <i>Albion</i> survived the damages incurred during the Delaz Fleet crisis, as the ship is not seen past UC0083.</p>

<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> Synapse's request for identification was to determine whether the <i>Papua</i>-class ship was part of the legitimate Republic of Zeon fleet or part of the renegade Delaz Fleet. The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Zeon_b8c9.html" title="Principality of Zeon">Republic of Zeon</a>, located at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Century_Locations_3f2a.html" title="Universal Century Locations">Side 3</a>, had been allowed to maintain their armed service branches at the end of the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Year_War_b652.html" title="One Year War">One Year War</a> provided that they met all terms and conditions set forth by the Earth Federation in the Treaty of Granada.

Determining whether a Zeon ship was with the Republic or with an anti-Federation movement was often difficult to do, especially in light of the fact that the Republic of Zeon operates the same ships that the Principality of Zeon had operated.</li>
