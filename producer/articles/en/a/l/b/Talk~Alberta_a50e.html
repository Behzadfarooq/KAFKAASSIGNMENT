<p>Just noticed that it lists it as being "one of Canada's youngest and liveliest cities." This should be edited, if only to fix the fact that Ft. McMurray is hardly a new settlement. Yes, it has experienced massive growth over the last few years over the previous population boom in the '60s and '70s that brought the population from around 500, but it is hardly a "young" area, even by Canadian standards. As well, being a part of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo means that the "city" isn't truly a city, even if it is still refered to as such by those who have, or do live there. Imput would be great so we can fix little things like this.</p>

<p>The article mentions that the oil sands production costs are nearing conventional production costs. having worked in the oil sands and being somewhat familiar I find this impossible to believe. maybe some one check the facts? i'm I'm not mistaken, primary extraction of conventional oil is pretty well free per barrel (cents per barrel), while tertiary is a few bucks more (~$3/barrel)... if i'm not mistaken oil sands production is roughly $12/barrel to produce. (which is bitchn' when the price to sell is around $60 and you produce a half million barrels a day. this is my recolection... but i'll check back with some references in a while if no else has changed it or verified it. -danimal --207.34.120.71 07:41, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the section on economy on the Alberta page, there is a reference to government provided-services as "Canadian-style quality of life." There is bias behind the phrase. If one looks at the sentence the phrase is found in, it implies that government-provided services improve the quality of life over similar services provided by the market. Many people, especially in Alberta, do no share this opinion. Further, this is a Wikipedia article, not a government of Alberta pamplet -- so it comes across as a biased advertisement. As such, the phrase should be removed from the article as the article, ostensibly, aims at neutrality. Something like "a Canadian amount of government services" is more appropriate.</p>

<p>And critisism has to be handled very very carefully in an Encyclopedia. I don't think I would even try, personally - I can distance myself enough from the issues, and I would end up writing stuff that has no place here.</p>
<p>It is notable that Albertain politicians, including Klein, really do kick the dust up on a national level, and I think that should be mentioned somewhere, even if it's not this particular entry. I'll try to see what the other pages have and do some other research. If anyone has any imput though, fell free to message me as a write this. Like I said, this is something that would be very easy to mess up. I'll post a rough draft when it's finnished. Kyle543 20:38, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering the existence of a separate school system for Catholics (although primarily due to historical rather than religious reasons), popular opinion on such issues as abortion, prayer in schools, and such, the political and religious views of the province do tend to follow those of "Bible Belt" areas. 205.206.98.72 07:13, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am a little surprised at the lack of historical knowledge of Alberta. The reason Alberta was called the Bible Belt was due to the radio preaching of William Aberhart in the 1930s. According to William E. Mann's book "Sect, Cult, and Church in Alberta" Aberhart's radio messages exerted "a tremendous influence in the province" (page 120). The Berean Bible Institute, where Aberhart and Ernest Manning taught, sent out a great number of men who started churches throughout Alberta. These two men, successively, were premiers of the province. Also the Prairie Bible Institute in Three Hills and the Peace River Bible Institute in Sexsmith were two other interdenominational evangelical Bible Colleges which influenced the province. For these reasons, William Mann uses the common term "Bible Belt" for Alberta. As Arch26 states, it was not the influence of the Roman Catholics. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadillac_b884.html" title="User:Cadillac">Cadillac</a> 04:27, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I came in halfway through so I'm not sure where this is going. But I would say the fact that Alberta is the province with the highest proportion of evangelical Christians, is noteworthy, but equating it directly with the Southern US Bible Belt in a stretch. Calling it "Canada's Bible Belt"&#160;? Maybe, but be clear this isn't anywhere near the same as the S. US. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevlar67_26f5.html" title="User:Kevlar67">Kevlar67</a> 00:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In this article it says that Calgary is Canada's 3rd busiest airport. If based on aircraft movements, then it is correct. If based on passenger movement, it is incorrect - as Montreal has more passengers. Could you clarify.</p>

<p>I don't agree that homeschoolers 'pay a substantial portion of the costs'. The amount of grant money varies with jurisdiction but I find the Argyll reimbursement enough to cover pretty well all the costs I incur: computer rental, Internet usage, consumables (e.g. art supplies) and tuition fees for elementary/junior high music instruction. My major out-of-pocket is transportation expenses to lessons and field trips. 208.114.131.32 04:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, Alberta Economic development quotes different numbers on a January 2006 document. Edmonton and Calgary are both about the same, with Edmonton hosting a few more, followed by Banff at 3 million. These numbers are more consistent with ones I've seen in the past anyway (I don't know where the 4 and 5 million figures came from). The reason I found the text misleading was because the editor referred to these numbers as being tourism indicators. Statistically, this is accurate. But in this encyclopedia, it is probably prudent to use different terminology. Tourism does not normally include business travel (but numbers are grouped into "tourism" anyway for statistical reasons because it is impossible to separate recreational from business travel). Edmonton, being the capital recieves a lot of government travel. Likewise, Calgary, being a business centre, recieves a great deal of economic travel. So, as a result, I have subtely reworded the passage. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch26_4a1c.html" title="User:Arch26">Arch26</a> 00:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although I appreciate that fewer than half of the municipalities in the chart have released 2006 data, I removed the footnote anyway for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt that the number of footnotes was making the table confusing.</li>
<li>Most of these municipalities will have data within weeks anyway (they are released in the summer)</li>
<li>Some of these municipalities will never have 2006 data because they only conduct censuses in odd years</li>
<li>I think we should actually replace all the 2006 data with StatsCan 2006 data when it becomes available anyway. Then it will at least be consistent.</li>
<li>A footnote is still in place for communities where old data (2005 and older) is used as the most current.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Okay that's actually a much better way to put it. I probably should've done it that way in the first place to avoid confusion. I've made a slight addition to the new footnote because you will notice that all those municipalities in the list marked with an asterisk (*) had their census done in 2005. Now as for population figures released by StatsCan, I've checked its site and it show the scheduled release date for population and dwelling counts as Feb 13, 2007 <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/release/RelDates_e.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/release/RelDates_e.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (see attached link), which obviously much later than this summer. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthernFire_700c.html" title="User:NorthernFire">NorthernFire</a> 01:25, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe the following statement should be removed from this article: "Alberta is well known for its warm and outgoing friendliness and frontier spirit." While this is not a negative statement, it is completely biased and therefore does not belong in a proper Wikipedia article.

<dd>Looks odd alright. I would guess that the 3,413,500 figure might be for 2006 while the 4.63/km² one might be for 2001.

<dd>Statistics Canada shows Alberta's population as 3,413,500 as of their October, 2006 estimate. The 4.63 number appears to be based on the 2001 census.

<dd>The latest official census data released last week indicate a population of 3,290,350 and a density of 5.1. Seems like the 3.4 million estimate was a bit over.
