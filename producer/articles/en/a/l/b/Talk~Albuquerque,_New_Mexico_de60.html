<p>I think it's generally considered bad wiki form to repeatedly change the same page in the space of scant minutes. If you've made a mistake, revert it and correct it. Someone may want to clean up Sammo's mess.</p>
<p>And is that directed towards me? If so, you are blaming the wrong dude... Do not take this the wrong but I think it official wiki policy to freely edit an article. It states that "If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it." Heck, it happened to me several times now and I am fine with it {lol}. Good job by the way. I really like what you did with it. Dino</p>

<p>I think I know where the source of confusion for Albuquerque's elevation came from. The elevation of the Albuquerque Internation Sunport (ABQ or KABQ) is officially 5352 feet. The airport, however, is way above most of the city. It's located on a high mesa a good deal above downtown (where many cities record their official elevations) and above a large portion of the city (I can see the airport from my house, and it's up the "hill" so to speak) and definitely far above the valley and west mesa areas of the city which are MUCH lower in elevation than the airport. 5280 is the general consensus of Albuquerque residents and is pretty close to the average. Unless you can cite the USGS for other elevations, we should leave ~5280 feet as the elevation of the city. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 07:04, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have cited another source. No confusion here... Also, living in Albuquerque and a few blocks from the Sunport (Cornell and Coal), I have never noticed the airport as being elevation as being an anomaly. In fact, I find such an elevation to be slightly closer to the lower end. The highest parts of the city are towards Juan Tabo and Tramway. Have you ever rode a bike on Indian school east of Tramway and then rode back down towards UNM? It is not easy going up there... I have done the same from UNM to the valley. I have also walked down to the valley and up to the Heights when I was low on bus money {lol}. I think that this estimate is more accurate. 5280 is a round figure, as it is a mile, which is probably the reason for the acceptance. It is also the official elevation for Denver, Colorado. Take care friend... Dino Bryant dinobrya@yahoo.com (UNM Class of '98).</dd>

<dd>One thing. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=albuquerque+%22average+elevation" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=albuquerque+%22average+elevation" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=albuquerque+%22average+elevation</a> might show you that the elevation of the city is hard to come by, and averages range all over the place. Let's list facts. Average elevation would consist of some sort of average of the elevation over the entire city. I doubt that's how the number which was previously cited was come by. If the city lists it, or USGS lists it, I'm fine with it. The CVB lists the range, kudos on that find. If we're citing average, however, I'd need to see a real citation from the city or from USGS. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 03:35, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

This statement "Interestingly, Albuquerque has the highest altitude of any major city in the United States." is inaccurate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, perhaps there's some technical definition of "major city" we're both unfamiliar with. The statement may not be inaccurate but rather imprecise. I've restored the comment with a qualifier "one of the highest elevations of any major city in the United States". If someone can point to a technical definition of "major city" which would support the original wording, by all means change it back. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 09:47, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I when to topozone.com and looked at the Rio Grande towards the south end of the city, where the lowest elevation should be, and I estimate it at about 4920ft. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:08, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to check a decent topo map. I had been looking off and on for a good source for that 4500 ft for a while now (I didn't quite believe it either - ~2000 feet of elevation gain IN the city?). --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 16:13, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Traditionally, the "location" of a city that's used for distances and elevations has been the main post office, which is usually close to the center of town. Since the base has limited southern growth here, growth has tended, until recently, to be north and east, out of the valley and towards the mountains. (BTW, Tramway and Tramway is *much* higher than the airport. And so is Rio Rancho.)</p>
<p>FWIW, my house, near Old Town, is at about 4650', and the base of the Tram is about 6200', so a 2000' difference within the city limits isn't out of the range of possibility, just improbable. But the most important measurement, by far, is at University and Avenida de Cesar Chavez: "A Mile High, and Louder Than Hell!" User:68.35.160.2 07:43, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>anon one, I think you must be mistaken about the elevation of your house, even several miles to the south the river is still above 4800 ft and that should be lower than your elevation, which must be higher than the river. If you follow the river to the southern city limits, the topomaps seem to show an elevation of 4920 feet, but that requires some interpolation, so I rounded down to 4900. You might want to follow the topomaps linked to in the article to find the elevation at your house.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:12, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I stand corrected. I consulted both the linked map at topomaps and the US Geological Survey website, and they both show a range from 4900 to 6000 feet within the city limits. I wonder where Google Earth (the source of my claim) gets their numbers, since there's nothing north of Socorro that low. Weird.</dd>
<dd>FWIW the USGS shows Old Town and my house at exactly 5000 feet using their "best source". User:148.177.69.211 22:45, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About Mike Judge - I was of the understanding that he attended St Pius (a local catholic) High School, not Highland - I went to Highland and remember seeing articles in some local news source as a highschooler that put Judge as an alumnus of St Pius, not Highland. Unfortunately I don't have a definite source. Anyone else have info on this? I always thought it was a bit interesting, seeing that while Highland High exists in Albuquerque, is the school Beavis and Butthead attend, and Mike Judge attended high school here, that he actually attended (of all other places) the private Catholic High school in town and came to be known for a product such as Beavis and Butthead.</dd>

<p>You're right; the original paragraph is biased. And wrong. I've lived here for over thirty years, and I can tell you that the South Valley (where all the "ranches" and "farms" are, isn't being "quickly replaced" by anything. If development is *finally* happening west of Old Coors, it's replacing shrubs and brush, not farms.</p>
<p>Besides, that Walmart was stopped, thanks to lots of people who didn't want the traffic it would have represented.</p>
<p>The Southwest quadrant may be growing, but it's not rapid. Controversial, maybe, but that's to be anticipated, given that a large portion of Albuquerque doesn't want anything to change. Ever.</p>
<p>Your replacement paragraph is better as</p>

<p>What is the literal translation of the Navajo name? Does it pre-date the spanish name? That would seem suprising, wouldn't that mean it is really the Navajo name for a nearby pueblo?

<dd>The Navajo only entered the area about 100-150 years before the Spanish, so while any Navajo name might be older than the Spanish name, pueblo names would certainly have precedent. - DDN User:68.35.160.2 07:29, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>While the Navajo and Pueblo names might be more appropriate, the fact is that Albuququerque was founded as a Spanish outpost, therefore there was no name for the area before then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There was no name for the Spanish settlement before there was a Spanish Settlement. The Navajo People do not live in Pueblos and like the Puebloan Peoples, have ties to the Pre-Puebloan people of the area, sometimes called the Anasasi or Anasazi.</dd>

<li>Okay, $100? Think about it this way: A courthouse useally has higher ceilings than a office building, and even more than a hotel. Some court rooms are known to have 30-foot ceilings. But a lot of modern hotels, an average man in height can touch the ceiling in their room. So, at 8-feet, versus an office building which is normally 10-15, and a courthouse at 20-feet per floor, plus useally some type of dome-shaped cap at the top.

<dd>VOTE: <b>NO</b> A "trivia" section in a Wikipedia article is about the <i>entire</i> article. It could include trvia questions about economy, geography, history, any category. Technology should be <b>MOVED</b> under economy. To conform to other articles, it has more to with the economy, the economic and historical growth, than the culture. The culture of all cities and towns can be, and are, influenced by the major economic engines of that individual place, but that doesn't mean that they belong in that category. Seattle is influenced by fishing, timber, Boeing, and now Microsoft, and those things filter down into the culture of places like Pikes Place Market, only the by-products of the economic engines need to be in culture. Well, that is my take. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a> 02:31, 29 September 2005 (UTC)ee</dd>

<dd>Personally I find the paragraph version to be cluttered and difficult to read, and prefer the list version. There's nothing lost by using a list to organize the information, really, and the gain is in readability and visibility. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 07:33, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It seems the reasons for reversion to the paragraph form were aesthetics and consistancy amongst other city articles. I'd say the first is a matter of individual taste that perhaps should be voted upon rather than unilaterally decided, and the second is interesting but following a convention which clutters (in my opinion, unnecessarily) a simple list of cities doesn't make sense either. Any other thoughts? --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 07:36, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, I don't appreciate the public defamation and attacks by <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a> on my character. This was unnecessary and unacceptable. I never intended to start a flame/edit war over this. As far as scientifically looking at all city articles to see which ones are list form vs. prose form, is really unfair because it seems like a lot of articles start out with lists of things and are eventually rewritten into a prose format at a later time, once more information is obtained and can be written. So I am not surprised that the majority of articles contain sister city information written out in a list format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>, in particular, the part concerning <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbedded_list_d7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Embedded list">embedded lists</a>, prefers the prose format versus list format if the list is within the article itself. Lists as separate, linked articles/pages, are the preferred format here. So this is what guided me in changing the sister cities sections to prose format. Furthermore, there is some interesting discussion on lists within city articles on the archived featured article votes for several city articles, which seem to prefer prose format as well: <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Louisville%2C_Kentucky_0c83.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_San_Jose%2C_California_07c1.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/San Jose, California">San Jose</a>, and <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Seattle%2C_Washington_69e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>. Although there is some interesting debate on lists vs. prose in these articles, with lists being acceptable in some cases, the general consensus appears to still be going towards the prose format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In general, I prefer the prose format for the sister cities information, as it makes the article a bit tighter with requiring less vertical scrolling. There's also less white space to the right of the list, which in my opinion, makes the article look better as well. If there's a really long list, then perhaps the list should be migrated to its own page and listed there, with a link under <i>See Also</i>.</dd>

<p>This article is starting to get long. Any ideas/comments on some sections that could be spun off onto their own pages? I was thinking possibly the section on quadrants be rolled into a neighborhoods article(s). Breaking this part off could allow more info on smaller neighborhoods in ABQ w/o making the main article any longer. Other candidates would be schools and the trivia section. Comments? Ideas? <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerberb_fd45.html" title="User:Gerberb">Gerberb</a> 19:34, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The section on quadrants might actually be more applicable for a metro area article, since a lot of that can go into describing the overall metropolitan area and not just the city itself. The education section is also really just a list, and can be condensed quite a bit into prose. The lists of K-12 schools are generally not mentioned directly in city articles, either, and rather as 'see also' type lists. There's also a lot of non-standard sections in this article, where information can be condensed and moved to other, more appropriate sections (e.g. 'Urban trends and issues', 'Interesting Facts', '10 Tallest Buildings in Albuquerque', 'Culture, technology, and popular culture', and 'trivia'). Much of the information in this article seems like just a list of lists of interesting things about ABQ, rather than an encyclopedia article.</dd>

<p>This section makes some fairly broad statements w/o citing references. This information is just belivable enough to warrant discussion, but should really be removed if there is no verifiable data to backup these demographic statements. Any relevant information should be merged with the existing Quadrants section if it is not there already.</p>
<p>You are right, I (author) deleted the section for the time being.</p>

<p>Just because Albuquerque is dry and sunny, does it really have the "best" climate? What about all the people out there that don't like deserts or dry heat? Maybe there should be reference or a less biased statement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Saying the climate is "best" is clearly in violation of NPOV. I personally can't stand the dry heat and plan on moving away from NM as soon as I can, but I wouldn't write that the area has the "worst" climate because that violates NPOV too. --<a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwockynmt_a011.html" title="User:Jaberwockynmt">Jaberwockynmt</a> 21:27, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These roads are part of the original massive AMREP pre-development that eventually became <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_Rancho_4cbb.html" title="Rio Rancho">Rio Rancho</a>. They are indeed mostly within the Rio Rancho city limits, and the city is slowly growing into the area. The master plan for the city still envisions it taking over all of this area, which will make it as large as the Northeast Heights of Albuquerque. This level of dirt road construction--with actual development much delayed--is not actually common in the US, and in fact the long lapse of time between the initial roads and initial land sales, on one hand, and actual development on the other, led to some lawsuits against AMREP. -- <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpireguy_272b.html" title="User:Spireguy">Spireguy</a> 18:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i believe that a functioning bus/commuter rail system constitutes a title of <b>mass transit</b> not <b>public transit</b>. there are plenty of city articles with the title mass transit that has less routes, etc then ABQ Ride. <a href="../../../u/r/b/User%7EUrban909_37d7.html" title="User:Urban909">Urban909</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>When I edited it, I was under the impression that mass transit meant a higher level of public transit, like rapid transit. However, after looking at the public transit page, I see that mass transit and public transit are interchangeable terms. I'm sorry, I should have really looked into this before editing.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, there is one thing in that article that bring the Rail Runner into question:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The term transit is less likely to include long-distance forms of public transportation, such as long-distance or commuter railroads, inter-city buses, or intercity railways."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So maybe the Rail Runner should go back under "Rail", and we'll keep "Mass Transit" for ABQRide. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerryPlanet_61fc.html" title="User:PerryPlanet">PerryPlanet</a> 20:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>no worries, thats cool with me. i will do the revision, remove the tag and hopefully Rail Runner will be expanded to Santa Fe and other parts of the city. seeing that i don't live in albuquerque yet (moving back to NM soon though) i hope this expansion will go through, as with the light rail proposal on central. luckily your city seems to be ahead on your transit needs. here in houston, its been an uphill battle for 20 years to even get 7 miles of rail. by the way, do you know how many miles of bus system you have? cheers. <a href="../../../u/r/b/User%7EUrban909_37d7.html" title="User:Urban909">Urban909</a></p>
