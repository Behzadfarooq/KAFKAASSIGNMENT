<p><b>Albert Henry George Grey, 4th Earl Grey</b>, <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George_9fff.html" title="Order of St Michael and St George">GCMG</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Victorian_Order_8658.html" title="Royal Victorian Order">GCVO</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">PC</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">28 November</a> <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a> – <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>) was a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> nobleman who was <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General of Canada</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>.</p>
<p>Grey was educated at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow_School_01a8.html" title="Harrow School">Harrow</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge_7df5.html" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he studied history and law. He came from a family that had enjoyed successful political careers based on reform, including colonial reform. In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>, his uncle, the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Grey%2C_3rd_Earl_Grey_78bc.html" title="Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey">3rd Earl Grey</a>, as Colonial Secretary, was the first to suggest that colonies should be self-sustaining and governed for the benefit of their inhabitants, instead of for the benefit of the United Kingdom. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, he married Alice Holford and together they had five children, one of whom died in early childhood.</p>
<p>Grey served as a Member of Parliament from <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a> and succeeded his uncle as 4th Earl Grey in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>. He travelled extensively throughout the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, and was Administrator of <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia.html" title="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> from <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>. He also gained commercial experience as the Director of the British South Africa Company from <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>. He was one of the first four trustees responsible for the administration of the scholarship funds which established the <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodes_Scholarship_b7cd.html" title="Rhodes Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> he was appointed Governor General of Canada.</p>
<p>Lord Grey was a very active Governor General. He was in constant contact with the Prime Minister, offering ideas for social reform. He sought greater political inclusion for all, and worked to reach as many ordinary Canadians as possible. In fact, he was so dedicated and involved that then-prime minister <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfrid_Laurier_2808.html" title="Wilfrid Laurier">Sir Wilfred Laurier</a> said Lord Grey gave "his whole heart, his whole soul, and his whole life to Canada".</p>
<p>Lord Grey was in office during a time of increasing economic development, industrialisation and immigration in Canada. Both <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> entered the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Confederation_dbec.html" title="Canadian Confederation">Confederation</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>. It was also a time of change. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government was defeated by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Laird_Borden_defd.html" title="Robert Laird Borden">Sir Robert Borden</a> over the issue of trade reciprocity with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom_9851.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> died in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> was crowned in 1911.</p>
<p>Lord Grey travelled throughout Canada extensively, from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Maritimes_05d1.html" title="Canadian Maritimes">Maritimes</a> to the north and to western Canada. He was the first Governor General to travel to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, where he issued a warm invitation for them to join the Confederation. He also developed strong bonds with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, visiting the United States on different occasions.</p>
<p>With his desire for social reform and cohesion, Lord Grey was a strong promoter of national unity among French and English Canadians, as well as a supporter of unity within the entire British Empire. He also advocated prison reforms in Canada to provide greater social justice.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">16 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>, a second Commission was issued that appointed Lord Grey as "Governor General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of the Dominion of Canada". This reflected the passing of the Militia Act in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, and resulted in changes to the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of the Governor General.</p>
<p>Lord Grey sought to promote culture among Canadians. From <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>, he was heavily involved in the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> Tercentenary, the celebrations, pageantry and social functions marking the 300th anniversary of the founding of the city. He also influenced the decision to have the Plains of Abraham, the battlefield where the French and English fought in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1759.html" title="1759">1759</a> which led to the fall of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_France_b15c.html" title="New France">New France</a>, designated a national park in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_City_5f2c.html" title="Quebec City">Quebec City</a>.</p>
<p>He supported the arts, and established the "Grey Competition for Music and Drama" which was first held in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>. In 1909, he donated the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> to the Senior Amateur Football Championship of Canada. The Grey Cup is still presented to the champions of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">Canadian Football League</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> Lord Grey was elected into the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_24ba.html" title="Canadian Football Hall of Fame">Canadian Football Hall of Fame</a> for his contribution to the game.</p>
<p>At the request of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%2C_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell_15ed.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">Sir Robert Baden-Powell</a>, he also undertook the role of Chief Scout of Canada. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, Lord Grey received Canada's first important foreign royal visit, Prince Fushima of Japan. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>, as part of the Quebec Tercentenary celebrations, he welcomed the Prince of Wales (later King George V), who reviewed 12,000 Canadian military personnel along with a host of ships visiting Quebec.</p>
<p>Lady Grey was the first spouse of a Governor General to be designated as "Her Excellency", an appellation approved by King Edward VII. She was very interested in her husband's role and duties. She sponsored contests for beautiful gardens in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, known as the "Lady Grey Competitions", (which continued a tradition begun during <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_John_Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound%2C_4th_Earl_of_Minto_c71b.html" title="Gilbert John Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto">Lord Minto's</a> term) and also planted <a href="../../../d/a/f/Daffodil.html" title="Daffodil">daffodils</a> on the west lawn, which visitors to <a href="../../../r/i/d/Rideau_Hall_8f15.html" title="Rideau Hall">Rideau Hall</a> can still see today. Their daughter, Lady Evelyn Grey, was a champion figure skater.</p>
<p>During his term, Lord Grey added both the Governor General's study and a new conservatory (which was removed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">24</a>) to Rideau Hall. And upon his departure, he sold the State Landau, which he had purchased from the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Australia_3130.html" title="Governor General of Australia">Governor General of Australia</a>, to the Canadian government — the carriage is still used for official functions. Lord Grey also recommended that a "great" railway hotel be built in the nation's capital — an idea that grew into the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chateau_Laurier_9391.html" title="Chateau Laurier">Chateau Laurier</a>.</p>
<p>Lord Grey and his wife received many accolades for their work with Canadians and for their championship of social reform.</p>
<p>On leaving office in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, Lord Grey and his family returned to England, where he became president of the Royal Colonial Institute (now the Royal Commonwealth Society) in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. Grey died at his family residence in 1917. His son <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Grey%2C_5th_Earl_Grey_2607.html" title="Charles Grey, 5th Earl Grey">Charles</a> succeeded to the title.</p>
