<p>I read one of the sources linked on this page, which clearly states the following:</p>
<p>Why the brain was preserved at all is not clear; the rest of the body was cremated shortly after death. One biographer says Einstein wanted it to be used for research; the executor of his estate denies this, and says the decision to preserve it was made by his son.</p>
<p>I was confused as I read the article to see a contradiction, but by no means would I consider myself an expert, and the article is older than I am, so something new could have come up. -- <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclipsed_Moon_d109.html" title="User:Eclipsed Moon">Eclipsed Moon</a> 08:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I went to a talk a couple of years ago about Einstein's brain, and in that talk the lecturer claimed that the person doing the autopsy on Einstein simply thought it would be in the interest of science if the brain was kept and preserved.:</dd>

<p>The article follows the information claimed by Steven Levy <a href="http://www.echonyc.com/~steven/einstein.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.echonyc.com/~steven/einstein.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that the brain was rediscovered by Levy in 1978. Other articles on his brain (look at the others linked at the bottom) do not mention this. Also, the various articles seem to indicate the brain is in pieces, which doesn't fit very well with the photograph of it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbara_Shack_6c33.html" title="User:Barbara Shack">Barbara Shack</a> 16:34, 2 February 2006 (UTC)Einstein's brain was removed at autopsy. It was photographed. Then, after the photographs were taken it was cut into sections. A television programme by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> explained this in 2005.</p>
<p>Of course, the various articles don't agree well either. One says the brain was given to Witelson <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05107/488975.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05107/488975.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> while another says it was given to Krauss <a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=207" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=207" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, but one of the links is a short article about the brain written by Witelson <a href="http://www.bioquant.com/gallery/einstein.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bioquant.com/gallery/einstein.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. However, another linked page says samples were recieved and its location revealed by Diamond and Scheibel in 1987 <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_127" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_127" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps not all of the information, either on the internet or in the article, is reliable?</p>

<p>There seem to be a number of different accounts floating around. Here is some brief sluething I did in some more respectable sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>The finding of the brain in 1978 by Levy is somewhat corroborated by an article from the time period: "Brain that Rocked Physics Rests in Cider Box", <i>Science</i>, New Series, Vol. 201, No. 4357. (Aug. 25, 1978), p. 696. Seems to be based off of Levy's account primarily, but at least it's some evidence that he's not just a quack. It says that brain was in number of mason jars in a cider box. The brain was indeed sectioned by not completely, "the parts of Einstein's brain which remain unsectioned are the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebellum.html" title="Cerebellum">cerebellum</a> and a piece of the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_cortex.html" title="Cerebral cortex">cerebral cortex</a>." Additionally it doesn't say what the sectioning was -- if it was just sliced in half, there's no reason the pictures couldn't be of it.</li>
<li>Here is the bit on Einstein's brain from <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Clark_d3ca.html" title="Ronald Clark">Ronald Clark</a>'s biography: "He had insisted that his brain should be used for research and that he be cremated." True? Not? In any event, it is a respectable source to quote, even if we also quote people saying something contradictory. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 18:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I resent the claim that Einstein was speculated to have been autistic. This is inaccurate; he is speculated to have had Asperger's Syndrome. There is a difference.
