<p>According to the biography of Victoria by Stanley Weintraub, Albert may have died of stomach cancer. I don't have the book with me now, but this is a summary of what he said:</p>
<p>Albert was diagnosed with typhus by the physician who had distinguished between typhus and typhoid, and thus the diagnosis was considered unquestionable. Even so, several other physicians at the time did question it.</p>
<p>Albert was a heavy smoker.</p>
<p>Albert had been having trouble with his digestion, and with his teeth. Trouble with teeth is often a side effect of trouble with the stomach; acid fumes come up the throat and attack the teeth.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of stomach cancer fits these facts, and other things known about his condition.</p>
<p>Weintraub made it sound as though stomach cancer were the current scholarly consensus, and just hadn't percolated out into the general public yet. Is this worth a note in the article?</p>

<dd>No. Male consorts and female consorts are different. Albert was "Prince Albert" for his whole life, wherease female consorts (on some male consorts) become Queen (or King) upon their spouse's accession. He should go back to "Prince Albert of...", since he's universally known as "Prince Albert." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:33, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason for the rule is because women consorts becomes Queens, and thus having the title of the article call them "Princess" is confusing.

<dl>
<dd>You make no sense at all whatsoever. I'm convinced you have no idea what is really going on. In the UK, Lady isn't a real title, at least as far as daughters of earls go.

<dd>All members of the House of Wettin held the title of duke or duchess in Saxony, a reflection of shared status as members of the reigning families of what was essentially a large family of states. Each ruler was also a Duke <b>of</b> Saxony, differenced with the name of his capital or principal city. The title Duke in Saxony is a dynastic title linking the family's status to the territory. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 04:10, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Usually, the Saxony dynasts actually did not use "in", as opposed to "von" (Bavaria was a different thing), and therefore much of the above is erroneous. Many of the non-reigning dynasts of the Wettin house used "Herzog von Sachsen" which should be translated "of" and not "in". It's wrong to put "in" as the English translation to signify "von", and yet more incorrect is it to use that as translatoon of "zu". <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObRoy_0a03.html" title="User:ObRoy">ObRoy</a> 20:27, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"zu" is not properly translated as "in" as far as I'm aware. Could you present some evidence that this translation is in use? It's also worth noting that "Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg-Saalfeld," or whatever, only appears as a proper title in the 19th century. In the 18th century <i>all</i> the Ernestine dynasts, ruling or not, were styled "Duke of Saxony, Angaria, and Westphalia; Landgrave in Thuringia; Margrave of Meissen; and Princely Count of Henneberg" Some of the branches had appended additional (and wholly notional) Jülich-Kleve titles, but none of the branches had any Saxon titles besides "Herzog zu Sachsen" that I'm aware of. The title is "Duke of Saxony," even if this doesnt quite convey the nuance of the German. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:22, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify on this, there are three noble particles in German - <i>in</i>, <i>zu</i>, and <i>von</i>. "in" is normally translated "in," as in "Duke in Bavaria," or "King in Prussia." Both "zu" and "von" are normally translated as "of," except when you have "von und zu" as you do with the Princes of Liechtenstein, where I'm not sure how it's dealt with. The only way to be completely clear about which Particle is meant is to give it in German. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Per <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html#Other_royals" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)#Other royals</a> items 4, 9, and 10; dead consorts revert to their pre-marital titles. In this case, that would be Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which is where the article now resides. I disagree that male and female consorts are fundamentally different. Marital naming conventions have, and do, change. Wikipedia strives for conformity across all articles; this would be in line with the conventions for consorts. While only female examples are given, the conventions refer to "Royal Consorts", not "Queen Consorts" to the exclusion of "Prince Consorts". The item for existing Royal Consorts (currently #10) contains the phrase, <b>"The same rule applies to male royal consorts."</b> The phrase has been there since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">01-31</a>; it's a bit late to be saying that these conventions were only intended for female consorts. Other usage is irrelevant, if Wikipedia tried to follow every naming convention the world over there couldn't possibly be any consistency in article naming.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 23:03, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Para #9 of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a> states that "Past Royal Consorts are referred to by their pre-marital name or pre-marital title, not by their consort name". Albert was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha both before and during his marriage, and is still generally known by this title in the UK. The present title suggests a monarchical status which he did not hold. The proposed title is preferable to the alternative of "Prince Consort" because it avoids possible ambiguity by making it clear from which territory the princely title originated. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 22:44, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where Albert is from (other than "Germany") isn't relevant to most people anyway and the territorial designation is more a matter of the deeper history of the prince's character than it is of his broader identity. He is known as Prince Albert (compare Marie Antoinette) or the Prince Consort to most. The current name is no less ambiguous than potential conflicts between varying queens regnant and queens consort of the same name. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 23:19, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Prince Albert is ambiguous. I don't understand why you are proposing a name which is even less like his most commonly known name than the alternative.

<dd>The conventions do not mean what you keep on saying they mean.

<dd>But surely any convention can then be swept aside by whoever says that they "dispute" it? By de-valuing previous efforts to resolve issues, Wiki's process of striving toward consensus through building on previous discussions is mocked. Moreover, this poll doesn't include the option "Prince Albert". It calls for an expression of which term is preferred between "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha" and "Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha". By voting on that first, then other choices, we can avoid mixing up distinct issues. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 21:11, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

Like, for instance, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> <span style="color: #444488; font-size: 11pt;"><b>//</b></span> <span style="background: #E5E5FF; border: 1px solid #BBBBCC; font-weight: bold; padding: 2px;"><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanbarnesdavies_8c0b.html" title="User:Danbarnesdavies"><span style="color: #000044; cursor: help;">D</span></a><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><span style="color: #444488; cursor: help;">B</span></a><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanbarnesdavies_Esperanza_5fda.html" title="User:Danbarnesdavies/Esperanza"><span style="color: #008833; cursor: help;">D</span></a></span> 17:37, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it can be argued that princes who inherit peerages or other such titles are Prince X, title of Y. I see no need to discount including prince before the forename when it is really two distinct dignities. The Prince of Wales is <b>a</b> prince of the United Kingdom and <b>the</b> Prince of Wales. I don't think an exception that should be fixed should dictate the naming of Albert when all other royal peers have Prince affixed in front of their forenames. But that is another discussion. What of the territorial designation (UK)? Is it cumbersome and can be omitted or is it necessary? <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 17:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both of John's proposals suit me.

<ul>
<li>How can we editors presume ourselves wiser than a guideline?
<ul>
<li>Because we <b>wrote</b> them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is a guideline?
<ul>
<li>An approximation to the consensus of editors on similar questions, held together by Scotch tape and piano wire. See <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a> therefore, as <a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">Template:guideline</a> says, it has exceptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the status of the section on consorts?
<ul>
<li>That's one of the things we're here to find out. It's a generalization of actual usage, such as <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine_9952.html" title="Eleanor of Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabelle_of_Bavaria_4bf4.html" title="Isabelle of Bavaria">Isabelle of Bavaria</a>; there is some trifling &lt;/irony&gt; dispute on how it should apply, for example, to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse_d151.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse">Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse</a>. We disagree on how rough an approximation it is; at least one of us denies that it applies to this case at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does it apply to this case?
<ul>
<li>Setting aside all questions of what the guideline <i>should</i> be, that's still debateable. All of the choices proposed are more or less defensible under the guideline as it stands; for example, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Albert_7a9e.html" title="Prince Albert">Prince Albert</a> is an appeal to exception 4 on monarchial names: If a monarch or prince is overwhelmingly known, in English, by a cognomen, use it. I will now go add a note that that applies generally, and see if anyone reverts me. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 03:25, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I&#160;!vote for Saxe-Coburg-Gotha <b>only</b> because Saxe-Coburg <b>and</b> Gotha is even less desirable. I have never seen this as English usage for any member of the family; and I have never seen it for Albert in any language.</p>
<p>As for inclusion of SCG, why? Please do not just quote the guideline; this seems one of the situations where it is unusually silly, even if it applies to males. Would we move <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_of_Bulgaria_dea1.html" title="Ferdinand of Bulgaria">Ferdinand of Bulgaria</a> to Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:38, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Burke's Guide to the Royal Family", 1973, p.295, lists the husband of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Victoria of the United Kingdom</a> as "HH Prince Francis <i>Albert</i> Augustus Charles Emmanuel of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony..."; Marlene Eilers' "Queen Victoria's Descendants", 1997, page 121 calls him "HSH Prince Franz August Karl <i>Albert</i> Emanuel of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; Dan Willis's "The Descendants of King George I of Great Britain", 2002, page 47: "Franz August Karl <i>Albert</i> Emanuel of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony, The Prince Consort"; <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_Aronson_472e.html" title="Theo Aronson">Theo Aronson</a>'s "Grandmama of Europe: The Crowned Descendants of Queen Victoria", 1973, page 268 states, "Now, a mere sixteen years after her death, her grandson changed the name of her beloved Prince Albert's dynasty of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor"; Walter J.P. Curley, Jr.'s "Monarchs-in-Waiting", 1973, page 27 says, "The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, one of the oldest Germanic dynasties, spawned the royal houses of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Belgium, and Portugal." The first three authors are well-known royal genealogists, while Aronson was probably the English language's most popular writer of biographies of modern "royalty" until his death two years ago. None of which contradicts the fact that in popular parlance "Saxe-Coburg-Gotha" is probably more common -- but the "and" version is not rare in English. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 21:23, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you for finding a source for SC and G. I could only wish it were a more reliable one than Burke's.
