<p>Ok I will return to run the bot in 1 week. (<b>on April 10th</b>)... I have cooled down a bit...but I don't think it is wise for me to jump right back in&#160;:-).</p>
<p>If you want please have a look at the bot criteria and change them as you see fit... As to not have this problem agian&#160;:-). <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome_%28Bot%29_Help_CleanupCriteria_5d60.html" title="User:Gnome (Bot)/Help/CleanupCriteria">User:Gnome (Bot)/Help/CleanupCriteria</a></p>
<p>Feel free to change as you see fit...I will change the bot to match... You and I should do some communication between us before I run agian.</p>
<p>P.S. I was ok with the blocks... It just was the tone of voice behind them, and the general attitude that I got when I tried to find out what was wrong.&#160;:-) I probably should not have run, but I was not expecting permision so soon... Once it is given you only get a week to prove the bot. More than likily this whole fiasco was due to unfortionate circumstances. I really am sorry... the timeing of this was just bad.&#160;:-).</p>
<dl>
<dd>When I do run I am going to set it up so that we are working togather.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 21:26, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also can you tell me if it is ok to remove the cleanup tag for wikification...ect??? I'm assumming the answear is no...but just tell me. Or better yet change the <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome_%28Bot%29_Help_CleanupCriteria_5d60.html" title="User:Gnome (Bot)/Help/CleanupCriteria">Criteria</a> and I will change the bot to fit.
<dl>
<dd>It only takes a couple minutes to modify the bot... It is programmed and working bug free, just not to the satification of the people here. adding and removing features is really easy now!!!</dd>

<ul>
<li>We will have to reapply for another test run... as this one will run out tonight. (should not be hard)---Especally if I have your diplomacy to help!!!<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 21:54, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if Gnome bot is unable to remove the cleanup tag... (I'm assumming that Zoe's argument about grammer ect. applies to rememoving the cleanup tag and replacing it with {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../s/e/c/Template%7ESections_e49a.html" title="Template:Sections">sections</a>}}, ect.) what exactly is Gnome bot to do... just add a bunch of tags to all of the articles in the backlog??? (leave the backlog be??) but that defeats the purpose of the bot...</p>
<p>As you see I am concerned about the future of the bots operation... right now as it stands the bot will only be able to replace ((cleanup)) with ((cleanup-list)), and ((disambig-cleanup))...I don't see the back log shrinking under these circumstances.</p>
<p>I really like your new stub type proposals... Very good... the bot will be able to work with those, if we find continuing opposition to Gnome bot's removal of cleanup tags.</p>
<p>NOTE: my personal belief is that every stub can be marked with cleanup, the all are small, and 99% of them have issues with english, or wikification... The cleanup tag should refer to only articles that are not stubs, and that are fully wikified... Kind of like a last polishing. (25% or more are stubs that are on the list)(and if the bot does not mark these with the stub tag, they will be marked with the wikify tag)<b>75%(a guess) of stubs in general need the wikify tag</b> What I am trying to say is that {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} should be reserved only for articles that don't fit in the other categories, otherwise it is rather pointless, as the category is used as a catch-all.</p>
<p>{{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-copyedit_3909.html" title="Template:Cleanup-copyedit">cleanup-copyedit</a>}} does exist... my bot can't put any-thing into it, but you get the idea... these tags are poorly defined as to there scope... the only ones that are clear at all are {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-copyedit_3909.html" title="Template:Cleanup-copyedit">cleanup-copyedit</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../s/e/c/Template%7ESections_e49a.html" title="Template:Sections">sections</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}}, ((and a few others, that I can't think of)).</p>
<p>We need to think about redifining(better defining) what putting something in cleanup means, v.s. putting something in one or more of the more specific categories.----</p>
<p>Back to hibernating!!!(I will of course continue this discussion)----This time we are getting this <b>right</b></p>
<p><a name="New_idea" id="New_idea"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlba_8221.html" title="Edit section: New idea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New idea</span></h2>
<p>Back out of hibernation... I think I have a solution to the problem...</p>
<p>The objection seems to be to the automatic removal of cleanup --&gt; stub. If that is the case than we can have the bot put them on a list, similar to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Novels_Book_to_novel_autolist_9b20.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/Book to novel autolist">Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/Book to novel autolist</a> that Gnome bot made. This list started with around 600 articles on it... it is down to about <b>100</b> articles. I had the bot make the list... As I knew that this task was not automatable.</p>
<p>For some reason people really like lists of this sort... especally when they are accurate... I think it is belause it is a list of easy edits to boost peoples edit counts... (it is easier to go through a list that is 95% accurate, no matter how long... than it is to go through the whole category <i>at one time over 2000 articles</i>) But really I don't care... The job gets done... and that in the end is the point:-)</p>
<p>I propose that instead of changing cleanup --&gt; stub, the bot make a list with the articles name and the number of words, and the %wikified).<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 23:23, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that we have had only positive thoughts toward the bot, (exepting the block and subsequent mess)... That appears to be changing... Opposition to the idea is slowly riseing, <i>i.e. the first opposing comment I have seen</i> (this opposition does not appear to be related to the block).</p>
<p>I left a link below, I think we need to rediscuss Gnome (Bot)'s mission... (I wrote the code... We are going to do something with it... just what we need to figure out.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I am sorry about the botophobia... but the comments that zoe and others left... and the dificult trail I had to follow to get even a vauge idea was... in short disturbing... to me total lack of trust... but I am going to leave that for another day.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 19:54, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, just seen your addition to the WP:ARCHAEO page. Not sure where this came from could you explain. I'm not sure that the link to page really covers it. Is this a single additioin to a project or are all about to get similar treatment. Not against it just seeking to understand what is going on. Also part of "Sports Olympics" and "Novels" projects and nothing appears to have changed there.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 08:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Olympics might need a bit more introduction to others as a "lot" of people seem to "contribute" / "get in each others way" on that project.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 15:16, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi its me Eagle_101</p>
<p>Thank you for fixing my horrible English skills, and grammer... on the bot criteria page. I'm a math and physics major, not english:-).</p>
<p>I am e-mailing you to inform you that I have indeed managed to get topic specific programming started, It is very basic right now, but is possible!!!! I am using a bit more than just finding the word in an article, the bot actually counts the frequency of apperence of ALL key words, than compares that to the total number of words, and yeilds a percent. In short it can tell which words are used the most.</p>
<p>In addition, it can tell if the key word is wikified, (If it is than it is more likely to be relevent to determining what category is what.) examples. This book is novel. as compared to This <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> is a book written by ...</p>
<p>It is rather amazing how many of the key words turn out to be wikified, (of course this only works on articles that don't need to be wikified).</p>
<p>I am e-mailing you as Zoe unbocked only his block, there still is a second block left... And I triggered it. (it's rather funny:-)</p>
<p>Tell me what you think,... Gnome bot can do topic sorting with ease and a bit (dare I say, a lot) more programming of what words to look for. (I would like some serious imput here.... what words should be key words for what category or categories)..... The bot can (and will) keep track by a "point system" of each category that is possible. In short, key words can mean more than just one thing.) Agian, my code is very flexable, as it is set up now, the bot can "wieght" certian words. This will need more discussion between the two of us and the community in general... but it can be done, and I have programmed the initial parts of this system.:-)</p>
<p>Please consider and think about the above....</p>
<p>I originally was going to e-mail this to you, Ignore all references to e-mailing anything, just post on my page.</p>

<p>First off, yes massive cut 'n paste... there is no better way</p>
<p>Second, can you get Beland to look at my bot's criteria... and tell him about the category sorting.... and if it is not too much, point me to his bot's criteria... That way we will not trip over each other's toes. As it is, my bot can do auto-categorization into the main categories... I am just missing key words (and what wieght to give each word). What is Berland doing excactly... please elaborate. I am going to try and look myself.. but I probably will not find it!!!!</p>

<p>Just tell beland that my bot is not yet approved... It will need a trial run, In addition my bot's features may not be on line entirely for about a month (hope to shorten it, but I need key words and time to figure out false positives) In addition, I probably should start with really easy to tell categoryies first. Give me some ideas.</p>
<p>P.S. I have a problem with useing the names of the categies... Chemistry means more than the science of chemistry... two people have good chemistry... same thing for most category names... we need to start with obious categories and work ourselves in... (Archology (I think I spelled it right) is a very distinct word... things like that.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 15:09, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why are you dismantling PNA/Physics? It seems to me that it's a better place to centralize notes on articles needing attention that WikiProject Physics, and I didn't see any discussion about the drastic changes being implemented.

<p>You may wish to consider putting the notice at the top of the page, rather than buried in the middle. You might also wish to _suggest_ transclusion of PNA/Physics to relevant WikiProjects, rather than implement it. I've also moved the comments you copied to the WikiProject Pseudoscience page. I recognize that you're putting a lot of effort into this, and that there's a reason for it, but please realize that WikiProject main pages tend to be fairly meticulously maintained by their members. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 17:15, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't speak for WikiProject Physics, but please don't unilaterally transclude anything into WikiProject Pseudoscience ever again. Put a suggestion on the talk page.

<p>I have not yet put it on the criteria list, as</p>

<p>P.S. Please tell me now what others may say about auto-categorization...

<p>Let's take this slow, I want to leave plenty of time for objections.</p>
<p>P.S. Due to real life interfering I will be a bit sparse... Probably little or no programming for a week or two... I will be checking in on my talk page of course... I don't think that will harm Belend and my bot's potential to work togather... Autocategorization I predict will draw some debate... and I think my bot should not run untill after it is over.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 03:00, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great idea!!! Gee so simple and easy, but I never thought of it. (Knocks head on wall) Thank you. If we wait for bot approval after the autocat feature is tested than the bot will not be running (on articles) for 2-3 months... I am in school and exams are comming. In addition it is a lot of typing, (I am trying to use some <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">Algorithms</a>, perhaps will make more accurate (presise) and less typing on my part.), (will enable me to add new criteria, and new output with fewer lines of code.</p>
<p>My view is that I am going to take all the time that is needed to get this correct. (please help me identify good starting categories, and perhaps what to look for, other than the specific category name... I can't use just that... the word "novel" appears in more articles than just those that are in category novel. Ditto for every other category name in wikipedia!!!

<p>Ok statistical studies it is... (woohoo!!! more work... at least this is automated, to exept for reading the output:-)</p>
<p>Without help, i.e. someone telling me to look for X, Y, Z.... and take the most commenm, this will extend the bot startup date considerably. Can you at least point me in the right direction... (how about a obsucre category to start... and I will work my way up.</p>
<p>If you are unable, that is ok... just keep working with me , and when I get the bot started, (i.e. testing--making sample output in the form of a list), please help me look over them and tell me if the runs were effective.</p>
<p>P.S. the only reason I responed so fast, is that I am doing research now on wikipedia!!!</p>

<p>Not to bad!!! great idea's... can you give me a link to the statistically improbable phrases... that will make my analysis sooooo much easier.... as I will only have to look for which words show up in each category..... I have a idea marked on paper on how I am going to do this... (the method), but I need to know what to do with the info that the algothim gives me... (i.e. when I see novel, assume that means the article is about the author of a novel, or the novel itself.) One or two more words, such as book, literature, ect., can also be added to improve results. (I am not just throwing out ideas here, I have a plan of action:-), I just need to know how to interprete results.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 19:31, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will start with antropology...&#160;:-) (I need to analyze the category first, i.e. taking representive samples, and going from there)</p>
<p>P.S. I have my research done, I am going to look for potential words. a link to my results is here--These are NOT done in any scientific manner( I am reading the article spotting words that appear multiple times in different articles)--Than I can do some analysis off-site on the specific words that I have found, (data dump).</p>

<p>Hello, Alba,</p>
<p>Regarding the entry for <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat_boy.html" title="Boat boy">Boat boy</a>, I wonder if you could answer some questions for me.</p>
<p>The article does not cite its sources. I am fairly new to Wikipedia. Does this mean that the article needs someone to find a source external to Wikipedia and cite it? If so, I am glad to do that. The article is reasonably accurate as it is, but I am glad to try to find something else if that helps.</p>
<p>I am a thurifer and work with boat boys and girls. I have one photograph of a thurifer and boat girl and have permission to use it. Is there any reason not to use it? It does have the photo of a child. Is this acceptable to post? Is there any risk to doing this?</p>

<p>I agree that this needed redesign, but how exactly is this "bot updating" to work? What exactly is the procedure for <i>reporting</i> problems? (You can answer here; I'll check back.) ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 15:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tagging any page in the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Category%7EPhysics_45cd.html" title="Category:Physics">Category:Physics</a> or its subcategories with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} will put it on the cleanup list; tagging any page in the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Category%7EPhysics_45cd.html" title="Category:Physics">Category:Physics</a> with {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}} puts it in the relevant subsections as well. On top of that, we are trying to build another sorting bot that can place new stubs and cleanup pages without a category in the physics category, so that they too will be listed.
<dl>
<dd>Now, this doesn't relieve the need to delineate the problems with the article. Those that can be automated, again, will be -- such as {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}. But descriptors still need to be posted, on the article's talk page or (if desired) the talk page of the PNA subpage.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The basic idea is to keep these lists <i>rapidly</i> and <i>comprehensively</i> updated. In the previous system, things were posted only if someone very familiar with Wikipedia and the problems in the article hunted down PNA/Physics and posted. This meant that many, maybe most, of the pages that needed help simply never got attended to -- which is why the cleanup, wikify, and expert lists are all horribly backlogged. By pooling these projects to PNA, autoupdating them, and transcluding them to the people who care about such articles, we hope to have a much more efficient system for Wikipedia maintenance. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 18:08, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>what about expert flagged articles in subcategories like <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">General relativity</a>?</li>
<li>what about {{POV-because|REASON}} and similarly flagged articles? Currently I think this is the most common way to flag articles which WP Physics members believe are biased toward some crank notion. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pseudoscience_Articles_attracting_pseudoscientific_edits_7365.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience/Articles attracting pseudoscientific edits">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pseudoscience/Articles_attracting_pseudoscientific_edits</a> for hundreds of examples, including many in physics-related articles. FYI, I and others have been using PNA/Physics primarily to alert physicists Wikipedians to relevant AfDs and cruft problems, so I hope you will modify the bot to look for POV flags and list affected articles under an appropriate new section.</li>
<li>numerous articles I have written or extensively edited have expert flags and todo lists on the talk pages; the intent was to help organize the work of WikiProject GTR. What about modifying the bot to note when an article having expert flag also has a todo list in talk page?</li>
</ol>
<p>I strongly agree with the goal of trying to streamline and improve WP article improvement/maintanance, but I suspect the biggest problem may be essential unsoluable: lack of a sufficiently expert editor pool large enough and energetic enough to cope with a horde of monomaniacal vandals, cranks, and well-intentioned but unwikiskilled newbies, inexperienced writers, etc. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 18:40, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Subcategories and sub-subcategories are included. The bot programmer, <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">User:Beland</a>, is of the opinion that sub-sub-subcategories is going too far, but you can ask him about that.</li>
<li>Hadn't considered POV monitoring or todo lists; I'm sure those could be done -- probably a short list.</li>
<li>That's why we're trying to automate as much as possible, so that the amount of 'expert' knowledge needed is minimized. Nonetheless I find that, over the course of human history, the truth has won out over vandals, cranks, newbies, and inexperienced writers. I feel sure the same will occur on Wikipedia -- in the long run. I mean, if you are right, then Britannica is right and the entire Wikipedia project is hopeless. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 19:00, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I add wikification and POV tags to the list of things to be aggregated by topic. Others have requested it, and the PNA list really is intended to aggregate anything that anyone interested in the topic might care to work on. I can probably do todo lists, too, though that may take some more programming. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:31, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alba,</p>
<p>You flagged the <a href="../../../f/u/m/Fumocy.html" title="Fumocy">Fumocy</a> page for being sub-standard. It would be more helpful if you said what is wrong with it, besides saying that you don't understand it. It has been around for a couple of years and maybe no-one has been reading it, but it attracted very few edits so I think it is safe to assume that most people who did thought it was fine as it was. At least it is factually correct.</p>

For instance <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicle.html" title="Vehicle">Vehicle</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blanco_galindo.html" title="Blanco galindo">Blanco galindo</a> (Geography), <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Deaf_Club_4615.html" title="The Deaf Club">The Deaf Club</a>, etc. etc. Am I ok to edit the list to sift out non-architectural articles?--<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> 16:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the title says... I have gotten ensnared in 'real life', June 10 is not looking good... I am sorry, depending on how busy I am, I may consider giving you the program and allowing you to babysit it though it's trial runs... Of course I will tell you how to shut it down ect...

<p>Before spending an inordinate amount of time on userboxes, please ask yourself whether it will benefit Wikipedia, such as helping people to collaborate more effectively on articles, and if it would be a better use of time to instead write and develop encyclopedia articles, cure diseases, and/or save the world. <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBiddy5637_cd91.html" title="User:Biddy5637">Biddy5637</a> 21:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Alba,</p>
<p>Thank you for moving my edit - my very first!! - of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pern.html" title="Pern">Pern</a> topic (reference to W.B. Yeats) to match the Wikipedia format. As a newbie, I'm still learning. I looked at the topic "history" to see why it was moved and saw your note, "move Yeats entymology to match Wikipedia format". Although Dame McCaffrey has created a novel ecology for the planet Pern, I don't think you were referring to insects (entomology). Did you mean etymology? :)</p>
