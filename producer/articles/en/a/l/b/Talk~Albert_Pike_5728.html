<p>There were books written citing actual high ranking klan members who acknowledged Albert Pike's membership. Also, the wording in the KKK section was taken directly from a Scottish Rite website (<a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html" class="external free" title="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html" rel="nofollow">http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html</a>), which means it is in no way neutral and the facts themselves are disputable because obviously the freemasons themselves do not want one of their own 33rd degree members to be known as a KKK member as well.</p>
<p>For one of many sources disputing the KKK section of this article follow this link: <a href="http://www.impiousdigest.com/lbj/fox.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.impiousdigest.com/lbj/fox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.impiousdigest.com/lbj/fox.htm</a></p>
<p>Albert Pike also had a KKK klavern in New Jersey named after him as can be seen at this link: <a href="http://www.kkklan.com/museum.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kkklan.com/museum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kkklan.com/museum.htm</a></p>
<p>For the reason that the article plagiarized <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html" class="external free" title="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html" rel="nofollow">http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html</a>, I have rewritten that section without altering its p.o.v.</p>

<dd>First, I'm wondering who posted these comments. You're supposed to sign them. And if you have "book" references, then why are there no citations in that whole section? <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 22:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying he was or wasn't involved with the founding of the KKK, but I think this sentence should be reworded: "Pike has been accused of being a founder and high ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan; however, there is no evidence of this..."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it should be reworded because there is actually some evidence (little, but some) that he is one of the founders. He was involved with the organization a mere 2.5 years after it's inception as evinced by the quote currently in the article. ("We would unite every white man in the South, who is opposed to negro suffrage, into one great Order of Southern Brotherhood...")</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the line "It is noteworthy that when the Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee around Christmas 1865, Pike was living in Arkansas, and there is no record of him journeying to or being in Pulaski." is problematic, because, unless records were kept of his journeys as a matter of course, then it's not saying much, is it? What I mean is, unless his journeys were noted at that time, then who is to say where he journeyed to? The fact that he owned a newspaper in Memphis Tennessee at that time should be enough evidence to support that he travelled to Tennessee in that time span.</dd>

<p>All sources cited and all links provided are links to purely masonic sources and masonic points of view and are therefore far from neutral. There is a need for links to opposing views on this subject. Without that, the article itself is completely biased.</p>
<p>There should not be opposing points of view for the sake of expressing another opinion. There should only be an opposite pov if there is EVIDENCE for it. As it stands, the article points out that Pike was in another state at the time the Klan was founded and that no primary source documents his connection. Also, since Pike was distrusted by the Confederacy, the idea that the Klan would trust him to be involved doesn't pass the smell test.</p>

<p>I have a few problems with the most recent additon (a quote from Pike)... first there is a general objection to citing quotes second hand. The citation is actually to the Catholic Encyclopedia and not to Pike. I do not doubt that the Catholic Encyclopedia quoted him accurately... I just object to this practice in general terms. Because many second hand sources don't quote Masonic authors correctly, we should be wary of using them. We should hunt down the original and cite that. Then there is a more specific problem... As I have said frequently, Pike is but one man. He did not and does not speak for all of Masonry. Like any cross section of society, Freemasonry has it's bigots... I think Pike was one. He definitely shows an Anti-Catholic viewpoint. But (and this is a big BUT)... just because he may have been a bigot does not make all American Freemasons in the late 1800s bigots. And the inclusion of the quote certainly <i>implies</i> that all American Freemasons are bigots today. I have slightly amended the citation note to highlight these concerns (to make it clearer that Pike was only one person, who spoke only for himself. However, I would feel better if the quote were not used at all. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:25, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is did Pike speak for American Masonry in the late nineteenth century not now? The clash between the church and newly-unified state was in that time, not now. Pike was certainly held in greater esteem then than he is now, as was understandable he was the long standing head of the Scottish Rite body for half the US. The builder magazine (1915-1930) also was very complimentary towards him - and I've never seen them say "but he's only one Mason among many and you shouldn't take his hard sayings too seriously" - although it may be lurking there somewhere. Mackey and Pike were also very close. Quoting Pike is <b>not</b> a claim that any Mason today is bound by Pike's religious views, nor is it a claim that all Masons in Ninenteenth century America shared these views - but Pike was probably the most eminent and influential figure in late Nineteenth Century Masonry and in the Nineteenth Century debate between the lodge and the Church, his fiercely anti-Papal views mattered.</dd>
<dd>On the issue of quoting from a secondary source - yes the original should be hunted down, but the best should not be the enemy of the good. As long as the quote is valid, it should be used. 13:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are over emphisizing Pike's importance. Even in the 19th century, Pike could not speak for Freemasonry. No one could or can do that. The closest that anyone ever comes to doing so is a Grand Master of one of the many Grand Lodges (which Pike was not)... and then he can only speak for his jurisdiction during his term of office... other Grand Masters, in other jurisdictions, or in other times are free to completely disagree. OK... I suppose it is valid to say that Pike could speak for AASR SJ during the mid 1800s, but as we have repeatedly pointed out, that is NOT Freemasonry as a whole. You can't even say that he spoke for US Scottish Rite Masons at the time, because he had no authority in the Northern Jurisdiction.</dd>
<dd>Please note that I am not trying to say that Pike wasn't anti-catholic... I suspect that he was (it was sadly not uncommon in mid-1800s USA). What I am concerned about is the use of Pike quotes (or any other quote for that matter) to insinuate that Freemasonry was/and thus is/ anti-catholic as well. I believe you when you say that is not your intent... but in the context of this article (which is very negative in its view of Freemasonry if not POV), that is how it comes across. Let me think about the issue for a while... perhaps I can come up with language that solves my problem and meets with your approval. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:19, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A follow-up thought on Pike... one that goes to your statement that Pike's views mattered: I suspect that the only reason that Pike's views ever came to the attention of the Vatican was due to his being used in the Taxil Hoax (which occured after Pike had died). I would be interested to find out if the Vatican had even <i>heard</i> of him during his lifetime. On the Masonic side, almost as soon as Pike died, the Southern Jurisdiction began to distance themselves from his views. The preface from Morals and Dogma includes a specific statement saying (in effect), "this is Pike's oppinion and not that of AASR". I doubt they would have included such a statement if he was as influential as you imply. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:13, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pike was the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Souther Jurisdiction for many years of the Scottish Rite. Now that may be an honorary position, but it certainly sounds important to those of us without leather aprons. For sixty years Morals and Dogma was given to all who joined the Southern jurisdiction of the Southern Rite. He's described by <a href="http://www.freemason.org/cfo/mar_apr_2002/pike.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freemason.org/cfo/mar_apr_2002/pike.htm" rel="nofollow">the California Freemason</a> as "the all-time Goliath of Freemasonry" and by <a href="http://www.masonicinfo.com/pike.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.masonicinfo.com/pike.htm" rel="nofollow">masonicinfo.com</a> as "among the most influential Masons of his time". He was an important figure, and in late nineteenth century Masonry it mattered what he thought. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 14:05, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite accounts for less than 20% of American Freemasonry... even at the time, most Freemasons NEVER HEARD of Albert Pike. He is know to scholars because he wrote a great big book full of his musings on comparative mythology. The only reason he is not long forgotten is that he was used by Taxil in his hoax. Even when Morals and Dogma was given to those who joined SJ, most of them never even opened it. In short... Pike is overblown by Anti-masons. but all this is besides the point ... the real point is that you are using his quotes to insinuate that there is currently a bias against Cathlics in modern American Freemasonry, which is not true. It is true that you don't actually say this... but given the context, you hint at it strongly. So... either cut the quote or majorly change the sentence it is linked to to make it VERY clear that the author was but one person, with little authority in American Freemsonry... and that his bias is not to be taken as speaking for the entire fraternity, then or now. I may have to tag this. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:38, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Blueboar, the point is that the Catholic Church (especially in the late 19th-early 20th Century) thought that Freemasonry in the less anti-clerical countries was very sympathetic to the Latin lodges and their anti-clerical actions. It may have been inappropriate to quote Pike, but they did quote Pike.</dd>
<dd>I have change the "a Freemason" to "the eminent and influential Freemason Albert Pike". He <b>is</b> claimed to be influential on Masonic sites. I didn't find a Masonic site that says that Albert Pike was in fact a mad old coot, and I did look a bit. If there is please cite it (and I would suggest that you try to change the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Albert Pike">Albert Pike</a> page first as otherwise the two pages will contradict one another). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 19:13, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, it would be good to sort out how influential Pike was in Freemasonry. This is clearly a big issue in the religious criticism of Masonry. I know your view of Pike but I would respectfully suggest that this is not the unanimous Masonic view. I have a feeling it is not the majority view, but am prepared to be proved wrong. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 19:18, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've added some dates to give context to show that this was in the past. I hope that this removes any implied bias to claim that Pike speaks for Freemasons now. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 19:45, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you disagree that the quote "Today, some Masons will diminish Pike's importance so as to deflect the charges of anti-Masons. There is no doubt, though, that he was among the most influential Masons of his time." from <a href="http://www.masonicinfo.com/pike.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.masonicinfo.com/pike.htm" rel="nofollow">masonicinfo.com</a> is relevant to Pike's influence on Freemasonry in the late Nineteenth century?

<dd>Yes, I most definitely disagree. Although I will allow the hesitation to say that it depends on what you say his influence was... as the man who basicly recreated the Scotish Rite in the Southern US in a form he liked, and as the man who helped that organization to grow into the largest Scotish Rite Jursidiction in the world... sure, he was infuential. As a ritualist, comparative Mythologyst, writer, scholar, etc... I would have to say that he was not all that influential, even in his own time. Outside his Jurisdiction no one paid him any attention. And certainly he is not influential at all today... the AASR Southern Jurisdiction no longer uses his rituals or his writing. As you are using him to make statements about the entire fraternity, I would have to say that he is most definitely NOT influential. Imfamous, perhaps, but influential... no. 00:06, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've attempted once or twice now to clarify the relationship between the Scottish Rite and Freemasonry, it appears that I've not been succesful. Despite that I'll try again. SR is an appendant body to Freemasonry, it draws its membership from Master Masons but has no authority over the craft, take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_Masonic_jurisdictions_8785.html" title="Regular Masonic jurisdictions">Regular Masonic jurisdictions</a> for UGLEs view that it recognises no higher authority or Supreme Council. Pike wrote on the Scottish Rite in the Southern USA, hence his writings have no authority over Freemasons in the craft and indeed SR/ A&amp;AR masons outside the SJ.</dd>
<dd>As to the veracity of Pikes writings, it's likely that a member of Quatuor Coronati has written something on him, I'll take a look at the copies of AQC I have later on, but I only have about 10 years worth of them, so it might involve going to Great Queen Street to take a look at the library. As to the level of acceptance his words have within the community. I would suggest that it is more likely that those who actively participate in the discussion or promotion of FM on the web are also active Masons, hence more likely to be involved or associated with the appendant bodies or the running and government of the craft. These brethren are more likely to be aware of additional sources such as Pike. As such the impression given from web sources is unlikely to be representative of Freemasonry as a whole, as Blueboar points out the proportion of Masons who are members of the SR is relatively small.</dd>
<dd>The fact remains that this distinction is not drawn by various sources hostile to Freemasonry, it should be clear that to do so would weaken the arguments, engaging in a detailed and subtle discussion of the relationship between various organisations which use symbolism in a range of ways does not lend itself to tabloid style condemnation.ALR 09:42, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The issue is whether Pike was ‘’representative’’ and ‘’influential’’ within Freemasonry in the ‘’’late Nineteenth Century’’’, not today.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Pike may be a mad old coot who no-one listened to in the late Nineteenth Century, but that is at the moment an uncited view (although that will probably change), whereas the idea that he was influential is not only attested by the Catholic Encyclopedia (making the quote citeable ’’for that reason alone’’ in an article which is largely about ‘’Catholic attitudes towards Freemasonry’’) but is also attested by two Masonic apologist sites – meaning that it was at least arguable that the Catholic Encyclopedia was reasonable in putting the quotation in as representative. Masonicinfo.com and California Freemason may be less important in the Masonic scheme of things than the Masonic editors who edit here, but they are more citable.</dd>

<dd>ALR, points taken. However (1) does any of this mean that Pike wasn’t taken as representative by the Catholic Church? No and for this reason alone the quote should be included. (2) Does it mean that Pike was not influential in the late Nineteenth Century as opposed to the early Twenty First? No (and masonicinfo.com directly contradicts this idea). (3) Are any of the arguments by you and Blueboar sourced and cited? No.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Pike spoke for the SJ of the SR. Blueboar may be able to provide that as a positive statement. I would suggest it's a little disingenuous to ask for a negative citation. Your argument to be that this had a significant influence on Craft Masonry at the end of the 19th Century. I think it'll be a struggle to find a citation that <i>says</i> that it doesn't apply to Craft Masonry worldwide, given the absence of any global FM hierarchy, but it can be demonstrated that the potential influence is much smaller than is implied.</dd>

<dd>Craft Masonry recognises no higher authority is made clear in the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_Masonic_jurisdictions_8785.html" title="Regular Masonic jurisdictions">Regular Masonic jurisdictions</a> article where the Aims and Relationships of the Craft are both linked and included. UGLE is not in amity with any GL which recognises the higher authority of a Supreme Council. Given that the list of GLs in amity with UGLE includes both Grand Lodges and Prince Hal Grand Losges in all the US states covered by SJ it can be seen that SJ has no authority over the craft within it's geographic constraints.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>As to the RCC reinforcing it's own position by conflating SJ SR with Craft Masonry? I'd suggest that it is reasonable to state the RCC position but to make clear in the article where the arguments presented by the RCC do not accurately reflect the reality of the organisation. That allows the reader to come to their own conclusions.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>As to your last point, IMO it doesn't matter what Pike said, the point is that it has little to do with the Craft Masonry which the vast majority of Masons belong to. I'm not sure what the statistics are but feel sure that compiling and analysing them would probably constitute original research. I know there was a peper delived to Quatuor Coronati about 4 years ago which analysed trends in Craft membership numbers but that wouldn't apply. For the UK I suppose one could compare the numbers of lodges, the numbers of A&amp;AR Chapters.ALR 13:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, let's try this again...</p>
<ul>
<li>Pike is a beloved figure for those who are members of the Southern Jurisdiction AASR... he basicly founded the organization as we know it. So, of course, nobody wants to say he was a loony old coot on Masonic web sites.</li>
<li>Pike <i>was</i> influential devising the rituals of the SJ AASR. BUT...</li>
<li>AASR is but a tiny part of Freemasonry. The <b>vast</b> majority of Freemasons world wide do not belong to any verison of Scottish Rite, and indeed have never even heard of it or of Pike... This was even more true in the 1800s when they didn't have instant communications and web pages etc. to look things up on.</li>
<li>In the US, only about 30% of all Freemasons belong to Scottish Rite ... and about half of these belong to the Northern Jurisdiction, over which Pike NEVER had any influence. This was also true in the 1800s.</li>
<li>Pike <b>HAS</b> become known to Anti-Masons, because Leo Taxil used his name in his Hoax. But for that, Pike would probably be long forgotten.</li>
<li>Because he appeared in Taxil's Hoax, Anti-Masons have poured through his obscure (and at times bizzar) writings looking for quotes that they can take out of context to say: "see Masons believe such and such". If they can not find a quote they like, they will make one up... because they know that few people will bother to open Pike's great big heavy book and verify it.</li>
</ul>
<p>IN SHORT: In the 1800s, Pike had very little influence on Freemasonry. Today he has even less. However, Pike has had a huge influence on Anti-Masonry. If you want to say something along those line fine, but make sure that you tripple check anything you quote Pike as saying... because we will be cite checking you. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:53, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that you have both missed the point. I asked you for a citation that said what you have. If Pike is not influential in Freemasonry and his name has been misused by anti-Masons then surely there must be some credible Masonic source that says "We love Pike, but he's mad", or words to that effect. I tell you what, if you can do that I will go over the the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Albert Pike">Albert Pike</a> page and put that in. (I'd suggest that you do the same with all this stuff). At the moment it is your views of Pike's relevance that are driving this.

<p>No your both wrong. Albert Pike was pardoned by Andrew JOHNSON after the Civil War. And yes, he was a brother Mason. He also wasn't convicted of treason. What happened was "he formed a brigade composed of Indian soldiers. Their only serious battle was at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, in 1862 and it was a loss. Worse, reports were circulated that at least one Union soldier had been scalped. This was a terrible black mark against Pike and his brigade, as well as the Confederate cause, and he was eventually forced to hightail it into the Arkansas woods to avoid prosecution."-Secrets of the Widows Son, David A.
