<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pierrepoint_25e1.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Albert Pierrepoint was by far the most prolific British hangman of the twentieth century. In office between <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, he is credited with having executed an estimated 433 men and 17 women, including 6 US soldiers at <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepton_Mallet_ecbc.html" title="Shepton Mallet">Shepton Mallet</a> and some 200 <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> after the Second World War. The number of executions was never confirmed by himself; he even declined to give a precise number when giving testimony to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment of 1949, and the precise number has never been verified; the most accurate being in Steve Fielding's 2006 book on the Pierrepoint Family.</p>
<p>Albert Pierrepoint was born on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">30 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton.html" title="Clayton">Clayton</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford.html" title="Bradford">Bradford</a>, the middle child and eldest son of Henry and Mary Pierrepoint. He was plainly influenced by the side-occupation of his father and uncle, writing as an 11-year old in response to a school "When I grow up..." exercise "When I leave school I should like to be the Official Executioner..." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Albert spent his school summer holidays at the home of his uncle Tom and aunt Lizzie in Clayton, his own family having moved to Huddersfield when Henry ceased to be an executioner, and he became very close to his uncle. While Tom was away on business, his aunt would allow Albert to read the diary Tom kept of his executions. In 1917, at the age of twelve and a half, he began work at the Marlborough Mills in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Failsworth.html" title="Failsworth">Failsworth</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, earning six shillings a week. Following Henry's death in 1922, Albert took charge of Henry's papers and diaries, which he studied at length. Towards the end of the 1920s he changed his career, becoming a horse drayman for a wholesale grocer, delivering goods ordered through a travelling salesman. In 1930 he learned to drive a car and a lorry to make his deliveries, earning two pounds five shillings (£2.25) a week. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">19 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> Albert wrote to the Prison Commissioners offering his services as an Assistant Executioner to his uncle should he or any other executioner retire. Within a few days he received a reply that there were currently no vacancies. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1931 Lionel Mann, an assistant of five years' experience, resigned when his employers informed him that his sideline was affecting his promotion prospects, and Albert received an official envelope inviting him to an interview at Manchester's <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangeways_Prison_5564.html" title="Strangeways Prison">Strangeways Prison</a>; his mother Mary, having seen many such envelopes in Henry's time as an executioner, was not happy at Albert's career choice. After a weeks' training course at London's <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentonville_Prison_38ff.html" title="Pentonville Prison">Pentonville Prison</a>, Albert was added to the List of Assistant Executioners on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">26 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>. At that time, the assistant's fee was £1 11s 6d per execution, with another £1 11s 6d paid two weeks later if his conduct and behaviour were satisfactory. Executioners and their assistants were required to be extremely discreet and conduct themselves in a respectable manner, especially avoiding contact with the press.</p>
<p>There were few executions in Britain in the summer and autumn of 1932 and the first execution Albert attended was in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">29 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> when his uncle Thomas was chief executioner at the hanging of Patrick McDermott and engaged Albert as assistant executioner (having previously shown Albert his duties, as Henry had over 20 years earlier literally "shown him the ropes"), even though Albert had not yet observed a hanging in England and thus, despite being on the Home Office list of approved Assistant Executioners, was not yet allowed to officiate in England. Albert's first execution as chief executioner was that of gangster Antonio Mancini at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentonville_%28HM_Prison%29_7a9e.html" title="Pentonville (HM Prison)">Pentonville</a> prison, London, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, who said "Cheerio!" before the trapdoor was sprung.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> Albert married Anne Fletcher, who had run a sweet shop and tobacconists' shop two doors from the grocery shop where Albert worked, and they set up home at East Street, Newton Heath, Manchester. The couple did not discuss Albert's "other career" until after Albert had to travel to Gibraltar in January 1944 to conduct a double execution; although Anne had known about it for many years she refused to ask him about it, waiting for Albert to discuss the subject.</p>
<p>Following the Second World War the British occupation authorities conducted a series of trials of concentration camp staff, and from the initial <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belsen.html" title="Belsen">Belsen</a> Trial eleven death sentences were handed down in November 1945. It was agreed that Albert Pierrepoint would conduct the executions and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">11 December</a> he flew to Germany for the first time to execute the eleven, plus two other Germans convicted of murdering an <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_4f12.html" title="RAF">RAF</a> pilot in the Netherlands in March 1945. Over the next four years, Albert was to travel to Germany and Austria twenty five times to execute two hundred war criminals. The press discovered Albert's identity and he became a celebrity, being hailed as a sort of war hero, meting out justice to the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazis.html" title="Nazis">Nazis</a>. The very substantial boost in income provided by the German executions allowed Albert to leave the grocery business, and he and Anne took over the running of a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_house.html" title="Public house">pub</a> on Manchester Road, Hollinwood, between <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham.html" title="Oldham">Oldham</a> and Manchester, named somewhat memorably <i>"Help the Poor Struggler"</i>, which allowed for plenty of journalistic puns. As a pub landlord, Albert was an affable character and his reputation brought coach loads of curious trippers to the pub. He later moved to another pub, the <i>"Rose and Crown"</i> at Hoole, near <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston.html" title="Preston">Preston</a>.</p>
<p>Albert Pierrepoint resigned in 1956 over a disagreement with the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Office_c781.html" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> about his fees. In January 1956 he had gone to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangeways.html" title="Strangeways">Strangeways</a> Prison, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, to <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officiate.html" title="Officiate">officiate</a> at the execution of Thomas Bancroft, who was reprieved less than twelve hours before his scheduled execution, when Pierrepoint was already present making his preparations - the first time in his career that this had happened in England. He claimed his full fee of £15 but the under-sheriff of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> offered only £1, as the rule in England was that the executioner was only paid for executions carried out - in Scotland he would have been paid in full. Pierrepoint appealed to his employers, the Prison Commission, who refused to get involved. The under-sheriff sent him a cheque for £4 in full and final settlement of his incidental travel and hotel expenses (Pierrepoint having been unable to return home that day because of heavy snow). The official story is that Pierrepoint's pride in his position as Britain's Chief Executioner was insulted, and he resigned, however there is evidence that he had already decided to resign, and had previously been in discussion with the editor of the <i>Empire News and Sunday Chronicle</i> for a series <i>"The Hangman's Own Story"</i> revealing the last moments of many of the notorious criminals he executed, for a fee equivalent to £500,000 in today's' money<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. It is no coincidence that the year Pierrepoint resigned, 1956, was the only year before abolition where not a single execution took place — he was the only executioner in British history whose notice of resignation prompted the government to write to him begging him to reconsider, such was the reputation he had established as the most efficient and swiftest executioner in British history, although on learning of the proposed newspaper series the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Office_c781.html" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> did consider prosecuting Albert under the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_Secrets_Act_a58a.html" title="Official Secrets Act">Official Secrets Act</a> before deciding it would be counterproductive; they did however pressure the newspaper publishers so that the series eventually fizzled out. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Albert Pierrepoint is often referred to as Britain's last hangman, but this is not true — executions continued until <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">13 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> when <a href="../../../g/w/y/Gwynne_Owen_Evans_8cd4.html" title="Gwynne Owen Evans">Gwynne Owen Evans</a> was hanged at 8.00 a.m. at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangeways_Prison_5564.html" title="Strangeways Prison">Strangeways Prison</a> by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Allen_8805.html" title="Harry Allen">Harry Allen</a>, while <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Anthony_Allen_193f.html" title="Peter Anthony Allen">Peter Anthony Allen</a> was hanged simultaneously at Walton Prison, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Leslie_Stewart_1bab.html" title="Robert Leslie Stewart">Robert Leslie Stewart</a>, both for the murder in a robbery of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Alan_West_4db2.html" title="John Alan West">John Alan West</a>. He was however the last official Chief Hangman for the United Kingdom (and, for a time, the unofficial one for the Republic of Ireland, along with his uncle, Thomas).</p>
<p>Albert and Anne Pierrepoint retired to the seaside town of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southport.html" title="Southport">Southport</a>, where he died on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">10 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> in a nursing home where he had lived for the last four years of his life.</p>
<p>A film about Pierrepoint's life was made in 2005. <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Spall_0beb.html" title="Timothy Spall">Timothy Spall</a> stars as Pierrepoint. The film went on general UK release in April 2006 under the title <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierrepoint_%28film%29.html" title="Pierrepoint (film)"><i>Pierrepoint</i></a> and is to be released in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> under the (factually inaccurate) title <i>The Last Hangman</i>.</p>

<p>Among the notable people he hanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>13 German war criminals - <a href="../../../i/r/m/Irma_Grese_e42a.html" title="Irma Grese">Irma Grese</a>, the youngest concentration camp guard to be executed for crimes at <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belsen.html" title="Belsen">Belsen</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auschwitz.html" title="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> (aged 22), <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Volkenrath_ac30.html" title="Elisabeth Volkenrath">Elisabeth Volkenrath</a> (Belsen &amp; Auschwitz), and <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juana_Bormann_701b.html" title="Juana Bormann">Juana Bormann</a> (Auschwitz), plus ten men including <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Kramer_f07c.html" title="Josef Kramer">Josef Kramer</a>, the Commandant of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. All were executed at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hameln.html" title="Hameln">Hameln</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_13.html" title="December 13">13 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> at half-hour intervals, the women being hanged individually, the men in pairs.</li>

He was described by Albert as "the bravest man I ever hanged", he greeted his executioner with the words "Oh! Pierrepoint." The executioner, however, took the proffered hand only to put the pinioning strap on, and replied nothing. Hanged at <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandsworth_%28HM_Prison%29_cafd.html" title="Wandsworth (HM Prison)">Wandsworth Prison</a>, London, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></li>

The execution was carried out despite pleas for clemency by large numbers of people including 200 Members of Parliament, the widow of Miles, and the recommendation of the jury in the trial. After a long campaign, Bentley received a posthumous pardon in July 1993. An article written by Pierrepoint for <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper, but withheld until the pardon was made, dispelled the myth that Bentley had cried on his way to the scaffold. Right until the last, he believed he would be reprieved. In 1998, the Court of Appeal ruled that Bentley's conviction was "unsafe" and quashed it.</li>

It was subsequently discovered that Evans' neighbour <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Reginald_Christie_1064.html" title="John Reginald Christie">John Reginald Christie</a>, a self-confessed necrophiliac, was a multiple murderer, who was also executed by Pierrepoint on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> at Pentonville.

The reason for this seems to be a combination of the experiences of his father, his uncle, and himself, whereupon reprieves were granted in accordance with political expediency or public fancy and little to do with the merits of the case in question. He had also been forced to hang <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Corbitt_87fd.html" title="James Corbitt">James Corbitt</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">28 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>; Corbitt was a regular in his pub, "Help The Poor Struggler", and had sung "Danny Boy" as a duet with Albert on the night he murdered his girlfriend in a fit of jealousy because she would not give up a second boyfriend. This incident in particular made Albert feel that hanging was no deterrent, particularly when most of the people he was executing had killed in the heat of the moment rather than with premeditation or in furtherance of a robbery.</p>
<p>But Pierrepoint kept his opinions to himself on the topic until his 1974 autobiography, <i>Executioner: Pierrepoint</i>, in which he commented:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I have come to the conclusion that executions solve nothing, and are only an antiquated relic of a primitive desire for revenge which takes the easy way and hands over the responsibility for revenge to other people...The trouble with the death penalty has always been that nobody wanted it for everybody, but everybody differed about who should get off."</dd>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> Henry Pierrepoint (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>) was appointed to the list of executioners after repeatedly writing to the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Office_c781.html" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> to offer his services. He later persuaded his elder brother Thomas to join the family business and influenced his son Albert to do the same. In his nine-year term of office Henry carried out 105 <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_%28legal%29.html" title="Execution (legal)">executions</a>. His career was finished when he arrived the day before an execution at Chelmsford prison "considerably the worse for drink", and fought his assistant <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ellis_%28executioner%29_a771.html" title="John Ellis (executioner)">John Ellis</a>. Ellis reported the incident to the Home Office which decided, after receiving confirmation by the warders' account of the matter, to strike Henry from the list of approved executioners. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pierrepoint_25e1.html" title="Edit section: Thomas William Pierrepoint">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Thomas William Pierrepoint</span></h3>
<p>Thomas Pierrepoint (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>) worked as a hangman for 37 years until his mid-seventies in 1946. He is credited with having carried out 294 hangings in his career, although no precise figure has been verified, as some of these were in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. During the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> he was appointed as executioner by the US Military and was responsible for the hanging at the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepton_Mallet_ecbc.html" title="Shepton Mallet">Shepton Mallet</a> military prison in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a> of several US soldiers for murder or rape, assisted by his nephew Albert.</p>
<p>In 1940, his medical fitness for the job was questioned by a Medical Officer who called him "unsecure" and doubted "whether his sight was good". The Prison Commission discreetly asked for reports on his performance during executions in the following time, but evidently found no reason to take action, although one report said that Thomas Pierrepoint had "smelled strongly of drink" on two occasions when reporting at the prison.</p>
<p>Note: Henry was never officially "dismissed" or Thomas "retired", rather their names were removed from the list of executioners and invitations to conduct executions ceased to arrive. Albert formally demanded that his name be removed from the list, thus he "resigned".</p>
