His father, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Parke_d910.html" title="Harry Parke">Harry Einstein</a>, was a comedian who performed on <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cantor_dc6c.html" title="Eddie Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>'s <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> program and was known as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Parke_d910.html" title="Harry Parke">Parkyarkarkus</a>.

He changed his surname from <i>Einstein</i> (to avoid confusion with the famous <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">scientist</a>) and began a stand-up comedy career that quickly made him a regular on <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_show.html" title="Variety show">variety</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_show.html" title="Talk show">talk shows</a> during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on the NBC network <i>Tonight Show</i> starring <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Carson_bdcc.html" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a>. His onstage persona, that of an egotistical, narcissistic, nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other 70's <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-modern.html" title="Post-modern">post-modern</a> comedians, including <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Martin_d496.html" title="Steve Martin">Steve Martin</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Mull_f913.html" title="Martin Mull">Martin Mull</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Kaufman_e7aa.html" title="Andy Kaufman">Andy Kaufman</a>.</p>
<p>After two successful comedy albums, <i>Comedy Minus One</i> (1974) and the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a>-nominated <i>A Star is Bought</i> (1975), Brooks left the standup circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker; his first film, <i>The Famous Comedians School</i>, was a satiric short which appeared on <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> and was an early example of the <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mockumentary.html" title="Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> sub-genre.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_television.html" title="1975 in television">1975</a>, he directed six short films for the first season of <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i>:</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_film.html" title="1976 in film">1976</a> he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Scorsese_e0ab.html" title="Martin Scorsese">Scorsese's</a> landmark <i><a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxi_Driver_2c80.html" title="Taxi Driver">Taxi Driver</a></i> (Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue).

<p>Brooks directed his first feature film, <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Life_%28movie%29_332d.html" title="Real Life (movie)">Real Life</a></i>, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_in_film.html" title="1979 in film">1979</a>.

<p>Through the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator Monica Johnson), directed and starred in a series of moderately-successful comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_film.html" title="1981 in film">1981's</a> <i><a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Romance_92ce.html" title="Modern Romance">Modern Romance</a></i>, where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathryn_Harrold_db97.html" title="Kathryn Harrold">Kathryn Harrold</a>). The film received a limited release and ultimately grossed under $3 million domestically,<sup id="_ref-modgross_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-modgross" title="">[1]</a></sup> but was well received by critics, with one reviewer commenting that the film was "not Brooks at his best, but still amusing".<sup id="_ref-modreviews_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-modreviews" title="">[2]</a></sup> His best-received film, <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_in_America_05a4.html" title="Lost in America">Lost in America</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_in_film.html" title="1985 in film">1985</a>), featured Brooks and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Hagerty_6d89.html" title="Julie Hagerty">Julie Hagerty</a> as a couple who leave their <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">yuppie</a> lifestyle, drop out of society and live in a motor home, only to find the disadvantages of <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>.</p>
<p>Brooks's <i><a href="../../../d/e/f/Defending_Your_Life_757b.html" title="Defending Your Life">Defending Your Life</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_film.html" title="1991 in film">1991</a>) placed his lead character in the <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a>, put on trial to justify his human failings and to determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the surprising chemistry between Brooks and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meryl_Streep_159c.html" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a> as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for <i><a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_%281996_film%29.html" title="Mother (1996 film)">Mother</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_film.html" title="1996 in film">1996</a>), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writer.html" title="Writer">writer</a> moving back home to resolve his tensions with his mother (<a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbie_Reynolds_f0ec.html" title="Debbie Reynolds">Debbie Reynolds</a>). <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_film.html" title="1999 in film">1999's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Muse_92fc.html" title="The Muse">The Muse</a></i> featured Brooks as a down-and-out <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> screenwriter using the services of an authentic muse (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Stone_6701.html" title="Sharon Stone">Sharon Stone</a>) for inspiration.</p>
<p>Brooks also acted in other writers' and directors' films during the 1980s and 1990s. He moved into the horror genre in one of the stories in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Twilight_Zone%7E_The_Movie_bf33.html" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></i>, playing an unsuspecting driver who picks up a suspicious hitchhiker (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Aykroyd_730b.html" title="Dan Aykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a>). In <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_L._Brooks_b665.html" title="James L. Brooks">James L.

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005</a>, his film <i><a href="../../../l/o/o/Looking_for_Comedy_in_the_Muslim_World_e810.html" title="Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World">Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World</a></i> drew controversy for its title. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Pictures_2081.html" title="Sony Pictures">Sony Pictures</a> eventually dropped the film altogether because of their desire to change the title. Subsequently, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Independent_Pictures_03aa.html" title="Warner Independent Pictures">Warner Independent Pictures</a> purchased the film and gave it a limited release in January 2006; the film received mixed reviews and a low box office gross. The movie goes back to the days of Brooks's <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Life_%28film%29_f128.html" title="Real Life (film)">Real Life</a></i>, as Brooks once again plays himself, a filmmaker commissioned by the U.S. government to see what makes the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> people laugh, thus sending him on a tour of India and Pakistan.</p>
