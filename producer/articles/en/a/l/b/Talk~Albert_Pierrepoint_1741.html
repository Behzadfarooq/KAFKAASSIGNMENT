<p>Does anyone know where he was born? I have an idea it was in Oldham (Lancs), but have no verification of this. He certainly ran a pub called "Help the Poor Struggler" in Oldham for many years before "retiring" to Southport (Lancs) where he had a number of part-time jobs.</p>

<p>I've had to do a slight edit as it appears that someone was a little confused at the two different usages of the term "Chief Executioner" - there's the <i>title</i> of Chief Executioner as in "Chief Executioner of the United Kingdom", and the <i>role</i> of Chief Executioner, i.e. the person who was in charge of conducting the execution - calculating the drop, hooding the condemned, putting the noose around the neck, and pulling the lever to open the trap; Antonio Mancini's in 1941 was the first execution where Albert played this role, previously he was an Assistant Executioner, responsible for pinioning the condemned's legs with a belt so he couldn't try to save himself from the drop. Executions in England normally had at least one Assistant Executioner (and sometimes as many as three, as new applicants for the job were tried out to see if they had the stomach for it), but in Scotland and Ireland there was not normally an assistant (the authorities would have had to pay his fees, and they were loath to do this!). In England, it was normally the under-sheriff of the county concerned who hired the Chief Executioner, while the prison governor hired the assistant. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 00:06, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going to say desertion most likely, but a quick check discovers that only one US soldier was executed for desertion in WWII, one <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Slovik_e399.html" title="Eddie Slovik">Eddie Slovik</a> and he was executed by firing squad in France.

<dd>We need to change the article - Albert was only assistant executioner at 6 executions at Shepton Mallet - it was Tom who was the chief executioner at all the American executions. The Steve Fielding book says that Albert was disturbed by the length of time the condemned spent in the executioners' company at the American hangings - in a normal British execution they'd be dead in within 10 - 60 seconds, but the Americans were stood on the trap and then had to wait for about five minutes while the charge was read, sentence spelt out, and the prisoner asked for any last statement.</dd>

<dd>Any idea about the two extra executions claimed by the document I quoted above? <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 02:59, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not at all sure. There may have been some executions before then, conducted by American hangmen, which didn't go too well which is why the UK government insisted that a British hangman be employed, using British procedures. The American method of hanging was to use a standard 5-foot drop which did not ensure the breaking of the neck and instant death; the British method was the long drop of between 5' (for 200 lbs clients) and 8' 6" (for clients of 118 lbs or less). I have reservations about the total accuracy of the Fielding book, as in the lists of Thomas' executions Albert is listed as the assistant at the 11-08-1944 executions, but they don't appear in the list of Albert's executions.

<p>OK, a little off-topic here, but there seem to be lots of references to this nonsense idea that breaking the neck causes instant death.

<dd>Is there any evidence for this at all? I can't think of any reason separation of the spinal cord should cause unconsciousness. There are well-attested reports of severed heads exhibiting signs of consciousness after guillotining. I also note that the condemned man's head is traditionally covered in a hanging, which would make it impossible to see these signs. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 22:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even if that's so, I still see no reason at all why severing the spinal cord should cause unconsciousness. Is there any evidence that it does? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:18, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Apparently you found no such evidence, or you'd have mentioned it. Your link to Lavoisier led me to <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_262.html" class="external text" title="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_262.html" rel="nofollow">this Straight Dope column</a>, in which a Dr. Fink observes that people "have remained alert after having their spinal cords severed".</p>
<p>I think in the absence of countervailing evidence, the default conclusion is clear: Severing the spinal cord does <i>not</i> cause unconsciousness, per se. A hanged person most likely remains conscious until hypoxia takes over (though it's conceivable he might be stunned by the <i>concussion</i>, but this is hardly "deep unconsciousness"). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:55, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No I got bored of doing your searches for you. I don't find the comment for "Dr Fink" conclusive (no supporting instances described), certainly not in the case of hanging as opposed to decapitation. But what do I know? If you read the rest of the article that I put at the top of this section you will see that it suggests that a measured drop execution "properly carried out" has been observed to lead to apparent unconciousness (you suggest this is merely paralysis) in several studies. It asserts that the suggestion that it "causes instantaneous loss of consciousness, seems highly probable" and concludes with - "Carried out carefully and humanely, using an accurately measured drop and modern noose, hanging is possibly the least cruel way to execute a criminal.". BTW I'm not in favour of capital punishment in any form. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 02:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My impression is that the author of that article <i>is</i> an advocate of capital punishment, and specifically of hanging. He does not adduce the slightest evidence in favor of his claim that hanging causes instant unconsciousness. I don't think he has any. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:15, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well you're right in at least one respect in that he does indeed appear to be an advocate of capital punishment.

<dd>Yeah I meant to comment on that, you have to scroll a huge amount to the left. I briefly tried to fix it but couldn't get the layout right. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 22:24, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So can we remove it from the article and just put it in the talk page. It's great that someone took the time to do it but, until it can be made into a more 'concise' chart, it doesnt look right in the article.

<p>The Biography section is now quite large. I don't think that any of it needs getting rid of. But, i do think that it would be a good idea to split it up a bit more.

<p>Surely if a hangman discovered that the person he was supposed to hang was a friend of his there should have been the possibility for him to declare himself as too involved to perform the execution? Maybe this possibility existed but Albert decided against it&#160;? 89.8.39.9 00:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Answers: (a) Pierrepoint did not know that the man about to be executed was his customer "Tish" until a prison warden, on the day before the execution, told him so. At that moment it would have been a bit troublesome to withdraw from the job: The authorities would have either have had to find a replacement executioner at the shortest possible notice, or to stay the execution until someone had been found.</dd>
<dd>(b) Pierrepoint always said that Corbitt was not a "friend", just a customer of his pub whom he knew by his nickname only.</dd>
<dd>(c) Pierrepoint was in the habit of saying that when he entered the condemned cell, it was not Albert Pierrepoint who came in but the arm of the law. He was obviously able, to a high degree, to block out all his personal feelings. Call it artificial schizophrenia, if you like.</dd>
<dd>(d) I think I read somewhere that an executioner who declined to do a specific job - except when he was unavailable because employed at the same time elsewhere - risked his standing with the authorities.--<a href="../../../k/a/u/User%7EKauko56_9e5c.html" title="User:Kauko56">Kauko56</a> 10:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>ad (d): it was Syd Dernley, who wrote in his book, that declining a job could lead to withrawal from the list of executioners. Jonny1044</p>
