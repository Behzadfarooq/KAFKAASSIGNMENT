<p><i>Hitler supposedly had a weakness for the young and handsome Speer, whose designs were considered expressions of National Socialist principles.</i></p>
<p>What is implied by that? <a href="../../../c/p/r/User%7ECprompt_297d.html" title="User:Cprompt">cprompt</a></p>
<p>I’ve changed it to “Hitler was always a strong supporter of Speer”. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 22:12, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The original sentence did not suggest any homosexual affection whatsoever. It simply implied that Hitler saw in Speer as he would have liked to be himself. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttens_60ac.html" title="User:Ottens">Ottens</a> 20:39, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I've augmented this, providing a bit of explanation why the two developed a strong relationship: "Hitler was always a strong supporter of Speer, in part because of Hitler's own frustrated artistic and architectural visions. A strong affinity developed between Hitler and the ambitious young architect early in their professional relationship. For Speer, serving as architect for the head of the German state and being given virtual carte blanche as to expenses, presented a tremendous opportunity. For Hitler, Speer personified a talented architect capable of translating Hitler's grandiose visions into tangible designs which expressed what Hitler felt were National Socialist principles." -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonRoma_fb06.html" title="User:JonRoma">JonRoma</a> 19:29, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To my knowledge, Speer always admired Hitler. Please check someone this "assassination" story. Does not seem believable!?</p>
<p>Secondly, it was Eichmann who engineered the logistics of extermination. Speer worked on the logistics of armaments and labor. If his role in Holocaust was true and verifiable, he would have hung!</p>

<dd>Speer started the "assassination" story back in 1945 debriefings. And yes, prolonging the war, and slave labor where what he was accused of (and he admitted it himself), had he been involved in the final solution, he would have ended up on the gallows. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 22:09, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

QUESTION: Understand the following: In late 1990s/early 2000s, after Speer's death, examination of the RAF photos of Hitler's bunker directly contradicted the timeline Speer gave for the assassination attempt. Does this constitute "scant evidence" or "evidence indicates that he did not?"</p>
<p>Aha! Should not though his post-Nuremberg word be taken with caution? I could imagine Speer as a great admirer of Hitler who woke up by 1946 or 1947 and though ... "My God! How foolish was I to follow this blundering madman?". Perhaps "scorched earth" policy of March 19 made him furious and for a moment in anger he though "I would like to kill this Hilter bastard". Then a few years later he might cover up for his foolish trust in the "leader" by converting a momentary thought of anger into an imaginary plot. Sort of self-defense, perhaps partly based on self-delusion? No idea. Just speculating on little knowledge.</p>
<p>Of what I know Speer seems a technical mind, efficient, intelligent, well-organized, and blindly following the leadership (nearly up to the end). Thoughts of assassination just do not fit this model. He seemed too "mild" and too much focused on the creative side of building the "great" Reich</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that is one of the problems with that segment of Inside the Third Reich. It is a little convenient that his plan was foiled, and that he was never punished like other conspirators were, or that no one else seems to have known about it...but it does seem to be true that he was actively working against Hitler's scorched earth policy. Perhaps he never did try to kill him though. I think it still warrants a mention in the article, though it might be amended to say he only claimed to have tried. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 14:47, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speer did not claim that he <b>tried</b> to kill Hitler; his autobiography only states that he <b>contemplated</b> procuring poison gas and <b>investigated</b> introducing it into the ventilation system in the Führerbunker during the last months of the war. Speer states that he abandoned it as impractical; it may have been so, or this may have been skittishness about taking so drastic a step. Nevertheless, merely thinking about it doesn't constitute an attempt. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonRoma_fb06.html" title="User:JonRoma">JonRoma</a> 18:47, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Roadrunner, Speer's refusal to carry the scorched earth policy is a documented fact. He even made sure that some trusted employees had weapons to defend mines against destruction by the SS. Read e.g. Sereny's book. He also used the anti-defaitist arguments to convince people. He asked managers of plants whether they believed that their plant would be re-captured by the Wehrmacht. These managers had to say yes otherwise they would get prosecuted for defaitism. And then Speer answered that this was the reason that they shouldn't be destroyed. Of course, Speer knew that the German army was not able to re-capture the plants. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:46, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states that "Speer's first commission as a Party member came in 1933 when Goebbels asked him to renovate the Propaganda ministry..." However, more accurately, after joining the Nazi party in 1931 Speer was asked to renovate the home of the Nazi official in Berlin (Karl Hanke), then given the more difficult task of rebuilding the party headquarters in Berlin. Upon completion of this work which inpressed the Nazi leadership, Speer was commissioned to renovate the Propaganda ministry.</p>

<p><i>Although Goebbels' performance offended Speer, he could not shake the impressions Hitler made on him. The next day he joined the Nazi Party</i>. Are you sure? I think Speer joined the Nazi party on the 5th of December, 1930 the day after he heard Hitler (not Goebbels) speak for the first time. You could probably also add Speer's comment to Sereny: <i>[he] found that [Hitler] bore a note of reasonable modesty</i>.</p>
<p><i>Speer's first commission as a Party member came in 1933 when Goebbels asked him to renovate the Propaganda Ministry.</i> I think Speer's first commission as a party member was redesigning the Berlin Party HQ <i>Adolf Hitler House</i> not the Propaganda Ministry.</p>
<p>I don't think Speer redesigned the Reich Chancellery itself, but, rather, the official residence in the Reich Chancellery for Hitler. (They may be one and the same, however).</p>
<p><i>capable of holding two hundred and forty thousand people. At the 1934 Party rally on the parade grounds, Speer surrounded the site with one hundred and fifty anti-aircraft searchlights.</i></p>
<p>I think there were 130 not 150 searchlights. Plus I think the Zeppelin Field could hold 340,000 not 240,000.</p>
<p><br />
<i>During his involvement in the rebuilding of Berlin, he was allegedly responsible for the forced deportation of Jews, evicting them from their houses to make room for his grand plans and for re-housing German citizens affected by this work. He was also listed as being present at the 1943 Posen Conference, although he supposedly left early.</i> I think this needs more attention. Speer evicted 75,000 Berliner Jews during his tenure as Great Building Inspector for Tranformation of Reich Capital. This was recorded in the <i>Wolter's Chronicle</i>. While at the October 6, 1943 conference at Posen, Speer was already Armaments Minister, and so that incident should be mentioned in the next paragraph.</p>
<p><br />
Regarding the death penalty - <i>which the Soviets pushed for</i> - according to Fest, if I remember correctly, most judges were pushing for the death penalty at the trial.</p>
<p><i>This conversation, it is said, brought Hitler to tears. In spite of this reaffirmation and Speer's trip to the Führerbunker toward the final days of the war</i> - - I thought the conversation took place in the Bunker, after which Speer was arrested and therefore could not travel back to the bunker again...</p>
<p>After Speer's Mauthausen visit, it is on record that he asked that conditions be made worse for inmates. That should be mentioned. As should the fact that Speer visited other slave labour camps: Camp Dora which he called <i>the worst place I'd ever seen</i> and the Landsberg Aircraft Factory. In both instances he asked for improvements in conditions. I also think that the actual verdict for Speer should be included; the verdict mentions that Speer was the only one to have the courage to tell Hitler the war was lost and stop the senseless destruction associated with Hitler's scorched earth policy.</p>
<p><i>For example, through one of his friends, Karl Hanke, he learned of Auschwitz and the large number of deaths taking place there.</i> Technically Hanke didn't inform him about Auschwitz, but, rather, a place that existed in Silesia which Speer concluded later <i>must have been Auschwitz</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm no Speer expert or anything but I can chip in what I know (or think I know) or at least what some books tell me about a few of these things.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In Inside the Third Reich, Speer says he saw Hitler speak first, was impressed, then "a few weeks after this speech" he was taken to see Goebbels's speech and, despite not being too impressed, he went "the following day and applied to for membership in the National Socialist Party and in Janurary 1931 became Member Number 474,481." So I suppose there was something of a delay in having his membership processed, but I think the date he applied is the date that should be cited as the date of his membership</li>
<li>Regarding his first assignment: It says that he first did a some small renovations to the villa of Karl Hanke (I love that name), and Hanke in turn recommended Speer to Goebbels for the rebuilding of the "new district headquarters" that was named in honour of Hitler. Since Goebbels was the Gaulieter of Berlin (where this building was situated) this was Goebbels office. So the name "Adolf Hitler House" is kinda irrelevant</li>
<li>You're right about there being 130, not 150, searchlights, I'll change that</li>
<li>The Soviets pushed for death for pretty much all of the indicted, so that part isn't in question, but I specifically remember reading in the book "Long Knives and Short Memories" that all of the others were opposed. At first the American judge, I believe, was for it, but at the end all judges except the Soviet one were against the death sentence. I wish I could cite exact information but I don't have that book on me at the moment. I remember specifically coming to his page to change the information regarding the death penalty to what it is now after first reading it.</li>
<li>You're right that it took place in the Bunker, I'll fix that as well. The arrest thing is news to me though. Do you mean arrested by the Allies? I think there was a considerable period in between Hitler's death and his capture by the Allies</li>
<li>You should feel free to correct the information on the concentration camps bits, I don't know much about them --<a href="../../../c/l/n/User%7EClngre_1f78.html" title="User:Clngre">Clngre</a> 13:33, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Since Goebbels was the Gaulieter of Berlin (where this building was situated) this was Goebbels office. So the name "Adolf Hitler House" is kinda irrelevant</i> - Yes, but the article claims his first commission was the <i>Propaganda Ministry</i> and, as I understand it, that was a different building, redesigned at a different time.</p>
<p>Re: the death penalty - I'm quite sure most of them were for the death penalty at first - - and, as you pointed out, they changed their minds. Fest actually goes so far as to say that Jackson was hopelessly unprepared for Speer's trial, claiming that he could not fathom Hitler's apathetic style of rule and its <i>polycratic</i> nature. That could be mentioned, I suppose.</p>
<p><i>Do you mean arrested by the Allies? I think there was a considerable period in between Hitler's death and his capture by the Allies</i> - If I remember correctly, a period did elapse in which Speer may have rejoined his family in the north (I think), however during that period - and given the difficulty it took him to re-enter Berlin the first time - it would have been most difficult to go back to the bunker again. When he was arrested exactly, I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm unwilling to make the changes before I become a member - - if that's alright. Plus, given the debate surrounding Speer I think it'd be wise to leave any possible changes open for discussion first. 60.225.77.105 23:56, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Even today, German historians such as Joachim Fest tend to have a high opinion of him, while non-German historians take a lower view</i></p>
<p>Thats definitely wrong. In an interview about the german-tv movie "Speer und Er" Fest said he was personally disappointed by Speer, "Er hat uns allen eine Nase gezogen"(He punked all of us), because evidence that surfaced after Speers dead proves that he at least partly participated in the holocaust. He personly ordered Auschwitz to be enlarged, he suggested that "Jew flats" should be given to the people who lost their home by the bombings, a.o.. He told nothing of that to Fest when they worked at "Inside the Third Reich".</p>

<p>I read a biography on Herr Speer in 1998, named <b>Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth</b> [ISBN:0-330-34697], on his relationship with der Fuherer and how he grappled with the guilt he must have felt. She interviewed Speer a few years before he died. Sereny hints that Hitler and Speer had a 'homoerotic' relationship, which isn't surprising given the dynamics of their friendship. It's worth a read and offers terrific insight into Speer's troubled chracter. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeelin_10ed.html" title="User:Geelin">Geelin</a> 14:05, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I heard Speer saying in a TV documentary that his biggest mistake as minister of armament was the <a href="../../../v/-/2/V-2_rocket.html" title="V-2 rocket">V-2_rocket</a> project that needed too many resources and yielded too little. Does anyone have the name and date, editor etc. for this TV documentary? I want to add it to the article with the source.

<dd>Sounds intriguing... I guess you've tried an internet search with keywords such as "Speer", "documentary", "television", "TV", "mistake", "regret", "V-2", "V2", etc...? &#160;Regards, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> <span style="font-size:90%;">(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Kernow_cdd2.html" title="User talk:David Kernow">talk</a>)</span> 02:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Check Speer's books on the subject. I am reasonably sure he ways by the time the V2 came around, he knew the war was lost.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 03:41, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Hitler's Henchmen, 6 VHS History Channel" has one VHS tape on Albert Speer and i saw in this documentary, a 3-min segment on the rockets in which it is stated that Speer considered the V-2 to be his biggest mistake.</p>

<p>What was Speer doing in London? Had he moved there or was he just visiting? As a Nazi war criminal I'm surprised he was allowed into the country at all. Also, he was the highest ranking Nazi to appear in the ITV documentary <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_World_at_War_b085.html" title="The World at War">The World at War</a>, perhaps we should put something in about this??--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 12:00, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth, he was there to participate in a documentary. It was the second time he had been allowed into the UK. The first time, there was all sorts of fuss, as you suggest, with the authorities. The second time, there was no problem. He was still living in Germany.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 12:26, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm bothered by the ping pong of edits about the Mauthausen photo. I suggest we throw out everything in the paragraph after Speer's sentence. Frankly, a photo of Speer surrounded by prisoners doesn't prove he was aware of the Holocaust, gas chambers and all, and I doubt if the prosecution so alleged. While that was a key piece of evidence in convicting Speer on the counts he was convicted of (which really stemmed from importation of forced labor), the prosecution, as I recall, made little attempt to tie Speer to the Holocaust. If they had done so successfully, he would not have survived Nuremberg. Accordingly, either the prosecution, or the judges, did not view the photo as probative of Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 02:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
