<p>The cultural resistance was first of all expressed through the elaboration of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic confessional region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reform invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric <a href="../../../g/j/o/Gjon_Buzuku_d193.html" title="Gjon Buzuku">Gjon Buzuku</a> brought into the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a> language the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_liturgy.html" title="Catholic liturgy">Catholic liturgy</a>, trying to do for the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a> language what <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Luther</a> did for the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a>.</p>

Excerpt from <i><a href="../../../m/e/s/Meshari.html" title="Meshari">Meshari</a></i> by <a href="../../../g/j/o/Gjon_Buzuku_d193.html" title="Gjon Buzuku">Gjon Buzuku</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/s/Meshari.html" title="Meshari">Meshari</a> (The Missal) by <a href="../../../g/j/o/Gjon_Buzuku_d193.html" title="Gjon Buzuku">Gjon Buzuku</a>, published by him in <a href="../../../1/5/5/1555.html" title="1555">1555</a>, is considered to date as the first literary work of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be a result of an earlier tradition of writing Albanian, a tradition that is not known. But there are some fragmented evidence, dating earlier than Buzuku, which indicate that Albanian was written at least since <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a> AD. The first known evidence dates from 1332 AD and deals with the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antivari.html" title="Antivari">Antivari</a>, who in a report in Latin writes that Albanians use Latin letters in their books although their language is quite different from Latin. Of special importance in supporting this are: a baptizing formula (<i>Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit</i>) of <a href="../../../1/4/6/1462.html" title="1462">1462</a>, written in Albanian within a text in Latin by the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> of Durrës, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pal_Engj%C3%ABlli_87b7.html" title="Pal Engjëlli">Pal Engjëlli</a>; a glossary with Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a> fragment from the Bible according to Sant Mathew, also in Albanian, but in Greek letters.</p>
<p>Albanian writings of these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marin_Barleti_d8c5.html" title="Marin Barleti">Marin Barleti</a>, who, in his book “Rrethimi i Shkodrës” (The Siege of Shkodër) (1504), confirms that he has leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the vulgus (<i>in vernacula lingua</i>). Despite the obstacles generated by the Counter-reform which was opposed to the development of national languages in Christian religious literature, this process went on uninterrupted. During the 16th to 17th centuries, the catechism “E mbësuame krishterë” (Christian Teachings) (1592) by <a href="../../../l/e/k/Lek%C3%AB_Matr%C3%ABnga_5ee1.html" title="Lekë Matrënga">Lekë Matrënga</a>, “Doktrina e krishterë” (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and “Rituale romanum” (1621) by <a href="../../../p/j/e/Pjet%C3%ABr_Budi_2978.html" title="Pjetër Budi">Pjetër Budi</a>, the first writer of original Albanian <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prose.html" title="Prose">prose</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apology.html" title="Apology">apology</a> for George Castriot (1636) by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frang_Bardhi_85fd.html" title="Frang Bardhi">Frang Bardhi</a>, who also published a dictionary and <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> creations, the theological-philosophical treaty “Cuneus Prophetarum” (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by <a href="../../../p/j/e/Pjet%C3%ABr_Bogdani_3e7e.html" title="Pjetër Bogdani">Pjetër Bogdani</a>, the most universal personality of Albanian <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, were published in Albanian.</p>
<p>Bogdani's work is a theological-philosophical <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treatise.html" title="Treatise">treatise</a> that considers with originality, by merging data from various sources, principal issues of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, a full biblical history and the complicated problems of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholasticism.html" title="Scholasticism">scholasticism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmogony.html" title="Cosmogony">cosmogony</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedagogy.html" title="Pedagogy">pedagogy</a>, etc. Bogdani brought into Albanian culture the humanist spirit and praised the role of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> in the life of man; with his written work in a language of polished style, he marked a turning point in the history of Albanian literature.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, the literature of Orthodox and Muslim confessional cultural circles witnessed a greater development. An anonymous from <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbasan.html" title="Elbasan">Elbasan</a> brings into Albanian language a number of sections from the Bible; T. H. Filipi, also from Elbasan, brings the “Dhiata e Vjetër dhe e Re” (The Old and the New Testament). These efforts multiplied in the following century with the publication in 1827 of the integral text of the “Dhiata e Re” (The New Testament) by G. Gjirokastriti and with the big corpus of (Christian) religious translations by Konstandin Kristoforidhi (1830-1895), in both main dialects of Albanian, publications which helped in the process of integrating the two dialects into a unified literary language and in setting up the basis for the establishment of the National Church of the Albanians with the liturgy in their own language.</p>
<p>Although in opposite direction with this tendency, the culture of <a href="../../../v/o/s/Voskopoja.html" title="Voskopoja">Voskopoja</a> is also to be mentioned, a culture that during the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> became a great hearth of civilization and a metropolis of the Balkan peninsula, with an Academy and a printing press and with personalities like T. Kavaljoti, Dh. Haxhiu, G. Voskopojari, whose works of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philology.html" title="Philology">philology</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> assisted objectively in the writing and recognition of the Albanian. Although the literature that evolved in Voskopoja was mainly in Greek language, the need to erect obstacles to the islamization made necessary the use of national languages, encouraging the development of national cultures. <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walachian.html" title="Walachian">Walachian</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a> were also used for the teaching of Greek in the schools of Voskopoja, and books in Walachian were also printed in its printing presses. The works of Voskopoja writers and savants have brought in some elements of the ideas of European <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>. The most distinguished of them, Teodor Kavaljoti, is an <a href="../../../e/r/u/Erudite.html" title="Erudite">erudite</a> of the time. According to the notes of the German albanolog H.E. Thunman, the work of Kavaljoti, which remained unpublished, in most part deals with issues from almost all branches of philosophy. It shows the influence of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descartes.html" title="Descartes">Descartes</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malebranche.html" title="Malebranche">Malebranche</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibnitz.html" title="Leibnitz">Leibnitz</a>.</p>
<p>A result of the influence of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and the culture of the invader was the emergence, during <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, of a school of poetry, or of a literature written in Albanian language but by means of an Arabian alphabet. Its authors such as N. Frakulla, M. Kyçyku, S. Naibi, H.Z. Kamberi, Sh. and D. Frashëri, Sheh Mala, and others dealt in their works with motifs borrowed from Oriental literature, wrote religious texts and poetry in a language suffocated by orientalisms and developed religious <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyric.html" title="Lyric">lyric</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_poetry.html" title="Epic poetry">epic</a>. This school did not have a long life or any specific influence on the later literary developments.</p>
<p>Distinguished writers of this period are: <a href="../../../p/j/e/Pjet%C3%ABr_Budi_2978.html" title="Pjetër Budi">Pjetër Budi</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frang_Bardhi_85fd.html" title="Frang Bardhi">Frang Bardhi</a>, <a href="../../../p/j/e/Pjet%C3%ABr_Bogdani_3e7e.html" title="Pjetër Bogdani">Pjetër Bogdani</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/k/Lek%C3%AB_Matr%C3%ABnga_5ee1.html" title="Lekë Matrënga">Lekë Matrënga</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jul_Variboba_79eb.html" title="Jul Variboba">Jul Variboba</a>, etc.</p>

<p>National Renaissance, nurturing the Albanian as a language of culture, the organization of national education and the establishment of a national literature on the cultural level as well as the creation of the independent state – these were the goals of this movement which gave birth to the school of Albanian Romanticism. It was imbued with the spirit of national liberation, with the nostalgia of the émigré and the rhetorical pathos of past heroic wars. This literary school developed the poetry most. Regarding the motifs and poetical forms, its hero was the ethical man, the fighting Albanian, and to a lesser degree the tragic man. It is closely linked with the folklore tradition.</p>

<p>The pursuit of this tradition and the publications of “Rapsodi të një poeme arbëreshe” (Rhapsody of an Arbëresh Poem) in 1866 by <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeronim_De_Rada_e57a.html" title="Jeronim De Rada">Jeronim De Rada</a>, of “Përmbledhje të këngëve popullore dhe rapsodi të poemave shqiptare” (Collection of Albanian Folk Songs and Rhapsodies of Albanian Poems) in 1871 by Zef Jubani, “Bleta shqiptare” (Albanian Bee) in 1878 by Thimi Mitko, etc., were part of the cultural programme of the National Renaissance for establishing a compact ethnic and cultural identity of Albanians.</p>
<p>Two are the greatest representatives of Albanian Romanticism of <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>: <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeronim_De_Rada_e57a.html" title="Jeronim De Rada">Jeronim De Rada</a> (1814-1903), and <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naim_Frash%C3%ABri_593d.html" title="Naim Frashëri">Naim Frashëri</a> (1846-1900), born in Albania, educated at Zosimea of <a href="../../../i/o/a/Ioannina.html" title="Ioannina">Ioannina</a>, but emigrated and deceased in <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.

<p><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Rada_b304.html" title="De Rada">De Rada</a> wrote a cycle of epical-lyrical poems in the style of Albanian rhapsodies: “Këngët e Milosaos” (The Songs of Milosao), 1836, “Serafina Topia” 1839, “Skënderbeu i pafat” (Unlucky Skanderbeg) 1872-1874 etc. with the ambition of creating the national <a href="../../../e/p/o/Epos.html" title="Epos">epos</a> for the century of Skanderbeg. Following the traces of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Gottfried_Herder_150f.html" title="Johann Gottfried Herder">Johann Gottfried Herder</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Rada_b304.html" title="De Rada">De Rada</a> raised the love for <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_songs.html" title="Folk songs">folk songs</a> in his <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> and painted it in <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnographic.html" title="Ethnographic">ethnographic</a> colours.

The conflict between the happiness of the individual and the tragedy of the nation, the scenes by the riversides, women gathering wheat in the fields, the man going to war and the wife embroidering his belt, all represented with a delicate <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrical.html" title="Lyrical">lyrical</a> feeling.</p>

He is recognised as the greatest national poet of Albanians. Naim Frashëri established modern lyrics in Albanian poetry. In the spirit of “Bucolics” and “Georgics” of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>, in his “Bagëti e bujqësia” (Shepherds and Farmers) he sang to the works of the land tiller and shepherd by writing a hymn to the beauties of his <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatherland.html" title="Fatherland">fatherland</a> and expressing the nostalgia of the émigré poet and the pride of being Albanian. The longing for his birthplace, the mountains and fields of Albania, the graves of his ancestors, the memories of his childhood, feed his inspiration with lyrical strength and impulse.</p>

<p>The inner experiences of the individual freed from the chains of medieval, Oriental mentality on one hand and the philosophical pantheism imbued with the poetical pantheism of the European Romanticism on the other hand, give to the lyrical meditations of Frashëri a universal human and philosophical dimension. The most beautiful poems of “Lulet e verës” (Summer Flowers) collection are the philosophical lyrics on life and death, on time that goes by and never comes back leaving behind tormenting memories in the heart of man, on the Creator melt with the Universe. Naim Frashëri is the founder of the national literature of the Albanians and of the national literary language. He raised Albanian to a modern language of culture, evolving it in the model of the popular Albanian speech.</p>

<i>Lahuta e malësisë</i> by <a href="../../../g/j/e/Gjergj_Fishta_5afd.html" title="Gjergj Fishta">Gjergj Fishta</a> (in English translation)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../g/j/e/Gjergj_Fishta_5afd.html" title="Gjergj Fishta">Gjergj Fishta</a> (1871-1940), wrote a poem of national <a href="../../../e/p/o/Epos.html" title="Epos">epos</a> breadth “Lahuta e malësisë” (The Highland Lute) in 17.000 verses, in the spirit of Albanian historical and legendary epos, depicting the struggles of Northern highlanders against Slav onslaughts. With this work he remains the greatest epical poet of Albanians. A Franciscan priest, erudite and a member of the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Academy_f084.html" title="Italian Academy">Italian Academy</a>, Gjergj Fishta is a multifaceted personality of Albanian culture: epical and lyrical poet, publicist and satirist, dramatist and translator, active participant in the Albanian cultural and political life between the two Wars. His major work, "Lahuta e malësisë” (The Lute of the Highlands), is a reflection of the Albanian life and mentality, a poetical mosaic of historic and legendary exploits, traditions and customs of the highlands, a live <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresco.html" title="Fresco">fresco</a> of the history of an old people, which places on its center the type of Albanian carved in the calvary of his life along the stream of centuries which had been savage to him. Fishta’s poem is distinguished by its vast linguistic wealth, is a receptacle for the richness of the popular speech of the highlands, the live and infinite <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phraseology.html" title="Phraseology">phraseology</a> and the diversity of clear <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syntax.html" title="Syntax">syntax</a> constructions, which give vitality and strength to the poetic expression. The poetical collections “Mrizi i Zanave” (The Fairies’ Mead) with patriotic verse and “Vallja e Parrizit” (Paris’s Dance) with verses of a religious spirit, represent Fishta as a refined lyrical poet, while his other works “Anzat e Parnasit” (Parnassus' Anises) and “Gomari i Babatasit” (Babatas' Donkey) represent him as an unrepeatable <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satirical.html" title="Satirical">satirical</a> poet. In the field of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">drama</a>, “Juda Makabe” and “Ifigjenia n’ Aulli” may be mentioned along his tragedies with <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical.html" title="Biblical">biblical</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythological.html" title="Mythological">mythological</a> themes.</p>
<p>The typical representative of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_realism.html" title="Literary realism">realism</a> was <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millosh_Gjergj_Nikolla_2381.html" title="Millosh Gjergj Nikolla">Millosh Gjergj Nikolla</a>, Migjeni (1913-1938). His poetry “Vargjet e lira” (Free Verses), 1936, and prose are permeated by a severe <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_realism.html" title="Social realism">social realism</a> on the misery and tragic position of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individual.html" title="Individual">individual</a> in the society of the time. The characters of his works are people from the lowest strata of Albanian society. Some of Migjeni’s stories are novels in miniature; their themes represent the conflict of the individual with institutions and the patriarchal and conservative morality. The rebellious nature of Migjeni’s talent broke the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalism.html" title="Traditionalism">traditionalism</a> of Albanian <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prose.html" title="Prose">prose</a> by bringing a new style and forms in poetry and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrative.html" title="Narrative">narrative</a>. He is one of the greatest reformers of Albanian literature, the first great modern Albanian writer.</p>
<p>Lasgush Poradeci (1899-1987), a poetical talent of a different nature, a brilliant lyrical poet, wrote soft and warm poetry, but with a deep thinking and a charming <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musicality.html" title="Musicality">musicality</a> “Vallja e yjeve” (The Dance of Stars), 1933, “Ylli i zemrës” (The Star of Heart), 1937.</p>

In 1947 he published in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> the study “Beethoven and the French Revolution”. He translated into Albanian many <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgical.html" title="Liturgical">liturgical</a> books and works of world class writers such as <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Khayam_2ecd.html" title="Omar Khayam">Omar Khayam</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrik_Ibsen_812c.html" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_de_Cervantes_9688.html" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a> and others.

His introductions to his own translations of world literature made him Albania’s foremost literary critic of the inter-war period. Fan Noli also led the democratic revolution that ousted <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Zog_d6b6.html" title="King Zog">King Zog</a>’s regime during the middle 1920's, though his peaceful governing was short-lived.</p>

<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <strong class="selflink">Albanian literature</strong> witnessed a massive development. The main feature of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts.html" title="Arts">arts</a> of this period was their ideologically oriented development and the elaboration of all genres, especially of <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a>, which despite of the lack of any tradition came to the lead of the literary process.</p>
<p>The most elaborate type of novel was the novel of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_realism.html" title="Socialist realism">socialist realism</a> of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical.html" title="Ethical">ethical</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical.html" title="Historical">historical</a> character, with a linear subject matter (Jakov Xoxa, Sterjo Spasse), but novels with a rugged <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composition.html" title="Composition">composition</a>, open poetics and a philosophical <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substratum.html" title="Substratum">substratum</a> issuing from association of ideas and historical analogies (<a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismail_Kadare_166c.html" title="Ismail Kadare">Ismail Kadare</a>, Petro Marko) as well as the satirical novel are not lacking (<a href="../../../d/r/i/Drit%C3%ABro_Agolli_d451.html" title="Dritëro Agolli">Dritëro Agolli</a>, Qamil Buxheli).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short story</a> and novel were developed by Dhimitër Shuteriqi, Naum Prifti, Zija Çela, Teodor Laço, Dhimitër Xhuvani, Nasi Lera and others; <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> by Ismail Kadare, Dritëro Agolli, Fatos Arapi, Xhevahir Spahiu, Mimoza Ahmeti and others. <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">Drama</a> (by Kol Jakova, “Toka jonë” (Our land), 1955) and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a> (by Spiro Çomora, “Karnavalet e Korçës” (The Carnival of Korça), 1961) developed to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>The literature of this period developed within the framework of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_realism.html" title="Socialist realism">socialist realism</a>, the only direction allowed by official policy. But beyond this framework, powerful talents created works with an implicit feeling of opposition and with universal significance.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissident.html" title="Dissident">dissident</a> trend in literature was expressed in different forms in the works of Kasëm Trebeshina, Mehmet Myftiu, Ismail Kadare, Dritëro Agolli, Minush Jero, Koço Kosta, etj, who either tried to break out the canons of the socialist realism method or introduced <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heretic.html" title="Heretic">heretic</a> ideas for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> ideology.</p>

<p>Albania’s best-known contemporary writer is <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismail_Kadare_166c.html" title="Ismail Kadare">Ismail Kadare</a>, born in 1935 whose 15 novels have been translated into 40 languages. With the poem “Përse mendohen këto male” (What Are These Mountains Musing On?) 1964, “Motive me diell” (Sunny Motifs) 1968, “Koha” (Time) 1976, and especially with his prose (“Gjenerali i ushtrisë së vdekur” (The General of The Dead Army) 1963, “Kështjella” (The Castle) 1970, “Kronikë në gur” (Chronicle in Stone) 1971, “Dimri i madh“ (The Great Winter) 1977, “Ura me tri harqe” (The Three-Arched Bridge) 1978, “Piramida” (The Pyramid) 1992; “Spiritus” 1996 etc., Kadare defied the limitations of the time and revived Albanian literature with forms and motifs which integrate it into the modern streams of world literature.</p>
<p>The work of Kadare represents an artistic encyclopaedia of Albanian life, historical and contemporary events, experienced with a philosophical attitude, sometimes expressed openly and at other times in Aesop’s speech. The philosophy, beliefs, dramas and historical and cultural traditions of Albanians, filtered through the artistic thinking of the writer are represented in Kadare’s work as an expression of the national identity and the vitality of the spiritual culture of his own people and as a factor in the people’s historical resistance and survival. Kadare creates a modern prose making wide use of historical <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogies.html" title="Analogies">analogies</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parables.html" title="Parables">parables</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associations.html" title="Associations">associations</a>, national <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend.html" title="Legend">legends</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. His work has an open poetics, which emanates from the intertwining of times, levels of artistic speech and the real with the unreal, and from the uneven mosaic nature of composition. Kadare's work brings to European literature a characteristic flavour, enriching it with the coloration of an area typical for its ethno-cultural distinctness. Starting from the epical world of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legends.html" title="Legends">legends</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballads.html" title="Ballads">ballads</a>, the prose of Kadare overcomes time distance and brings to resonance the medieval artistic conscience and mentality with those of our time. The message of Kadare’s prose and poetry simultaneously gains historical depth and a universal humane note through a deep creative elaboration of the richness of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient.html" title="Ancient">ancient</a> <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk.html" title="Folk">folk</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditions.html" title="Traditions">traditions</a>.</p>
