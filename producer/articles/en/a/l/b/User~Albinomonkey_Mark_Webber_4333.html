<p>Mark Webber was born in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queanbeyan%2C_New_South_Wales_4dcb.html" title="Queanbeyan, New South Wales">Queanbeyan</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>, son of Alan, the local <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> dealer. He started his relationship with sport young, working as a ball-boy for premiership winning <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> team, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra_Raiders_face.html" title="Canberra Raiders">Canberra Raiders</a> during the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. However, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorsport.html" title="Motorsport">motorsport</a> was where his interest lay, later listing Formula One <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions_0172.html" title="List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions">World Champion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alain_Prost_329d.html" title="Alain Prost">Alain Prost</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing_1ba5.html" title="Grand Prix motorcycle racing">Grand Prix motorcycle</a> racer <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Schwantz_c7d7.html" title="Kevin Schwantz">Kevin Schwantz</a> as his childhood heroes. Starting out racing motorcycles, Webber moved to four wheels in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, taking up <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kart_racing.html" title="Kart racing">karting</a> at the relatively late age of 15. He won the New South Wales state championship in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, and moved straight into the Australian <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_Ford_f1b2.html" title="Formula Ford">Formula Ford</a> Championship after his father bought him an ex-<a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Lowndes_e37e.html" title="Craig Lowndes">Craig Lowndes</a> Van Diemen FF1600. Working as a driving instructor at <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>'s <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oran_Park_Raceway_d0a4.html" title="Oran Park Raceway">Oran Park Raceway</a> between races, Webber finished 14th overall in his debut season. Continuing in the series in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, Webber scored several victories, including a win in the support race for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_Australian_Grand_Prix_280f.html" title="1995 Australian Grand Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> at <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Street_Circuit_659b.html" title="Adelaide Street Circuit">Adelaide</a>. He finished the series in fourth place, but perhaps more importantly, teamed up with Championship co-ordinator Ann Neal, who secured him a seven-year sponsorship with Australian <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Pages_f2fd.html" title="Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a>, and would become his manager and accompany him on a trip to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in an attempt to start a career in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Webber was given a test at <a href="../../../s/n/e/Snetterton.html" title="Snetterton">Snetterton</a> with the Van Diemen team, and subsequently earnt a works drive for the team at the 1995 Formula Ford Festival, held at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brands_Hatch_d8fd.html" title="Brands Hatch">Brands Hatch</a>. He finished third in his first international race, a result good enough to see him retained by the team for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> Championship. Before moving to Europe permanently, Webber won the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_Holden_bb38.html" title="Formula Holden">Formula Holden</a> race at the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_Australian_Grand_Prix_42bb.html" title="1996 Australian Grand Prix">1996 Australian Grand Prix</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Grand_Prix_Circuit_989a.html" title="Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit">Melbourne</a>. During the 1996 British Formula Ford Championship, Webber took four victories on his way to second place overall, finishing his season strongly with a win in the Formula Ford Festival. He also won the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps_db91.html" title="Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps">Spa-Francorchamps</a> race of the Formula Ford Euro Cup, taking third in the series despite competing in only two of the three rounds. His results throughout the year saw him voted as Australian motorsport's "Young Achiever" and "International Achiever" of 1996. Two days after his Festival victory, Webber completed a successful test for <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Docking_Racing_42af.html" title="Alan Docking Racing">Alan Docking Racing</a>, and was signed by the team to graduate to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_Three_7b45.html" title="Formula Three">Formula Three</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>.</p>
<p>Without the financial backing he had enjoyed during his time in Formula Ford, Webber and his team struggled to find the money to fund their championship campaign. He was almost forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain personal support from Australian <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> legend <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Campese_8bcb.html" title="David Campese">David Campese</a>, which helped him to complete the year. Webber took victory in just his fourth ever F3 race, at Brands Hatch, leading from start to finish and setting a new lap record in the process. He took a further four podium finishes, including a second place in the support race for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_British_Grand_Prix_bedc.html" title="1997 British Grand Prix">1997 British Grand Prix</a>, and finished the season in fourth overall. Webber also took strong finishes in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlboro_Masters_5c2b.html" title="Marlboro Masters">Marlboro Masters</a> at <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_Zandvoort_1257.html" title="Circuit Zandvoort">Zandvoort</a> (3rd) and the <a href="../../../f/3/_/F3_Macao_Grand_Prix_e7c5.html" title="F3 Macao Grand Prix">F3 Macao Grand Prix</a> (4th), both times making his circuit debut. During the 1997 season, Webber was approached by <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes-AMG_ab0a.html" title="Mercedes-AMG">Mercedes-AMG</a> to participate in a <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_car_racing.html" title="Sports car racing">sports car</a> race. He initially declined the offer, but at the end of the year he was invited to participate in a test session for the team at <a href="../../../%C3%B6/s/t/%C3%96sterreichring.html" title="Österreichring">A1-Ring</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>. AMG were suitably impressed with Webber, and he was signed as the official Mercedes works junior driver for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> <a href="../../../f/i/a/FIA_GT_Championship_1ba4.html" title="FIA GT Championship">FIA GT Championship</a>, alongside reigning champion <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernd_Schneider_0ed8.html" title="Bernd Schneider">Bernd Schneider</a>. Travelling around the world, including the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and Europe, the pair won five of the ten rounds on their way to second in the overall standings, remarkably beaten to the Championship by teammates <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klaus_Ludwig_26d7.html" title="Klaus Ludwig">Klaus Ludwig</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Zonta_91b7.html" title="Ricardo Zonta">Ricardo Zonta</a> by just 8 seconds in the final race at <a href="../../../l/a/g/Laguna_Seca_87e6.html" title="Laguna Seca">Laguna Seca</a>.</p>
<p>Webber remained with the AMG team for <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, and was promoted to his own race car for the season. However, his sportscar career came to an early end after he flipped twice on the straight in the lead up to the <a href="../../../2/4/_/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans_fec9.html" title="24 Hours of Le Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> race that year. An aerodynamic fault on the team's cars caused Webber to spectacularly become airborne during both practice and race-day warm up, with the same fate befalling teammate <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Dumbreck_6485.html" title="Peter Dumbreck">Peter Dumbreck</a> five hours into the race. Both drivers escaped uninjured, but the crashes forced Mercedes to shelve their sportscar program for the year and Webber to reconsider a return to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_wheel_car.html" title="Open wheel car">open wheel</a> racing. Webber spoke to Formula One team owner <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Jordan_6ed3.html" title="Eddie Jordan">Eddie Jordan</a>, who introduced him to fellow Australian <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Stoddart_645f.html" title="Paul Stoddart">Paul Stoddart</a>. Stoddart offered to undercut the necessary $1.1 million budget for Webber, and gave him a drive in his Eurobet Arrows <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_3000.html" title="Formula 3000">Formula 3000</a> team for <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. As a result, Webber also got his first taste of a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_One_cars_1fb2.html" title="Formula One cars">Formula One car</a>, completing a two-day test at <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Catalunya_53ae.html" title="Circuit de Catalunya">Barcelona</a> in December 1999 for the <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrows.html" title="Arrows">Arrows</a> F1 team.</p>
<p>Webber was signed as test driver for the Arrows F1 team for 2000, and also gained sponsorship from Australian <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a> company <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster%27s_Lager_7345.html" title="Foster's Lager">Foster's</a> whilst competing in the F3000 Championship.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Webber took victory in round two of the season at <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silverstone_Circuit_4e1c.html" title="Silverstone Circuit">Silverstone Circuit</a>, and finished the series with two fastest laps and three podiums on his way to third overall - the highest position of any rookie that year.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Contract issues meant that Webber was never able to drive the Arrows A21 car, and rejected an offer of a full contract for 2001 in July. However, he was offered a three day evaluation test for <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benetton_Formula_ade1.html" title="Benetton Formula">Benetton</a> at the end of the year, outpacing F1 drivers <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralf_Schumacher_91fd.html" title="Ralf Schumacher">Ralf Schumacher</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giancarlo_Fisichella_936a.html" title="Giancarlo Fisichella">Giancarlo Fisichella</a> at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Aut%C3%B3dromo_do_Estoril_711d.html" title="Autódromo do Estoril">Estoril</a>. The results were good enough to earn him the test driver role with the team for 2001, and he also agreed to take on team boss <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavio_Briatore_2f9f.html" title="Flavio Briatore">Flavio Briatore</a> as manager in return for finance for a further F3000 season. Webber joined the championship-winning <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nova_Racing_64fc.html" title="Super Nova Racing">Super Nova Racing</a> team, and despite winning at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autodromo_Enzo_e_Dino_Ferrari_ca1d.html" title="Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari">Imola</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Monaco_b526.html" title="Circuit de Monaco">Monaco</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Nevers_Magny-Cours_4ea9.html" title="Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours">Magny-Cours</a>, he finished second overall to British driver <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Wilson_922c.html" title="Justin Wilson">Justin Wilson</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Webber was replaced as test driver for Benetton for 2002 by <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_Alonso_f1dc.html" title="Fernando Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a>, but Briatore managed to secure Webber a contract to race alongside <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Yoong_8e69.html" title="Alex Yoong">Alex Yoong</a> in the Stoddart-owned <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minardi.html" title="Minardi">Minardi</a> team, making him the first Australian in Formula One since <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Brabham_5a0c.html" title="David Brabham">David Brabham</a> in 1994.</p>

The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_German_Grand_Prix_10e4.html" title="2003 German Grand Prix">German Grand Prix</a> saw Webber's sixth retirement for the season, after he made a desperate last lap lunge on <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenson_Button_7a86.html" title="Jenson Button">Jenson Button</a> in an attempt to salvage a point from the weekend.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> Consecutive points finishes in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Hungarian_Grand_Prix_1f19.html" title="2003 Hungarian Grand Prix">Hungary</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Italian_Grand_Prix_0780.html" title="2003 Italian Grand Prix">Italy</a> saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers' standings, with a 5 point margin to Button. He was unable to hold onto his position however, as one too many laps on dry tyres saw him spin out from the lead of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_United_States_Grand_Prix_017b.html" title="2003 United States Grand Prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, and a disappointing 11th-place result in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Japanese_Grand_Prix_2eb9.html" title="2003 Japanese Grand Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a> meant he finished on equal points with Button, but lost out on a countback.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> Although Wilson scored a point in the United States Grand Prix, Webber had still never been outqualified by a teammate, and late in the year, Jaguar announced that rookie <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Klien_b65d.html" title="Christian Klien">Christian Klien</a> would team up with Webber for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Formula_One_season_870a.html" title="2004 Formula One season">2004 season</a>.

The following race, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Malaysian_Grand_Prix_8f2f.html" title="2004 Malaysian Grand Prix">Malaysian Grand Prix</a>, Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career, splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up 2nd on the grid. The race was disappointing though, a stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place, but during an exciting battle with <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralf_Schumacher_91fd.html" title="Ralf Schumacher">Ralf Schumacher</a>, the German collided with him and forced Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre.

More frustration eventually led to the end of his race, as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23. The situation improved for the following race in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Bahrain_Grand_Prix_8bb8.html" title="2004 Bahrain Grand Prix">Bahrain</a> though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him in 14th and marked the first time he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> He was unable to continue his pointscoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_San_Marino_Grand_Prix_4ac3.html" title="2004 San Marino Grand Prix">San Marino</a> and a lack of grip in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Spanish_Grand_Prix_2ed5.html" title="2004 Spanish Grand Prix">Spain</a> meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races.</p>

<p>Heidfeld was finally announced as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, with Webber admitting he was pleased with the eventual decision.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> Webber's move to Williams brought about comparisons to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Jones_%28Formula_1%29_3a4d.html" title="Alan Jones (Formula 1)">Alan Jones</a>,<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup> Australia's last <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions_0172.html" title="List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions">F1 World Champion</a> (also in a Williams) and expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005,<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> while Williams technical director <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Michael_4c61.html" title="Sam Michael">Sam Michael</a> said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> In his first race for the team, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Australian_Grand_Prix_430a.html" title="2005 Australian Grand Prix">2005 Australian Grand Prix</a>, Webber took 3rd on the grid but was beaten to the first corner by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Coulthard_9ade.html" title="David Coulthard">David Coulthard</a> and eventually finished fifth – still unable to improve on his best F1 finish. His best chance to do so though came in the following race in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Malaysian_Grand_Prix_565a.html" title="2005 Malaysian Grand Prix">Malaysia</a>. After qualifying fourth, Webber was running behind the Renault of Giancarlo Fisichella, who was struggling due to a lack of downforce and tyre grip. As Webber closed in and attempted a pass around the outside of turn 15, Fisichella locked up his brakes and slid into the side of Webber's car, eliminating both drivers from the race. Fisichella was later reprimanded by race stewards because of the incident,<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> but as Heidfeld took third in place of Webber, the weekend came to epitomise Webber's growing reputation as a fast qualifier who did not perform well under pressure in race situations.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> It was later revealed that Webber had competed in the first two races carrying a fractured <a href="../../../r/i/b/Rib.html" title="Rib">rib</a>, an injury he had sustained during pre-season testing at <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Catalunya_53ae.html" title="Circuit de Catalunya">Barcelona</a>, though he "didn't want to make a fuss" about it and would be fully fit in time for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Bahrain_Grand_Prix_0400.html" title="2005 Bahrain Grand Prix">Bahrain Grand Prix</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>After qualifying fifth in Bahrain, a mistake under pressure from <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen_dec2.html" title="Kimi Räikkönen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> whilst in third place saw Webber ultimately finish sixth,<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup> taking his points tally to 7 for the season. He followed this up by qualifying fourth and finishing a disappointing 10th in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_San_Marino_Grand_Prix_1180.html" title="2005 San Marino Grand Prix">San Marino Grand Prix</a>, although his position was revised to 7th after the disqualification of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_American_Racing_9ed2.html" title="British American Racing">BAR</a> team and a penalty to Ralf Schumacher. The race was a poor one for Williams (Heidfeld was 9th before the reclassification), but Webber hit back at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Spanish_Grand_Prix_3f6d.html" title="2005 Spanish Grand Prix">Spanish Grand Prix</a>, qualifying 2nd and finishing 6th – his fourth pointscoring finish in the first five races. The following race in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Monaco_Grand_Prix_c5cb.html" title="2005 Monaco Grand Prix">Monaco</a> saw Webber take the first podium finish of his career, with third. On the rostrum however, Webber looked noticeably disappointed with the result after losing second to teammate Heidfeld in a pitstop sequence towards the end of the race.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> The best result of Webber's career was followed by one of his worst at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_European_Grand_Prix_d5eb.html" title="2005 European Grand Prix">European Grand Prix</a>. After qualifying third, Webber had a collision in the very first corner of the race, forcing him to retire as Heidfeld went from pole position to take an impressive second-place finish, overtaking Webber in the Championship in the process.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> The following race in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Canadian_Grand_Prix_16ad.html" title="2005 Canadian Grand Prix">Canada</a> was affected by this result, as Webber was only able to qualify 14th, but he was pleased with an eventual 5th-place finish and a further 4 Championship points.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_United_States_Grand_Prix_6957.html" title="2005 United States Grand Prix">United States Grand Prix</a> (where only 6 cars took part) was the beginning of a lean streak for Webber, with just one pointscoring finish in the next seven races, a seventh in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Hungarian_Grand_Prix_4356.html" title="2005 Hungarian Grand Prix">Hungary</a>, but by this stage he had slipped from 6th to 10th in the World Championship.</p>
<p>With Heidfeld injured, Webber's former Jaguar teammate Antônio Pizzonia stepped into the second Williams seat, with added pressure on Webber to perform well given the public argument the pair had towards the end of 2004. The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Italian_Grand_Prix_ea82.html" title="2005 Italian Grand Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> saw Pizzonia gain the upper hand, driving to seventh whilst Webber was caught up in a first-corner incident which saw him finish 14th.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup> The roles were reversed for the following race in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Belgian_Grand_Prix_d486.html" title="2005 Belgian Grand Prix">Belgium</a>, as Webber raced to fourth but Pizzonia retired after a collision with Juan Pablo Montoya in the closing laps. With rumours that Heidfeld had in fact signed with <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_Sauber_8a6d.html" title="BMW Sauber">BMW Sauber</a> for the 2006 season spreading,<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup>, Pizzonia continued in the race seat, and in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Brazilian_Grand_Prix_76c6.html" title="2005 Brazilian Grand Prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>, spun into Webber to force extensive repairs to the Australian's car.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> Webber eventually finished 17th and set the race's 8th fastest lap,<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> but was not classified as a finisher. The final two races of the season saw Webber take 4th and 7th to consolidate his 10th place in the Drivers' Championship. Webber described the 2005 season as "frustrating" and acknowledged that his reputation had somewhat diminished,<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup> but he opted to stay on with Williams despite an offer from BMW Sauber.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup> Webber's teammate for 2006 would be <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nico_Rosberg_2536.html" title="Nico Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>, becoming the seventh different driver to partner Webber since 2002.</p>

<p>For the first time in Webber's career, the first race of the season was not held in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Grand_Prix_Circuit_989a.html" title="Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit">Melbourne</a>, and instead was in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Bahrain_Grand_Prix_0d6f.html" title="2006 Bahrain Grand Prix">Bahrain</a>. Webber qualified 7th and had a solid race to finish 6th and pick up 3 Championship points. Although Webber was considered by some to have the better race performance,<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup> this was generally overlooked for the fact that Rosberg set the fastest lap in his debut race and moved through the field well after a first-lap incident.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> The following two races, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Malaysian_Grand_Prix_5d90.html" title="2006 Malaysian Grand Prix">Malaysia</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Australian_Grand_Prix_be21.html" title="2006 Australian Grand Prix">Australia</a> were cut short due to mechanical problems. In Malaysia, Webber started 4th on the grid and was still running in that position before a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulics.html" title="Hydraulics">hydraulics</a> failure ended his race on lap 14. In his home race, Webber qualified seventh and was leading the race (before his first <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pit_stop.html" title="Pit stop">pit stop</a>) when his <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmission_%28mechanics%29.html" title="Transmission (mechanics)">gearbox</a> failed on lap 22.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>

Route map for Webber's 2003 Challenge</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In November 2003, Webber set up and competed in a 10-day trek across <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> in an attempt to raise funds for children's <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> research charities. Starting in Marrawah on the state's west coast, the trek involved 1,000 km of cycling, <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayaking.html" title="Kayaking">kayaking</a> and trekking along the southern coast and finished at Coles Bay in the east. Four teams of four competitors each started the trek, with only two teams (including Webber's) completing the entire journey.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup> Along the way, Australian sporting stars <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Rafter_84e9.html" title="Pat Rafter">Pat Rafter</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Waugh_54d6.html" title="Steve Waugh">Steve Waugh</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathy_Freeman_a792.html" title="Cathy Freeman">Cathy Freeman</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Tomkins_0203.html" title="James Tomkins">James Tomkins</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Andrews_690b.html" title="Guy Andrews">Guy Andrews</a> and actor <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Edgerton_a0c8.html" title="Joel Edgerton">Joel Edgerton</a> completed certain parts of the trek. The challenge concluded with a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_tie.html" title="Black tie">black tie</a> dinner and <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auction</a> to raise funds. Webber said he was driven to organise the event after the death of his grandfather to cancer, as well as his experiences with friends whose children had battled the disease.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>With Webber's switch from Jaguar to Williams at the end of 2004, the challenge was postponed until 2006, when he was able to secure a three-year deal with the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Tasmania_166a.html" title="Government of Tasmania">Tasmanian Government</a> to hold the event.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup> In 2006 the event (now named the "Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge") will be over six days and 600 km, with up to 12 teams competing.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup> In addition to funds raised by the challenge, Webber has announced that all proceeds from his 2006 merchandise range will be given to cancer charities through his "Mark Webber Challenge Foundation".<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
