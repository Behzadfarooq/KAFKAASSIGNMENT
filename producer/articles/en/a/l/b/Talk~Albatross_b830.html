<p>Taxonomy is a nightmare at the moment with the AOU moving faster than the rest of the World towards a major revision. Until a consensus reforms, I think that all we can do is try to reflect the main strands of thought.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the BOU has been very quickly out of the blocks in terms of splitting the albatross group, and moving the Galloanseriformes to the start of the Neoaves list.</p>
<p>With regard to this article, I think it will need splitting fairly soon to a generic article on albatrosses and separate species accounts. I<i>ll do it when I get time<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 10:24 Mar 29, 2003 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Sounds reasonable, Jim. I'm not really up to speed on seabirds, but on checking the sources I have here I see that it looks as though the AOU has gone out on a limb with them. The latest official South African, and also the Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic lists have them as Procellariiformes, family Diomedeidae. Given that they are, in broad, Southern Hemisphere birds, it would be silly to ignore that. The South Africans seem to agree with the BOU, but the HANZAB list still has two genera. I suggest that we go with the South Africans &amp; British on this one. I'll adjust the taxobox to suit in a little while. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 12:27 Mar 29, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a nice Royal Albatross picture from the colony in NZ in "Albatrosses and Culture", near the line that talks about it (the colony).

<dd>"Albatrosses can glide for six days without flapping their wings and sleep at the same time.

<p>Had a little look for another source but couldn't find one - is this really true? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:04, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>LOL! "about a third of whome are pirates". Just how many pirates are there in fact these days, I wonder? And to glide for six days... without flapping their wings... this is laughable. Even if albatross flew very high and glided much the way that planes do, there is nothing that indicates why there should be a 6 day limit. Either they would be able to do it endlessly, or they would have to flap every now and then to either fly higher, lower, or avoid cloud, etc. It sounds like nonsense to me. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 17:23, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I planned to get round to that, thanks for the reminder. I don't know an avarage for the family, but ther great albatrosses have a maximum wingspan of 351cm.

<p>As the very famous Monty Python sketch asked, What flavour is it? But seriously, it would be nice to have a section on albatross apearance in the media (as in related documtaries and films). Perhaps this could be made ointo a seperate article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the way it's handled now is great, and a model for other pages to do pop culture references. Instead of an "include my favorite program too!" style bulk list I see way too often, it's a nice, brief paragraph which doesn't just list programs, but tries to detail the culture and meaning behind the references. I also like how it briefly mentions very popular series (Monty Python, Serenity) in a way which is not "fan-boy", but will hopefully in a way such that adhearants will be satisfied enough that they won't feel the need to add a "fan-boy" type statements -- the article is about albatrosses, not Monty Python/Serenity.

<dd>Thanks!&#160;:) That is certainly what I was aiming for; when I first started on this page there were lots of the lists you mentioned. Incidentally, to answer the original question, I can not find a description of what albatrosses taste like, although they were widely eaten in the past and other petrels are considered quite tasty. Albatross eggs are described as very palatable but taking a long time to boil! <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a href="../../../s/a/b/User_talk%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_5ef7.html" title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 16:03, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree.

<p>The etymology is patently wrong. The proposed arabic word is obviously not arabic at all. I'm not 100% clear on the correct etymology, but according to my Random House/Webster dictionary the arabic root is al-ghattaas (I don't know how to write arabic in wikipedia, the 't' is actually a "taw" and the 's' is a "saad". The double a is an aliph. The arabic word refers to "a kind of sea eagle". Apparently it came into english converting the 'gh' (ghain) to a 'b' via similarity to the latin 'albus' for 'white' which is the color of the bird. (Again, according to the Random House/Webster.) Unfortunately, that isn't quite right either. The Random House/Webster claims it comes from the arabic 'diver'. What they apparently meant was 'ghattaas' -- it is a 'siin', not a 'saad' (from Al-Mawrad, Arabic-English). According to Hans Wehr (Arabic-English) the root 'ghts' (again, a taw) means to dip, plung or immerse. A diver (according to Hans Wehr) is ghattaas, whether man or bird. In the entire entry for derivations of the root, albatross is not mentioned.</p>
<p>"Albatross" in Al-Mawrad (English-Arabic) is given as 'al-qatras' (the 't' is again actually a 'taw'. With a definition of 'big sea bird'.</p>

<dd>The etymology was derived from albatross books, not from dictionaries. What I didn't include was that the word came to Arabic from Greek.

<p>I removed the following line from the introduction. <i>They even sleep in flight.</i> I have heard this several times from unofficial sources but have not actually seen it in a journal or ornithology book,it smacks of a myth. It seems unlikely that they could, unlike birds that do (like swifts) they fly very close to the surface of water and the control needed suggests strongly they'd be awake to fly like that. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 16:42, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>None of the following should prevent FA status being conferred but as I was reviewing it anyway to assess the FA nomination, I thought I'd note these down.</p>
<ol>
<li>"The albatrosses are seabirds in the family Diomedeidae" is potentially a little ambiguous; it could mean "The term albatross is synonymous with 'bird in the family Diomedeidae'", or "Albatrosses are some of the members of the family Diomedeidae"</li>
<li>"Breeding pairs form over several years" - does this mean it takes a male albatross several years to convince a female albatross to become its mate, or something else?</li>
<li>Can the sentence "A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding season." be written in such a way as to avoid using the term breeding season twice?</li>
<li>Can we wikilink long-line fisheries to some appropriate article</li>
<li>first paragraph "great albatrosses" could perhaps be in quotes, termed "so-called", Wikilinked to a great albatross page, or clarified in the same way we clarify the term tubenoses a few sentences before</li>
<li>"Of the four genera, the North Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks" - I think I can visualise the tree, but not 100% sure; I think I can reword this to give an unambiguous description of the tree if someone tells me what the tree looks like</li>
<li>Taxonomy &amp; evolution 3rd paragraph - 1852 split - by whom?</li>
<li>Taxonomy &amp; evolution 3rd paragraph - can we wikilink the no-longer-used genus names as redirects to the genera they've been subsumed into, and make mention of the names in those articles</li>
<li>Taxonomy &amp; evolution 4th paragraph - it could be stated more clearly that the view that sooties are primitive is now known to be incorrect</li>
<li>Taxonomy &amp; evolution 4th paragraph - maybe "rearranged" would be a better word than "split"</li>
<li>The intro to the species list (and anywhere else where we say "number of species") ought to make clear that we're talking about extant species only (we're not including P. anglica, for instance)</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight first paragraph - "amongst" the largest - are they not THE largest? If not, can we say why?</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight first paragraph - walking ability is not unique if the Giant petrels can do it too</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight second paragraph, first sentence - grammar</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight second paragraph - surely the appearance of the sooty albatrosses is the extreme, not Amsterdam?</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight second paragraph - is there a "yellow" albatross?</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight second paragraph last sentence - is Light-mantled Sooty all black?</li>
<li>Morphology &amp; flight third paragraph - Can we wikilink glide ratio to some appropriate article?</li>
<li>Distribution and range at sea second paragraph - "submerged the Short-tailed Albatross colony" conjures up the image of the albatrosses themselves suddenly vanishing between the waves - I presume we mean the colony site?</li>
<li>Distribution and range at sea second paragraph - do we know whether any species other than Black-browed has ever been "exiled"?</li>
<li>Breeding fourth paragraph - can we wikilink pair bond to ome appropriate article?</li>
<li>Breeding fourth paragraph - albatrosses lay a single egg - presumably per pair per season?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are one or two places where I think we sail a little close to the wind on NPOV - the word "important" is usually the troublemaker.</p>
<p>Finally, a brisk whizz through to add sources for all as-yet-unsourced statements wouldn't go amiss (and for sources where a whole book is cited, giving a page number would be sensible). <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 20:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>just to come back on a couple of these:
<ul>
<li>16: the article says "Several species of [albatross] ... are grey or yellow instead of white"; I appreciate that some are partially yellow, but this phrasing could be taken to mean there is at least one all-yellow albatross.</li>
<li>20: I guess the point I'm making is that "exiled" could be taken to mean "doomed never to make it home". I know that Black-broweds have ened up in that predicament but I thought that all other species found up here have only ever been one-off sightings i.e. they could have made it back down south</li>

<li>Hokay, I have addressed each and every one of your points, except for 8. I will go and figure out which old genera led to which species, but I think that a better place to have them redirect to and have all that information will be the forthcoming article on albatross taxonomy. I will need to do that article because I have condensed the taxonomy section as much as possible while still jkeeping it readable and if I add much more information it will outweigh everything else in the article. There is, as you know, a great deal more than can be said. So I'll create the redirects then (when, among other things, I have time to follow the pea under the cup.). Everything else is dandy now, added the tree, the links, and am now going to try and expand (a little) the section on the number of species. I looked at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_albatross_breeding_locations.html" title="List of albatross breeding locations">List of albatross breeding locations</a>, I added some sites and will add a lot more from Brooke, but maybe the page would look better as a table? <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a href="../../../s/a/b/User_talk%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_5ef7.html" title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 13:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good stuff - I'll take a read through later - just one other minor thing I spotted - the Penhallurick paper actually proposed dropping the species count to 13 (i.e. lumping Amsterdam Albatross with Wandering).

<dd>It gives equal weight to two scientists who don't have much widespread support - but it will do until some more papers come out. I'd argue that most of the debate is how many more species there are (19, 21, 24?), not wherether P&amp;W are right or not.

<dd>Like HBW, Howard &amp; Moore are generalists. I wonder how many albatross specialists still stick to 14 species.

<p>I'd suggest moving the section on taxonomy to right before the species list, which follows naturally from it. The taxonomy is probably the least interesting section to the general reader, and that move would let the article start with "Morphology and flight", probably the most interesting to such a reader. You'd still need a short mention of the genus names and the range of species numbers at the beginning (maybe in the lead), though. —<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryFriedman_2245.html" title="User:JerryFriedman">JerryFriedman</a> 21:07, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmmm. I'm not exceptionally bothered either way, but I'd lean towards leaving it as it is. I structured the layout to follow the conventional way a family or species is dealt with in the books I read for this. To paraphrase Confucius, (in a fashion that would probably cause physical pain to a follower therof) the first step to wisdom is know what things are. Most texts deal with taxonomy and evolution first as it tells you what things are and how they came to be. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a href="../../../s/a/b/User_talk%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_5ef7.html" title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 22:01, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>We're on the main page on 4th May. I've given the article a read through, and made a number of tiny changes as a result of small problems that seem to have escaped us in previous review work. It might be worth a few more pairs of eyes taking a final look at the article before our chance at stardom. However, even without any more changes, the article is one of the best I've seen on Wikipedia, and a great credit to editors, particularly of course <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a>.

<dd>It's a widespread idea but a myth.

<li>Sabine's, sleeping in flight formerly "smacked of myth" ("Removed line", 5 Jan) — now it <i>is</i> a myth. Although it seems unlikely, and the literature is silent, how can we definitively rule out the possibility? What about a debunk, by including content to the effect that although the bird is commonly believed to sleep on the wing, for the reasons given this is unlikely?

<dd>I wrote it smacked of a myth, then it is a myth as I have done quite a bit of reading between the two edits. The literature is almost silent, but one paper on about time spent at sea lists sleeping as a behaviour undertaken while resting on the sea.
