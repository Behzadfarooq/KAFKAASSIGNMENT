<p>I thought that a subsequent treaty removed this disposition that Monaco would be absorbed by France should the princes fail to have a heir. Does anybody know about this? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 09:34, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was in fact no provision that Monaco would be "absorbed" by France. The old 1918 provision was "En cas de vacance de la couronne, notamment faute d’héritier direct ou adoptif, le territoire monégasque formera, sous le protectorat de la France, un État autonome sous le nom d’État de Monaco. En pareil cas, les biens privés immobiliers non affectés à un usage public, qui, de ce chef, pourraient faire l’objet d’une revendication particulière des ayants-droits, seront rachetés par l’État de Monaco avec l’assistance, s’il y a lieu, de l’État Français." "Should the throne become vacant, particularly for lack of a direct or adoptive heir, the territory of Monaco shall form, under the protectorate of France, an autonomous State under the name of the State of Monaco. In such case, immovable private property, which has not been appropriated for public use and which might accordingly be the subject of a private claim by the rightful owners, shall be purchased by the State of Monaco with the assistance, if necessary, of the French State." The provision is that Monaco would remain an autonomous State. It might become a republic rather than a principality, but it would still be an independent state - or at any rate, at least as independent as it is now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since October 24, 2002, when a new treaty between France and Monaco was signed, it is reaffirmed that the territory of the principality of Monaco is inalienable. "La Principauté de Monaco est un État souverain et indépendant dans le cadre des principes généraux du droit international et des conventions particulières avec la France. Le territoire de la Principauté est inaliénable." "The Principality of Monaco is a sovereign and independent state within the framework of the general principles of international law and the particular conventions with France. The territory of the Principality is unalienable.". - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 10:02, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>if Wiki's entry on presumptive versus apparent is correct, then the Princess of Hanover has become the Heiress Apparent to the throne of Monaco. Her brother could father an heir if he were so inclined, as given that fact, Wiki's entry makes it clear that the Princess of Hanover is the "apparent" heiress rather than the "presumptive."</p>
<dl>
<dd>As discussed elsewhere, I think the above switches the meanings of <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">heir apparent</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_presumptive.html" title="Heir presumptive">heir presumptive</a>, and Princess Caroline is in fact an Heiress Presumptive. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 11:41, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's clear that "heir presumptive" is the term we need here. If Albert has a legitimate child, that child will inherit. Therefore, Caroline cannot be "heir apparent", <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 12:17, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even though she now apparently holds the title Marquise des Baux as heiress presumptive to the throne of Monaco, Caroline's present titular position via marriage outranks her Monegasque titles. As heiress to the throne, in any list of succession, I believe she would correctly be referred to as Her Royal and Serene Highness the Princess of Hanover, Hereditary Princess of Monaco, with all lesser Monegasque titles subsumed. For example, imagine if Princess Caroline had married the Prince of Wales; presuming that her brother was still living and still without issue, she, as heiress presumptive, would be listed in the line of Monagasque succession as Her Royal and Serene Highness the Princess of Wales, Hereditary Princess of Monaco, not as HSH the Princess Caroline, Marquise de Baux. Rank has its privileges, and one of those is that the higher rank wins out until further notice. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 10:40, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Had she married Charles, Prince of Wales she wouldn't become Princess of Wales since Charles would've lost his place in the line of succession and the titles that go with it. She would've have been HRH the Princess Charles. And her brother would still outrank since he's a sovereign head of state. Hell Albert outranks the Crown Prince of Japan and he's an <i>Imperial Higness</i>(<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphaboi867_e144.html" title="User:Alphaboi867">Alphaboi867</a> 22:40, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you'll notice what I wrote, I using the Wales-Monaco marriage purely as an example, re use of titles. People spend a great deal of time on Wikipedia arguing the obvious. And I already addressed that Albert, as a sovereign prince, would outrank his Royal Highness sister, see below. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 10:07, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>At no time did Princess Caroline outrank any member of her family due to her marriage to Ernst August Prinz von Hannover. Princess Caroline has always carried her rank as the daughter of a reigning/deceased monarch. The style of Royal Highness did not change Princess Caroline's rank within her family or on an international level. Members of a ruling family (Monaco) always outrank those who are deposed (Hannover).</p>
<hr />
<p>Does this means that she technically outranks her brother&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unless I am incorrect, Albert II is a sovereign prince, a head of state, so his sister, though she is a Royal Highness, does not outrank her brother. She does, however, outrank her sister, Princess Stephanie, her aunt, Princess Antoinette, and all other members of the Monegasque royal family who bear the designation of Serene Highness or lesser designations/titles. In most other situations not involving a head of state, a Royal Highness trumps a Serene Highness every time. This is the kind of thing that made the late Queen Mary nervous about her standing as a young woman. Her mother was a British royal princess, a Royal Highness, but like her father, the Duke of Teck, young Mary was a Serene Highness. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 17:43, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Princess Caroline did not gain any rank upon her marriage. Her rank is now and has always been superior to that of her latest husband. The styles of Royal and Serene Highness do not convey rank they are merely forms of address. Princess Caroline and Princess Stephanie have the same rank as daughters of the late Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Princess Caroline is slightly elevated do to her constitutional position as Heiress but not due to her marriage. Members of ruling Princely House always place before those who are not reigning (Hannover).</p>

<dd>Well, if you're a Hanoverian extremist, she's legally the Queen Consort of the United Kingdom, which would mean she outranks Albert, doesn't it? But unless her husband is willing to assert his right to the throne, he's still only a Royal Highness, as is she. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:36, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>All of the above is wrong. Caroline may STYLE herself "HRH The Princess of hanover" but she does not hold the TITLE of a princess of Hanover NOR a Royal Highness because those TITLES dont exist anymore, they were abolished by German law. She is referred to as HRH and Princess of Hanover by COURTESY ONLY, and only STYLED, not TITLED (the two things are very different). Her legal name is Caroline, Princess of Hanover, with "Princess of Hanover" acting as a SURNAME, not a TITLE. The only title she has is as a Princess of Monaco and HSH, so its rubbish that she "outranks" other people with a HRH because she doesnt legally posess it.</b></p>

<p>For me as hereditary prince Albert II is not preceded by Rainier III but for by his older sister Caroline. She was heir presumptive from 1957 to 1958. Before it was Antoinette I think.<a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 17:59, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Curious Reader: In truth Hektor, Until the 2002 Succession Act. If a Ruling Prince had no Legitimate or Legally adopted child or grandchild (or any Direct descendant ,legitimate or adopted), upon his death. Monaco would have become a part of France. Therefore from 1949-57 (from Rainier III's succession ,until Caroline's birth), Monaco had no Heir-Apparent or Presumptive, (unless you count the President of France).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I wish people would quit saying that Caroline is not Hereditary Princess. She is the Hereditary Princess under the Monegasque Constitution, which states:</p>
<p>"L'héritier du Prince régnant qui est le plus proche dans l'ordre successoral résultant desdites dispositions est Prince Héréditaire."</p>
<p>Meaning:</p>
<p>"The heir to the Sovereign Prince who is closest in the succession resulting from the aforementioned terms is Hereditary Prince."</p>
<p>It does NOT state anything about heirs-apparent and heirs-presumptive. It just says that the first in the line of succession is Hereditary Prince. Thus, Caroline is Hereditary Princess. {unsigned}</p>

<dd>If use of the title follows convention or common use or conforms to technical/legal accuracy, I fail to see how doing so is obsequious.

<dd>I have removed the statement that Prince Albert was "Crown Prince of Monaco," in 2005 or at any other time. There is no such title held by any member of the Monegasque royal family. Excepting subsidiary titles such as Duke/Duchess de Valentinois and Marquis/Marquise des Baux, the only two applicable senior titles are Hereditary Prince/Princess and Sovereign Prince/Princess. That is it. If someone can provide a citation for Prince Albert's having assumed the title Crown Prince instead of Hereditary Prince upon becoming Regent of Monaco, I would appreciate it. I have searched Nexis/Lexis and other sources for a citation proving this but have found nothing in any European or American papers, news agencies, or magazines. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 22:27, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Under the list of titles I have changed Hereditary Prince to Crown Prince, this being that this is how Albert was styled on the official website of the Grimaldi family. Also the title of Crown Prince is usually used by an heir aparent while the title of Hereditary Prince is generally used by an heir assumptive, such as Pss. Caroline. ((<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooldoug111_858f.html" title="User:Cooldoug111">Cooldoug111</a> 02:34, 2 August 2005 (UTC)))</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no idea if Albert was called "Crown Prince" on the Grimaldi website. If so, this was rather odd, and I've always seen him called "Hereditary Prince." Your second rational is entirely false, in any event - a "Crown Prince' is normally used by the heir apparent <i>of a king</i>. A "hereditary prince" can be various different things, but is most usually the heir apparent <i>of a sovereign prince</i>, which is what Albert was. The sons of German <i>Fürsten</i> are still generally called <i>Erbprinz</i> (Hereditary Prince). The son of the Prince of Liechtenstein is also the <i>Erbprinz</i>, and the same title was used by heirs-apparent of German princes like those of Reuss, Schwarzburg, Waldeck, Lippe, and so forth, until the early 20th century. The heir apparent of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg has generally been known as the "Hereditary Grand Duke," and this same style was used by the heirs of other grand dukes, such as though of Hesse, Baden, Saxe-Weimar, and so forth. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 03:55, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Find where "adulterine"'s meaning in the Constitution is defined under Monagesque law, and we'd be in business.

<dd>The definition of adulterine is a child born of adultery, then that is exactly what Jazmin is. I am neither for nor against the inclusion of the term specifically in the article, but I will bring up a point for both sides. Acknowledging Jazmin's status as a child born of adultery is important if it has implications that are not the same as simply being born out of wedlock. On the contrary, since the use of the word itself has caused some reversions, it oughtn't be given prominence and should be relegated to parentheses. That all being said: is adulterine status something that must be specifically declared in Monaco, as a procedure? It seems to be blatant fact to me without room for interpretation, as much as the sky is blue and water is wet, that Jazmin is an adulterine. If the constitution does not provide a definition for adulterine, then shouldn't the dictionary suffice? Conversely, if adulterine was not used in the constition but the meaning was, then the term may still be applied. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 02:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The term itself is perfectly pertinent and belongs, because it's the term used in the constitution. Though you may be certain that Jazmin would be considered adulterine, it's not at all certain. The legal meaning of words is not necessarily equivalent to their dictionary meaning. Should it be desirable to those in power that she not be held adulterine, it would be very easy for them to point out that she was born to a mother whose divorce was initiated on 13 September 1991 and who had, by the time of her birth, a decree that she was divorced - and though the opposing side would point out that it had not yet taken effect, it remains to be seen who would carry the day in court. We shouldn't be the ones making that decision, we should simply state the facts that <i>if</i> she is adulterine, <i>then</i> she could not be legitimated through the subsequent marriage of her parents, and that under the law as currently understood, she could not succeed. We don't even want to contemplate how European human rights legislation might enter into it... - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Very true regarding EHR legislation... This will remain one of those "what if" questions, because it seems that Jazmin will never be in the line of succession, and that certain question would be raised "if" Jazmin's mother and Albert wed. Regarding <i>those in power</i>, I think it is worth note in this discussion that such rules with serious implications are always held until the exception is declared. Could it not also be said that Jazmin cannot be legitimatized because she <i>is</i> adulterine, having been born out of adultery? It is stated in the article that <i>In Jazmin's case, however, marrying the mother would not legitimate her or give her a place in the line of succession</i> and then that <i>That is because she is <b>might</b> be considered an "adulterine" child.</i> To me, the latter statement casts doubt on the former. One of them must be amended. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 03:07, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, my point is that we should not be definitive, because the result is unknowable until it occurs. <i>In Jazmin's case, however, marrying the mother would probably not legitimate her or give her a place in the line of succession</i> and then that <i>That is because she would likely be considered an "adulterine" child.</i> - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

    There are waivers that can be signed by the parties who are divorcing in California that allow a divorce to be completed in as little as 30 days. It is very possible that Tamara was divorced long before Jazmin was born.

<p>what's up with the succession box. He was preceded as hereditary prince by his sister, who also succeeds him? Isn't the correct "preceder" his father? And is it really correct to call his presumptive heir the "hereditary prince"? We might be better off without the box. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heirs presumptive to Monaco are entitled to the title of Hereditary Prince or Hereditary Princess. Caroline was the Hereditary Princess before Albert's birth and also after her father's death. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 03:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite, but various other royals (The Prince of Wales, etc) have boxes indicating the previous holder of the title. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 03:58, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps that should be reconsidered. It really doesn't mirror the way such titles are acquired. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:01, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm more worried that it says that he is still the marquis des Baux, which, although is among the titles of the Sovereign Prince, is used by the Hereditary Prince. The succession box should probably be removed, but should be kept at Caroline's page, since she is the Hereditary Princess (and for the same reasons that various British <b>kings</b> don't have boxes for the title Prince of Wales). <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 04:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I think that too, would be better off treated in the text, rather than in a succession box. Succession boxes oversimplify to the point of being misleading. (It's also certainly a less-used title than other similar ones used for heirs). - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 19:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will removed the hederitary princely title, the ducal title and the marquisal title then. If anyone later objects, it can be readded. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 20:21, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

I believe that the de Baux title actually has to be conferred on the Hereditary Prince/ss as it was for Albert. Which would mean that Caroline does not hold this title despite being Hereditary Princess under the constitution.</p>

<p>In Monaco it's an investiture, Albert II wasn't crowned. I've made the correction in the article, however the article won't show my correction. Why's that? <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 22:00, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
