	    <p>Warning: most of this text may be copyright violation, quoting John Wilkes, <i>The Illyrians</i>, verbatim. The book is at the library, but I remember lots of these exact sentences.</p>
<p>Though other phrases are interpolations: Wilkes knew better than to call the Liburnians "Illyrians", and I don't remember anything about an Illyrian word "Arba" that meant "dark, wooded". Alexander 007 07:17, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Illyrian word "Arba" for wooded is connected with the latin "Arbo" wood and possible also connected with the job as a woood chucker. The tribe Albani was also known as Arbanoi, arba and alba have a common origin. Alpine means "forest in the moutain zone" which makes that the word Arba and Alba is connected together. Arba and Alba seam to be a widespread term for the Illyrians, their is also a place in prehistoric time, in Istria, a illyrian twon named Alba. The name for the country Albania cannot be derived from the word meaning white, it comes from the word Alba meaning mountain and Albanians means mountain people, it make sense since Albanians lived mostly in the moutain and in that way preserved their language, also Albania is the most mountain country in the Balkans. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 16:09, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Many scholars do connect Albania with the root *albho, that <i>originally</i> meant 'white': some scholars say that later on, the word was applied to high mountains, because of the white snow on the mountain tops. That is the theory they have.</p>
<p>The other theory is that Alp- (as in the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alps.html" title="Alps">Alps</a>) meant "high" or "mountain", and is a separate word that doesn't derive from *albho. No one knows yet which theory is correct. These are the two basic theories, and I've seen some other ones too.</p>
<p>The Latin word that you are talking about is <b>Arbor</b> (also, <i>arbos</i>), which meant 'tree' or 'any wooden object' and generally signified 'wood'. The Latin word is of unknown origin: but I haven't seen any scholar connect Illyrian 'arb-' with Latin 'arbor'. Alexander 007 06:43, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've tweaked the text to make it more transparent to the ordinary Wikipedia reader (me), who, when arriving unprepared at this entry, still needs to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>why there is no mention of Albania of the Caucasus since this is about "the name Albania"</li>
<li>"an ancient family epitaph" 3rd cent AD? 10th cent AD? 13th cent AD?</li>
<li>"Moreover, Arbanon is just likely to be the name" Arbanon has not previously been mentioned. We miss the connection.</li>
<li>"An indication of movement from higher altitudes in a much earlier period has been detected in the distribution of place-names ending in -esh.." What's the connection with "Albania" in this?</li>
<li>"Albanian writers such as Budi, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blanco.html" title="Blanco">Blanco</a> and Bogdano." Not household words. Their full names would be a start. A brief stub for each would very genuinely help too.</li>
<li>"<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Attaliates_aaa0.html" title="Michael Attaliates">Michael Attaliates</a> was first to refer to the Albanoi" how is he the first, all this time after Ptolemy?</li>
<li>"descendants of the Arbanitai" None of these designations are Italian, that's for sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general it is a courtesy that one might extend to offer the briefest disambiguation of places and rivers and mountains in Albania: "northwards" "coastal" "on the X River" "nearby"—any little hook for the reader to cling to would help. Our knowledge of Albania's geography is somewhat blurry, remember, and you must be kind.--<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 04:30, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problems stem from the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">User:Albanau</a> lifted 90% of the article from John Wilkes' <i>The Illyrians</i>, I believe. I've been picking at Albanau's text over the past few months, making sporadic changes (though I don't know why my User name appears so much in the history when Albanau wrote 90% of it, which was lifted from Wilkes and may even have been copyright violation, as I noted above). I'll try to fix some of the problems over time. Albanau used an anonymous IP when he started the article, but a check of that IP's contributions leaves no doubt that it was Albanau himself.

<p>In his <b>Lexicon of the Modern Greek Language</b> (1998), prominent Greek linguist and current Rector of the University of Athens, Professor Georgios Babiniotis<a href="http://uoa.gr/uoauk/html02/rector_uk.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://uoa.gr/uoauk/html02/rector_uk.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> states that the two names have been falsely conflated, and in fact do not share the same etymology. He postulates that the ancient name <i>Albania</i> derives from the Latin <i>Albanus (Mons)</i>, the name of a mountain in the Italian region of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latium.html" title="Latium">Latium</a>, while on the other hand <i>Arbanitai</i> is a mediaeval term first used many centuries later by the Byzantines to describe the inhabitants of a region in what is today central Albania. There is a gap of several centuries which is simply glossed over in the current and previous versions of the article, and <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a> is right to point out that we miss the connection. Is there <b>irrefutable</b> evidence to support the claim that "the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrian.html" title="Illyrian">Illyrian</a> ethnonyms <i>Albanoi</i>, <i>Arbanitai</i>, and <i>Arbanios</i> are from the same source as <i>Albania</i>, from which is [sic] also derived the modern ethnonyms <i><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanite.html" title="Arvanite">Arvanite</a></i>, <i>Arber</i>, and <i>Arbëreshë</i>"?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 08:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm frankly extremely suspicious of Babiniotis' idea [sic]. From what you've said, he doesn't even offer an etymology, he just suggests that they "have been conflated". He's not a crackpot, it seems, so I guess you can work in his suggestion as long as it is specified that it emanates from Babiniotis (it seems). Decius 15:38, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't like this article as it now (13:25, 8 November 2005), and I'm sure no one else does either. The problem goes back to Albanau, who apparently just lifted portions from Wilkes, some other sources, etc., but he didn't distill them properly. I will eventually go get Wilkes and some other books and online sources and see what I can do. Alexander 007 13:25, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I need references for the <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a> of <i>Arbanon</i>. Many linguists may well agree that <i>Arbanon</i> has the same etymology as <i><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanoi.html" title="Albanoi">Albanoi</a></i>. So the argument that "Arvanites derives from Arbanon, not Albania" is rendered moot. For other ethnonyms that may derive from <i>Arbanon</i>, see this interesting link from <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>: [<a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26398" class="external free" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26398" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26398</a> .

<dd>Well it's common knowledge that Albanians call their language "Shqip" and their country "Shqipëria". These substituted an older set of terms, namely "Arbërisht" or "Arbnisht" for the language and "Arbëria" or "Arbnia" for the country. Until the 11th century the country was called "Illyria", whereas since the 13th century, according to Latin dictionaries, it has been known as "Albania", a term easily related to "Arbnia", which in turn comes from an older term "Albanoi", first mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century as the name of the Illyrian tribe which lived in the north-central area of present day Albania. This is the kind of thing you learn in primary school, every Albanian knows them.

<p>Yes, but somebody has to notify Babiniotis (and Theathenae). It was no surprise to me, I'm just glad I found a Britannica reference. Alexander 007 16:57, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arbanon is the medieval Greek name for the region and is found in medieval documents which were written in Greek. Imagine this: 2000 years in the future archaeologists find an English newspaper which names the country <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> (and has a map). Would the archaeologists then say that the Finns used to call their country Finland? Wrong, they called it "Suomi". Arbanon is merely what they were called in Greek, not what they called themselves. Therefore, it is of no etymological significance.

<dd>I'm not concerned with that. My point is this: the Greek term <i>Arbanon</i> is modified from Illyrian. The Illyrian term <i>Arbanon</i> and <i>Albania</i> probably have the same etymology, because Wilkes and others treat them as both deriving from an Illyrian root, <i>Alb-</i>, <i>Arb-</i>. Simple as that. I wasn't making any other conclusions. Alexander 007 17:07, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is what I want to look further into. It is one thing to say that <i>Arbanitai</i> does not derive from <i>Albania</i> or <i>Albanoi</i>, but in fact from <i>Arbanon</i> (itself a Greek adaptation from Illyrian). It is another thing to say that <i>Arbanon</i> has an <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymon.html" title="Etymon">etymon</a> that is different from <i>Albania</i>---what is the argument for this latter point? References? Evidence?</p>
<p>I am not concerned much with the statement made by Britannica that <i>Albania</i> or <i>Albanians</i> may derive from <i>Arbanon</i>, though I find it humorous and a good way to counter G.B. and pull the rug from under him. Alexander 007 17:57, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
