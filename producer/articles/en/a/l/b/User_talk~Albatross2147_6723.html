<p>Your edit on Howards hypocrisy to national service is very well crafted. But I warn you there may be a lot of oppostion to its presence. I will support you if others choose to wipe it. 128.250.99.135 00:43, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Was your aim also to paint Howard as a hypocrite, or is that 128.250.99.135's intention alone? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 06:03, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Albatross2147,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I noticed you reverted the citation needed thingo which is fair enough. Given that to prove the somewhat bleeding obvious is nearly as hard as proving a negative can you wait a bit before striking out the alleged PoV statement?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>A little bit, but not too long.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Also at the risk of entering into a bitter ploemic (which I certainly don't want to do) I would be interested to know exactly what your objection is to the statement that in the 1960s he was a supporter of both NS and Aust's participation in the Vn War. I don't see how it could have been otherwise.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, people have made mistakes before. For example <a href="http://www.brushtail.com.au/july_04_on/senate_preferences.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brushtail.com.au/july_04_on/senate_preferences.html" rel="nofollow">this rant</a> claims that Family First were presumably "into the Iraq war like a rat up a drainpipe" when the policy platform was that they disapproved of the invasion. (I sent them an email in December 2004, and they're yet to correct the statement) The article originally talked about Howard "vociferously" supporting the war, which is hardly NPOV language. Even if he weren't in favour of the war and conscription, he may have decided to stay silent to avoid giving the North Vietnamese comfort. Frankly, I'm a bit tired of "fake but accurate" attitude some people have. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 06:03, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even though we suspect it, we can't assume that he did hold the same views as his party without evidence, nor does add much to talk about the views of his party as evidence of his own inconsistency. For eg, after the Vietnam war the Liberal party decided that South Vietnamese who had assisted the Australian forces should be evacuated. There was only one minister who wanted to leave them behind in the hands of the North Vietnamese. Guess who. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 07:27, 27 January 2006 (UTC) PS. I did manage to find a quote for you.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So long as it's from a reliable NPOV source, well ... I still wouldn't exactly be thrilled about the inclusion, given that one person wanted it included in order to paint Howard as a hypocrite. But if it's got a good citation, I won't try to get the section removed unless other people worry about how notable it is. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 08:01, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All depends on how it's used, really. Same as any other fact. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 08:32, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry you feel that way about my action there. I am merely cautioning against presenting something as fact when we don't know for sure that it is. In my opinion, it is still perfectly legitimate to discuss the gay claims within the text of the article. I don't feel this is censorship, since I haven't removed from the article the talk about these allegations. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 02:37, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Albatross2147,</p>
<p>I only just noticed your "re John Howard Talk" section on my talk page (not that it is a big issue, as the issues have been mentioned in the article talk page). I typically only look at the bottom of my user talk page, so if you have any further messages, can you start a new section unless there's an existing section near the bottom of the page?

<p>Remember to mark your edits as <b>m</b>inor when, but only when, they genuinely are (see <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">Wikipedia:Minor edit</a>). Marking a major change as a minor one, or vice versa, is considered poor etiquette.

<p>Dear Albatross</p>
<p>Would you please have a look at this disputed column and give an opinion by reading the citations and external links - or better still write a new article. It appears to be badly written, repetitious, and lacking neutrality. As it is a current dispute surely it should be no more than a paragraph with links to reputable reports. I would appreciate your opinion.Aagps 03:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid you have, in fact, got my stance wrong. I encourage a lot of the things to be put it, as many as possible. But to single out one show above all others when we have a wide range of them seems overtly unfair to the others and comes across as advertising. Don't get me wrong, I thought Cumberland Gang Show this year was good (yes, I went to see it&#160;;) ) but for an international event such as this, to single it out is injecting it above other shows.

<p>Alright...you caught me. I too can make typos...which I'm sure you've never done, and I commend you for it. I have since gone back and added the 'e' that I had so carelessly sailed over. Note that I didn't forget it in my link to his daughter. Aside from that, I find it itneresting that you decided to post such a comment on my page, and editor who wants to merge the small amount of information presented to the more relevant article <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Delezio_1000.html" title="Sophie Delezio">Sophie Delezio</a>, instead of on the talk pages of those who wish to see it go. My opinion was formed by reviewing both articles, and noting that there was very little to say about Mr. Del<i><b>E</b></i>zio. The only real notable facts, in my opinion, are his award and his award nomination, and of coarse that he's the father of Sophie. Other than that, he's just not that notable. However, those two bits of information <i>are</i> notable, and can fit just fine into his daughter's article.<b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 18:43, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Eusebeus. Your article was nominated for deletion. The majority of people believe it should be merged/deleted. The people who contribute to AFD understand that Wikipedia runs by consensus, they review the article as it would appear in a normal encyclopedia and form their opinion. I understand you're proud of your article. I understand you're angry that it has been nominated for deletion. I too have had articles I felt, and still feel are notable enough to be in Wikipedia and have been deleted via the AfD process. However I did not go around complaining on the talk pages of those who disagreed with me. I did go and try to prove my point, as you did, and failed as you are. But I realized when it was time to move on, I didn't continue to patronize other people by preaching what my idea of notability was...Wikipedia had <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">done</a> that for me.

<dd>You know what I meant by 'your article', and if you didn't...I was referring to the fact that you had taken responsibility for and were fighting vigorously to keep it alive (which I do respect (to a point) by the way). Technically speaking, you never asked me a question to begin with, but I did answer the implied query in my original comment back. However, since I obviously confused you, I will try reiterate as plainly as possible. I saw the AfD, I reviewed the article. I looked back on what other editors thought. I then reviewed over Sophie's article. Finally I factored all of this together and came to the conclusion that it was not notable enough for it's own article, but the awards and such could be mentioned in the Sophie articlle, which is notable. I'm sorry this has turned into the argument it has, but my opinion won't change, and neither will your's, so let's leave it at that and stop patronizing each other. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 04:56, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for bringing this to my attention, friend. I've corrected it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicthebrown_fe54.html" title="User:Tonicthebrown">Tonicthebrown</a> 10:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Albatross. Actually I am an ex-Adventist, but still have an interest in Adventism --hence my contribution to the Wikipedia articles. I wouldn't personally call the Adventists a cult, but I think some of their beliefs are definitely not mainstream Christian. I think I can be fairly NPOV because I want neither to glorify nor denigrate the church.</p>
<p>To clarify those terms for you: "Pentecostal" is a style of Christianity which focuses heavily on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, miracles and worship. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assemblies_of_God_c252.html" title="Assemblies of God">Assemblies of God</a> (AOG) are a denomination which are Pentecostal, and Hillsong is part of AOG. To be "non-denominational", a church cannot be part of a denomination (Anglican, Baptist, AOG, Adventist, etc.) Cheers. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicthebrown_fe54.html" title="User:Tonicthebrown">Tonicthebrown</a> 03:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Albatross - thanks for your comments. As you can see I am a new user, only trying out my first edit less than a week ago. The information about Ralph Reader living in Denton, Sussex comes from personal knowledge but is also sourced from "The East Sussex Village Book" by Rupert Taylor (1986) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-905392-59-0</a>. However I will visit the local museum (where I am a member) and find out exactly when and where her lived there. Cheers and best wishes Kevin - Seaford - Sussex</p>

<p>I have removed the Wp links you inserted to the articles on both the mythical and historical persons who happen to share the same names as the characters in the strip. My understanding is that the author of the strip does not intend that the characters should be perceived as referring to the mythical and historical persons. This might explain why the Ganesh character made only a single appearance since any representation is perhaps too unique. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 03:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh come on! You know that's exactly what he's doing. If not then why all the references to him walking on water and having stigmata? Anything he says about it being a joke or a stand-in is part of the comedy mocking the evasiveness of people who criticize or who do parodies. I really think they should be added back. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 15:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
