<dd>That's objective and (nearly) undisputed; if on top of that you want to push for adding a strongly disputed claim you'll have to add the dispute as well. See for example <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendrik_Lorentz_20c5.html" title="Hendrik Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9_760c.html" title="Henri Poincaré">Henri Poincaré</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity_priority_dispute.html" title="Relativity priority dispute">relativity priority dispute</a>, with which this article should be consistent. However, a simple link to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity_priority_dispute.html" title="Relativity priority dispute">relativity priority dispute</a> may be a good idea; we could for example add that "The widely held opinion that Einstein created the theory of special relativity has been contested, see [[<a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity_priority_dispute.html" title="Relativity priority dispute">relativity priority dispute</a>."; but I think such a phrase doesn't belong in the summary.

<dd>Work in progress; and what is "FARC"?! Anyway, from the above discussions it appears that there is concensus that here and there the tone was a bit overdone. And what of this one that is still there: "In his later years, his fame exceeded that of any other scientist in history". I'd say that his fame almost certainly did <i>not</i> exceed that of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, and I even vaguely remember having seen an opinion poll about it - but I don't know how to find it back... <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 01:33, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that's what I stated: work in progress. I don't always find the right words to really improve it, and I have limited time, as most of us. I guess that in one or two weeks we'll have improved it enough in a way that we all can live with it, so that we can remove that tag without opposition (and then no need to remove its featured status!). <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 10:16, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the tag thinking that Licorne had added it, as I was doing with some of his other edits on Wikipedia. A detailed look at the history suggested that <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> was actually the one who had added it, and I felt it would be inappropriate to remove his tag.

<p>To Ryan Delaney: If you place a clean up tag on an article then it's expected that you explain yourself. A one liner doesn't explain what's wrong with the article especially when it's something subjective as "tone". Specific examples would go a long way in helping others try to clean things up when you haven't done any editting on it in 3 weeks (sans reverts and putting the tag back). That said: what <i>exactly</i> is wrong? <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 06:38, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A quick scan doesn't reveal any obvious problems. If all the prior discussion has disappeared into the archives, it must be somewhat old. How about you re-explain the problems, since (obviously) you don't think they were solved.

<dd>For starters, cleanup tags go in the article space so that people who look at the articles will be encouraged to look for and fix the problems. This is a style issue about templates that has substantial precedent and if debated should be debated elsewhere. I'm busy with school right now (I probably shouldn't even be typing this) so I can't reiterate old discussion that I think is still relevant; that is, the problems are still there. You can find more than one example that I gave and is still unfixed, but there are others that I didn't name explicitly, for reasons outlined in the original post. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 16:58, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Smoluchowski</span></h2>
<p>I found an interesting source on this (see link below). It appears that, though Smoluchowski worked in parallel (and from other sources, starting before Einstein) on Brownian motion, his first publication was not only later than Einstein's, but also not correct (it was also different in methodology than Einstein's). From some other sources, Smoluchowski was concerned first and foremost with explaining Brownian motion, and thus didn't want to publish without experimental confirmation. Einstein's approach was 'here is a theoretical prediction of something that should happen. It may or may not be Brownian motion (his paper explicitly stated the measurements so far were not good enough to confirm agreement one way or the other). This predictive, rather than exlanatory approach allowed him to puplish first. Given this, I have moved the Smoluchowski comment to a footnote, where it is more appropriate to add brief qualifying information. However, I have no problem if someone else suggests or acts on a different way of handling this informaion. I would be interested if someone who has Bjerkne's book (e.g. Harald88) would comment on what it says in reference to Smoluchowski - if it claims (as Licorne did) that Smoluchowski's result is identical and similar in method to Einstein's, then Bjerkne's credibility takes another nosedive. The source is a translation of a paper by Langevin, along with some commentary: <a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/Langevin1908.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/Langevin1908.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/Langevin1908.pdf</a> --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPallen_518e.html" title="User:Pallen">Pallen</a> 05:09, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What's with removing all the external links!!</span></h2>
<p>I looked at the 5 pillars article, but I interpret is 'avoid an article consisting primarily or excessively of links'. It is a judgement call, but the recently deleted links (by Jibran1) are much more in the nature of 'references' that you find in any main article in Britannica. In the modern world, web references are the most accessible. I would like to argue in favor of restoring them, but don't want to start an edit war.--<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPallen_518e.html" title="User:Pallen">Pallen</a> 00:06, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, the reason given was not a very compelling one, but in looking over them, I thought most of those removed were unlikely to significantly aid the reader and didn't look like they were being used in the article as references. I am a fan of culling down external links every once in awhile (too many external links gives too much choice to be useful, in my experience), though I don't think the five pillars is a good justification for that. I restored one which was a good site, but we don't need to link to every Einstein-related site on the internet. I removed the letter from Einstein to FDR simply because we already have a whole article on it linked prominently in the text itself, and from there it is accessible both as external links and at Wikisource. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h4>
<p>The WWII part is actually a bit more complicated than presented here. What happened is that when Hitler came to power in 1933 is that Einstein was on the boat for his return trip to Europe. While on the boat he found out that the Nazi's has ransacked his vacation home in Caputh, his bankaccount was blocked, and his beloved sailing boat had been confiscated. When he arrived in the Belgian port of Antwerp he decided to stay there, and not to continue his trip back to Germany. With the help of his Belgian friends (De Groodt and De Donder) he rented a house in the Belgian beach resort of De Haan (Le Coq in French), and stayed there for several months. While there he co-signed a declaration denouncing the newly established Nazi regime, and declared that he did not want to live in a country where basic human freedoms were not guaranteed. Following that there was a official condemnation by the Prussian Academy of Sciences, at which point Einstein resigned as member of the Prussian Academy, and renounced his Prussian citizenship as well. At the end of all this turmoil he was offered a permament position at Princeton, and he returned to the US to never return to Germany.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An Einstein Quote</span></h2>
<p>I came across a powerful quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
<p>“The world is too terrible a place to live in, not because of the bad things that happen, but because of the good people who stand by and do nothing."</p>
<p>I believe it is relevant to this very moment in time.</p>
<p>There are other quotes from Einstein embedded in the existing Article.</p>
<p>I tried to add it to the Einstein Article, but was reversed with the comment “Quotes belong in Wikiquote".</p>
<p>I would like to see this quote inserted in Einstein’s ‘Personality’ Section between his ‘Religious’ and ‘Political’ views. I feel this quote would be more powerful in the flow of the Article itself, than in another link altogether.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">extraordinary professor at the University of Leiden</span></h2>
<p>Some clarification seems warranted. "Extraordinary" is in no way intended as a "peacock" phrase. What is stands for is "buitengewoon" in Dutch. This is a pretty common arrangement at Dutch Universities, where somebody who has his main employment somewhere else (often in industry, or at a University or research institute elsewhere) may hold a parttime appointment at the University. Typically for 1 day/week, or -as in Einstein's case- for a few weeks/year. Such a 'buitengewoon' professor has all the privileges of a full professor, may give lectures on special topics, or may supervise graduate students who may do their lab work at the place of his main employment. 'Extraordinary' is the literal translation of 'buitengewoon'; however, as pointed out by <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a>, is may raise some unwanted associations. For the time being I have come up with 'parttime appointment'; I don't like it, but it is all I can think of for now.

<dd>There's no need to delete perfectly good terminology which is used in plenty of scholarly works. "Extraordinary professor" is the way that term is translated and that's probably why Wikipedia has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;domains=en.wikipedia.org&amp;q=extraordinary+professor&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;domains=en.wikipedia.org&amp;q=extraordinary+professor&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">plenty of articles using that term</a>; it should be noted that "extraodinary professor" does have different meanings though, depending on the country of origin. Some of this is explained in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">professor</a>, but I don't see the Dutch version. The reasonable course of action here is just to insert the appropriate info in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">professor</a>, or create a kind of disambig page for extraordinary professor, and use the term in the article, linking to it if someone thinks it really necessary. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 14:26, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To say that he was "extraordinary" is ambiguous in English.

<dd>The term "extraordinary professor" may be ambiguous in English only because we are unfamiliar with its use as a formal title in this country.

<p>I am not aware of any thought experiment involving a mirror with Einstein; however, Jacob Bronowski, in his Book, "<b>The Ascent of Man</b>: A Personal View" by J. Bronowski," which was also produced as a mini-series docu-film version of the book, and in which he relates that Einstein did have a thought experiment on the speed of light while taking the tram to and from the patent office. Einstein had a view of a clock on a tower and apparently wondered what would happen as he receded from the clock at an ever increasing speed until he reached the speed of light so that the wave front reaching Einstein would remain static and the time as shown on the clock would freeze.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Family life</span></h2>
<p>What I noticed is that the subject of family life is spread out all over the place. Somewhere it mentions that he fell in love with Mileva, several paragraphs later it mentions that Mileva and Albert had a daughter out of wedlock, then again several paragraphs later it mentions that they got married, and many paragraphs further down it says that they had two sons, got divored, and that he married Elsa. Wouldn't it make more sense to collect all that in one paragraph upfront, so that the main body of the article can focus on his education, professional carreer, and scientific achievements? <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 01:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article seems to follow an historic timeline: events are arranged according to when they happened, and not categorized in subjects. An example of this is the "family life" issue brought up in the previous paragraph, but it is much more widespread than that. I just noticed the confusion about citizenship; that subject of citizenship is also spread out over paragraphs throughout the article, just like the family life thing. I think that in an encyclopedia you try the subdivide an article in a number of logical subjects; make separate paragraphs about "private life", "youth and education", "professional carreer", and "scientific contributions", perhaps one on "political views" as well, things like that. That way the article would be much more focussed, and also duplication would be avoided as is happening now. However, to rearrange the article that way would be a huge task, and I am not sure whether it is worth the effort. <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 08:40, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, however you want to do it. Categorization by subject matter and characterization by narrative are just two different approaches. The current is somewhat of a hybrid, which I personally think is fine. I find that articles which try to be overly categorized by subject are often a bit hard to read and often end up being very redundant (since you have to give some of the same context many times over), but anyway, that's just one approach. I think most long biographies exist in a productive tension between the two narrative forms. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 16:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Most of it was copy-and-pasted from other articles on the web. Even if these are from NASA, this is generally discouraged, especially for large amounts of narrative text. If you think the NASA article is important, we can add an external link to it. The NASA page also lists an author credit which generally means that they are supposed to be credited as the author, which we do not do with text edits generally, and so I don't think it works with our licensing.</li>
<li>The article is already very long and has a coherent narrative structure. The added text almost doubled its length, disrupts the narrative completely, repeats things already said, and generally is not compatible with the other text.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Einstein's iconification</span></h3>
<p>Today Einstein is regarded as an <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> throughout the world, and his name stands synonymous with <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence.html" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a> and the revolutionisation of the world, ushering in the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_age.html" title="Atomic age">atomic age</a>. There are myths ranging from the claim that Einstein donated his brain for further scientific post-mortem analysis, bad school years, to claims that he invented or found the relationship between energy and mass in E=mc². Einstein is constantly featured on various magazine covers, reports, documentations, stamps, comic figures, coins, T-shirts, wallpapers, posters... and lionized by the public at large. <i>The remarkable thing is that Albert Einstein achieved that universality in the pre-television era, without an agent or the help of a public-relations company. His face has become an icon for wisdom, imagination, creativity and concentrated mental power; his brand name so pervasive a synonym for genius that even he once had to confess: "I am no Einstein."</i></p>
<p>Reasons for Einstein's iconification:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ubiquity of the older Einstein image meant that the concept of the scientific genius became associated with the image of an old fatherly figure</li>
<li>Extensive media coverage, whilst concealing the message, thus appealing to people's interest in mystery.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Einstein restored belief in the unintelligibility of science. Everyone knew that Einstein had done something important in 1905 (and again in 1915) but almost nobody could tell you exactly what it was. When Einstein was interviewed for a Dutch newspaper in 1921, he attributed his mass appeal to the mystery of his work for the ordinary person: "Does it make a silly impression on me, here and yonder, about my theories of which they cannot understand a word? I think it is funny and also interesting to observe. I am sure that it is the mystery of non-understanding that appeals to them...it impresses them, it has the colour and the appeal of the mysterious."</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Relativity soon established as a fashionable notion and scientific hallmark</li>
<li>Paraphrasing ideas about space and time by using familiar words, such as mass and energy, but endowing them with new and seemingly richer meanings</li>
<li>Bandwagon propaganda: convincing the subject that one side is the winning side, because more people have joined it (appeal of the subject towards stronger, majority groups) [example links &amp; quotes required, Michelson-Moore, etc..]</li>
<li>Card stacking: presenting information that supports an idea or proposal and omitting information contrary to it</li>
<li>Glittering generalities: words that have different positive meaning for individual subjects, but are linked to highly valued concepts, thus concepts less critically questioned by the subject</li>
<li>Lesser of two evils: tries to convince us of an idea or proposal by presenting it as the least offensive option [example links &amp; quotes required, Michelson-Moore, etc..]</li>
<li>Transfer: 'E=mc²' as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfer_%28propaganda%29.html" title="Transfer (propaganda)">transfer</a> technique. No other scienctist in history has been assigned a similar iconification symbol in such a direct approach</li>
<li>Plain folks: 'plain folks device' is an attempt by the propagandist to convince the public that his views reflect those of the common person and are therefore working for the benefit of the common person. This is attempted by the wording targeted at a specific audience as well as using of specific idioms or jokes: "everything is relative"</li>
<li>Simplification (stereotyping): reduction to a clear-cut choices e.g. "moving clocks run slow"</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h4>
<p>Before Einstein, the last scientist who had such a seemingly creative outburst was Sir Isaac Newton. It happened in 1666 when Newton secluded himself at his mother's farm to avoid an outbreak of plague at Cambridge. With nothing better to do, he developed his Theory of Universal Gravitation.</p>
<p><a name="Annus_mirabilis" id="Annus_mirabilis"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Annus mirabilis</span></h4>
<p>For centuries historians called 1666 Newton's annus mirabilis, or "miracle year." Now those words have a different meaning: Einstein and 1905. The United Nations has declared 2005 "The World Year of Physics" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Einstein's annus mirabilis.</p>
<p><a name="Superthinker...ordinary_man_-_or_both" id="Superthinker...ordinary_man_-_or_both"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Superthinker...ordinary man - or both</span></h4>
<p>Modern pop culture paints Einstein as a bushy-haired superthinker. His ideas, we're told, were improbably far ahead of other scientists. He must have come from some other planet--maybe the same one Newton grew up on.</p>
<p>Physicist and science historian <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Galison_350e.html" title="Peter Galison">Peter Galison</a> from <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> says that "He was a man of his time." All of his 1905 papers unraveled problems being worked on, with mixed success, by other scientists. "If Einstein hadn't been born, (those papers) would have been written in some form, eventually, by others".</p>
<p>What's remarkable about 1905 is that a single person authored all five papers (with the help of his wife and friends), plus the original, irreverent way Einstein came to his conclusions.</p>
<p>For example: the photoelectric effect. This was a puzzle in the early 1900s. When light hits a metal, like zinc, electrons fly off. This can happen only if light comes in little packets concentrated enough to knock an electron loose. A spread-out wave wouldn't do the photoelectric trick.</p>
<p>The solution seems simple--light is particulate. Indeed, this is the solution Einstein proposed in 1905 and won the Nobel Prize for in 1921. Other physicists like Max Planck (working on a related problem: blackbody radiation), more senior and experienced than Einstein, were closing in on the answer, but Einstein got there first. Why?</p>
<p>It's a question of authority.</p>
<p><a name="Authority" id="Authority"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Authority</span></h4>
<p>"In Einstein's day, if you tried to say that light was made of particles, you found yourself disagreeing with physicist <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Clerk_Maxwell_e091.html" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>. Nobody wanted to do that," says Galison. Maxwell's equations were enormously successful, unifying the physics of electricity, magnetism and optics. <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell.html" title="Maxwell">Maxwell</a> had proved beyond any doubt that light was an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetic.html" title="Electromagnetic">electromagnetic</a> wave. Maxwell was an Authority Figure.</p>
<p>Einstein didn't give a fig for authority. He didn't resist being told what to do, not so much, but he hated being told what was true. Even as a child he was constantly doubting and questioning. "Your mere presence here undermines the class's respect for me," spat his 7th grade teacher, Dr. Joseph Degenhart. (Degenhart also predicted that Einstein "would never get anywhere in life.") This character flaw was to be a key ingredient in Einstein's discoveries.</p>

Einstein's High School Diploma. Contrary to urban legend, Albert did great in school.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the age of 7, Einstein started school in Munich. At the age of 9, he entered the Luitpold-Gymnasium. By the age of 12 he was studying calculus. Now this was very advanced, because the students would normally study calculus when they were 15 years old. He was very good at the sciences. But, because the 19th-century German education system was very harsh and regimented, he didn't really develop his non-mathematical skills (such as history, languages, music and geography). In fact, it was his mother, not his school, who encouraged him to study the violin - and he did quite well at that as well.</p>
<p>In 1895, he sat the entrance examinations to get into the prestigious Federal Polytechnic School (or Academy) in Zurich, Switzerland. He was 16, two years younger than his fellow applicants. He did outstandingly well in physics and mathematics, but failed the non-science subjects, doing especially badly in French - so he was not accepted. So in that same year, he continued his studies at the Canton school in Aargau (also called Aarau). He studied well, and this time, he passed the entry exams into the Federal Polytechnic School (see diploma to the right).</p>
<p>So how did the myth that he failed high school start?</p>
<p>Easy. In 1896, which was Einstein's last year at the school in Aargau, the school's system of marking was reversed.</p>
<p>A grading of "6", which had previously been the lowest mark, was now the highest mark. And so, a grading of "1", which had been the highest mark, was now the lowest mark.</p>
<p>And so, anybody looking up Einstein's grades would see that he had scored lots of grades around "1" - which under the new marking scheme, meant a "fail".</p>
<p>"In 1905," notes Galison, "Einstein had just received his Ph.D. He wasn't beholden to a thesis advisor or any other authority figure." His mind was free to roam accordingly.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Maxwell was right. Light is a wave. But Einstein was right, too. Light is a particle. This bizarre duality baffles Physics 101 students today just as it baffled Einstein in 1905. How can light be both? Einstein had no idea.</p>
<p>That didn't slow him down. Disdaining caution, Einstein adopted the intuitive leap as a basic tool. "I believe in intuition and inspiration," he wrote in 1931. "At times I feel certain I am right while not knowing the reason."</p>
<p>Although Einstein's five papers were published in a single year, he had been thinking about physics, deeply, since childhood. "Science was dinner-table conversation in the Einstein household," explains Galison. Albert's father Hermann and uncle Jakob ran a German company making such things as dynamos, arc lamps, light bulbs and telephones. This was high-tech at the turn of the century, "like a Silicon Valley company would be today," notes Galison. "Albert's interest in science and technology came naturally."</p>
<p><a name="Last_effort" id="Last_effort"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Last effort</span></h4>
<p>Later in life, it should be remembered, he struggled mightily to produce a unified field theory, combining gravity with other forces of nature. He failed. Einstein's brainpower was not limitless.</p>
<p>Neither was Einstein's brain. It was removed without permission by Dr. Thomas Harvey in 1955 when Einstein died. He probably expected to find something extraordinary: Einstein's mother Pauline had famously worried that baby Einstein's head was lopsided. (Einstein's grandmother had a different concern: "Much too fat!") But Einstein's brain looked much like any other, gray, crinkly, and, if anything, a trifle smaller than average.</p>
<p>Detailed studies of Einstein's brain are few and recent. In 1985, for instance, Prof. Marian Diamond of UC Berkeley reported an above-average number of glial cells (which nourish neurons) in areas of the left hemisphere thought to control math skills. In 1999, neuroscientist Sandra Witelson reported that Einstein's inferior parietal lobe, an area related to mathematical reasoning, was 15% wider than normal. Furthermore, she found, the Slyvian fissure, a groove that normally extends from the front of the brain to the back, did not go all the way in Einstein's case. Might this have allowed greater connectivity among different parts of Einstein's brain?</p>
<p>No one knows.</p>
<p>Not knowing. It makes some researchers feel uncomfortable. It exhilarated Einstein: "The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious," he said. "It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science."</p>
<p>It's the fundamental emotion that Einstein felt, walking to work, awake with the baby, sitting at the dinner table. Wonder beat exhaustion, every day. (Source: Nasa article)</p>
<p><a name="Einstein.27s_Self_Doubts" id="Einstein.27s_Self_Doubts"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Einstein's Self Doubts</span></h4>
<p>Einstein himself at various times had expressed doubts about the edifice of modern physics that he had helped to create— witness the remarks that follow. Perhaps his most serious expression of doubt came in a 1954 letter, the year before he died, to his friend Michel Besso: "I consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept, i.e. on continuous structures. In that case, nothing remains of my entire castle in the air, gravitation theory included, and of the rest of modern physics."[1] Biographer Abraham Pais hastens to excuse this slip from contemporary certainty about relativity theory, claiming that virtually all physicists think that this self-assessment at the end of Einstein's life was "unreasonably harsh." But just a few years earlier (1948), in an introduction to a popularized book about relativity, Einstein was also circumspect about physics, in a more general sense: ". . .the growth of our factual knowledge, together with the striving for a unified theoretical conception comprising all empirical data, has led to the present situation which is characterized— notwithstanding all successes— by an uncertainty concerning the choice of basic theoretical concepts."[2]</p>
<p>In my estimation, Einstein was a person much more cautious about dogmatic expression than those who have claimed invincibility for his relativity theories. In a letter to J. Lee in 1945, Einstein wrote: "A scientific person will never understand why he should believe opinions only because they are written in a certain book. Furthermore, he will never believe that the results of his own attempts are final."[3]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dr. James DeMeo has unearthed ambiguities in Einstein's reaction to the threatening experimental results from Dr. Dayton C. Miller, who in June 1933 published in Reviews of Modern Physics, "The Ether-Drift Experiment and the Determination of the Absolute Motion of the Earth."16 In the present issue, DeMeo (p. 72) provides an outstanding critique of the Miller work and its apparently glib rejection by others, such as Einstein's biographers, who dismiss Miller's work outright. Though Miller's extensive experimental work is not crucial to Einstein criticism, Einstein's and others' reaction to it is very telling.</p>

<p>The other great scientific transformation, which occurred as the icon was emerging, concerned the style of scientific work. In the 'brilliant papers of 1905, we see the hallmark of the young Einstein: penetrating ideas, motivated by crucial thought-experiments and finally fashioned into perfect form by mathematics that is "as simple as possible but no simpler".' . During the formulation of GR Einstein was introduced to the power of abstract mathematical formalisms, notably that of <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tensor_calculus.html" title="Tensor calculus">tensor calculus</a>. In the following years the blanced of deep physical insight orchestrating the mathematics of GR, tipped the other way and thus a rising fascination with the abstract formalisms themselves. "Rather than using physical arguments or thought-experiments, the strength and degrees of completeness of the formalisms themselves were used to sift their appropriateness as physical theories."</p>

<p>The stall in progress regarding a unified theory and many other theoretical scientific fields is greatly attributed to this paradim shift, ushered by Einstein's populist-style promotion of his Theory of general relativity: <i>The ill effects of such nonsense have spread throughout western science and culture over the last century. The problem seems to have sprung from the worship of Einstein, who was the first to discard verifiable physical laws altogether and propose a wholly mathematical theory.</i></p>
<p>Those who would aspire to a theory of everything are told they must undertake "the gruelling complex and abstract mathematics" required for the task. Who says so? Mathematicians of course. It is a chronically narrow view, like looking through the wrong end of the telescope and imagining you see stars. This view has led to elitism in physics based on mathematical ability. Most bizarre have been those who claim to see God in their own image – as a mathematician. <i>(New Scientist, Magazine issue 2529, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/quantum-world/mg18825293.200-editorial-physics-greatest-endeavour-is-grinding-to-a-halt.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/quantum-world/mg18825293.200-editorial-physics-greatest-endeavour-is-grinding-to-a-halt.html" rel="nofollow">"Physics' greatest endeavour is grinding to a halt"</a>)</i></p>
<p>One expert on relativity theory attempted to discourage such hubris. He publicly exposed an inconsistency in Einstein's special theory of relativity. Following his experience of other leading experts deliberately misinterpreting and misrepresenting the problem he posed, he wrote: "<i>I am not yet convinced that facility in performing mathematical operations must inevitably deprive its possessor of the power of elementary reasoning, though the evidence against me is strong."</i> (Professor H. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dingle.html" title="Dingle">Dingle</a> in his Presidential Address to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1953.)</p>

<p>Guys... The quotes are not bons mots, they provide a _Concise_ views of Einstein's Well_Thought_Out, Well_Articulated views on religion. I've spent many years studying the topic.</p>
<p>There is no mistaking what Einstein thought, the quotes have links showing the greater context.</p>
<p>The [ now deleted ] section that called Einstein a theist is like calling Charles Darwin a theist... anyone who has taken the time to study his point of view would soon discover that.</p>
<p>General_Relativity's Cosmological_Constant is at the very heart of today's Standard_Model of cosmology, Lambda_CDM, and Einstein was the one who first convinced the world that photons and atoms exist.</p>
<p>Einstein's "Cosmic_Religious_Sense" was inspired by today's standard models of cosmology and particle physics and eschews the "primitive" gods of traditional society.</p>
<p>His non-standard use of the word God does _Not_ invoke an image that one would pray to.</p>
<p>Einstein's metaphysics was very special in that he discovered many causalities _Decades_ before they were empirically proven.</p>
<p>If you disagree with some portion, then let's discuss it... instead of totally trashing it.</p>
<p>Until I get totally shutdown, I'll continue to insist that Einstein was a Scientist with advanced metaphysical views, not a theist by any standard usage of the word. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Relf_e709.html" title="User:Jeff Relf">Jeff Relf</a> 17:28, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

No one is saying Eistein was a theist or that your information is wrong - just that you are presenting what is apparently a big list of quotes with a lot of original interpretations of those quotes. You are creating the situation where <i>your</i> interpretation of Einstein's meaning is being passed off as the "standard interpretation" which is not necessarily the case.

<p>Hi Astral_Usenet,</p>
<p>My comments and quotes are very concise and the links provide the context, further detailing Einstein's views on religion.</p>
<p>I tell of his muses, what drove him to find the deeper causalities, zooming ever farther out/in.</p>
<p>By the way, Astral_Usenet, For some unknown reason, most of what I wrote got munged so I had to revert to an older copy I had, undoing your changes.</p>
<p>Hard coded carriage returns don't show up in the HTML and they make it easier for me to edit the souce-text in Visual_Studio.</p>
<p>Further, they make it _Much_ easier to track changes.</p>
<p>So why did you take them out&#160;?</p>
<p>Also, blank lines makes the text much more readable.</p>

<dd>Hello Jeff, The religious views section is straying more and more away from the general style found on wikipedia pages. It is looking like a collection of disparate sentences with no overall coherence. There is little flow between topics and the sequence is jumbled. If you wish to generate a list of his quotes then there is a separate place for that, this is effectively an open source encyclopedia not the place for personal interpretations and opinions. As for the blank lines an forced carriage returns it actually makes the text less readable for most people. While it doesnt directly affect the displayed product, your process of single sentence paragraphs makes for very, very hard reading. The source code is much harder for anyone except you to edit and you increase the amount of the scree which must be used. From what I can see, you are determined to "buck" the conventions used here and do things your own way. Is there any reason for this? --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstralusenet_f713.html" title="User:Astralusenet">Astralusenet</a> 14:19, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Astral_Usenet,</p>
<p>The first sentence of the paragraph that you added, right below the stuff I wrote, is basically saying: Jew, Jew, Jew. Nice going.</p>
<p>Einstein was _Not_ raised Jewish, whatever that means, it's enough to say he thought of himself as an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_Jew_ec52.html" title="Ethnic Jew">ethnic Jew</a>, not a practitioner of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>.</p>
<p>Why, for God's sake, do you link to the word <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> and not the term Ethnic Jew&#160;?&#160;! Huh&#160;! I should call an administrator about that one.</p>
<p>What I wrote does have a coherent thread, it does outline his thoughts on God, religion, physics and metaphysics.</p>
<p>What I wrote is concise with very carfully selected quotes. All of my quotes have links to the greater context... providing a plethora of further content.</p>
<p>Einstein was very articulate, a deep thinker, and, although you don't agree with him, there is no mistaking his point of view.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with a particluar word or sentence, let's examine that.</p>

 Hi  Muchness and Vsmith,
   The previous version was a lot of nonsense about
 Einstein's Jewishness and little about his actual
 convictions that wasn't already said 
 in what I wrote.
    Einstein's religious views were extremely well 
 thought out and he was very articulate so that it's
 hard to mistake his views.  The quotes and the
 links to the greater context further remove 
 any doubt about what he meant.
   I suspect that the real problem is that 
 you two disagree with his views.
   Instead of deleting what I wrote en masse,
 I suggest we agrue it line by line.

 Hi Muchness,
   I only removed CRs from the source code,
 the resulting display was uneffected.
 I did that so that changes are easier to track
 and because I find it easier to edit that way.
   The quotes have to be there, otherwise 
 it looks like I'm just making stuff up.
 The quotes come with links to the greater context,
 another essential feature.
   What I wrote does have a definate thread,
 and is _Very_ on topic.
   As I said, the edit you prepose to revert too
 essentially said:  Jew, Jew, Jew.
   You obviously agree with that, and not with
 Einstein's views... you should be ashamed,
 in my opinion.

<dd>Jeff, you are now inserting nonsense. To believe that, based on the quote given, that Einstein believed all randomness was pseudorandomness is not only the worst of your own ridiculous interpretations, but it reflects not only a poor understanding of Einstein's views of randomness but a total lack of understanding of what pseudorandomness means. I think you've tried our patience here quite enough, and if you are not going to introduce real secondary literature which espouses your interpretations of Einstein's belief, I am going to be forced to delete all of your additions to them based on our <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> policy.

 Hi  Fastfission,  
   Einstein took the very metaphysical, 
 yet very sober view that 
 all randomness is pseudorandom.
   The very famous Einstein-Bohr debates, 
 extending over 20 years, are just one example.
   So, contrary to your suggestion above, 
 it's what Einstein believed, not Original_Research.

<p>Actually, the issue with the measurement of General Relativity by Eddington in 1917 was that the measurement of the star's displacement on the photographic place was on the very edge of limits of the experiment's acceptable errors due the the equipment, weather, etc. In essence, Eddington saw what he wanted to see, although this effect has been measured to far greater precision manytimes over</p>

<p>This article contains two errors.</p>
<p>1. The 1918 solar eclipse observation did not really confirm Einstein's prediction. The results were in the margin of error. Only later, more accurate observations of the solar eclipse really confirmed Einstein's theory. Actually, the 1918 eclipes observation did convince most everyone Einstein's theory was correct, but in reality it should not have do so. As it really did not confirm Einstein's prediction.</p>
<p>2. Einstein signed not one, but two letters to FDR alerting him to the need that the US needed to investigate the possibility of an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>This second point I learned from a History Channel special on Szilard's attempt to warn FDR. Both letters were probably written by Szilard.</p>

<p>I cleared this whole paragraph since it was completely useless. It's funny though. The person who did this was 24.47.19.9, which have a habit of vandalizing articles. "In 1902 Einstien had a dream he was bing chased by black midgets who tried to eat his mothers cranberries. The midgets were Moe Chirs and Craig therefore MC squared. The night before he was told that Elderberries taste like rainber sherbert straightr from the leprachauns behind. thats where the E came from. After having this dream he invented the flux cupassitor which enabled him to go back in time and eat the rainbow sherbert straight from the lepraxhauns behind because its better that wa. He soon found out that in 1641 that leprachauns were too ugly to eat from so he had to settle for the creamsicle sherbert from the unicorns behind. This unicorn feces tasted incredible . He couldn;t believe what he came upon. He was going to go back and tell the world but someone through a spare testicle from a three baller and it hit thim right in the gwigglesposher. This put him into a coma for 62 years straight and when he woke up he kept saying E=MCsquared over and over again. Brock Lee a man from the time that he was in took Einsteins idea and told it to his kids so they could grow up and invent bombs. HE named his kid Albert Einstein and that Albert Einstien is the one who invented bombs and is wanted in 36 countries. To this day people think he is alive becuase he invented a solution consisting of unicorn feces a beard form an irish goblin and the neck of the fattest kid he knew (his name was Phil) this concoction gave him eternal life and he is believed to live somewhere in the mideast under the name Chris parker but his friends call him osama been lame man."--<a href="../../../r/n/a/User%7ERNAi_0c75.html" title="User:RNAi">RNAi</a> 06:58, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Astralusenet, I think you are absolutely correct. Unfortunately a single user, Jeff Relf, refuses to listen to anyone else, and thinks that he understands Einstein's religious views. Additionally, Jeff confuses Einstein's religion and Einstein's metaphysics in a rather ridiculous ways, and attributes notions to Einstein that show a definite lack of understanding. Note, for example, Jeff's consistent misuse of the idea of pseudorandomness — he thinks it refers to the believe that all random phenomena is at heart deterministic, when in reality it refers to the ability to simulate random phenomena by use of determinist methods, an entirely different thing. Jeff does not care nor understand how articles are written or formatted on Wikipedia, and has clearly never understood our policy on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. My hope is that someone will take the time to write a few short paragraphs on Einstein's <i>religious</i> beliefs, will source them with secondary sources, and then we can have a pointless yet apparently necessary straw poll as to whether it is better than Jeff's personal Einstein. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 22:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

 Hi  Fastfission,  The Wiki entry on the word
 <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudorandomness.html" title="Pseudorandomness">Pseudorandomness</a> begins:
 " A pseudorandom process is a process that 
   appears random but is not. 
   Pseudorandom sequences typically exhibit
   statistical randomness while being generated by
   an entirely deterministic causal process."
 As you can see, the meaning is not restricted
 to computer simulations.
     As the quotes from Einstein reveal,
 Nothing I wrote was Original_Research.
 In fact, that's why the quotes Must_Be there,
 no matter how much you disagree with Einstein.

 Hi  Astralusenet,
 The footnotes provide the context,
 Einstein's views are perfectly clear,
 and well documented over many decades.
 People need the quotes because, like you,
 they don't know, or can't accept, Einstein's views.
    The clash between Einstein 
 and traditional religion is even greater than
 that between Darwin and traditional religion,
 I believe.

 Hi  Desdinova,  My interpretation of the word God
 is _Nothing_ like Einstein's, nothing at all.
 I say the word God denotes a postion:
 I'm God's slave, and God to my slaves.
   For example, if you raise mice 
 to feed your snake, then you're God to those mice, 
 because you created/controlled/destroyed them.

 2. Added titles to the _Ref_ tags.
    Although many CRs were added by hand,

    ...the end-user saw no other changes.
 3. Reverted 3 times to the version

<dd>The bits and peices that various contributors have added to the Religious Views section has descended it into a collection of phrases surrounding a quote, attributed to Einstein but often available from a single website source. In addition to this, there are meaningless sections like <i>Einstein postulated that time is pseudo-directional because randomness is always pseudorandom, i.e. the future is just as immutable as the past, saying: "The scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation.The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past."</i> This begins from a premise (time is pseudo-directional) which may, at a push, be supported by the quote however it is then followed by the nonsense <i>randomness is always pseudorandom</i> which is far from supported by the quote. The implication here is that time and randomness are implicitly linked - this is not supported by the quote and can only be assumed to be original research. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstralusenet_f713.html" title="User:Astralusenet">Astralusenet</a> 17:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

 Hi  Astralusenet and  Harald88,
 The quote:
   " But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation.
     The future, to him, 
     is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. "
 was taken from the abridged edition of Einstein's book 
 " The World As I See It. "
 In this edition the essay appears on pp. 28-29.
 See:  www.EinsteinAndReligion.COM/sciencereligious.html
 It is also in Einstein's " Ideas and Opinions " book
 where the essay is entitled:  " The Religious Spirit of Science "
     If that wasn't enough, we have decade after decade,
 quote after quote, where Einstein said essentially the same thing.
 I can and will list them all for you, one at a time, right here.
   General Relativity's time-like dimension is symmetrical,
 meaning it works the same way no matter the direction of time,
 and it has _Spatial_ units:  ( - ( c * t ) ^ 2 ) ^ .5
 See  <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_time.html" title="Block time">Block_time</a>.
   A complete lack of acausality means randomness is always pseudo-random,
 that's why Einstein wrote:
   " I do not believe in freedom of the will. Schopenhauer's words:
     “ Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills ”
     accompany me in all situations throughout my life 
     and reconcile me with the actions of others
     even if they are rather painful to me.
       This awareness of the lack of freedom of will
     preserves me from taking too seriously myself
     and my fellow men as acting and deciding individuals
     and from losing my temper. "
 Astralusenet doesn't agree with this philosophy, I know.
 But that doesn't alter that fact that Einstein had this POV.

<dd>Jeff, I really have no idea where you are getting this from. Both general and special relativity imply that time is a dimension, yet it is not the <i>same</i> type of dimension as the three we are used to dealing with. Spatial dimensions have special characteristics, not found in the temporal dimension. The <i>units</i> of Time in relativity are not <i>spatial</i> in nature. Can I point out two additional things here. First off this is nothing to do with the Wiki entry on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstien_cf63.html" title="Albert Einstien">Albert Einstein</a> - I get the feeling you are trying to troll wiki and divert this off into different directions. If you want to start a debate on the dimensional nature of time then please find the appropriate place. Secondly, this is an example of how you put forward your <i>own</i> ideas with irrelevant referencing. Jeff, I see you have been on Wiki for some time so can you please spend a little while reading on accepted behaviour and what sort of things should and shouldnt be posted. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstralusenet_f713.html" title="User:Astralusenet">Astralusenet</a> 16:18, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

 Hi  Astral_Usenet,
     You interpretation of General and Special
 Relativity does not jibe with Einstein's,
 nor is it scientifically correct.
     Time is parochial and symmetrical
 in the standard models of particle physics
 and cosmology... the direction of time
 is irrelevant to the models.
 That's why Einstein wrote:
 " People like us, who believe in physics,
   know that the distinction between 
   past, present, and future 
   is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."
 Now, who's POV should prevail here ?
 Yours or Einstein's ?

 Hi  Astral_Usenet,
     Einstein's philosophy of time
 and the total lack of acausality
 was strongly influenced by General_Relativity
 and it's explained well enough by Einstein himself 
 in the many books he wrote.
   But if you took out what I wrote
 there'd be nothing but quotes.
 My wording simply adds emphasis and clarity
 to what Einstein wrote.
     Do you have a better way to add 
 emphasis and clarity to Einstein's POV ?
 If so, let's here what they are.

<p>I think an earlier formulation "Einstein made major contributions to SR", was a better formulation. SR really was, like calculus, a set of ideas whose time was ripe. The totality of Lorentz and Poincare's work before Einstein covers a large majority of the ideas and results of Einstein's first two papers on SR. Unlike Licorne, I think Einstein's contribution was substantial and deservedly influential, but 'developed' seems to me an over statement.

 Hi  Alvestrand, I use a code editor, Visual_Studio,
 set at 80 columns, monospaced.
 This makes for more deliberate edits, I find,
 instead of  " quickies ".
     I find it extremely difficult to compare
 entire paragraphs... stupid me.
 But why not compare shorter lines instead ?
    I only add the carriage returns to 
 the souce code that I'm working on,
 ...a small section to be sure.
 I welcome alternate assessments of 
 Einstein's religious views, so long as
 some of my assessments are also allowed, somewhere,
 along with some quotes and supporting footnotes.

 Hi  Alvestrand, I didn't write much,

 will have the line breaks in them.

 Hi  David_Underdown and Astral_Usenet,
     WikiPedia compares lines, 
 that comparison is almost useless when
 each line is one paragraph long.
     I'm only reading/editing
 the 7 paragraphs I wrote for 
 the Religious_Views section.
     I will add line breaks to the source code
 when I edit/read it, just like you remove them
 when you read/edit it... that's that, BFD.
   The end-user and most WikiPedia contributers
 are not effected in the least.

<dd>Jeff, I have no clue what you are talking about with <i>WikiPedia compares lines, that comparison is almost useless when each line is one paragraph long.</i> When I click on <i>diff</i> on my watchlist for example, Wikipedia <i>produces</i> a comparison screen right there in my browser. That screen contains two <i>side-by-side</i> columns of text all neatly <i>word-wrapped</i> with any differences highlighted in red or green. It only <i>messes up</i> occaisionally such as when some vandal enters a very long text string. I assume the others here see the same thing. Now, your comment suggests that you are using some other <i>comparison method</i> or else something is weird with your browser. Also, please note that we are not writing <i>source code</i> - rather we are writing an encyclopedia which is written in prose, not programming code. And that point is a <i>BFD</i>.</dd>
<dd>Now, you can stubbornly <i>do it your way</i> and have more <i>to worry about</i>, to quote from your talk, or you could try working with other editors - the Wikipedia way. If you persist in your stubbornness - your option - you will meet resistance and conflict.

 Hi  Vsmith,  I require a black background.
 I've been coding since 1976, professionally
 ever since the start of 1982... my eyes are bad.
     That means I _Must_ use something like 
 the style sheet override listed below.
     I'll see what changes I can make to it
 that might allow me to see WikiPedia's colors.
     I never said I was writing programming code,
 I was just using the term Source_Code to describe
 WikiPedia's syntax.
     As you can see, 
 whitespace is a very personal issue,
 each of use reserves/deserves the right
 to use it as we will.

 Hi  Jpgordon, a carriage return is white space
 and I've yet to see a diff that would ignore them.
     I'm partially blind, I have to use 
 Win_XP's high contrast mode, yellow on black.
 I also have to use FireFox's userContent.CSS to
 insure that the background color is always black.
     Highlighted/selected text is cyan on black,
 both in Win_XP and in all web pages I view.
     Because WikiPedia ignores these accessability
 issues I find it almost impossible to compare
 changes hidden deep inside long paragraphs.
    Adding line breaks to the source I wrote,
 7 paragraphs in the Religious_Views section,
 allows me to compare changes.
 Seldom do I edit any other section.
    Here are three possible solutions
 to this edit war:
    1. The admin gives me a pass on
       the line breaks I need in the source.
    2. WikiPedia's coders _Respect_ 
       my meed for a black background.
    3. Make WikiPedia's diff ignore line breaks
       and compares x number of words at a time.

 Hi  Stephan Schulz,

 Cyan on black is what selected/highlighted
