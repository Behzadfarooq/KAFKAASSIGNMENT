<ul>
<li>does Alba Iulia come from Balgrad (White City), or does Alba Iulia come from Apullum, or does Alba Iulia come from Gyula Feher Var (White Citadel/City Gyula)&#160;? is the etymology for Alba Iulia clear or controversial&#160;? -- <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 14:51, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, you have a point. I don't think we can say that there is a clear etymology for Alba Iulia. What I know for sure is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balgrad is a Slavic name comprising white+castle/citadel (not city)</li>
<li>Gyulafehervar is a Hungarian name comprising Gyula+white+castle/citadel</li>
<li>Alba Iulia is Latin. The word <i>alba</i> is a feminine form of <i>Albus</i> (late latin meaning white) and the word <i>Iulia</i> is a woman's name (sometimes written <i>Julia</i>). But it isn't clear that the name Alba Iulia comes from these words.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I've read:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Alba Iulia city hall Website, the first documentary reference to the name Alba Iulia is from a 1276 century source and was then taken over and consequently translated as Bãlgrad or Gyulafehérvár. This latter bit doesn't make sense, so I don't trust the 1276 date without other sources.</li>
<li>According to the Website <a href="http://www.poli.hu/erdely/varo_gyulaf.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.poli.hu/erdely/varo_gyulaf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.poli.hu/erdely/varo_gyulaf.htm</a> the name Belgrad - Fehérvár</li>
</ul>
<p>was inherited from the Byzantine Empire. But it doesn't say anything else, so this can't be trusted without other sources.</p>
<p>What seems speculative:</p>
<ul>
<li>which name came first</li>
<li>Balgrad and Gyulafehervar are clearly related, but whether and how Alba Iulia is related to them is not clear</li>
<li>the real meaning and origin of Alba Iulia. "White Julia" doesn't make any sense to me.</li>

<dd>Verespatak. Yes, it does not has the same meaning as in Romanian, but I read somewhere that it's because the name was translated wrongly.&#160;:-) Anyway, "Montană" is a recent Romanian word (the old word would be "Munteană"), so the Romanian name of the settlement probably has its origin in the early 20th century. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 11:31, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>let's see,: hungarian "veres" (read 'veresh') means 'bloody', "voros" (read 'veoreosh') and "piros" (read 'pirosh') mean 'red'; romanian "ros" and "rosu" (read 'rosh' and 'roshu') mean 'red', "singeros" means 'bloody'. could there be any relation between hungarian "piros" and "voros" to romanian "ros"&#160;? -- <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 13:24, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that <i>veres</i> is an archaic form of <i>vörös</i> (meaning red, but tends to be used for darker reds and browny reds whereas <i>piros</i> is used for brighter reds). It still retains the <i>veres</i> form in some surnames. The Hungarian for bloody is <i>véres</i>. Verespatak could mean "bloody stream" but more probably "red stream" (referring to a reddy-brown colour). I'm just basing my guess on the etymology, I don't know anything about the actual place. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Moore_265d.html" title="User:Scott Moore">Scott Moore</a> 16:10, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. No relation between Romanian 'rosu' (red; Lat. rosaeus) and Magyar 'piros' (red). What is interesting is that 'piros' is reminiscent of Indo-European 'pur', which meant 'fire', and which I think may be duplicated in 'purpur' (purple). Occasionally, there are correspondances (coincidental or not) between IE words and NonIE words. No relation between 'rosu' and 'voros' either. Also interesting is the resonance between Magyar 'zold' (green) and IE *zald (yellow, golden). Alexander 007 14:50, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, it is believed that the proto-Indo-Europeans and proto-Finno-Ugrians had contacts some thousands of years ago and zold/zald is one of the common words I heard about. The proto-IE had some contacts even with proto-Semits, but that's another story. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 19:38, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i'd speculate on Dacian tribe Apulensis from city Apulia(?)/Apoulon(?) at the origin of Alba Iulia, combined with Balgrad (White City(?)), but i lack the necessary argumentation. <i><a href="../../../a/p/u/Apulia.html" title="Apulia">Apulia</a></i> was a roman city in Italy, while <i>Apullum</i> (later <i>Municipium Apulensis</i>) was the roman castrum/municipium in Dacia built in place of the dacian city Apoulon. The slavs suposedly named the roman city Apulensis as Balgrad(white city), and later the ciy was called <i>Alba of Gelu</i> (alba=white in romanian), later <i>Alba of Gyula</i>, (Iuliu/Iulian=Julius/Julian in romanian Gyula=Julius/Julian in hungarian) <a href="http://www.apulum.ro/ro/istoria.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.apulum.ro/ro/istoria.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a> -- <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 18:50, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the Iulia of Alba Iulia is a female name, then it isn't linked to Gyula. The Hungarian form of Iulia/Julia is Júlia. In Hungarian, Gyula is a male name and was only linked to the Latin name Julius at a later date. In the context of Transylvania it seems far more likely that the Gyula in Gyulaféhervár comes from the title/name of the Magyar chieftains. See the article <a href="../../../g/y/u/Gyula.html" title="Gyula">Gyula</a>. Maybe there is a link between Iulia and Gelu. But I don't think Gelu could have become Gyula. If the name Gelu was Magyarised then I believe it would have become a front vowel word rather than a back vowel word like Gyula. Also in Hungarian, the letter 'g' is very different to the letter 'gy'. I assume the 'g' of 'Gelu' is similar to the 'g' in English words such as 'get'. The Hungarian 'gy' has no English equivalent but the nearest sound is the begining of the word 'duke'. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Moore_265d.html" title="User:Scott Moore">Scott Moore</a> 10:34, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In Romanian, "g" in "gelu" is a soft English "gel" or "gin". BTW, what is the etymology of Gelu? If it were from Latin "Julius" it should look "Giuliu" or "Juliu". <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 19:38, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apulum (now Alba Iulia) came to be known as Chrysopolis, 'the City of Gold' (chrysos=gold) after the Roman conquest (according to references; the Greek name is probably from Greek/Byzantine texts, I'll check). 'Leukos Chrysos' was the specific term for 'white gold'. Chrysopolis, 'the Golden city' (Orasul de Aur), is highly suggestive of 'the White city' (golden, radiant, brilliant, shining, white), so much so that the idea behind 'Alba Iulia', 'Gyulaferhevar', and 'Balgrad' quite likely goes back to the Daco-Romans. The apparently newer element is the 'Iulia/Gyula' element. There seem to be a lot of extraordinary "coincidences" in this Alba Iulia mystery. Alexander 007 04:50, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This reference states: "In fact, the city's seemingly unpronounceable name (sake-kesh-fehair-vahr) means 'Seat of the White Castle,' as it was the royal capital and white was the king's colour." So, I still contend that Gyulafehervár means "White Castle of Gyula". The genitive is more speculative, but Gyula White Castle is meaningless if Gyula was a personal name. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Moore_265d.html" title="User:Scott Moore">Scott Moore</a> 10:35, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>magyar dictionary says: var - citadel, fortress, (<i>kastely</i>) castle</p>
<dl>
<dd>And which dictionary is this? I presume you mean a Magyar-Angol dictionary? If it was the Országh László's dictionary then it is quite possible that it is incorrect (I've found numerous examples of inaccurate translations). The etymological dictionary stated that vár meant and still means:
<ul>
<li>erődítmény - ie. a fortress, fortification, stronghold</li>
<li>megerősített hely - ie fortified place, location</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Fellegvár can be translated as citadel, and várkastely as castle. But note that castle in English has different meanings. Várkastely would be used to describe e.g Windsor Castle which is a residence in the form of a castle, and not primarily a fortified building.

<p>so, the hungarians translated the latin Alba Regia as SzekesFeherVar, szek=chair('scaun' in romanian), szekes=where the chair/throne is('de scaun' in romanian)</p>
<p>so, Gyula Fehervar doesn't mean "White Castle of Gyula" no matter how appealing, but "Gyula White City/Citadel" and a connection to <i>Alba Regia</i> of Stephen I and Geza's documents is probable. so, Gyula Fehervar doesn't mean "White Castle of Gyula" no matter how appealing, but "Gyula White Citadel" and a connection to <i>Alba Regia</i> of Stephen I and Geza's documents is probable</p>

<p>Italian 'Giulio' is interchangeable with 'Julius' in Italian: see 'Giulio Cesare' for <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Ceasar_2461.html" title="Julius Ceasar">Julius Ceasar</a>.

<p>The same Indo-European root lies behind <i>alba</i> "white" (Latin, not Late Latin) and mountain "Alps". Accounting for mountainous Albania, for Albion, or Alba Longa. There are Dinaric Alps not directly connected with Swiss ones, and an "Albania" in the Caucasus. The "alba" of Alba Julia refers to the mountains, not necessarily white limestone or snow. Folk etymology easily translates an original "Mount Julia" to the more obvious reading in Latin, "White Julia". The translations follow the folk etymology. Thus "Alba Julia" precedes the other vernacular usages embodying "white". --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 17:04, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The mountain connection sounds plausible, and it should be looked into. The confusion is easy, considering that <i>Alb</i> is also the everyday word for 'white' in Romanian. Leaving aside Alba Iulia, and generally speaking, the 'white' meaning might be older than the 'mountain' meaning, and the progress may have been white snow-capped mountains-&gt; mountains in general, a mountain.

<p>Yes, it is defined as 'white', that's why I say 'white' is in general the older meaning, as in Latin 'alba' (white) and Greek 'alphos' (dull-white). So I guess you could conceivably translate 'Alba Iulia' as 'White Mount Iulia', if you wanted to, in addition to 'White Iulia' and 'Mount Iulia'. The state of the evidence being as it is, we should put 'White Iulia', 'Mount Iulia', and 'White Mount Iulia' on the card table. The 'White Iulia' option still looks good to me. 'Alba' in Latin meant not only 'white', but could also mean 'bright'. I'm looking for a Greek text where 'chrysos' (usually meant 'gold', 'golden') also meant 'bright, radiant', which would definitely link the name Chrysopolis to the name Alba Iulia.</p>
<p>Another thing that is quite interesting is the Apulum factor: there are indications that Apulum was a center of Dacian sun-worship, and 'apulum', 'apoulon' is connected by many to 'Apollo', the sun-god. The disc of the sun was sometimes called 'Chryseo-Kyklos', the 'golden disk', in Greek. That brings us to Chrysopolis---which brings us to Alba Iulia. Intriguing.

<p>It should be looked into, just in case. The problem is, I'm not sure if the Daco-Romans called the city 'Chrysopolis' themselves, or whether this was an exonym used by Byzantine Greeks, that being how they called the city: in which case, the Byzantines may have translated the Daco-Roman name. This one website makes it seem as if the Daco-Romans called it Chrysopolis: <a href="http://www.gk.ro/sarmizegetusa/alba_iulia/alba_lui_iuliu_st.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gk.ro/sarmizegetusa/alba_iulia/alba_lui_iuliu_st.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> but I find it hard to beleive that Daco-Romans would use such a Greek name. I fixed the link. The site is not necessarily totally reliable. It was most likely an exonym, an exonym of course based on the native name.</p>
<p>Fascinating: the Roman name <i>Julius</i> is derived from the PIE root <i>*deiw-</i>, 'to shine', from which comes 'dies' (day) and 'deus' (divinity), and the 'Ju' in Jupiter. Both 'alba' and 'iulia' can thus in a sense mean 'bright' (though this is probably a strange coincidence). In a much more immediate sense, Julius is defined as having meant "descended from Ju", that is to say, descended from Jupiter. Since claiming descent from Jupiter was common among nobility, one can see why the name Julius was popular, and names derived from Julius were also popular among nobility, if you get my drift. 'Julius', or names derived from, would have been popular among the early Vlach nobility, the Vlach rulers of the Dark Ages, and from them the names would have spread to other peoples. Within the context of Latin to Romanian sound-changes, I don't think 'julius' would have changed to 'gelu', so if they are connected it may have been via intermediaries. The 'iulia/gyula' element seems to be a new element (foreign influx, perhaps), while the 'alba' element has suggestive precedents. Alexander 007 18:33, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to Roman tradition Alba Longa in Italy was founded by a figure named <i>Iulius</i> (Iulius&gt;&gt;&gt;Alba Iulia). Interesting. 007 01:54, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
