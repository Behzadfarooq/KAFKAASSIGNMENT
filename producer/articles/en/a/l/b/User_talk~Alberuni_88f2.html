<p>New users in particular are often entranced by the openness of Wikipedia and dive right in. That's a good thing. But please note: be bold in updating pages does not mean that you should make deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories, such as Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Abortion. In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 19:51, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. I was trying to edit for readability. The article is over 30kb and I believed the long section on Previous Revelations needs to be broken out to other pages. The conspiracty stuff like Michael Moore's comments need to go to the conspiracy section or conspiracy wiki. Just MHO. Feel free to revert.

<p>Half of New Yorkers Believe US Leaders Had Foreknowledge of Impending 9-11 Attacks and “Consciously Failed” To Act; 66% Call For New Probe of Unanswered Questions by Congress or New York’s Attorney General, New Zogby International Poll Reveals</p>
<p>On the eve of a Republican National Convention invoking 9/11 symbols, sound bytes and imagery, half (49.3%) of New York City residents and 41% of New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders "knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act," according to the poll conducted by Zogby International. The poll of New York residents was conducted from Tuesday August 24 through Thursday August 26, 2004. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of +/-3.5.</p>
<p>The poll is the first of its kind conducted in America that surveys attitudes regarding US government complicity in the 9/11 tragedy. Despite the acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and over 38% of those who described themselves as "very conservative" supported the claim.</p>
<p>The charge found very high support among adults under 30 (62.8%), African-Americans (62.5%), Hispanics (60.1%), Asians (59.4%), and "Born Again" Evangelical Christians (47.9%).</p>

<dd>You appear unclear on the concept of Neutrality. It is neutral to state that a poll of New York City residents indicates that nearly half believe U.S. government leaders knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. It is not neutral to refer to a site reporting those results as a "campaign to educate the public about the Sept. 11th coverup." You see, the cover-up is not a neutral fact. It is an opinion. Surely, you can make more of an effort to be polite and to separate opinions from facts, can't you? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 05:28, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice detail that you've added here (and pretty quick as I only put about insurance claims on there a few mins ago - I know my wording wasn't up to much, so I was hoping someone would replace it with something better asap (especially as I think the financial aspects of the disaster are worth mentioning in the article, albeit that they're much much less significant than the loss of life).

<dd>Thanks for the kind words. The insurance disputes are an interesting issue but, yes, a sideshow to the main issues of direct loss of life, geopolitical wars and macroeconomic shifts caused by 9/11.

<dd>Thanks for your comments and support. I agree with your perception that this page needs alot of editing for NPOV. I would go further and say that there are many pages dealing with the Mideast that need this type of work. Some people intentionally inject a biased perspective into this encyclopedia as part of a propagandistic agenda. Others are unable to frame issues related to their closely held beliefs/biases into a more objective and neutral description. It's somewhat annoying to see blatant one-sided propaganda passed off as neutral fact but I guess this is an inevitable problem with any open source project dealing with highly controversial issues. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 15:47, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>P.S. There is nothing "biased" going on. Jordan took East Jerusalem and the West bank by <b>military force</b> and <b>occupied</b> it in defiance of the world community and even against the wishes of local Arabs. See <a href="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1948to1967_jordan_annex.php" class="external text" title="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1948to1967_jordan_annex.php" rel="nofollow">What did the Arabs do about Jordan's annexation of the parts of Palestine they captured?</a>. Also, several "Occupation" articles, unrelated to the Middle East, already exist on Wikipedia, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_occupations.html" title="List of military occupations">List of military occupations</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belligerent_occupation.html" title="Belligerent occupation">Belligerent occupation</a>.

<dd>You're on here a lot Alberuni, why haven't you shown any "humanitarian concern" for other groups? Out of the hundreds of edits you make every week, ALL of them are about Palestinians. Black Africans are being oppressed by Arabs on a much greater scale in the Sudan, why don't you talk about that?

<p>Hello Alberuni, I made the following proposal on <a href="../../../o/c/c/Talk%7EOccupation_of_Palestine_e2a4.html" title="Talk:Occupation of Palestine">Talk:Occupation of Palestine</a>. Would you be interested in taking part in this?</p>
<p>I very much oppose the creation of alternative articles. True, it will be very difficult to write a single article that will still be readable and not just a point-counterpoint list. But the whole point of the NPOV policy is to avoid the proliferation of alternative articles. If it happens for Israel//Palestine, then it will set a precedent to be imitated on all controversial topics. Also, if there are alternative Israel//Palestine articles, they will each tend to become far more POV than they are now. I think that we need to write an article that manages to incorporate fair descriptions of the conflicting POVs into one single narrative. This would be very hard work, and it would require a lot of editors on this topic to open their minds and change their intransigeant stance, but if we succeed, it would be a very big achievement, and (at the risk of sounding a bit pompous now) I think it might actually contribute to the understanding necessary for a genuine peace process. On the other hand you are right that it is much easier to start fresh. Also, all attempts to improve tha current Israel//Palestine articles are pretty futile, because they always descend into bickering about details. We really need to focus on the bigger picture, that's essential to writing a readable and enlightening article. I think Buff has given us a good outline of points of that bigger picture. So here is what I suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those who share a similar critique of the current <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> article get together and make a thorough analysis of where that article fails&#160;;</li>
<li>We make a list of the main points where the article fails, as well as a list of what we can keep&#160;;</li>
<li>Those who agree with the criticisms list get together and start a draft for a completely new article (at this point, those who disagree with the criticisms would not be allowed to pick it apart through the usual bickering about the details)&#160;;</li>
<li>This new draft article would be based on Buffs outline above as well as the two lists from the current article&#160;;</li>
<li>Only after we finish with the new draft do we ask those who defend the <i>status quo</i> of the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> article to contribute and edit the draft, and adapt the broad narrative to incorporate their views - but edits by those (from both sides) who do not try to engage constructively will be rigorously reverted&#160;;</li>
<li>When the draft has stabilised somewhat, we make it into the new <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> article.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a nutshell, the strategy I propose for writing a NPOV Israel//Palestine consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>hammering out a narrative supported by a broad consensus - when we have achieved that it won't be too difficult to deal with the details</li>
<li>thereby marginalising those who refuse productive co-operation and try to destroy a consensus-based narrative (which has always been the aim of the NPOV policy)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell me what you think of this. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 15:55, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quoting <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_King_f40c.html" title="Rodney King">Rodney King</a>, "Can't we all just get along?" Nice idea in principle but I suspect an "Israeli/Palestinian narrative with a broad consensus" is a pipe dream. People on both sides of this conflict have extremely different and often conflicting POVs making the issue resistant to negotiation, compromise, and consensus. As long as this is an open-source project, people will be free to continuously edit out each others' versions and edit in their own biased views. Just like in "real-life", the side that is more organized and technologically savvy imposes its will on the other side. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 16:11, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Alberuni, thanks for the link to that other article. I don't necessarily disagree with you (on the likelihood of a "Israeli/Palestinian narrative with a broad consensus"), but what do you suggest? Do you think that the current state of these articles is acceptable? I think they are very bad, not in the sense that they would contain a lot of inaccuracies or heavy POVs, but in the sense that there's so much bickering about details, and in the end they don't allow a reader to find out what the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is all about. I think that's unacceptable. Personally, I didn't have a clue about this conflict until very recently, it's just impossible to understand it from the reporting in the mainstream press. I think it would be very important for Wikipedia to help and address this problem.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I think it is not just morally but also tactically a good idea to make the first move towards building a concensus, because then the other side has to decide to either engage constructively or to adopt a rejectionist stance. The former would constitute a significant progress, the latter would expose them in the eyes of observers. In addition taking such an initiative helps to build trust, which is the very basis for co-operation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my eyes, it's very important to write an improved I-P article as a draft. Once we have done that there are several ways to go on (1) engage with the intransigeant "supporter of Israel" faction and make it into the main I-P article&#160;; (2) if that fails, we can try the "two state" approach with a split article (I agree with you that it doesn't work on Wiki, but it could be a transitory solution that would help to find a proper solution, like the "two-state solution" could in my mind be transitory to the binational solution of the real I-P conflict ... funny how articles here really reflect the real world!)&#160;; (3) if that fails we can have an alternative article to I-P conflict. Any of these three outcomes would be an improvement to the current situation, plus it would help to organise Wikipedians who could be described as more anti-Zionist. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 10:25, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I wish you well. I think HistoryBuffER did a great job starting to point out the biases in that article. It's going to take alot of work no matter how you slice it. It's probably best to work within the existing Wikipedia system to submit one edit at a time, contesting the biased statements and slowly but surely chipping away at the pro-Israeli slant until a more objective NPOV emerges. I'll try to do my part and will look forward to reading your edits and those by others who want to make Wikipedia a more useful resource. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 14:01, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

You base your edits on your own opinions while mocking the facts. It's reprehensible. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 20:39, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I was just about to suggest to you two to use the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> when I noticed it mentioned on the talk page of the Al-Mezan article already. Alberuni, you still seem to be a bit nervous when talking to Jayjg, and you keep using much more unnecessary (IMHO) labeling epithets and other rhetoric instead of proving your case. To have you two working together, you both have to keep it down. Don't feel insulted by Jayjg's tracing your other edits – while I haven't yet read your full edit history, judging by just what you've said around this article and the ones immediately linked in from here, it seems you are frustrated with what you perceive as a pro-Israeli WP bias, but this seems to result in extremely POV and sometimes insulting remarks (to my personal perception, and I don't feel any animousity towards anybody who keeps contributing and doesn't just troll). It is no surprise that, having seen such remarks, other editors that want to achieve NPOV, will re-trace your history of edits (and Jayjg's as well, and mine, and whoever else's). Try not to take it as if it were in the real world, where a detective is spying on every part of your private life – WP is inherently fully open, there is no private life here, and you don't own anything but the "deltas" on the history lists, as you certainly understand. Instead of taking somebody tracing your edits personally, try to reform – for a good start, how about going over this page and replacing your own POV remarks with NPOV ones, and maybe even crossing out or removing some of the things you said here? You have just addressed the open source nature of the Wiki, having others tracing your edits is part of the game you have to accept to play. And if you reformulate stronger expressions, remove them, or even ask someone's pardon. Don't start right with the ones you had addressed to Jayjg, try working on a couple of others. This is just a suggestion – if I were you, I'd feel much better repairing the damage done by the strong emotions and unjust (in many editors' eyes) labels stuck; the reason is that in real life I have gotten into similar situations that you seem to have gotten yourself into here, and repairing the damage was always the key to the cure. If right now you feel you can't do it w/o getting angry or stressed, just <i>relax</i> and get to a completely different topic (my original "Relax" advice at the top of the talk still applies – you've got several more days to think things over...) If you feel the topic is too hot for you, well, you've said what you've said here and you are ready to accept the vote outcome, so maybe just ignore the article until the vote is over, and work on the other issues meanwhile... Good luck – I'm off to get some sleep... <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 22:16, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alberuni hi. I seemed to notice that you returned the "propaganda" category to <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbara.html" title="Hasbara">Hasbara</a> a lot in the last 24 hours. You might want to have a look at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a>. The best course of action in your case, if you see you might be violating the rule, is to ask another user (HistoryBuffEr?) to do the reverts for you, since violating the three-revert rule will not look good on your RfC. Alternatively you might want to let it go for a day. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 13:26, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alberuni hi. I think you should understand that Wikipedia norms (including the three revert rule) are not a rigid legal system but more a flexible system of guidelines that allow your peers to judge your good intentions. Therefore I would suggest that you do not blame others (even if you believe you are right) of breaking this or that policy. This is pointless since their actions will not be judged formally but rather after weighting in all kinds of external factors. Specifically, it was <i>you</i> who did the first edit on Al Mezan after 4 days of peace, therefore it is likely that you will be blamed for edit warring. Please try and reach a consensus with Jayjg. That's the Wiki way. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 19:34, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alberuni, I am following your talks and edits in several articles recently (hopefully you no longer consider such practice as "stalking"&#160;:-) ), as well as lurking on the RfC. It seems to me that the RfC and other attempts has already had a positive effect on you, as the sample of your recent comments on the discussion pages leaves me under impression that you're now staying cooler even in the discussions about controversial close to your heart. Keep going that way (and please don't disappoint me even if you feel you are being provoked – WP is no place for eye-for-eye). <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 19:01, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. I learned alot from objective people's comments and won't let the bias and incitement of others bother me. I don't mind people reading my edit history. I do mind people pushing their POV onto Wikipedia pages and who intentionally seek out and revert all my edits without explanation or discussion just in a campaign of political censorship and intimifdation. "It should be noted that some editors deliberately push others to the point of breaching civility, without committing such a breach themselves." <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> Perhaps you should also leave your suggestions at the User talk page of the editor who still hasn't learned this lesson. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 19:17, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm watching others' behaviour in the said disputes as well.

<dd>Please note the 3 revert rule comments above, they are to the point, and probably should be followed. It would give you much more legitimacy to revert with a check-in comment in a couple of days saying smth like "no factual objections have been raised, as confirmed by the majority on the discussion page" rather than just hastily re-doing it your way, <i>even if in the long run your version is perceived more NPOV</i>. (If you are emotionally attached to the article revision you've made, it's understandable, but really, the article doesn't suffer physically while it temporarily stays in a revision that is POV and biased against your beliefs&#160;:-) just detach yourself from it, and try to engage in a substantiating dispute on the talk page. If your opponents keep reverting without responding, you can surely revert again, and if an edit war ensues, call in an admin for a protection until the consensus on the talk page is reached. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 20:46, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. I would also strongly recommend not labelling the edits of other editors either; for example, describing other people's edits as "Zionist hasbara efforts" or similar wording is antagonistic and not conducive to collegial editing, even if you haven't specifically made any ad hominem comments. And it would be extremely useful and show good faith if you could help reign in or at least NPOV HistoryBuffEr's highly POV edits; while you have been able to add a fair bit to Wikipedia, I don't think one could make a similar claim for HistoryBuffEr, and his edits just inflame the pages. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 07:44, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Don't be a hypocrite. You have labelled edits and a Talk page section "Anti-Israel propaganda efforts are continuing" on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EPropaganda_760d.html" title="Talk:Propaganda">Talk:Propaganda</a>.

<dd>Um, who created the original label for that section (before I modified it), and what was it?

<dd>So, according to you, when you are antagonistic it is justified because you are retaliating against me but when if I retaliate against your provocations, I am violating Wikipedia policies. Like I said, please don't be a hypocrite. It will go a long way to improving the collegiality of editing if you admit when you are wrong and even offer an apology, as I have. I have never seen you do that. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 20:03, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Alberuni, you titled the section "Israeli propaganda efforts, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbara.html" title="Hasbara">hasbara</a> are continuing". You have continually created descriptions and Talk: comments with these kinds of description, even after toning down your ad hominem comments. I made <b>one</b> change of your title, to show you why these descriptions are objectionable, and now you focus on this one edit, rather than the dozens of times you have did this leading up to my edit. My "provocations" have been removing or re-stating your POV edits to Wikipedia articles, something that, in fact, is my <b>duty</b> as a Wikipedia editor. I have not removed any of your NPOV edits, as the edit history continually shows. The fact that you still view NPOVing your article modifications as "provocations" is rather dismaying. More dismaying is that you equate my NPOVing your edits with your making ad hominem comments, violating Wikiquette, and making inflammatory edit descriptions. If you make a POV edit to an article and I NPOV it or remove it, it is neither a "provocation", nor does quid pro quo demand that you get to both re-insert it <b>and</b> make inflammatory comments about the edit <b>and</b> make ad hominem comments as well. And modifying <b>one</b> inflammatory comment of yours in similar fashion does not justify your making dozens, perhaps hundreds of inflammatory and ad hominem statements leading up to that one change. I really want to work <b>with</b> you, Alberuni, not against you, and I feel you're capable of adding a great deal to Wikipedia. I'm giving you honest advice as to what will make that possible, with me, or with any other editor, and it's the opposite of inflammatory edit comments. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 21:23, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I wrote above, "I am willing to work with any editor who is honest and diligent about maintaining NPOV." I am afraid that in your edits you continue to push your POV in a very aggressive manner, ignoring Talk discussions and citations with evidence contradicting your personal opinions, even when that evidence has been provided by you! See <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbara.html" title="Hasbara">Hasbara</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">Propaganda</a> history and Talk pages for numerous examples. It is my duty as an editor to correct your innacurate and POV edits and I will continue to do so. You claim to be seeking an NPOV balance but your history shows this is false. I believe that you are aware that many of your pro-Israeli pro-Zionist edits are very POV but you pretend they are NPOV. I do think you know the difference in most cases. In some cases, I think you sincerely believe that a pro-Israeli POV is NPOV. In other words, you can't separate your personal opinions from facts. Furthermore, before you accuse me or others of being antagonistic in edit summaries, you should make sure that you are not doing the same thing. When your errors or hypocrisy are pointed out, the appropriate response is acknowledgement and, perhaps, if you are a confident man with some degree of honor, you could make an apology. THEN an offer to work together collegially will be more likely to be accepted because your ability to admit errors and moderate your behavior will be appreciated. To stubbornly never admit errors, to continue to aggressively push your POV agenda, to make excuses blaming others to justify your misconduct while criticizing those others for conducting themselves the same way you do, will not encourage editors to assume your good faith nor will anyone want to work with you. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 21:40, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

In some cases, I think you sincerely believe that an anti-Israeli POV is NPOV. In other words, you can't separate your personal opinions from facts.

To stubbornly never admit errors, or to insist that any blame accrues to me because of my "provocations", to hypocritically try to equate one mildly antagonistic edit statement with dozens of highly antagonistic edits (even going so far as to accuse me of psychological problems and refer to my father, of all people), to continue to aggressively push your POV agenda, to make excuses blaming others to justify your misconduct while criticizing those others for conducting themselves the same way you do, will not encourage editors to assume your good faith nor will anyone want to work with you. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a></dd>

<dd>Oh, one more thing. When answering messages here on your talk page, the practice around here seems to be to use the talk page of the person you're talking with (so that they get the "you have new messages" message.)

<p>Hi Alberuni, I feel I must apoligize for not responding to your request for assistance over the conflict you mentioned. I've been on a sort of impromptu wikivacation, and didn't find your message until just recently. Am I correct in assuming (judging from the above discussion) that you and Jayjg have assumed good faith and have averted catastrophe? If I am mistaken, or if there is anything else I can help with, I'll be back at WP (for the time being), so feel free to ask. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>11:31, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Alberuni,</p>
<p>It's funny that you should suspect me of being a Jew because I want to restore some balance to the Qur'an part of the Islam article. I'm as far from being a Zionist as you can get. I usually describe myself as an "ecumenical Bundist". Bundists were Jews who thought Zionism was a dreadful mistake. I'm a Buddhist who thinks that ALL nationalism, Jewish, Arab, American, German, whatever, is a dreadful mistake. I'm putting this on your personal page rather than on the Talk:Islam page because it's really more of an aside.

<p>You've proved your point about Jayjg's insertion of opinions from Likudnik propaganda sites into articles on humanitarian organizations. Having done so, you should consider stopping. It would be more helpful to use the point you've established to address the editing of the articles that you really care about; for example, you could handle the NGO Monitor attacks by collating them in the <a href="../../../n/g/o/NGO_Monitor_4356.html" title="NGO Monitor">NGO Monitor</a> article, and you might handle the IDF's self-exculpation on <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Durrah_f90d.html" title="Muhammad al-Durrah">Muhammad al-Durrah</a> by citing reports that reached a different conclusion.

<p>What we have here is a very complicated situation. There appears to have been a copy and paste move done between <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Revisionism_a7f4.html" title="Zionist Revisionism">Zionist Revisionism</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism_in_the_Israel-Palestine_Conflict_e3f1.html" title="Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict">Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict</a>. I am quite happy to merge the two and setup a redirect, however because Zionist Revisionism is on VfD at the moment I don't want to do anything like this right at this moment. Also, it is further complicated by the fact that there is <i>another</i> article called <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_history_denial_a513.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian history denial">Israeli-Palestinian history denial</a>, that's almost exactly the same as the other two. I'm sending a message to all participants so far, requesting their comments on what they think we should do. My own preference is to merge into a more appropriately named article, something like Historical perspectives of Israelis and Palestinians (as that's what this is all about), but I'm flexible. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:16, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi Ta bu shi da yu, Zionist Revisionism was the original article. I had moved it to Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict in an attempt to NPOV it, but Alberuni undid the changes and the move, without redirecting the other article. I have since redirected the 2nd article to another page.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 19:35, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Good idea, or you could just merge all three into <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism_in_the_Israel-Palestine_Conflict_e3f1.html" title="Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict">Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict</a>. As long as you merge information rather than deleting it, as some have a habit of doing. Don't worry about the VfD entry for <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Revisionism_a7f4.html" title="Zionist Revisionism">Zionist Revisionism</a>; it is invalid.

<li>Yet again? You obviously don't watch anything I actually do, as 1) That was the first page I had ever put up for deletion - the fact that I had done it wrong should be proof of that, and 2) I and others listed perfectly good reason on the VfD page.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 19:35, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would avoid POV titles that are bound to be challenged.

<li>I would suggest not to use the word "revisionism" in the title at all. It it nothing but an allusion to historical revisionism (a.k.a. Holocaust denial). Since none of the holders of these views on either side consider their views "revisionism", it would be better if the title did not contain this word. Finally, the potential for confusion with te unrelated <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist_Zionism_b013.html" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist Zionism</a> is enormous. More seriously, I also cannot see how any such page would contain anything but POV fights. Is that really what we need?

<p>"One time, Ali was fighting the champion of the opposing army. He pushed his opponent on the ground, jumped on his chest — and lifted his sword to finish the opponent. At that point — with both armies watching in great suspense — the opponent, lying on the ground with Ali on his chest, spat on Ali’s face. The Muslim army got very tense when this occurred. It was a tribal society dominated by notions of revenge and honour. So when the victor got up, everybody expected him to be even more vicious and brutal to the defeated. But the army saw an amazing sight. Ali stood up and suddenly walked away. The generals gathered around and asked him, “Why did you just walk away? If you knocked down your opponent, why didn’t you finish him?” Ali replied, “That man was not my personal enemy. I was fighting in the name of God. But when he spat on me, he angered me and he became my personal enemy. If I had killed him then, I would have killed him in anger, not for the sake of God.”"<a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_26-2-2003_pg3_3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_26-2-2003_pg3_3" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:33, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can be openly anti-Israel on Talk pages and still write NPOV articles. Would you claim that someone who is openly pro-Israel cannot write an unbiased article? Anyway, NPOV is about presenting alternative points of view. Everyone recognizes that complete objectivity is impossible. Read Wikipedia:NPOV. What you are actually doing is censoring editors for holding political points of view with which you disagree - because of your own POV. Hence, a witch hunt. --Alberuni 19:34, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My POV? And what would that be? You've already decided, quite openly, that Israel is "wrong" in the current political situations. How could you write a fair, NPOV article with a mindframe like that? NPOV is about neutrality, and, if especially controverisal, both sides being presented equally under so-labelled headings. Wikipedia is supposed to be encyclopedic, not propoganistic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And yes, I would say that someone who is openly pro-Israel likely also couldn't write a fair article on the situation either. I know that complete NPOV is impossible, but there are certainly larger margins then others.</dd>

<dd>Sorry to butt in, but I couldn't disagree more. I am probably at least as much "pro-Israel" as Alberuni is "anti-Israel". Yet I trust him to follow the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> policy. It doesn't make sense to require an editor to <b>be neutral</b> about an issue, in order to write a balanced article which presents multiple points of view fairly. All it takes is an awareness that one's own views are not shared by others, and there's no doubt in my mind that Alberuni has this awareness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To take another example, I am probably the foremost opponent of the "gay rights" point of view at Wikipedia, because my church flatly opposes homosexuality. Yet many of my contributions on the topic have been so well-written that they've remained essentially unaltered for over 2 years. If I was poisoning the articles with my biases, surely someone would have complained - or corrected the articles - by now.</dd>

I left a message like this on everyone's talk page that had been active in the previous edit war, and all agreed to refrain from reverting for a while so as to let things cool off a bit. I must have accidently left you off the list, and I apologize. So I'm asking now: please don't start up a revert war here. I know you have strong opinions, and I agree with you on some of them.

<p>I am going to have to side with you on the argument over Arafat knowing the intentions of the Zionists. The name "Zionist" tells their intentions: they want to establish "Zion". However, Alberuni, you shouldn't turn a debate over writing an encyclopedia article into a personal attack. This isn't an AOL chatroom. Attacking people won't help your cause. It will just alienate people even more. I understand that the condition over there is very harsh, and that the radical factions of Zionism have been treating your people unjustly, but using an encyclopedia article to call someone a "Zionist Troll" will only make things worse. You can be stronger than that. Surly you must recognize though, that your side isn't perfect, either. If the Palestinians were in power, who is to say that they wouldn't treat the Israelis even worse than the Israelis are treating you?--<a href="../../../n/o/p/User%7ENoPetrol_c037.html" title="User:NoPetrol">NoPetrol</a> 07:36, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)--NoPetrol 07:32, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I've carefully read what you wrote, and I find it extremely interesting. Ironically, I'm somewhat sympathetic to your views. I sometimes wonder why the U.S. let's Israel get away with some of the things it gets away with... that said I wonder when this conflict will cease (I don't think it will in my lifetime) as I beleive <i>both</i> sides are equally to blame! You'll have to note I come from a Christian background, so I'm declaring my potential biases right here so you'll understand where I'm coming from.</dd>

<dd>I think, however, that if you want to keep the text for the U.S. 9/11 attacks, you're going to have to do more to convince people (including myself). Firstly, I agree with Jayjg's statement that "attacks on the U.S. are not attacks on Israel, nor part of the Arab-Israeli conflict, since Israel is not a proxy for the U.S., nor is the U.S. a "Zionist Occupied Government" proxy of Israel"". Whether the Sept. 11 attacks were directed against the U.S. or against Israel is a matter for debate. Secondly, I beleive you must have gotten your information from somewhere. You seem pretty intelligent, so I'm guessing you are well read up on this subject (better read than me anyway, I'll bet). Perhaps if you could point us to some external sources, we would be able to include your information. Heck, we could put it into another section and give a brief description of the views of others. That way it won't be original research, it will be compromising yet not in a way that you have concede anything on your information.</dd>

I don't want to see these things happen as I don't feel it's terribly productive or nice.

<p>Alberuni, to keep on reverting the Black September article is senseless, my friend. Why do you want to keep Abu Iyad's quote out of it? He's not exactly what anyone could call an Israeli or "Zionist" source. I also don't see why you're so keen to ensure that Arafat is not blamed for Munich. Abu Daoud himself said that Munich is not something the PLO would do nowadays, but times were different back then. I believe Arafat would have said the same thing if he'd have been honest. I don't understand why you're so keen to airbrush this out of the PLO's history. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 07:27, Nov 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't take the Abu Iyad quote from Palestinefacts.org or any website. I took it from his book <i>Stateless</i>, p 146-7. There's also a well-known quote in an Egyptian newspaper in 1972 from a Black September operative who took part in the planned assassination of Hussein. He said: "We all belonged to Fatah.

<p>Your last post on <a href="../../../h/a/s/Talk%7EHasbara_b649.html#Hasbara_is_propaganda" title="Talk:Hasbara">Talk:Hasbara#Hasbara is propaganda</a> went like this:</p>

</dl>
<p>I am happy that you acknowledge my efforts to achieve an NPOV wording, but I would prefer it in less insulting language next time, even if the insults bulk (<i>The narrow-minded Zionist bigots that think they own Wikipedia</i> and the <i>Hypocrites</i> at the check-in comment) are not directed at myself. In other words, if you wanted to show your appreciation, you should have probably said ONLY the 2nd sentence (<i>I appreciate...</i>). Really, when you say <i>even an Israeli Zionist can be sensible</i>, doesn't it contradict your own observation above on that page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>It is not accurate to divide links into anti-Israel and pro-Israel</b></i>
<p><i>It's a sick worldview that perpetuates an us vs. them identity of perpetual defensiveness, aggression, and self-victimization. Alberuni 05:04, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By using this wording (<i>even...</i>) relating to me you make me feel as if, in general, I am a part of an alien "them" camp for you that can't in general be sensible, kind of nullifying the effect of your second sentence, that you actually appreciate my attempts. Therefore, if your intent was to encourage me (which I wish to believe using the good faith assumption principle), it actually had an opposite effect — making me wish to stay away from this page for some longer period so that can get again fully detached from the stirred emotions (I can not allow myself edit controversial articles in a non-detached state of mind, because if I do, my edits are highly likely not to be NPOV!). I'll prefer to donate my free time on wikipedia to pages with less edit war flames while I lower my wikistress level.</p>
<p>I can only hope that my yesterday's attempt to step in with the tentative category inclusion concept and the paragraph rewrite suggestion would bring the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbara.html" title="Hasbara">Hasbara</a> article two steps closer to consensus.</p>
<p>BTW, your "I am Alberuni" on the user page is not very informative. If you think nobody is interested in who you are, well, at least I am. Do you mind sharing a bit of information on your background, or maybe giving a link to your homepage? Of course, if you choose anonymity for some personal or security reasons, you need not elaborate, and everybody will understand. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 20:03, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Admitted bias" against you. Poppycock.</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, it's time for you to explain why you reverted three times in that article and why you didn't make any effort to compromise. It appears that there is a bit of ambiguity in the policy. Also, admins get some leeway in blocking decisions. So tough. You clearly went outside the spirit of the law in regards to reverting, and you'll not get an apology from me on this one. In fact, I'd welcome you to take this RFC <i>or</i> to ArbCom, because then we'd both see who people see to be in the right and who would be in the wrong. Also, my "admitted bias" (aparently from my edit summary at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Binational_solution&amp;diff=8353065&amp;oldid=8353016" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Binational_solution&amp;diff=8353065&amp;oldid=8353016" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) you've made up is complete bullshit, and you know it. I might disagree with you on many issues, but I also disagree with others, like Jayjg. They don't feel the urge to tell me about my "admitted bias". I am most <i>definitely</i> allowed to disagree with you. This has never been a crime, and I'd advise you to act more sensibly, and to also stop making personal and inflamatory comments. So pull your head in and try to come to compromises. Do <i>not</i> revert like you have been <b>ever again</b>. Understood? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:59, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. You might also want to read <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a> (calling me a "little boy" is a personal attack, also saying that I have a Napoleonic complex and suggesting I expand the article stub is also a personal attack), along with <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. You might also want to do more edits that try to strike a consensus. You must also justify massive edits. if I can be bothered I'll be adding your reversions and personal attack to your arbcom case. Also: I've been told about you by a few editor and on how they refuse to edit articles that you contribute to. I'm not suggesting this time: I'm <i>telling</i> you: you need to change the way you edit.

<dd>Further: "Viriditas enlisted you so that he and Jayjg and a sock puppet could impose their Zionist bias on Wikipedia. Proud of yourself being used like that?" Viriditas did not "enlist" me. Neither did Jayjg. Your "Proud of yourself being used like that" I count as a personal attack, do it again and I file an RFC. You <b>must</b> justify major edits.

<p>Whether I blocked you inappropriately is debatable. You did revert 4 times. This was done deliberately. You've also said you don't have to explain your edits. The irony of your comments are that I could have chosen to lock the page straight away (which you would have caused by reverting a fourth time) but that would have disrupted the page: as you've already stated. You were out by 5 minutes, so I used my discretion and blocked you for 24 hours. So darned tootin right I won't be apologising. And I guess you won't be reverting so quickly in future, will you now? So my question stands: Who the hell do you think you are reverting pages and making major changes without discussion? As for admitting to deliberate bias, I reverted back to your edits on the <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> article and I didn't see any complaints of bias against the other user when I did this. And you conviniently miss the fact that I <b>reverted Jayjg back to your changes</b> in the edit you are complaining about. Funny how that shows my "bias".</p>
<p>You still haven't addressed your personal attacks, and you also show no sign of apologising. Funny how things look so much different when the shoe is on the other foot, doesn't it? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:55, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
