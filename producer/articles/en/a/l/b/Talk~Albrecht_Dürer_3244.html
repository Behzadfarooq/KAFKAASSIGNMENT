<p>Wouldn't "germanizing" be better than "germanicizing"&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, "Germanicizing" is philologically correct english word structure, because we're talking "Germanic", not "German", as in "Germanic culture".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Germanizing" is incorrect, even if it's simpler form seems preferable. To really, <i>really</i> answer your question, Mr/s. Anonymous, which is "better" depends on who is asking the question—would "germanizing" be better for you? Probably, since you don't see anything wrong with it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now I'm going to spin you out by revealing there is an alternative to "Germanicizing" --- "Teutonicizing", a la "Teutonic" culture. Teutonic means Germanic. So is "Teutonicizing" more more accurate than "Germanicizing"? I'm not an english professor and not qualified to say&#160;:^) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Arboghast_a4ca.html" title="User:James Arboghast">Arbo</a> 20:09, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've deleted the section "Albert's Brother" (<i>sic</i>), recounting the staple Sunday school story about Dürer's brother and the <i>Praying Hands</i>. According to one website I've consulted there is "no credible source" for this, and although <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snopes.com.html" title="Snopes.com">snopes.com</a> doesn't mention it, it has debunked the other class assembly favourite about Leonardo using the same model for Jesus and Judas in his <i>Last Supper</i>, so I doubt the story has any place in this article other than possibly in a pop culture or trivia section. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHam_ce62.html" title="User:Ham">H<small>AM</small></a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintPierre4.JPG_d3e3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/8/87/SaintPierre4.JPG/15px-SaintPierre4.JPG" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintPierre4.JPG_d3e3.html" /></a> 14:49, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are correct the story has no veriffiability.

<p>He probably was a Lutheran, but it's not entirely clear and he was buried in a Catholic cemetery.

<p>- Don't you mean the cemetery is NOW catholic? I'm pretty sure it would have been Lutheran then. He was plainly very sympathetic to Lutheranism, &amp; Nuremburg went Lutheran in 1525, when he was already pretty ill. Really he was ill by the time it became necessary to label himself. Of course he carried on making saints etc after a keen protestant would have stopped. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 04:15, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was thinking that perhaps we should change the self portrait at the top of the page to his more famous self portrait of 1500. The other portrait doesn't necessarily need to be removed, and perhaps it should go into the section about his marriage, as the earlier self portrait may have been sent home to Nuremberg as a wedding portrait while he was away on his wanderjahr.</p>

<p>Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder's children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.</p>
<p>After many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in the mines.</p>
<p>They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg.</p>
<p>Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht's etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works.</p>
<p>When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht's triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, "And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you."</p>
<p>All heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, "No ...no ...no ...no."</p>
<p>Finally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, "No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look ... look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. No, brother ... for me it is too late."</p>
<p><br />
By now, Albrecht Durer's hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer's works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.</p>
<p>One day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply "Hands," but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love "The Praying Hands."</p>
<ul>
<li>Load of old nonsense, i'm afraid. Durer came from a prosperous and well-connected family in Nuremberg itself &amp; (as the article says if you bother to read it) was apprenticed to the top local painter at 15 (a close neighbour of his parents), probably with no fee needed. No village, no academy, no professors. He did the praying hands as a study for an altarpiece many years later, when he was about 37. Are the hands in such a bad condition anyway?</li>

<p>Albrecht Dürer's name is not pronounced "ale-brake-t dür-uh" It's more pronounced like "ull-brecht dür-air" The "Al" in "Albrecht" is like the "ull" in "gullible" Unfortunately there is no equivalent for the "ch" but it's certainly not pronounced as "k".

<p>Just noticed the post, 3 above - what a coincidence! One of the things on which Monty Python's humour is based is to treat lightly or frivolously a subject which is nornally considered formal or traditional. They are not poking fun at it necessarily, they are rather poking fun at people's attitude towards it. Here's an excerpt from the relevant script:</p>
<p><b>Announcer</b>: Albecht Durer, 1471-1530, the Nuremberg painter who captivated Europe with his sharp eye, his mastery of line and texture, his car hire service. .</p>
<p>(Cut to a man behind a desk, played by John Cleese.) &lt;Picture&gt;</p>
<p><b>Man behind desk</b>: We apologize for the inaccuracies that have crept into this portrait of Albrecht Durer. Durer NEVER operated a car hire service. Thank you. (Cut back to a drawing.)</p>
<p><b>Announcer</b>: Durer drew his inspiration from his birthplace, Nuremberg. Portraits. Landscapes. The detail of nature. Social themes. Religious themes. But always present his fascination with the grotesque. To find out more about Durer the man as opposed to Durer the insect. . . (cut back to the man at desk.)</p>
