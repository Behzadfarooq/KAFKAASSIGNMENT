<p>Two recent academic papers which give some quotable figures are <a href="http://www.migrationdrc.org/publications/working_papers/WP-C5.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.migrationdrc.org/publications/working_papers/WP-C5.pdf" rel="nofollow">Migration and Development in Albania</a> and <a href="http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/11.1/Essays/Barjarba.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/11.1/Essays/Barjarba.pdf" rel="nofollow">Migration and Ethnicity in Albania</a>. For the number in Greece, the second is more accurate, but you can cite my survey for the Greek Interior Ministry -- although I did not give a precise figure in the publication. My estimate is 650.000 for 2004 (cf Barjaba at 600.000). If you need more help, email me through our website address.

<p>For the US figure (the 115,000 figure that sometimes appears on this page seems to be about right) you can refer to the US Census tabulation from 2000: <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf" rel="nofollow">US Census Ancestry 2000 (PDF)</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> 13:45, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Changed data</b> Do not change numbers or analysis of the data concerning Albania and Greece without discussion in this page. Someone changed the total of Albanians in Greece to 1m [without any datasource, because it is a lie] and also the analysis in the text, linking Arvanites with recent Albanian emigrations. THIS NATIONALIST ALTERATION OF DATA IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR WIKIPEDIA. --<a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMBE_437f.html" title="User:MBE">Martin Baldwin-Edwards</a> 02:54, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above comments apply to the entire Table which I have reverted. There is no justification for putting any number at all for Turkey, without evidence of Albanian ethnic identity of those in Turkey. --<a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMBE_437f.html" title="User:MBE">Martin Baldwin-Edwards</a> 11:53, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Martin. Please cite your sources on Albanian immigration into Greeve. As for the issue of Albanians in Turkey, albanians deported to Turkey arent really "Albanians" anymore but rather "Turks with Albanian roots". Turkey did take in some Kosovare Albanians as refugees recently because the Kosova War. Im sure you could add them into the article as they self identify as Albanians and should also speak Albanian, as opposed to Turkish albanians who are mostly integrated into mainstream Turkish society.</p>
<p>Here's a CNN article that says 26,000 Albanian refugees have moved into Turkey as a cosequence of the turmoil in Kosova <a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/05/kosovo.refugees.04/" class="external free" title="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/05/kosovo.refugees.04/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/05/kosovo.refugees.04/</a> <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnter_sandman_2029.html" title="User:Enter sandman">Enter sandman</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/t/User_talk%7EEnter_sandman_a706.html" title="User talk:Enter sandman">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Enter_sandman_cd62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Enter sandman">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<dd>I dont believe that there are only 30000 albanians in Britain, this is either 10 years out of date or an extreme under estimate, the figure is closer to 1 million or at least in the hundreds of thousands, according to the table there are as many Albanians in Britain as there are in Sweden!

<p>Today, majority of Albanians are <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslims</a>. Most of them are Sunni-Muslims but a smaller part are Bektashi. Also smaller parts of Albanians are <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_Orthodox_Church_9936.html" title="Albanian Orthodox Church">Albanian Orthodoxes</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholics.html" title="Catholics">Catholics</a>.

<p>Today, the majority of Albanians are <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslims</a>. Most of them are <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> Muslims but a minority are <a href="../../../b/e/k/Bektashi.html" title="Bektashi">Bektashi</a>.

<p>Starting with the occupation by the Ottomans, the majority of Albanians have been <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslim</a>. During the Ottoman occupation, the shared religion of Islam created a tendency for Muslim Albanians to side with their occupiers and thus become considered enemies by the Catholic Albanians. Gradually over time this changed as Muslim Albanians decided that their ethnicity and Albanian identity outweighed the religion they acquired from their occupiers.

<p>His objections, as stated in the edit summary are: "Revert POV. This ain´t history so give me the situation today and not 500 years ago, specilly when it´s no proof."</p>
<p>My problems with the changes he wants (besides the grammar errors which are easily fixable with a bit of copy editing - and understandable as he is apparently not a native English speaker) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>for some reason, he keeps unwikilinking Sunni and Bektashi, and changing Roman Catholic to just Catholic.</li>
<li>the history is very relevant to the article. The legacy of Ottoman occupation has impacts to this day on the entire Balkan region. I can't see any serious dispute that the Ottoman occupation is the reason Islam took root in Albania, but if challenged I'll go dig up sources.</li>
<li>The sentence "In the albanian comunity, religion is a personal thing and belief, while everybody are Albanians" is inaccurately POV, in that relgious tensions do persist to this day although much reduced. For example, here is a project aimed at increasing religous harmony in Albania: <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/wlid/news/albania_harmony.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldlearning.org/wlid/news/albania_harmony.html" rel="nofollow">Religious Harmony Project in Albania</a> I'm sure more sources could be found.</li>
<li>as a general matter, history is very appropriate for an article like this, as long as the current conditions are also prominently included</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the existing section fairly reflects that there has been religious conflict in Albania, and that it is less of a problem today. But I'm certainly open to discussion and/or changes. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonCopy_919a.html" title="User talk:CarbonCopy">(talk)</a> 20:46, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Allright. Yes, I speak Bosnian and not so good English. I´m sorry that Sunni and Bektashi wasn´t linked I didn´t thinh about that. But the thing is that Albanians are ONE nation. And I don´t just mean Albania I mean Kosovo, Macedonia and all other regions to. Shure maybe some smaller parts don´t agree, but so can two Albanians also fight about hows town is best Prishtina or Prizren? Of course this is stupid as religios fights but in some exeptions it happens, but should we write that Albanians from different cities don´t get along? I am a Bosniak and many people in Bosnia fight over hows town is the best but should we write that in the Bosniaks article. Of course not! A man that declaire him self as an Albanian where ever he livs, what ever religion he is, poor or rich is an Albanian and writing about conflicts isn´t that good. Specilly sens most Albanians I know don´t even think about where they are from and what religion they are, the important thing is that they are Albanians. You can change the article how ever you want but please don´t right about some religios conflicts and such things if you ain´t gonna right about city-conflicts, conflicts between rich and poor and al sorts of conflicts. And I have never herd about a war between Albanians of any cause and onastly, writing about problems that ain´t even there can cause them. Specilly when you say that catholic and muslim are enemies even if they are the same people.

<p>How about the following replacement for the second paragarph? Does this address your concerns? In particular, I eliminated the word "enemies". (Note I'm not the original author of this section, but I have contributed some rewriting.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>During the occupation by the Ottomans, the majority of Albanians converted to Islam. The shared religion between Muslim Albanians and their Ottoman occupiers, and their different status under Ottoman law, caused divisions between Muslim and non-Muslim Albanians. Gradually over time these divisions have been reduced as Albanians decided that their ethnicity and Albanian identity outweighed their religious differences. Although at times in the past religious differences caused hostility and tensions amongst the Albanian people, in the 21st century this has become a relatively minor issue in Albania.</dd>

<p>Allright, I agree. As I said i´m not Albanian but i´m interested in Albanian history. Can you give me a link about good history and if you can let it be in Bosnian. And this is just a friendly question, are you Albanian and do you for sure now about times when Albanians have fougt becuse of religion? Most Bosnians thing that religion isn´t an issue in the Albanian people, is that true?<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Muu_cce4.html" title="User:Dr. Muu">User:Dr. Muu</a></p>
<p>No, I'm not Albanian myself. There was definitely civil conflict in Albania in the 1910-1924 time period, and again during World War II. It's hard to clearly distinguish the causes, as external wars and ordinary economic and political conflicts were undoubtedly significant factors. Italian links to Roman Catholic institutions caused some conflict in the late 1930's, but the problems probably had more to do with Italian Fascist political ambitions than religion. I can't help you with Bosnian resources, since I don't speak/read the language. I'll take what is above and some other edits that have been made and see if we have a better section now. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonCopy_919a.html" title="User talk:CarbonCopy">(talk)</a> 01:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes CarbonCopy I think you made a god site. I just want to ask if the part about Jews is in place their. Becuse this is an article about Albanians as a nation and people and not about Albania as a country. The Jews in Albania wasn´t/are not Albanians nationally, they only lived in Albania. If somone hase other statments please give them but this way I don´t thnik this is relevant in the article about reiligion in the Albanian people. That´s why I also think you should make a dostens between Greek otrhodoxes(is that how you spell it?) and ALbanian ortothoxes in Albania becuse they are not the same. And I think that the leader of the Albanian Churc hase to be Albanian and not Greek.<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Muu_cce4.html" title="User:Dr. Muu">Dr. Muu</a></p>

<p>Inanna, here is the main reason why I reverted your edits. Firstly, you replaced many <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> numbers with uncited ones. You also replaced "Turkey's public administration and administrative law is a citizenship policy with ideally no ethnic consideration" with "many Albanians, who were deported from their land to Turkey, have been assimilated due to the assimilation policy of Turkish government". These are two very different claims. I'd be nice if you could let us know where you got the latter information.</p>
<p>You also removed "August of 2003 was marked by renewed terrorist attacks by the <a href="../../../a/n/a/ANA_cf88.html" title="ANA">ANA</a> (Albanian National Army) both against Serb border guards and (allegedly) Serb civilians". Why?</p>
<p>Lastly, you removed the link to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania_and_Greece_6546.html" title="Albania and Greece">Albania and Greece</a> in the "See also" section. You mentioned on your talk page that you "hate Greeks" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:-Inanna-&amp;diff=36574695&amp;oldid=36568515" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:-Inanna-&amp;diff=36574695&amp;oldid=36568515" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, but I hope that you removed this link for a different reason.</p>

1-) I dont know what articles you are talking about.I didnt remove anything.</p>
<p>2-) You have to expain me where did you get that unfair information at first."In Turkey, Turkish demographers have continuously mentioned numbers up to five million. However, many Albanians, who were deported from their land to Turkey, have been assimilated due to the assimilation policy of Turkish government. Turkey does not compile official census figures for Albanians." This is completly lie.It is only provacation to create enmity between albanians and Turks.The everyone are defined as Turks who lives in Turkey except for three nations who has minorty status (greeks,armenians and jews).</p>
<p>3-) Even i have never seen that article.I think it's one of your insidious plans again.</p>

<dd>Yes, under the Greece section it should say Arvanites. The Aromanians are an ethnic group who speak a language close to Romanian (Romance language) and are not Albanian. The Arvanites are the Christian Albanians of Greece. So whoever can edit the page please make this fix. Also, although the number of speakers may be 30,000, the number of ethnic Arvanites is much higher than that. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImperial78_63a1.html" title="User:Imperial78">Imperial78</a>.</dd>

Having in mind your question which you sent us a few days ago, I would like to inform that we got data regarding how many Albanians are living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from one of representatives of Albanian population in BH. According to the data in Bosnia and Herzegovina are leaving <b>between 10 and 12 thousand Albanians (approximately)</b>. If you have any questions please let us know. Sincerely,</p>

<p>I agree with the person below who said that you cannot just make up all those numbers and publish them on the internet, as far as the population census goes!!!!!8 million Albanians??? Give me a break!!!!!!!! NOt only that the Greek-Albanian population is overestimated (one million people)- which cannot be proved cause Greece doesn't classify people in that way (which clearly leaves a lot of room for the manipulations), but Kosovo population also!!! Where did you get the number of 2,2 million Albanians in that province?!?!It's certainly not according to UNMIK estimates that put the entire population of Kosovo to about 2 million (out of which 1,7 million are Albanians)!!!!!!!I personally see the number of 6,5 million Albanians quite reasonable (that's the number that Wikipedia was using until just a while ago)! You cannot pretend that ALbanians are the largest ethnic group in the Balkans, cause that simply isn't true! 3,5 million in Albania + 1,7 million in Kosovo + 0,5 million in Macedonia= 5,7 million + approximately 1 million worldwide, out of which one half in Greece. Those are the official data that you can check anywhere. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 194.106.169.155 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.106.169.155_3fa7.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.106.169.155">contribs</a>) 10:18, 23 February 2006.</small></p>

<p>Hello to everyone. I would like to write some remarks and figures about number of Albanians in the Balkans and the World. First figure; Albanians in Germany 10.500. This figure is quite incorrect because the number of Albanians in Germany is way larger than it appears on the sample. You can check german offically data about numbers of Former Yugoslavia (2), the number there is 381.563 the largest ethnicity among them are Albanians, Serbia Montenegro (3),the number there is 125.765 even from them there are quite big number of Albanians due to the fact that UNMIK Travel Documents issued to K.Albanians are considered as citizens of Serbia and Montenegro. I saw a comment posted in wikipedia where somebody wrote it that there are 1.700.000 million Albanians in Kosovo, because total population of Kosovo numbers 2.000.000 million. This records are old 25 years, because last time population in Kosovo was registered was in 1981, since then there was no official records. Kosovo has the highest growth of population in Europe.Kosovo Government is going to register the Kosovo population next year, so far, they had some tests about registration. According to them Kosovo population numbers 2.550.000, over 91% of them albanians. If I may give you just one interesting figure about Albanians in USA. In 1981 city with largest number of Albanians in the world was Boston, so you can just search for numbers of Albanians in capitol Tirana in year 1981 and you can just compare the number given in USA and the number of Albanians in Boston, and hopefully you can draw a fair and correct conclusion. Regarding Switzerland, number of Kosovar Albanians alone is over 220.000. Switzerland Foreign Minister said: "Kosovar Albanians number in Switzerland is equal to 10 % of Kosovo population".</p>

<p>Just FYI, religious harmony in Albania is not as much of an issue as you might think. For the most part, Albanians tend to identify themselves mostly based on their ethnicity (with religion playing a distant second in their identity). As a result of Enver Hoxha's rule in Albania, religion was stifled. Most Albanians who have emerged from under Communism have no real affiliation with organized religion. Some have re-discovered religion, however, any hostilities between Albanians are probably personal in nature and not based on a religious divide.</p>

<dd>Makes sense, if the have the figures broken down to include them separately. On a more practical side though, it makes the infobox <i>really really</i> long. The Albanian population in S&amp;M is already analyzed in the "Population" section. Until S&amp;M actually break up (pending), they are still one state and should be treated as such. Not to mention that I have a feeling that each state of the USA has its own censi as well. You haven't broken those figures up yet. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikX_adcf.html" title="User:NikX">NikX</a> 00:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well, I am afraid that this is out of discussion at least till the Geneva talks end. As for UN Security Council Resolution S/RES/1244(1999) of 2 June 1999 (S/1999/649, annex 2 to this resolution), The UN reafirms the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region.

<dd>some people are determined to vandalize every page that has SOMETHING to do with Albanians. Well, I am more determined to protect them. This IS the relevant information, the current version. As long as Kosova's status is not resolved, the statistics and figures should refer to it as an entity, and not indirectly through any other neighbouring country, and claiming that it is a part of it. It is an entity under UN administration. Talks are taking place in Vienna, not Geneva. Kosova has its constitutional framework, which defines it as an compact entity, and it has its democratically elected government and parliament. Please refer to rather updated sources <a href="http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/EN/declarations/88236.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/EN/declarations/88236.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, the statement which determines what is about to happen with Kosva. So there is no return of Kosovo to the pre-1999 situation, no partition of Kosovo, and no union of Kosovo with any or part of another country. Live with it, and stop your nationalist-revert-war and vandalization of wiki pages with Albanian content.

If you want Kosovo listed separately, there is justification for doing to and can be done - just do it properly, not by eliminating other people's work in the process. While the article should make clear that <b>Kosovo is still part of S&amp;M</b>, the Kosovo population should be listed separately. However, Montenegro, should not (at least not in the infobox - it is already mentioned in the population section and the figures are fully analyzed there). --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikX_adcf.html" title="User:NikX">NikX</a> 10:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is not about saying whether Kosovo is a part of any country or not. Your reverts seem to be the "lazy" type, of copy pasting. This article should list Kosovo as separate, and say that it is a disputed region under UN administration. This way you would not fuel the revert war that is going on, unfortunately, in the rest of pages that have to do with Albanians. Some people are just determined (and I could freely guess, that even paid, due to their determination) to change content of any page that has something to do with Albanians. That is sad to see. I will remove any label here that predicts the status of Kosova, as this is not the place to do that.

<dd>No one knows about what will happen, this is not the article to discuss Kosovo. I'm merely suggesting two sets of figured Kosovo and the rest of S&amp;M in the infobox. S&amp;M can then be analysed separately in the population section and that is what is already being done. As much as you don't like it, Kosovo is part of S&amp;M today, so the article cannot be misleading. No one knows what will happen tomorrow and you are welcome to include a footnote to reflect that. However, lengthy explanations of the UN administration do not belong in the infobox and certainly do not belong in the first paragraph. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikX_adcf.html" title="User:NikX">NikX</a> 10:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not predicting the status; there's no point in predicting the status. Kosovo is now part of Serbia and Montenegro - that's the reality. You are presenting it as if it's independent when clearly it's not. We can list it separately, but only if we make clear that it is currently part of S&amp;M. According to my version, Kosovo is a UN administrated territory in Serbia and Montenegro - the future is unknown.

I am not stating anywhere that Kosova is independent, it will be, soon, but I did not say that in the article. Instead I thought we agreed to have Kosova be represented separately, and suddenly your nationalistic pulse jumped up and you reverted it backing sending me threats what can "only" be acceptable for you.

<p>Hi, I propose including a text on the Ghegs and the Tosks. How about this one:</p>
<p>There are two major dialect groups, the Ghegs, to the north of the Shkumbin River, and the Tosks, to the south. Kosovar Albanians are Ghegs. The Ghegs, who make up two-thirds of Albanians, are less intermarried with non-Albanians than the Tosks, who throughout history were more often subjected to foreign rule and other foreign influences. In the past, the Ghegs were organized in clans and the Tosks in a semifeudal society. Before World War II the Ghegs dominated Albanian politics, but after the war many Tosks came to power because the new Communist government drew most of its support from Tosks.</p>
<p>During Enver Hoxha’s regime in Albania, the cultural and economic differences between the Ghegs and the Tosks were suppressed. However, Tosk became the official standard dialect under the Communists (1972) and remains so today.</p>

<p>Is it 65 thousand (as said in ethnologue web site) or 5 million as in a BBC news? Both figures are from the article.

<p>Could the (presumably Serbian) users trying to amalgamate the entry for Kosovo into that for Serbia please explain why. Yes, Kosovo is legally a province of Serbia however is it not within the control of the Serbian government for the time being, and it carries out its own census. The Albanian population in Kosovo is a very significant factor for the region's future, and most people checking the infobox will most likely be wanting to check that. Listing "Kosovo" next to "Serbia (excluding Kosovo)" does not imply that Kosovo is not part of Serbia. All it does is imply that the region requires special treatment, which it does. //Dirak 00:49, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 2003 census of Serbia (minus Kosovo) counted 61,647 Albanians. The Kosovo government estimated that the total Kosovo population ranges from 1.9 to 2.2 million of which 88% is Albanian or some where between 1,672,000 &amp; 1,936,000. Taking the mid point of that 1,804,000 and adding a rounded figure of 62,000 I came up with a total of 1,866,000. 2,782,000 seemed very much an over estimation. -- <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhildav76_3990.html" title="User:Phildav76">Phildav76</a> 20:36, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
