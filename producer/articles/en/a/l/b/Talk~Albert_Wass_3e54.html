<p>Nothing about his implication (at least as a controversy) in WWII war crimes from Northern Transylvania? (I've read in some newspaper and magazine articles about incriminating documents from the archive of US Holocaust Memorial Museum). AFAIK he was trialed and sentenced to death for war crimes but he escaped (I don't know the circumstances). Some years ago the Hungarian politicans from Romania asked for his rehabilitation (and among other things they also requested the former sentence to death to be declared null). <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 17:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC) Plus, the article in the current form reads as incoherent. It is claimed a rehabilitation but the editors so far haven't mentioned why. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 17:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I also noted those discrepancies. I just found out about the subject, just tried to wikify a bit the page, fixed some of the redlinks (going even to the length of adding the village of <a href="../../../r/%C4%83/s/R%C4%83scruci%2C_Cluj_e741.html" title="Răscruci, Cluj">Răscruci, Cluj</a>), added categories, etc, plus fixed the {fact} tag, which sounded very much needed. For the substance, though, more effort is needed. I don't have the necessary references, but I'm willing to look into it. At any rate, this seems like an article that needs quite a bit more work to it -- much of the infom seems POV to me, but I just don't know enough to say that for sure. At the very least, I agree, the way it is presented, whole paragraphs sound rather incoherent. How to proceed? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 17:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The best thing is if one can get those references to USHMM archives. I've found almost no material in English, just the echoes in Romanian press. One good article for instance is here: <a href="http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=9147&amp;print=true" class="external free" title="http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=9147&amp;print=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=9147&amp;print=true</a> I've found several others detailing various perspectives on Albert Wass involvement but these are historical events and we need better sources than newspapers.</dd>
<dd>I've found this article as I was looking for Wiki articles on war-crimes in Northern Transylvania. I've found the pages of Ip (a stub) and Treznea massacres, but otherwise the subject is almost untouched here in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 18:01, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I found a detailed study of the Wass family, published in 2005 -- I put the link in the article (there were absolutely no references before!). There is some interesting information there, some of which I plan to add. Also, a brief guide surrounding the controversy; apparently, there is a big dispute here, involving Romania, Hungary, and even the United States -- none of which is clearly explained in the article as of now. It would take a while to sort through all these competing claims and counter-claims, but I think it would be worthwhile to explain first what originated the dispute (certain events from WWII), and how the case proceeded. Otherwise, as you said abovem the whole thing is incoherent. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 18:21, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK, I added some of the material from the Kovács biography. I'll take a break now -- there is that much time I can devote to this story. Just a quick question: how to deal with those place names? I found them listed in Hungarian in Kovács' book, but I wanted to put wikilinks to current place names. That was not so easy to do, since one has to first translate, and then look for the names in en.wiki, where there are still big gaps when it comes to village names, at least in Cluj County. I did best I could, but maybe someone else can double-check, and maybe even start relevant stubs? Finally (and in a different vein), I think there may be a need for a separate article on Wass' son, Huba Wass de Czege, who looks to be an important general and military theoretician of the U.S. Army. I put in some quick mention about that, but it may be better to have a separate article on that. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 19:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good job. I think we can leave those villages with two names here - the page for Taga is a stub and no Hungarian alternative is there, the other are missing. And we have to keep the Hungarian names as the reference itself makes use of them (that is a problem of mostly Hungarian authors - to use pre-Trianon names). <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 22:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbert_Wass_3e54.html" title="Edit section: Hungarian names">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hungarian names</span></h2>
<p>I have no problem with Hungarian alternate names in Transylvania when they are supposed to show something (an etymology or added because the settlement doesn't have a proper article to clarify the multiple names it may have in several languages: Romanian, Hungarian, German etc.). But adding Hungarian alternates to a city in today's Romania about events happening in today's Romania is inacceptable to me.</p>
<p>I am in doubt on how to refer Cluj-Napoca at the time when Albert Wass graduated. Sometimes people use the old names (e.g. Aquincum instead of Budapest in Roman times), sometimes they do not (e.g. no one talks of al-Qurtubah, only of Cordoba). <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 21:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fail to see how it is inacceptable. This is an article about a Hungarian person. Odorheiu Secuiesc is 96.7% Hungarian, and I am sure that him, and virtually all of the inhabitants of the city used the Hungarian name. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 21:30, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Odorheiu Secuiesc is in Romania today and the official name of the city is Odorheiu Secuiesc and not otherwise. The Romanian legislation allows them to have dual tags in the city, not to change the name of the city. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 21:36, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No one is changing the name of the city, we're just stating the Hungarian name right beside it. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 21:39, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And thus promoting the Hungarian name in a non-Hungarian environment (English Wikipedia), even though the city has an official name. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 21:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>English Wikipedia does not mean "England/United States Wikipedia". It makes sense to give the name that the city's inhabitants use. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 21:46, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It makes sense to give the name in English language and following the naming conventions. The article on Odorheiu Secuiesc gives the name in other languages (relevant for the inhabitants of the city or for its history) for those curious on that. As for the inhabitants, they can call it however they want, the country they are living in and whose laws they must obey <b>enforces</b> another different name, a name they must learn if they want to find it on maps or to ask for a train ticket or anything. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 21:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to see there is a dispute about these naming conventions, I would hope there is some clear rule about all this by now. But, after reading the arguments pro and con on both sides, and pondering the issue based on what I think is merely common sense, I must say I tend to agree with <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">User:Daizus</a> on this. Indeed, I see the reason to use both names in instances where it pertains to long-ago historical events (when perhaps the locality had a different name), or when the quote one is using refers to the name of a locality in a different language (I've done precisely that in my own edits). But I do not see the justification for using alternate names for localities when there is a unique name assigned to such a locality in en.wikipedia, and when that unique name coincides with the legal designation in the country in question, especially when referring to current events (as of 2006, in the instance under dispute). Now, if I understand the argument made by <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a>, he proposes an exception to this rule, which seems pretty well accepted, both as a matter of international Law, and as a matter of Wikipedia policy (please do correct me if I'm wrong), based on the percentage of people in a given locality that speak a different language from the official language of said country. While I do see some some plausibility to this sort of argument, it doesn't seem convinging enough to me -- if nothing else, it opens up a Pandora's box of possibilities. To make up an (admittedly artificial) example, if all of a sudden <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a> were to have a French-speaking majority population, should we refer to the city as New Orleans (<i>La Nouvelle-Orléans</i>)? And, would that majority have to be 50.1%, or 99%, or some other pre-defined percentage in between (which one?), for such an exception to established rules to take effect at wikipedia? Please do give some more thought to the issue, and let's try to establish some general rules, rules that ideally should be established a priori, not a posteriori, on a case-by-case basis. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 05:14, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a rather problematic matter. Albert Wass was hungarian, and most of the places in question still have a majority of hungarian inhabitants. Also, he was a writer famous for his post-Trianon novels, and this makes it even more problematic.</dd>
<dd>In my view, both hungarian and romanian names should be used. And since Albert Wass used the hungarian names (also in his novels!), he was hungarian, and at the times he lived, those places belonged to Hungary, I suggest writing the hungarian names first, and then the romanian names in brackets. ( <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> is right, if people "want to find it on maps or to ask for a train ticket" they need to know the romanian version of the names.) To use the Aquincum example: if we are talking about the Roman empire, we will surely use the Aquincum name, and put Budapest in brackets.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a>, this is a totally different place, so the New Orleans example is not correct. Technically, these places now belong to Romania, but the people living there are hungarians in all aspects. As <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> wrote, the country they are living in and whose laws they must obey <b>enforces</b> another different name, and another language and culture. This leads to constant problems and an always boiling situation.</dd>
<dd>Also, those places had hungarian names for about a thousand years. (So it is not like calling New Orleans all of a sudden La Nouvelle-Orléans.)</dd>
<dd>In this situation, I think the only solution that could bring peace is to use both names. And - since we are talking about a hungarian person - we should use the hungarian names first, then the romanian ones.</dd>
<dd>Thank You!</dd>

<dd>The edit conflict was about recent events in places now in Romania, under Romanian administration (the section called "Rehabilitation attempts"). There are not connected in anyway with Albert Wass' nationality or how those places were named at the times when he lived (by all means, I agree to keep information he was born in Kolozsvár (Romanian: Cluj-Napoca)), nor <i>all</i> the places involved have a majority of Hungarian inhabitants (check <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reghin.html" title="Reghin">Reghin</a>), nor the history of <i>all</i> those places' was especially connected with Hungarians (Szászrégen - you know what that means, no?). To continue your Aquincum example, however if you talk about modern Budapest on other Wiki pages, you don't put Aquincum in brackets. And to finish up, <a href="../../../n/c/g/WP%7ENCGN_6405.html" title="WP:NCGN">WP:NCGN</a> states: "If no name can be shown to be widely accepted in English, use the local official name.". <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 08:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As for "enforcement", I merely addressed an official name for a location (city). Under Romanian legislation, if those Hungarians are a sizeable minority(!) they have priviledges - like dual names for locations on all the public signs, education in their mother tongue, etc.. So the "boiling situation" is a not justified concern. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 08:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
