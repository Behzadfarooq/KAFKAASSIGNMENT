<p>Belle was also considered a model of consistency, compiling a .295 career <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a>, averaging 37 <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a> and 120 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_Batted_In_ac2e.html" title="Runs Batted In">RBI</a> a season over the ten main years of his major league career from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_baseball.html" title="1991 in baseball">1991</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_baseball.html" title="2000 in baseball">2000</a>. Belle is also one of only six players in major league history to have nine consecutive 100-RBI seasons. However, his combative personality combined with occasional angry outbursts created a reputation for surliness that often overshadowed his on-field hitting performance.</p>

<p>Albert Belle, and his <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternal_twin.html" title="Fraternal twin">fraternal twin</a>, Terry, were born on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport%2C_Louisiana_c251.html" title="Shreveport, Louisiana">Shreveport</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, the son of Albert Belle Sr., a high school baseball and football coach, and Carrie Belle, a former math teacher. Belle attended Huntington High School in Shreveport, where he was a star baseball and football player, a member of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Honor_Society_e5ca.html" title="National Honor Society">National Honor Society</a> and vice president of the local <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_Business_Leaders_of_America_43b9.html" title="Future Business Leaders of America">Future Business Leaders of America</a>. He graduated sixth in his high school class and made the all-state baseball team twice. In 1984, he was selected to play for the USA in the Junior Olympics in which the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">U.S.</a> won a silver medal. He played outfield and pitched, winning one game. After graduation, Belle was offered many football and baseball scholarships, including one to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Notre_Dame_aca9.html" title="University of Notre Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> and an appointment to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_ee12.html" title="United States Air Force Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a>. However, Belle decided to stay close to home and accepted a baseball scholarship to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_State_University_92ca.html" title="Louisiana State University">Louisiana State University</a>.</p>
<p><a name="College" id="College"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Belle_af9a.html" title="Edit section: College">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College</span></h2>
<p>Belle played college baseball at <a href="../../../l/s/u/LSU_07c5.html" title="LSU">LSU</a> from 1985–1987 where he made 1st team <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">All-SEC</a> in 1986 and 1987 and played in 184 games, with 585 at bats, 194 hits, 30 doubles, 49 home runs, 172 runs batted in, 157 runs, a .670 slugging percentage, and a .332 batting average.</p>
<p>After college, he was drafted by the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. While in the minor league system he was known as "Joey" (his childhood nickname) and was thought of as a top prospect, but high-risk due to his temper and excessive drinking. Belle underwent counseling and became known as "Albert." Umpire <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durwood_Merrill_25f7.html" title="Durwood Merrill">Durwood Merrill</a>, who wrote a book called <i>You're Out, and You're Ugly, Too</i>, tweaked Belle by calling him "Joey" long past the time when Belle was known by that name publicly.</p>
<p><a name="Major_league_career" id="Major_league_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Belle_af9a.html" title="Edit section: Major league career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Major league career</span></h2>
<p>Belle became the fourth player to have eight straight seasons of 30 home runs and 100 RBI, joining <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmie_Foxx_a70e.html" title="Jimmie Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Gehrig_2b64.html" title="Lou Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>. He was a mediocre fielder, but a somewhat effective base stealer, with a career high of 23 steals in 1993, and a surprising 17 steals in 1999 despite hip problems. Belle led the league three times in RBI, three times in total bases, three times in extra-base hits, and twice in slugging. He was a five-time All-Star between 1993 and 1997.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Albert Belle's career highs in home runs, RBI, batting average, runs scored, and walks occurred in five separate seasons.</p>
<p>In 1994, he lost the batting title to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>' similarly volcanic outfielder <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_O%27Neill_%28baseball_player%29_64ee.html" title="Paul O'Neill (baseball player)">Paul O'Neill</a>, .359 to .357. Belle's postseason record was limited to two heavy-hitting appearances, in which only his batting average suffered: he hit .230/.405/.557 with six home runs and 14 RBIs in 61 at-bats.</p>
<p>In 1995, Belle became the first player in the history of the major leagues to hit 50 homers and 50 doubles in the same season; the last player to reach 40 in both those categories in a season was <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Stargell_1557.html" title="Willie Stargell">Willie Stargell</a> in 1973.</p>
<p>His reputation, and more specifically his disdain of the media, almost certainly cost him the 1995 MVP Award. Belle finished second in the media voting to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>'s <a href="../../../m/o/_/Mo_Vaughn_3bb3.html" title="Mo Vaughn">Mo Vaughn</a>. This result occurred despite Belle's having led the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> that season in runs scored, home runs, RBI, slugging percentage, and total bases, and despite his outpacing Vaughn head-to-head in every important offensive category except RBI (both men had 126). This was in the middle of a three-year streak in which Albert Belle finished 3rd, 2nd, and 3rd for the American League MVP. Belle had two other top ten MVP finishes, in 1993 (7th) and 1998 (8th).</p>
<p>In the winter of 1996, Belle signed with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> as a free agent, which made him the highest paid player in baseball for a brief period. Belle enjoyed two great seasons in Chicago, including a career-high 27-game hitting streak in May 1997. Belle came close to having another 50/50 season in 1998, with 49 home runs and 48 doubles. Additionally, when <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Ripken_2bb5.html" title="Cal Ripken">Cal Ripken</a> ended his record consecutive game streak in September 1998, it was Belle who took over as the major league's active leader in the category.</p>
<p>Belle's White Sox contract had a unique clause allowing him to demand that he would remain one of the 3 highest paid players in baseball. In October 1998, Belle invoked the clause, and when the White Sox declined to give him a raise, Belle immediately became a free agent. Belle again became the game's highest paid player, signing a five-year deal with the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. Unfortunately for him and his new team, Belle ended his career just two seasons later, retiring at age 34 as a result of degenerative <a href="../../../o/s/t/Osteoarthritis.html" title="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> in his hip. However, he was kept on Baltimore's active 40-man roster for the next three years, as a condition of the insurance policy which largely reimbursed the Orioles for the remainder of Belle's contract.</p>
<p>Albert Belle homered in the final at-bat of his major-league career on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>.</p>

<p>Belle was involved in controversial incidents during his major league career. He was suspended in 1994 for using a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corked_bat.html" title="Corked bat">corked bat</a>. He was fined in 1996 for knocking down Brewers infielder <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_Vi%C3%B1a_57c7.html" title="Fernando Viña">Fernando Viña</a>, who had blocked his way on the basepaths (though many observers felt the collision was a legitimate play). He also had unpleasant interactions with the public. In 1990, he threw a baseball into the stands, where it struck a fan who had been taunting him about his alcohol rehab. He also chased down rowdy <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trick-or-treat.html" title="Trick-or-treat">trick-or-treating</a> vandals who were celebrating <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> by throwing eggs at his home; Belle bumping one of the vandals with his car. In 1986, he went after a heckler in the stands who was shouting racist insults at him; he was suspended while his team played in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_World_Series_fb11.html" title="College World Series">College World Series</a>.</p>
<p>Sports reporters resented Belle's refusal to grant interviews before a game. A profane outburst directed at a group of reporters in his team's dugout, including <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Sports_cf05.html" title="NBC Sports">NBC Sports</a> personality <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Storm_f4e7.html" title="Hannah Storm">Hannah Storm</a>, was widely reported during the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_World_Series_47c7.html" title="1995 World Series">1995 World Series</a>. The incident cemented Belle's image in the media, which was further fueled by his unrepentant attitude: "The Indians wanted me to issue a statement of regret when the fine was announced, but I told them to take it out. I apologize for nothing."</p>
<p>Eventually, Belle routinely refused to speak with the media. "I don't get excited talking about myself", he explained. "Guys such as <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Koufax_b2ac.html" title="Sandy Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_DiMaggio_29be.html" title="Joe DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Carlton_0f54.html" title="Steve Carlton">Steve Carlton</a> did not interview, and it was no big deal. They were quiet. I am also quiet. I just want to concentrate on baseball. Why does everyone want to hear me talk, anyway?" Belle rarely even conducted interviews regarding his various charitable donations and scholarships that might have burnished his sour image.</p>
<p>But the media did not ignore Belle. <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>'s <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buster_Olney_7e14.html" title="Buster Olney">Buster Olney</a> would write about Belle's outbursts while a Cleveland Indian:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was a taken in baseball circles that Albert Belle was nuts... The Indians billed him $10,000 a year for the damage he caused in clubhouses on the road and at home, and tolerated his behavior only because he was an awesome slugger... He slurped coffee constantly and seemed to be on a perpetual caffeinated frenzy. Few escaped his anger: on some days he would destroy the postgame buffet...launching plates into the shower... after one poor at-bat against Boston, he retreated to the visitor's clubhouse and took a bat to teammate Kenny Lofton's boombox. Belle prefered to have the clubhouse cold, below 60 degrees, and when one chilly teammate turned up the heat, Belle walked over, turned down the thermostat, and smashed it with his bat. His nickname, thereafter, was "Mr. Freeze."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In 2001, following Belle's retirement, the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a>'</i> venerable columnist Bill Madden wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Sorry, there'll be no words of sympathy here for Albert Belle. He was a surly jerk before he got hurt and now he's a hurt surly jerk....He was no credit to the game. Belle's boorish behavior should be remembered by every member of the Baseball Writers' Association when it comes time to consider him for the Hall of Fame."</li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to this, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> sportswriter <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lipsyte_1d9f.html" title="Robert Lipsyte">Robert Lipsyte</a> observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Madden is basically saying, 'He was not nice to me, so let's screw him.' Sportswriters anoint heroes in basically the same way you have crushes in junior high school... you've got someone like Albert Belle, who is somehow basically ungrateful for this enormous opportunity to play this game. If he's going to appear to us as a surly asshole, then we'll cover him that way. And then, of course, he's not gonna talk to us anymore—it's self-fulfilling."</li>

<p>In Belle's first year of Hall of Fame eligibility (2006), he garnered only 7.7% of the baseball writers' votes—missing election by an extremely wide margin.<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060110&amp;content_id=1293389&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb" class="external autonumber" title="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060110&amp;content_id=1293389&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> But Belle's vote total was high enough to keep his name on the ballot for the following year. In 2007, however, Belle only garnered 19 votes and dropped off the ballot.</p>
<p>In February 2006, Belle was arrested on suspicion of stalking a woman who was identified in court as a former licensed escort.<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/0610albertbelle0610.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/0610albertbelle0610.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> He was again arrested in charges related to the same case on May 17, 2006.<a href="http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/index.php?sty=65817" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/index.php?sty=65817" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> On July 27, 2006, Belle plead guilty to one count of stalking and he was sentenced on August 24 to 90 days in jail and five years supervised probation.<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/sports/articles/0825belle0825.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/sports/articles/0825belle0825.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Belle's behavior was extreme; he had had a <a href="../../../g/p/s/GPS_8c57.html" title="GPS">GPS</a> tracking device put on her car, and obtained her phone records.
