<p>Rev. <b>Albert Edward Smith</b> (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_20.html" title="October 20">October 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>—<a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>) was a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> religious leader and politician. A <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_gospel.html" title="Social gospel">social gospeller</a>, Smith was for many years a minister in the Canadian <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> Church before starting his own "People's Church". He served in the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_Manitoba_631d.html" title="Legislative Assembly of Manitoba">Legislative Assembly of Manitoba</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> as a <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_Labour_Party_%28in_Manitoba%29_a375.html" title="Dominion Labour Party (in Manitoba)">Labour</a> representative. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, he became a member of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Canada_8370.html" title="Communist Party of Canada">Communist Party of Canada</a>.</p>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guelph%2C_Ontario_ed32.html" title="Guelph, Ontario">Guelph</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, the son of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working-class.html" title="Working-class">working-class</a> immigrants from <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. His family later moved to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Ontario_a636.html" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton</a>, where he developed an interest in religion after joining the Gore Street Methodist Church. After passing an oral examination to become a preacher, Smith was transferred to McGregor, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> to begin field work field. His appointment came from James Woodsworth, superintendent of Methodist missions for western Canada and father of <a href="../../../j/2E/s/J.S._Woodsworth_3061.html" title="J.S. Woodsworth">J.S. Woodsworth</a>.</p>
<p>Smith was a vocal supporter of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Greenway_e754.html" title="Thomas Greenway">Thomas Greenway</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Liberal_Party_c226.html" title="Manitoba Liberal Party">Liberal</a> government in Manitoba during the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890s.html" title="1890s">1890s</a>. During the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Schools_Question_6548.html" title="Manitoba Schools Question">Manitoba Schools Question</a>, he defended the Greenway government's decision to remove funding from French-language <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separate_school.html" title="Separate school">denominational schools</a>.</p>
<p>After three years' work as a probationer, Smith enrolled as a student for the ministry at Wesley College in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg.html" title="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>. He was formally ordained to the ministry in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>. After working in <a href="../../../d/a/u/Dauphin%2C_Manitoba_39fe.html" title="Dauphin, Manitoba">Dauphin</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Albert%2C_Saskatchewan_5f26.html" title="Prince Albert, Saskatchewan">Prince Albert</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, Smith was stationed at the MacDougall Memorial Methodist Church in north-end Winnipeg in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>. His political views now turned to labour, and he spoke in support of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_W._Puttee_1b39.html" title="Arthur W. Puttee">Arthur W. Puttee</a>'s re-election in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1904.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1904">1904 federal election</a>.</p>
<p>Smith left Winnipeg in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, and moved to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portage_la_Prairie%2C_Manitoba_28cc.html" title="Portage la Prairie, Manitoba">Portage la Prairie</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>, he accepted ministerial work in <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson%2C_British_Columbia_6371.html" title="Nelson, British Columbia">Nelson</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>. He spoke at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_of_Canada_984b.html" title="Socialist Party of Canada">Socialist Party</a> gatherings, and became acquainted with Jack Johnstone, later a leading figure in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_the_United_States_2970.html" title="Communist Party of the United States">Communist Party of the United States</a>. Smith returned to Manitoba in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, to accept a position as minister of the First Methodist Church in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon%2C_Manitoba_68f4.html" title="Brandon, Manitoba">Brandon</a>.</p>
<p>He was an advocate of church union with the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterians</a> throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910s.html" title="1910s">1910s</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, this union came about via the creation of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Canada_9aa4.html" title="United Church of Canada">United Church of Canada</a>.</p>
<p>Smith was asked to consider running in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1917.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1917">1917 federal election</a> as a supporter of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Borden_544f.html" title="Robert Borden">Robert Borden</a>'s <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist_Party_%28Canada%29_e51d.html" title="Unionist Party (Canada)">Union government</a> of pro-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberals</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_%28historical%29_1ebf.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada (historical)">Conservatives</a>. Alhough he rejected these requests, Smith's name was put forward for the Unionist nomination in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Brandon (electoral district)">Brandon</a>. Borden's government was supported by both mainstream labour and the Methodist Church, and some local government supporters believed Smith's name would aid their cause. Asked to make a speech at the nomination meeting, he informed the delegates that he had no confidence in either of the older parties, and did not believe the Union arrangement would make any difference. To the surprise of none present, Smith did not receive the nomination.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, Smith read the <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Manifesto_2ae3.html" title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a></i> for the first time. He later claimed that the work was "like a revelation". Smith's religious views were, by his own admission, unorthodox for the standards of his age: he believed that the message of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> was "the proclamation of a new social order of human society", and rejected the "harsh theologies" of mainstream <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> churches. "In my sermons", he wrote, "no miracle was required to explain the birth of Jesus or his life and teachings [...] His name was to be cherished because He died as a leader of the people, for His principles and in protest against the unjust rulers of His day" (Albert Smith, All My Life, pp. 42-43). After reading the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, Smith eventually reached the conclusion that Jesus was a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a>.</p>
<p>Smith's views had not yet developed to this stage in 1917, however, and he joined the social reformist <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_Labour_Party_da70.html" title="Dominion Labour Party">Dominion Labour Party</a> at the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Smith supported the strikers from his pulpit during the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_General_Strike_afd8.html" title="Winnipeg General Strike">Winnipeg General Strike</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, and opened his church to Brandon civic workers who voted for a parallel strike in their city. As a member of the Brandon Trades and Labour Congress, Smith provided extensive logistical support to Brandon's strike committee.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Smith's labour activities were opposed by more conservative figures in his Methodist church. At a special meeting of the church board held on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, a prominent church member moved that Smith "be restrained from any further preaching in First Church". No formal charges were made against him, and the motion was withdrawn. Nonetheless, his role as Brandon's Methodist minister had become untenable. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, he announced the formation of a new People's Church in the city.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, Smith was prevailed on to run for the provincial legislature as a labour candidate. He received the nomination of a local group called the "Brandon Labour Party", which was aligned with the Winnipeg branch of the Dominion Labour Party. He was successful in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1920.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1920">1920 provincial election</a>, defeating Liberal incumbent Stephen E. Clements by 604 votes. Some of Smith's opponents blamed vote-splitting by the Liberals and Conservatives for his victory.</p>
<p>For the next two years, Smith sat with the labour parliamentary group led by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Dixon_dfec.html" title="Fred Dixon">Fred Dixon</a> in the legislative opposition. Unlike other labour members, Smith did not join the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Labour_Party_%28in_Manitoba%29_%28II%29_0abd.html" title="Independent Labour Party (in Manitoba) (II)">Independent Labour Party</a> when the Winnipeg branch of the Dominion Labour Party split in late 1920. In August <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, he instead attended a meeting of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Congress which led to the creation of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Labour_Party_8d94.html" title="Canadian Labour Party">Canadian Labour Party</a>. While joining the CLP took Smith on a different path from his co-legislators, he remained a member of the labor parliamentary group.</p>
<p>Labour's political support in Manitoba had declined somewhat by the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1922.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1922">1922 provincial election</a>. Smith lost his seat to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edmison_aeae.html" title="John Edmison">John Edmison</a>, who ran as a "fusion" candidate of the local Liberals and Conservatives. No longer receiving a salary as a Methodist minister or <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_05a5.html" title="Member of the Legislative Assembly">Member of the Legislative Assembly</a> (MLA), Smith experienced financial difficulties in Brandon and decided to return to Ontario. He moved to Ontario in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>, and immediately started a People's Church in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. Smith was also involved in the Forum Committee of the local Labour Temple, and became a prominent member of the Canadian Labour Party in the city. Like <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Simpson_%28politician%29_54bb.html" title="James Simpson (politician)">James Simpson</a>, Smith supported opening the CLP to members of the newly-formed <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Canada_8370.html" title="Communist Party of Canada">Communist Party of Canada</a>.</p>
<p>Smith's personal philosophy continued to develop in this period, and in January 1925 he made the decision to join the Communist Party himself. His membership in the party was confirmed at a small upstairs room at 8 Gerrard Street East in Toronto, where a meeting of the party was held. He later explained his decision to a <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a></i> reporter by arguing that communism was a part of man's social evolution. Smith remained a member of the Communist Party for the rest of his life. Still a prominent figure in Toronto, he often defended the Communist Party against threats from hostile governments. He became a prominent organizer for the Canadian Labour Defence League across Canada in the 1920s, and served as its general secretary until it was shut down by the Canadian government in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>.</p>
<p>He campaigned for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1925.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1925">1925 federal election</a> as a candidate of the CLP in the northern Ontario riding of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur%E2%80%94Thunder_Bay_7551.html" title="Port Arthur—Thunder Bay">Port Arthur—Thunder Bay</a>. He finished fourth, with 1,363 votes. The winner was William Fitzgerald Langworthy of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_%28historical%29_1ebf.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada (historical)">Conservative Party</a>. At the time of the election, Smith described his occupation as "educationalist". He ran again in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1926.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1926">1926 election</a>, and finished third with 1,382 votes. The winner was Conservative <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_James_Cowan_303a.html" title="Donald James Cowan">Donald James Cowan</a>.</p>
<p>Smith ran for municipal office in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> during this period. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, he ran for <a href="../../../a/l/d/Alderman.html" title="Alderman">alderman</a> in Ward Seven as a candidate of the Labour Representation Political Association, a broad-tent group aligned with the Canadian Labour Party. He was defeated, and lost a second time in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>. He also ran as a candidate of the Ontario division of the CLP in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1926.html" title="Ontario general election, 1926">1926 provincial election</a>, receiving 416 votes in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Centre_eecf.html" title="Hamilton Centre">Hamilton Centre</a>. The winner on that occasion was Thomas Jutten of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario_4e61.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario">Ontario Conservative Party</a>.</p>
<p>During the late 1920s, Smith became a prominent opponent of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyism.html" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a> within the Communist Party of Canada. He supported the removal of <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Spector_71ea.html" title="Maurice Spector">Maurice Spector</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_MacDonald_4044.html" title="Jack MacDonald">Jack MacDonald</a> from the CPC, and endorsed <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Buck_7c33.html" title="Tim Buck">Tim Buck</a>, a strong supporter of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, to become the party's new leader in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>. In his autobiography, Smith accused <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a> of attempting to betray the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik_Revolution_c392.html" title="Bolshevik Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, alleging that he had been in the "in the service of British agents" in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>.</p>
<p>With the Canadian Labour Party falling into disarray, Smith returned to northern Ontario for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1930.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1930">federal election of 1930</a> to contest <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_William_%28electoral_district%29_4197.html" title="Fort William (electoral district)">Fort William</a> as an independent candidate. He received 594 votes, finishing third. The winner was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_James_Manion_b828.html" title="Robert James Manion">Robert James Manion</a>, who later served as leader of the federal Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Smith visited the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> for the first time in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, and wrote favourably of the experience upon his return. In July <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, he traveled to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> as an emissary of the "Friends of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackenzie-Papineau_Battalion_d26a.html" title="Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion">Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion</a>".</p>
<p>Smith was one of Tim Buck's most vocal defenders in the early 1930s, when Buck was detained and nearly killed in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingston_Penitentiary_1715.html" title="Kingston Penitentiary">Kingston Penitentiary</a>. In the 1934 provincial election, Smith ran as a candidate of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Canada_-_Ontario_bebe.html" title="Communist Party of Canada - Ontario">Ontario Communist Party</a> against Conservative <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Ontario_ab6d.html" title="Premier of Ontario">Premier</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Henry_eadd.html" title="George Henry">George Henry</a> in the constituency of <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_East_e34d.html" title="York East">York East</a>. He finished fourth, though still polling a respectable 664 votes. Later in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, Smith polled a surprisingly high 8,500 votes for <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_Toronto_9111.html" title="Mayor of Toronto">Mayor of Toronto</a>.</p>
<p>Returning again to northern Ontario, Smith ran for the House of Commons as a candidate of the Communist Party candidate in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1935.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1935">1935 federal election</a>, receiving 1,161 votes for a fourth-place finish in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur_%28electoral_district%29_5e55.html" title="Port Arthur (electoral district)">Port Arthur</a>. The winner was <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Decatur_Howe_b376.html" title="Clarence Decatur Howe">Clarence Decatur Howe</a> of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>Smith largely curtailed his political activities after this time, though he remained an active figure within the Communist Party. He returned to Manitoba for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1945.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1945">1945 federal election</a>, and campaigned for the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Progressive_Party_0a4a.html" title="Labour Progressive Party">Labour Progressive Party</a> (as the Communist Party had renamed itself) in his old riding of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Brandon (electoral district)">Brandon</a>. He received 497 votes, finishing fourth. The winner was Liberal James Ewen Matthews.</p>
<p>Smith's autobiography, <i>All My Life</i>, was published posthumously in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. The work chronicles his religious and political evolution, and gives extensive consideration to the Communist Party's struggles of the 1930s. Interestingly, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Stalin_83d9.html" title="Josef Stalin">Josef Stalin</a> is never mentioned by name in this book.</p>
<p>To the end of his life, Smith argued that his beliefs were a reflection of the message promoted by Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>A.E. Smith's son, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Smith_81d0.html" title="Stewart Smith">Stewart Smith</a>, was a leading member of the Communist Party in his own right.</p>
