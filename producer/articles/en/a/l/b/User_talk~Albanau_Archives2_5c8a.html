<p>The Ottoman province Albania compromised the following four vilayet: Kosova, Ishkodra, Manastir and Yanya. I hope you knew that!? --Albanau 17:48, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So what. The Serbian teritory during the reign of Tzar Dusan compromised almost all the countries below the Danube, Part of Serbia (with Kosovo), whole Albania, whole Macedonia, big part of Greece... And do Serbs ask for the independence of these areas?</p>

<p>I am neutral in the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Albanians_25c1.html" title="Origin of Albanians">Origin of Albanians</a> article. I will not erase arguments or statements in the article that support the Illyrian theory, as long as the arguments or statements represent the current views of credible scholars. I might not believe in the Illyrian origin yet, but I can't say it is impossible and I do not have the right to erase credited information from the text (unless, of course, it is no longer current, or has been disproven, or is mis-stated, etc.). Decius 22:46, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In considering your subjectivities in regard to the article - the article have many times been considered for deletion. You've been intellectually dishonest by feigning neutrality. While much has been achieved in the last months, a lot more hard work is yet to be done on reaching neutrality. The article needs to be edited to conform to a higher standard of quality. May seem hopeless but given up is not something we should do. I admit that I need your help. We are opposite to each other, we have our own vision of objectivity and melting them together will produce a good article. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 01:33, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think for now we should keep a close eye on <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">User:Theathenae</a>'s edits. He has engaged in what can easily be classed as vandalism in the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Romanians_fcc1.html" title="Origin of Romanians">Origin of Romanians</a> and other articles as well. If he continues and gets worse, we will report him, but I think we should wait for something more before we report. I read those edits he did and it is definitely wrong to have erased the term <b>of Albanian ethnic origin</b> (correctly speaking of the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>), because Albanians are classed as an ethnicity regardless of the fact that the nation did not exist then as a modern state. That was clearly a demonstration of his nationalist Greek agenda, once again. Decius 22:07, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Theathenae continues to write on articles <i>Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</i> insteed of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. One the article, <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>, he continues to deny that the Arvanitis people are the descendants of settlers of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanian</a> ancestry who migrated to what is now <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. On article <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> he claim that a Gheg Albanian don't understand a Arvanítika speaker, that is totaly untrue, I myself of Gheg descant, eventhough I don't speak my native language (Gheg Albanian) so well I understand Arvanítika when I read it so well as I understand Tosk. <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anv%E4ndardiskussion:Arvan%EDtis" class="external text" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anv%E4ndardiskussion:Arvan%EDtis" rel="nofollow">L'Houngan</a> from swedish wikipedia said to Theathenae talk page in arvanitika: 'edhé sa më thójnë u folni glúhën Arvanítika?', I don't speak Tosk Albanian but Gheg Albanian, however I understand this line and I can translate it to you: 'and what you told me was that you speak Arvanitika?' On the articles he have made up alot of things. He is a supporter to many theories that have been invented by politics for political purpose during Balkan's history in the begning of 1800- 1900 century. He have made clear on few articles and talk pages that the Vlach people in Albania are Greeks. On the article Arvanites he mention the Arvanites only as 'a people' rather then to specify 'a Albanian ethnic group' that settled Greece. Likely he want to claim that Arvanites ancestors are not Albanians. This is manipulation of history to the degree of paranoia. We should have a very close eye on him, he does edit pages alot, quick, I suggest we report him to other administrators that way we pressure him to stop writting from his point of view. He will likely give up, and hopefully he will learn to understand what neutrality means. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 02:05, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's a good idea about getting administrators to review what he's been doing. Maybe you can get some administrators to read the paragraph above on this talk page, because you have made some good points above. Also, you can go to the Albanian Wiki and look for <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">User:Dori</a> to help out to. Dori can write very well in English but he doesn't use the English Wiki anymore, but he'll probably step in if you ask him. Decius 04:04, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>George Kastriotis, by Paganel, 1860</li>
</ul>
<p>when what you had to do was to find online sources for the books and more books about him. Let me quote a paragraph from the first link:</p>
<p>This is not the oldest printed book found in the National Library of Albania (the earliest dates from 1473), but it is the most important one concerning the historical-documentary value of the <b>Albanian culture</b>. At the center of the work stands the image of <b>George from the Castriots</b> family (known by the Osmans as <b>Scanderbegi</b>). For a quarter of a century, at the head of the Albanian military alliance, he faced the Ottoman invaders preventing their irruption in Europe. This work points out the influence of the <b>Albanian prince</b> on the political life of <b>Albanian people</b>, of the <b>Balkan Peninsula people</b> and on the <b>Continent</b>. The author's name, an Albanian from Scodra, appears at the top of the preface: 'Marini Barleti Scodrensis de vita &amp; gestis Scanderbeg'. The publication data are taken from the colophon.</p>
<p>and I think the Library "Biblioteka Kombetare" is in Tirana, Albania.</p>
<p>I do hope that you put that information back when you understand that you were wrong.</p>

<p>I dont know if he was partly Greek. Perhaps he was or wasn't. Would that make him less heroic? The books, or at least the first one, is considered an albanian cultural treasure. I don't really care if he was partly Greek, of felt he was a little Greek too. I understand how you consider him a hero (and he was) so I've made some notes on the talk page so that you can use them to expand the article. I personally think he was partly Greek but that doesn't make any difference. But we should mention what he wrote on his letter, don't you think? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 18:29, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not distorting any article, I just write my views on talk pages (I believe it's honest to know with whom you are talking). The two books (the bibliography section) you 've deleted is like hiding facts. You can see from the history that I was very carefull when editing the article. I told you the other day, that I've read something about his origins in the past. After reading the article about him and checking the external links I found this two books (after long google searches). I believe that you will put them back when you understand it. My personal point of view is that he probably was albanian who might had some greek relatives. This doesn't make him less Albanian or less heroic. I do hope that you will expand the article and I wish you good luck.<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 18:46, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Matia is claiming that the Albanian group population Tosks and Gegs are not the same people and the dialect they speak, toskërisht and gegërisht, is a separated language, he is using a <b>old</b> Encyklopedia and this is typical what is written in a old encyklopedias about the dialects of the Albanians language and the Albanian group Tosk and Geg. All new Encyklopedias disagree.

<p>Albanau I am very sorry and I can't understand why you call me greek propagandist. Anyone can see my contributions, here in this talk page, on scanderbeg's talk page and in wikipedia in general. I gave you some sources to expand the Scanderbeg article. On Arvanites diff history one can see me cleary stating that Tosks are Albanians. I have clarified on one of the articles about Arvanites (<a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">Talk:Arvanitic language</a>) that Tosks and Ghegs are both Albanians, like on Ancient Greece, Spartans and Athenians were both Greeks. Yet they might have different dress codes, dialects etc, and I told you that you could use, after filtering out the biased info from 1911, those info to write two good articles about Ghegs and Tosks.</p>
<p>You on the other hand kept claiming on the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> article and talk page that Arvanites are an Albanian ethnic minority on Greece, while anyone who studied the history of Arvanites can understand that they are not Albanians, and everyone, including you, should respect other people's history and their right for self-identification. And back then I didn't called you a propagandist.</p>
<p>If someone check the diff history in Scanderbeg, he will see that I 've added a bibliography section (as we've talked about before, here on your talk page). Your insecurity led you to remove from the Scanderbeg wiki one book that is considered as an Albanian Cultural Treasure. I'm not claiming Scanderbeg for Greece, I 've clearly stated (see above) that Scanderbeg was Albanian, who might had a greek grandfather (check his letters). That, as I said before, won't make him less Albanian or less heroic. Do whatever you want and whatever you understand. I would like an apology for calling me a propagandist, but I don't really expect you to do so. Good luck on your wiki editing.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 17:43, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Matia, many thanks that you do not go in edit wars with others and that you are calm and discuss the matter although I disagree what you just said.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) where in the articles did I describe Arvanites as an Albanian ethnic minority? I stated many times that Arvanites are dispite the admixture descendants of settlers of Albanian ancestry and that the Arvanitic language is variety of Tosk Albanian.

<dl>
<dd>2) reason why I called you a Greek propagandist was because you have further angered me in bringing Greece in this separatist and schismatic description of the Albanian groups Tosks and Ghegs and the two main dialects of Albanian language.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) you are allowed to believe that Skanderbeg was Greek or partly Greek by descendant and other Serbs are also allowed to beleive that Skanderbeg was Serb or partly Serb by descendant, however you and the others should keep the <i>point of view</i> outside the article. Skanderbeg does not claim Greek descendant. Regarding the name Epirus I told you that It was during medival time a synonym for Albania and Epiroti could also be used to refer to the Albanians. If you wish to claim Skanderbeg as Greek or partly Greek start a website for your purpose! PS: if you or any other make a smallest impression that he was Greek or Serb or partly Greek or Serb I will bring administrators to protect the article cause I already been fighting for a long time to keep the article clean from that kind of stuff.</dd>

oh my godddddddddddddddddd!!!! i was currently viewing this site and i came to a stand still when i saw the two most horrible names in my vocabulary!! do you know what they are? Greek and Serb!!! first of all, i like to inform evryone that Skender beu or as he was originally called Gjergj Kastrioti was not Serb or Greek and for your information he didn't have descendants from there either....its insulting to think otherwise...its dimining for me as an albanian! serbs and greeks are not even ethnic, they are what we call sllavs...meaning they are "te ardhur"! what has further disgusted me is the fact that people with albanian blood repeatedly in this site refer to the original albanian language and their dialects gheg and tosk as originating from greekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!! i am ashamed.....its people like you-lot that anger me and this is the reason that albania doesn't prosper.....BECAUSE....we don't stick together but instead we choose to lick arse's of sllavs....its disgusting and every single one of you should be ashamed apart from the nationalists! i won't accept any lower... 'pacim! do you know what? if gjergj kastrioti was alive today (impossible i know) but nonetheless he would have said "i fought for nothing!!! absolutely f****** nothing!" i agree...i have seen albanians who become friends with greeks and serbs.....its not a pretty picture, i tell you that! i would rather die than stoop down to that level...its lower than dirt....and to be honest i will have my dignity, thank you!!!</p>
<p>ohhh one more thing!! for those of you who choose to write the name Skender Beu , Scanderbeg...what the hell do you think you are doing? Scanderbeg???? is this how albanians write the name? N O ... do you copy the name Scanderbeg from an english infested website unless you are an illeterate....doing a good job i must say! carry on with your incapability to write properly and you won't get far!!!</p>
<p><br />
Chill out dude, it's a known fact that Iskender Bey is being claimed by Turkish, Greek and Serbian nationalists. Albanian nationalists aren't the only grave-diggers. Chill out. Get a life.</p>

And forgive me if I don't know the Albanian names for these cities, but the cities of Kroja, Avlona/Valona and Himara became Orthodox religeous centers. The Tsar enforced total equalty between Serbs, Arbanasses and Greeks; as is shown when the northern half of present Albania was governed by Karl Topia (until 1387) (th south were ruled by Despot John Asen (until 1366 and Master Alexander (1366-1370)). I see that you have been called a terrorst-supporter. Relax, user Mir Harven responded to my questin with a counter-question: "What's your life's problem?

<p>The life of Basil Sakelaris, the Troesenian priest.</p>
<p>(Freely adapted from the arvanitic.) I was born in nineteen ninety-seven, 1797, after the birth of Christ. And when I reached the age of seven, I learned to write in modern? Greek in Piyada (Nea Epidaurus?). Then I returned in my native country, and in 1808 I went to Poros, to study Greek under N. Bambakis. Then, after one year I got on a ship and we set sail to Constantinople, and then came we to Smyrna and we loaded raisins destined for Amsterdam. We set sail for Malta, from there we went to Mahon, and then to Mallorca, and we anchored in Argazilia (?). The sailors warned us not to go on sea, because the Algerians were offshore, and they would kidnap us. We went to sea anyway, they caught us and put our whole crew in their ship. In our ship the Algerians put some of their men and took us to Algiers. We remained there for four days, and then they released us, together with some other slaves. After being released we arrived in Calais, but we were sent off. Then we went to Lisbon, from there we went to London. We went to Helder by ferryboat (?) and unloaded. We entered Amsterdam six months after we set sail for the first time. Then we came back to Poros. Then I got married there, in 1818, and in 1820 I became a priest.</p>
<p>In 1821 the war with Turkey broke out. In 1828 I learned the allilodidaktike method? and became a teacher in Poros, remaining there until 1842. Then I left the island and in 1852 I was anointed priest for the king Ludwig. We went also in Toulon, France. In 1855 Ludwig released me from my duties and since then I have been employed in my church, with no other occupation.</p>

<p>I agree that name Albania was used during the Ottoman times, but this use was only geographical. It was used to designate lands inhabited by Albanians, not any province or provinces. I hoppe that you know that one province have its borders, government and defined legal status within the country to which it belong. Term Albania was not used to designate these 4 Ottoman vilayets, but only parts of these vilayets inhabited by Albanians. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="green"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 14:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Albanau, please stop it. We had a very thorough discussion of the topic during the last few weeks, and those statements in the present article that you may find hard to swallow are nevertheless extremely well supported by references. In my view, this is the best that could be done in terms of taking the Albanian view into account in a good NPOV way. If you have any constructive input to give, or want to question any specific point, then please do so. But that wholesale opposition is really totally uncalled for.

<p>Just admit that Greec, Serbia and Macedonia have taken the lands witch rightfully belongs to albania and the albanian people, talk all you want but the pure truth is that these lands are all inhabited by albanians and should be joined to albania. I dont really know why there is so much hatred for us albanians in the Balkans, we havent done any thing to anyone but yet you hate us so much, all we have done through out our history is suffered, torcered and been riped out of our land, we have been forced to move to this small corner of the Balkans, and yet you still want to pressur us and arent leaving us alone we want nothing more than to live in peace in a united county in the teritories that we ocupy nothing more, we dont want to take lands from any other countrys we just want our land is that too much to ask!!!!??????</p>

<dd>My problem is when users present theories as facts in the article. What annoys you so much seams very clear to me, that the word "Serbian" isn't mention on the article Skanderberg. Theories should be presented as theories in the article, and not as facts. I made that very clear on the talk page Skanderberg.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>I propose the removal of disputed information when the veracity of such disputed information cannot be verified. The theory of the Serbian origin of Scanderbeg is contradictory, and based on the national romantic interest of the Serbian people. Due to this fact it has not been scientifically confirmed. The woman in question is supposedly a princess of Bulgarian origin. Yet it certainly isn't safe to say much about the origin of Scanderbeg's mother. This theories should be presented as as theories in the article, and not as facts.</i></p>
<p><i>User shouldn't expend great energy on searching information from one-hundred-year-old encyklopedias. Old information overwrites new information, and is is generally not useful information. It is unwise to rely on old information all the time because certain information has been controversially disputed ever since. The best way to get reliable information is from updated and objective sources</i></p>

<dd>It is a very good explanation or else he would have been listed as an Illyrian, as it stands he is not. As the discussion on his site mentions, just because someone was born in Illyrium does not make them automatically ethnically Illyrian, especially when there is no historical documents which claim <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_the_Great_64d8.html" title="Constantine I the Great">Constantine I the Great</a> as such. Give historical authenic documentation which says his was ethnically Illyrian and then it can be looked upon seriously. Until then claiming him as Illyrian is just a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 7 April 2006</dd>

<p>I think Niko reverted your "disputed" tags without looking much at the situation on the talk page. Don't worry, we're working on a solution, it really doesn't matter much whether the tags are there for the time being or not. But, as far as I'm concerned, feel free to add them back if you want to insist. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 11:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Albanau, compromise proposal: would you agree to a solution where the "Albanian settlers" is left out of the introduction, but placed - unambiguously and stated as an undisputed fact - into the beginning of the "history" section, right below the intro? <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 13:39, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S.: By the way, please watch your reverts - that was four reverts within <i>very</i> narrowly over 24 hours, if I counted right.

<dd>If you've read the latest discussions between Matia and me, you'll see that I rather agree with you about the facts - the question is whether you would insist on having it in the intro, or whether it would be enough to have it in the next section down. Intro unfortunately means further conflict with the Greek editors; history section might be a basis for consensus. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 15:19, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For whatever it means, I do not plan on reporting Albanau for 3RR - the reverts though annoying is a side-effect of the problem that needs to be solved. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 07:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know who you are, I know what you have done before, and I certainly know that if someone likes to overexpress their nationalism, it is you.
