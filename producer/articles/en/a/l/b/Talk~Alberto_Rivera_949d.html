<p>Removed a paragraph of "Rivera's claims have never been denied or refuted by the Catholic Church", as this is demonstrably untrue. See the Catholic Answers page in the links section; in particular, note that the R.C.C. has denied Rivera's claims of having been a Catholic priest - on which many of his other claims depend.</p>
<p>The same site also lists numerous other objections to Rivera's claims. Whether these count as 'refutation' is a matter of POV, but they can certainly be seen as such; thus, claiming that Rivera's claims 'have never been refuted' is POV. As such, I've removed it. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:26, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, we shouldnt say "Rivera, a fruad from spain...". Even if Rivera himself wouldnt give others the same respect. However, it could be made quite clear that his claims can not be confirmed by any objective source whatsoever. Also, mention should be made of the fact that Chick later claims Rivera was a Bishop with the Jesuits. Of course in my opinion this has about as much credibility as the "Vatican Pornography Conspiracy", but I will try to return with facts.</p>

<p>Per the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy, I've removed the tag categorising Rivera as an "impostor"; there may be a lot of evidence for it, but this is hotly contested.

<dd>From the Cornerstone Magazine article: Alberto commands great respect from many with his alleged numerous degrees including an N.D., a D.D., a Th.D., a Ph.D., and a master's in psychology. However, he is ambiguous when asked where he received these degrees. Alberto attended a seminary in Costa Rica (the Seminario Biblio Latinamericano) with a friend from Las Palmas, but he did not graduate. That friend, Rev. Plutarco Bonilla (a respected Christian leader in Central America), said that Alberto never finished high school in Las Palmas and that he was in the seminary's program for non‑high school graduates. The school in a letter said they were forced to expel Alberto for his "continual lying and defiance of seminary authority," The known chronology of his life does not allow time for him to have achieved the academic status he claims. When Rev. Wishart pressed Alberto concerning his degrees, Alberto admitted receiving them from a diploma mill in Colorado. Kmerian 17:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a great article. I just wanted to let you know that you did a good job. When I read the section on his claims I was caught off guard for a moment thinking they were presented as fact. The writing on that section may hit the reader a bit hard, but it's not confusing for more than a second. Good page...Paul August 17, 2006</p>

<p>I removed a 'section disputed' tag from the page because no explanation of that dispute was offered here - feel free to re-add the dispute tag after explaining what the dispute is about. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 12:09, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine, I'll make a dispute: I did not know what other tag to use. But the biography seems rather unusual... At the end he turns into an angel and saves his sister, also the catholics are tortuing him... It sounds unlikely...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think you may have misunderstood that section on a couple of points.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, the first paragraph of that section says "the following account reflects Rivera's own claims rather than generally-agreed facts". Whether or not they're actually true, Rivera did *claim* those things, and that's all this section says. I don't think his own account is available online, but you can find a <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0112/0112_fourpages.asp?PG=01" class="external text" title="http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0112/0112_fourpages.asp?PG=01" rel="nofollow">comic-form adaption</a> of some of it, including the torture claims.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second... there's nothing in there about him turning into an angel. It does say he 'flew to London'... but presumably that was in a plane. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 03:22, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In absence of further comment here, I've removed the dispute tag again and reworked the article in a way that will (hopefully) make such misunderstandings less likely to recur. The previous version claimed that Rivera denounced the Catholic Church in a Costa Rican stadium in 1967; I don't have access to Rivera's original version, but the Chick adaptation says Guatemala, 1965 - I've changed it accordingly, but if somebody can find Costa Rica and 1967 in Rivera's version, please change back and perhaps note the discrepancy. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:03, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like one of Alberto's fans has valdalized one of the sections, adding this drivel after the book title (starting with 'However...')-</p>
<p>Author Gary Dale Cearley has written a book refuting these claims about the Roman Catholic Church and Islam. The book is titled <i>Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness: The Truth About the Vatican and the Birth of Islam.</i> However, its common knowledge that Roman Catholicism is indeed a mixture of Roman pagan practices and gods with Christian labels; these contradictions led to the world-wide Protestant Reformation that re-discovered the essence of the Christian early church is salvation through faith in a pardon by Jesus Christ---not by good behavior in any church. A large human organization commanding the unquestioning obedience of millions of people would have plenty of funds to hire agents to disrupt those who oppose them so the Rivera story is plausible.</p>
<p>I don't know what was originally intended for this paragraph, but it seems trashed beyond repair, my apologies to whoever got their work messed up.</p>
<p>I can't imagine this stuff fits in on Wikipedia, so I cut it. Perhaps Mr. Chick is a registered member here... Thedegu 00:10, 30 September 2006 -- Thedegu 00:13, 30 September 2006 (UTC)thedegu</p>

<p>I'm removing references to the Cornerstone refutation of Rivera because the links seem to be coming up dead. I'll see if the address as changed or whatever but this is creating a hole in the article sources and references.

<p>UPDATE: The Cornerstone site <a href="http://www.cornerstonemag.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cornerstonemag.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is still there but a search of the domain for Rivera only finds one passing reference to him. Again, this puts strain on the underlying available documentation of some of what is said in the article. A new link to the article would really be useful.

<dd>No, of course it doesn't have to be a weblink. I just like it when citations are available online so I can look at them myself. It certainly doesn't make the sources more valid by any means. But I'm also not thrilled to re-insert a reference that isn't current. I can validate the contents of the article at the Wayback Machine but it bothers me to use that as a link for the article.

<p>Someone with the IP 68.46.155.9 came in on Feb. 25 and vandalized the page, and I had to revert it back to its Feb. 20 state. This guy tore apart the whole article, basically changing the first half into 'Alberto's Story (as Told by Alberto).' The vandal even rewrote the 'Cornerstone' section in a more Alberto-leaning manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sloppy grammar, too...</li>
</ul>
<p>The vandalized sections featured stuff like: "Alberto Magno Romero Rivera (1935 - 1997) was a Jesuit priest who later defected from the Catholic Church and reported in numerous interviews and publications that the Catholic Church was "Babylon the Whore" from Revelations and that the Pope was the man name calculated to 666 in Revelations. This argument was also shared by many notable men in history such as Sir Isaac Newton and almost all protestant reformers such as Luther and Calvin as the pope's mitre does read "Vicarius Filii Dei" which adds to 666 in Roman Numerals and the Catholic church did admittedly kill 68 million people usually in torturous fashion for owning, teaching, or translating the bible. But the interesting twist to Rivera's story was that he claimed the Catholic Church had briefed him at the Vatican a much different world history than what is generally accepted, filled with the Catholic Church attempting to obtain a unified world government and church with the Pope as ruler."</p>
<p>I think you'd agree with the revert if you checked it.</p>

<p>I am not sure how well visited this page is, but having the exact grave site mentioned seems a little invasive to me. I have looked at several pages about deceased individuals and the article may say, "was buried in such-and-such cemetery" but never the exact location of the grave. Paranoid are not, it seems like the guy had some concern about the desecration of his corpse. Do we really need to promote the exact location of his final resting place so that any kook can vandalize it? 66.192.126.3 09:09, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
