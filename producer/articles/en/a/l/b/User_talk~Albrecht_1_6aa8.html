<p>Hello there! I just realice some of your recent edits to that article. I must said that the Cenepa War was a tactical draw between the two nations involved, since a full scale war was prevented by Presidents Fujimori and Mahuad. It is truth that it was a minor Ecuadorian victory, but I would said that is was much more a Tactical Peruvian victory, since the border was not changed, leaving it in the same way that was supposed to be according to the Rio Protocol. Thanks&#160;! and keep in touch <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 5 July 2005 01:02 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your interest. I've been delighted and impressed by your work on the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Pacific_ca2d.html" title="War of the Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> articles and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru-Ecuador_War_121e.html" title="Peru-Ecuador War">Peru-Ecuador War</a>, by the way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As concerns the Cenepa War, you're probably a better authority as to what exactly happened; my Spanish isn't as good as I'd like it to be, and most English sources are vague and contradictory. I have heard it said that the Peruvians did a lot better in the ground war than is commonly believed. Sites like <a href="http://www.geocities.com/peru_defensa_nacional/pages/cenepa_batalla_de_falso_tiwinza.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/peru_defensa_nacional/pages/cenepa_batalla_de_falso_tiwinza.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> claim that Peru had recovered lost territory by war's end, while <a href="http://140.247.248.241/UserFiles/6/6/Exorcising%20the%20Demons%20of%20War%20-%20Memory,%20Identity%20and%20Honor%20in%20the%20Ecuador-Peru%20Peace%20Negotiations.pdf" class="external text" title="http://140.247.248.241/UserFiles/6/6/Exorcising%20the%20Demons%20of%20War%20-%20Memory,%20Identity%20and%20Honor%20in%20the%20Ecuador-Peru%20Peace%20Negotiations.pdf" rel="nofollow">others</a>, perhaps more reliably, affirm that Peru had been unable to expel the Ecuadorians. Casualties seem to be particularly unreliable: many Peruvians apparently died out of combat, while Ecuador seems to have suffered severe infantry losses in an unrecognized assault at the end of the war. Ecuador even seems to have claimed spurious aircraft kills concerning planes that Peru had never even deployed in the region! Perhaps you could help clear up the confusion?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, the conservation of the border's historical status probably had more to do with international diplomacy than with events on the battlefield. Territorial revisionism was out of the question from the start.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a related matter, I think it would be a good idea to create a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation page</a> for "Peru-Ecuador War" that could link to the 1859, 1941, 1983, and 1995 conflicts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, do you have any information on the Leticia War of 1933? English sources are practically nonexistent.</dd>

<p>Just curious-- why the change from "killed" to "dead" in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braddock_Expedition_671e.html" title="Braddock Expedition">Braddock Expedition</a>? -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> 14:50, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My usage is consistent with professional military history publications, which, from my experience - although they use the two interchangeably to avoid repetition in narrative accounts - tend to favour "dead" to "killed" when stating casualties. If you were to open a typical Chartrand book to a random page, for instance, you'd probably run into something like: "...the British were defeated, losing more than 500 dead, with 148 wounded, against only 48 dead and 227 wounded for the Americans." (<a href="http://www.forces.gc.ca/hr/dhh/publications/engraph/Online_e.asp?cat=6" class="external text" title="http://www.forces.gc.ca/hr/dhh/publications/engraph/Online_e.asp?cat=6" rel="nofollow">Canadian Military Heritage Volume II</a>, p.113) This, of course, is only one example amongst thousands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Remember that although the directions on WikiProject Battles incidentally use "killed" instead of "dead", these were written rather arbitrarily and without being subjected to scrutiny or debate. They are also inconsistent, failing to draw a distinction between "captured" and "prisoner" when the former is clearly superior factually and grammatically - "prisoner" is a noun, people! They ought to be revised.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to <i>why</i> I've made these changes, perhaps you could ask the same of my most esteemed colleague, <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a>? I woke up one morning to find that he'd revised almost all of my battleboxes (some dozens, possibly triple-digits), changing "dead" to "killed" with impunity. I'm merely taking action to change them back, and if I revise others along the way, so much the better.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm curious about this too, since you've been changing a lot of these. The "battlebox" guidelines (which I did not write) say to use "killed", "wounded", and "captured", which seem to be consistent descriptions or action verbs. "Dead" doesn't fit this pattern. Additionally, "killed in action" or KIA is perhaps the most familiar way to describe battle fatalities. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 15:52, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unsure as I am as to what exactly you mean by "familiar", I'll point-out that the same battlebox guidelines you cite above recommend <i>not</i> to use abbreviations like "KIA". <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 18:51, July 17, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True, but not relevant, since I didn't suggest using the abbreviation.&#160;:-) I don't really care which one we use, though "killed" is probably standard usage in U.S. military histories, especially in older wars, in order to differentiate between those killed in action and the many more who died from disease. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 20:34, July 17, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a bold claim. But as you've probably guessed, I'm afraid I'm in no position to debate American military history standards. However, I seriously doubt that writing "killed" is really any clearer in the respect you offer. Disease casualties are usually mentioned separately.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you'll allow a few anecdotal statements, I will note that "dead" seemed to be pretty standard when I first began browsing these battle articles in depth about a year back. I'd also venture that those articles using "killed" tend adopt a more unencyclopaedic tone overall, while those using "KIA" and "POW" are typically childish and amateurish (note: "KIA" and related initialisms offer vital definitions in modern framed contexts, and I don't mean to suggest that all use of them is improper. However, it often seems that irregular contributors resort to - or are somehow infatuated with - military jargon purely for the false air of authenticity it can lend).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that the terminology for battlebox casualties should be limited to "dead", wounded", and "captured" (in any case, I think you'll agree that my "dead <b>or</b> wounded" is clearly preferable to the awkward "killed <b>and</b> wounded" people have begun using recently). The article's main text, of course, can describe the dead as "killed" and should note any additional deaths to illness or other non-combat-related causes. Likewise, the article can then draw distinctions between "prisoners of war", "pardoned and released", "later executed", "stripped of arms and given safe passage to neutral territory", etc., as the case may be. But troops that, as a result of the battle, are put under enemy control and rendered incapable of fighting for any duration of time should be listed in the battlebox simply as "captured". I just don't see the need to burden ourselves with the unnecessary complications some people have introduced. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 02:40, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that nothing more is needed in the battlebox other than "captured" and "wounded" for those categories. "Killed" seems to me to be consistent in form with "captured" and "wounded"; "dead", to me, sticks out as inconsistent usage alongside the other words. I don't think you've made a strong case for "dead" over "killed", but I'll go along with whatever shows up in the battlebox instructions.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 13:10, July 18, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it stretches credibility to demand any massively compelling argument of me when both words are so widely used. I've maintained that "dead" is the more common and scholarly (encyclopaedic) nomenclature for declaring casualties - but not by a huge margin. Grammatically, these words form neither a sentence nor even a list, so I'm not exactly sure where your inconsistency appears. We're not conducting an exercise in phonetic parallelism; we're highlighting casualties, and we should do so in an economic and encyclopaedic fashion. I would attach more gravity to your concern if not for the demonstrable fact that military historians don't seem terribly bothered by these "inconsistencies". <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 20:23, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is perhaps a bit of a tangent to the discussion above but it is relevant to the general discussion of "killed vs. dead". Here are some points to consider:</p>
<p>1) At the risk of stating the obvious, some soldiers are Killed in Action, others are wounded and die of their wounds later. I'm not sure how military historians count the second category. I would guess that you are only counted as dead if you die on the battlefield during the battle.</p>
<p>2) Some soldiers die of non-battle related causes, most notably disease. These losses should not be discounted but I don't know how military historians count this category. These soldiers are not Killed in Action but when you look at total troop strength, disease takes a heavy toll in wars up until and including WWI.</p>
<p>3) I assume that the strength box does not look at civilian populations. Does the casualties box consider civilian casualties? The civilian death tolls in sieges such as Stalingrad and Tenochtitlan were horrific. In a siege, the civilians are as much a part of the battle as the soldiers.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to wage a polemic here. I'm just trying to understand what the guidelines are and suggesting that they might be refined to consider the issues mentioned above. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 18:27, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello there! I just saw your change related to Pizarro's "line in the sand" quote in the History of Peru article. I just thought I would mention to you that I'm expanding Francisco Pizarro's article with a lot more details of his expeditions to South America before the fall of the Inca Empire. I'm including links to your articles of the battles of Puna and at Punta Quemada. (I would have probably been done but have been overloaded with work, school, etc.) Anyways, your latest change called my attention since I was the one who put the previous "line in the sand" quote in a different context (sort of). So now that I'll update Pizarro's article I thought I might use your new quote if you obtained it from a more authoritative source, so to speak. Maybe you can drop me a message and let me know where you obtained it from&#160;:) (I'm only doing this for the collaboration in the improvement of peruvian-related articles) --<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamax_4eb9.html" title="User:Dynamax">Dynamax</a> 18:06, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My version of the Pizarro quote came from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hickling_Prescott_8e5f.html" title="William Hickling Prescott">William Hickling Prescott</a>'s <i>History of the Conquest of Peru</i>. He tends to give a more romantic flair to his translations, although these differences are purely stylistic in nature and not affecting substance. The full quote is presented as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Drawing his sword, [Pizarro] traced a line with it on the sand from east to west. Then, turning toward the south, "Friends and comrades!" he said. "On that side are toil, hunger, nakedness, the drenching storm, desertion, and death; on this side, ease and pleasure. There lies Peru with its riches; here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian. For my part, I go to the south." So saying, he stepped across the line.</i></dd>
</dl>

<dd>I will be delighted to offer help towards the improvement of Peru-related articles â at least in the military spheres.

<dd>Thank you; although I am by no means sure that the article is in a condition to grace the main page. To answer your question, Atahualpa and his bodyguard did, in fact, observe Spanish horsemen on the eve before the battle, when Pizarro communicated his invitation (some say that the Emperor condemned several of his soldiers to death merely for flinching when the animal reared and pawed at the air above their heads; such was the discipline of the Incas). The Inca people had surely seen horses on several occasions before then. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 04:21, August 3, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nice work! The battle of Cajamarca was indeed a tremendous turning point in the history of the Inca Empire and its subsequent conquest by Pizarro's men. I can see we both obtain a lot of information from Prescott's work. I had done a similar recount of events which led to the capture of Atahualpa in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ransom_Room_87bf.html" title="The Ransom Room">The Ransom Room</a> article, although with much less emphasis in details like your new article. Now that your article has a more clear explanation of what happened before the Inca's capture, the ransom room article will need to be fixed up so as not to sound so redundant and/or have contradictory information. A link should be added to it, and maybe it can be edited to only focus on what happened after the Inca's capture? I also wanted to ask you, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pun%C3%A1_04b6.html" title="Battle of PunÃ¡">Battle of PunÃ¡</a> relates to the events in Pizarro's third and final expedition, right?

<dd>Yes, Prescott is almost universally admired for his impartiality, his accuracy, and his remarkable thoroughness built upon a lifetime of intimacy with the Spanish royal archives. For my part, I consider his prose a work of the highest elegance and literary character, although some may be bothered by its grandiloquence and archaic constructions.</dd>

<dd>These changes should not be controversialâeighty vessels seems to be the <i>lower</i> estimate of the force provided by Spain. Previous breakdown was distortive and hugely underrepresented Spanish contribution to the coalition.</dd>

<dd>The question of nationality isn't strictly limited to which port the vessels sailed from. The galleys previously listed as "<a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicilian</a>" or "<a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Neapolitan</a>" were actually built and financed by Spain (as was the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_League_%28Mediterranean%29_720f.html" title="Holy League (Mediterranean)">Holy League</a> itself, to a large extent), sailed under the Spanish flag, and would have been of marginal fighting value if not for the Spanish soldiers stationed aboard.

<p>Although it's very tempting to conclude the T90 camera was named 'the tank' after the T90 MBT, the latter's 1993 introduction makes it seem a little less likely, which is why I left it out in the first place. Perhaps the nickname developed later on, or perhaps the T90 designation was known for a while before the tank actually appeared? â<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 03:12, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assumed the nickname was acquired later on, after the tank had been introduced â surely it takes a while for a camera to earn a reputation for "ruggedness."

<p>The Spanish Empire was the <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_of_Empires_e5be.html" title="Size of Empires">third largest</a> in history, spanning 7.5 million sq. miles (19,425,000 sq. km.) in its heyday, nearly all centred in the Americas.</p>
<p>There is no reference to the size of the Empire, very useful information, and I have already proved the first statement true on the Spanish Empire talk page.

<p>Just to let you know, I will modify battle of Somosierra. According to my data, Polish charge was not suicidal and succeeded in taking all the batteries, though because the last battery was reached only by few uhlans (more accurately, cheavau.. bah, i can;t remember french word. Szwalozer in Polish&#160;:) ), defending heroical Spanish artilery man, who prefered to die rather than to abandon their positions, It was quickly recaptured by Spanish. Seeing that success, Napoleon decided to immedietely used that chance and sent another suqadrons in secnod charge, which recaptured the last battery. Also, Polish losses were nto that large. There were many wounded, and it lost many horses, but it was fully operational later.</p>
<p>It is also not known whether the Polish squadrons in first charge were supposed to take all the batteries. No written orders were preserved, and different testimonies are from Polish witnesses.</p>
<p>I will prepare more data for Monday. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 09:19, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thx for the answer. I am posting the data on talk page, before I will adopt them into the Somosierra. I see Bielecki, on which I am relying, was too fast to say "right now only extremely fast-written and careless books are repeating those old mistakes". It seems the books you quoted are from the sort.</p>
<p>1) There were 4 batteries, 3 of which 2 cannons each and 4th 10 cannons. Only first one blocked the infantry progress. Taking that by cavalry was totally within possibilities of any cavalry unit, though extremely difficult and Napoleon wasn't risking much. 2) It seems the success of the first charge (Polish squadron took all the batteries) surprise Napoleon, but he was quick to catch the chance and send reinforcements, since without them spectacular success of the first charge would be wasted. Spanish were able in the meantime to recapture fourth, the largest battery and it had to be charged again. 3) The losses were not large. For total 450 Poles taking part in both charges, 57 wounded and dead (according to Datancourt report) or 18 dead, 11 wounded according to the units registers were not that much. 3rd squadron was totally operational. 4) It must be noted that _80_ people in your descirption are those under Kozietulski, which charged and took first battery, after which they were joined by Niegolewski who returned with the rest of squadron from the recoinessance, while 57 dead and wounded came from Datancourt report and is relating to the losses of all squadrons. 5) And, finally, it was SUCCESS - taking four batteries and forcing whoel army to withdrawal (Andalusian militia flied without fight, and regular units, losing cover of the artillery withdrawed immedietely then) at the cost of 30-60 people?</p>
<p>Please take a look <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 06:15, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I invite you to comment on Somosierra talk page &#160;:-). Few notes: 1) Most accounts say about Four cannons per battery, but Bielecki seems very convincing in saying that first three cannot have four cannons. 2) French officers, who later passed by, reported only one battery - Bielecki assumed they only memorised the last battery, since two cannons from each first three ones were probably pushed away to make room 3) 80 people in first charge which took first battery seems to be standard account and 140 for total in 1st sqadron which participated. Bielecki checked unit registers and found out that 213 people were operational at the day of the charge, from which he concluded that must be number of people of participating (plus then other suqadrons). I am not sure whether he is right: 213 people operational doesn't have to mean authomatically 213 people participating in the charge. 4) Losses in dead and wounded: Datancourt wrote 57, but from unit register number is much lower (18 dead and 11 wounded or so). Bielecki found that few people who were mentioned by e.g. Niegolewski as died at Somosierra, were in fact killed weeks or even months later. Maybe Datancourt counted also those who had lesser wounds or just were missed? 5) In fact there could be said there were three charges: First one was repelled from artillery fire - squadron stopped for a moment and had to be regrouped for the second charge, and then was charge by Lubienski with 1st squadron and others.</p>
<p>Bielecki mentioned that few western authors were using Thiers and Napier, which in turn were based on French officers memories, hence their mistakes; French officers were minimising cavalry role, while Polish were trying to picture themselves as the only responsible for the success. But indeed, for me it was cooperation of cavalry and infantry: without cavalry taking first battery, infantry couldn't press the attack; without the infantry, regular Spanish forces wouldn't probably withdraw. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 09:56, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an issue that's been discussed <i>everywhere</i> over the past three monthsâincluding extensive mention on the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">administrator's noticeboard</a> and its various subpages, the <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">Village Pump</a>, the <a href="../../../m/l/_/WP%7EML_adb5.html" title="WP:ML">various mailing lists</a>, and several <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">requests for comment</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">requests for arbitration</a>âso it's a bit difficult to adequately summarize. I'll try to give a (brief) timeline of the major events involved; the pages (and their corresponding talk pages) linked below should provide an adequate sample of the rancor surrounding this:</p>
<ol>
<li>In late December, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> mentions that the creation of political categories and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">userboxes</a> for Wikipedians is somewhat undesirable. (Some background: the userboxes originally started out as a way to display knowledge of languages but were then co-opted for various other purposes, such as advertising WikiProjects, favorite bands, political parties, etc.)</li>
<li>On New Year's eve (as far as I recall), a member of the <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EARBCOM_80fd.html" title="WP:ARBCOM">Arbitration Committee</a> deletes a bunch of userboxesâprimarily political ones and those containing inappropriate images. This quickly explodes into a massive RFC (which is restarted several times as it dissolves into open name-calling).</li>
<li>In the aftermath of the above, several attempts to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_policy_on_userboxes_a196.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed policy on userboxes">form a policy</a> for appropriate userboxes are made, but generally come to nothing. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Userboxes_5529.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Userboxes">Wikipedia:WikiProject Userboxes</a> and various others fight in <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> over the deletion of multiple userboxes; the end result is that almost all userboxes are kept.</li>
<li>For about a month, userbox creation rates go through the roof, mostly courtesy of the aforementioned WikiProject.</li>
<li>Somebody creates {{User pedophile}}. The only person to use it on their userpage (a 16-year-old who had no idea what he was about to get into, as it later turned out) is blocked; the people who called for his block are blocked; and so forth. This explodes into a gigantic <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wikipedia%7EWheel_war_ce1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wheel war">wheel war</a> that finally ends when Jimbo steps in and strips a number of people of administrative rights (although some of them are reinstated following a Request for arbitration about the matter).</li>
<li>Jimbo then introduces <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD T1</a>, which allows "divisive and inflammatory" templates to be deleted without the need for further discussion. This is used by a number of administrators who delete userboxes in enormous numbers. The deleted userboxes are inevitably nominated to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Userbox_debates_fb11.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Userbox debates">deletion review</a>, which causes even more angry debate.</li>
<li>In response to this, a <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_manifesto_ced8.html" title="User:Karmafist/manifesto">number</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_manifesto_a89b.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/manifesto">of</a> <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_Statement_against_Jimbocracy_25ca.html" title="User:RevoluciÃ³n/Statement against Jimbocracy">manifestos</a> are widely circulated; these tend to range from actually debatable proposals to virulent anti-Jimbo (and anti-administrator) tirades.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserbox_policy_poll_0ca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Userbox policy poll">new proposal</a> is made and appears to garner wide consensus, but is the victim of a number of incidents of apparent vote-stacking late in the polling period. The debate over whether the results of the poll represent the community is currently ongoing.</li>
<li>Which brings us to the present.</li>
</ol>
<p>All through this, significant numbers of established contributors have left, many expressely citing the loss of civil discourse; incivility, personal attacks, and assumptions of bad faith have become almost <i>de rigueur</i> in certain circles. A number of experienced users have stated that this is Wikipedia's equivalent of the <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_September_c081.html" title="Eternal September">Eternal September</a>.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? A few comments (keep in mind that this is merely my opinion, and I could be quite wrong):</p>
<ul>
<li>For Wikipedia as a whole: While I continue to hope that things may return to some semblance of normality, I suspect that we're going to be increasingly stuck with a significant portion of the community whose goals are fundamentally at odds with Wikipedia's. This is inevitable to a certain extent as the project becomes more popular, attracting people who may not have time to acclimate properly to existing community norms; I think that we'll see more steps taken to limit the effect such people have on major decisons, though.</li>
<li>For WikiProjects in general: I think that WikiProjects, which tend to be composed of more experienced and dedicated editors, and whose smaller size allows a greater degree of esprit de corps, will become more prominent within the community. Already we're seeing many projectsâeven smaller onesâorganizing collaborations and so forth.</li>
<li>For the Military history WikiProject: Not much. We've been remarkably successful at maintaining a pleasant atmosphere within the project, which is something that I hope will continue. At the same time, our structural growthâthe task forces, the new departments, etc.âis allowing us a greater degree of self-sufficiency, so that we'll be less affected by any temporary madness that afflicts other parts of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that all of this is somewhat helpful to you (and that I haven't rambled too much). If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask! â<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">hin</a> 21:58, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
