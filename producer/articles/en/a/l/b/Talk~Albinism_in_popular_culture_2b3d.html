<p>I'm personally thinking that the section on albinism in culture is rather lacking, to say the least. There's plenty that could be written on the subject, fro mthe occoaisional heartless joke in The Simpsons to the way albinos are treated in different countries (revered in some, outcast in others). There's also the current Hollywood trend of making bad guys albino for shock value. There doesn't seem to be much by way of positive portrayal of albinos in popular culture but if any of you guys know of any then that would make a nice addition too. [--anon.]</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, the only not-entirely-negitive albino characters I can think of is the character UV from the movie Disturbing Behaviour, and Powder from the movie of the same name. And I am far from happy with Powder. There are also some characters from anime that may deserve a mention. I beleive that Rei from Neon Genesis Evangelion is supposed to be an albino. Also, the character Quatre from Gundam Wing is supposed to be of Arabian descent but is extremely pale. [--anonymous]</dd>

<dd>I agree as well, and there WAS a section about that, but someone has deleted it. This is the entry: <b>09:27, 28 December 2005 24.24.185.210 (→In the Media - Give me a break, Albino Bias?)</b> I don't know exactly why it was deleted, and I'm not sure whether to put it up again, because this could go back and forth for a while. I'd rather know why it was deleted. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyddin_Sane_97ae.html" title="User:Allyddin Sane">Allyddin Sane</a> 23:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)Allyddin Sane

<p>Why was the section about albino bias deleted? Is it NOT true that many movie villains have white or light blonde hair and pale skin? Some even are called "the albino" or "whitey"--is that NOT discrimination against people with albinism???

<dd>I agree. The bias section needs to come back, espicially because it discusses albinism in movies. The movie protrayls of albinism is almost universally negitive, from insults hurled at albino characters in Me, Myself and Irene and Wayne's World 2 to portraying them as murderous psychopaths in far too many movies to list. Most people only know of albinism through characters in movies and there is in fact tremendous anti-albinism bias.</dd>

<dd>Also the fact that most albinism suffers have vision problems that preclude driving it can make it difficult for them to find a job. While this is not discrimination against albinism par se but rather discrimination against people with poor vision, it is nontheless an extremely frustrating experience to be repeatedly turned down for jobs you are qualified for on account of it.

<p>Perhaps the readers who thought that the article was biased would care to point out what aspect of it they thought was biased? I disagree with the opinion that "albino bias" is a biased article. This dispute would be resolved by a descriptive scientific study that thoroughly searches the literature and popular media and compares the rates of positive and negative representations of albinos. In the absence of such a study, can we assume that "albino bias" is a real phenomenon? I believe that we can assume that, because it is very easy to come up with many examples of negative portrayals of albinos and very difficult to come up with more than two or three positive ones. This is the very definition of bias, and it is not a bias of recollection, it is a bias in the media. Another way to approach the question is, does albino bias need attention in an encyclopedia? Since people who are interested in albino bias use that term, and since that term has been adopted by organizations that deal with prejudice and albinism, therefore the term is a real term and deserves to be treated in the encyclopedia. Another objection could be that the article's claim that albino bias is unjustified is biased. However, in the absence of research to suggest that albinos are evil, murderous, or crazy, it would be difficult to argue that albino bias is somehow justified. In fact, there are several psychological studies that find albinos' average intelligence to be the same as that of everyone else, but, overall, the psychological research on the topic is poorly done, because of inadequate measurement and small sample sizes. Thus, we have no evidence to claim that albino bias is in any way justified. In summary, the article treats a real term that likely corresponds to a real phenomenon, and it rightly defines it as a kind of prejudice. It is difficult to find bias in this article (other than albino bias), and the people who claim they found such bias are invited to explain what they meant. —The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_170.140.251.249_d230.html" title="Special:Contributions/170.140.251.249">170.140.251.249</a> (talk) 14:56, June 7, 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p><b>Merge</b> — I'm hereby proposing a merge with the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_albino.html" title="Evil albino">evil albino</a> article, as the lists and reasons for the lists are the same -- they list albinos depicted as "evil" in movies. Much of the contents seem to be similar as well. One interesting aspect of the two articles is however that this article consider it simply an unjustified generalization and leaves it at that, while the other as possibly founded in African albinism generalizations, but also mentions that asian albinism can be a sign of beauty, and goes along with listing several heroic albinos.<br />
Since these two articles are very similar in subject, but has rather different views on the trait, I believe they should maybe be merged with an attempt at finding a good coverage of the two. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthgrove_5a5c.html" title="User:Northgrove">Northgrove</a> 22:09, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quite some time ago the "hero albino" list was merged into the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html" title="Albinism">Albinism</a> article, since it actually directly contradicts the point of the present <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_albino.html" title="Evil albino">Evil albino</a> article. But, it's back here for some reason. I propose re-merging the content of this section into the "Albinism" article so that the "Evil albino" article makes sense again and we get rid of the redundant list. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 10:47, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm about to propose a merge of one subsection of this article with another article that is more about the topic in question (though from a negative p.o.v.) I propose that the fictional characters list here be merged with the one at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_bias.html" title="Albino bias">albino bias</a> which is also being merged from <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_albino.html" title="Evil albino">evil albino</a>; both of these articles have been the targets of deletion attempts, mainly because the lists in them overlap too much (including with the one here) and no one is "policing" them, e.g. to cite sources. I'll do what I can to merge and cite them into a defensible article. It may eventually fail AfD anyway, but if so, it will be good that this list is no longer in the main <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html" title="Albinism">albinism</a> article or it too will simply come under attack. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 02:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just did an edit on the first paragraph, which started as a single phrase, then a sentence, then the whole paragraph...you know how wp is. Anyways, the catalyst was a phrase like "the evil albino villains don't actually suffer from albinism", used to say that the characters are not affected by the actual condition of albinism. After a little thinking and researching to double-check, I'd say that albinism isn't a condition to be 'suffered from'. There could be an argument in that it seems that somewhere between many and most affected persons have impaired vision, which you could then argue is something to suffer from...but it seems to take a couple leaps of logic to get there...and as far as being respectful to people who are different (as similar language precedents exist for referring to people with disabilities, etc), it really just seems like the wrong way to go. I know it was probably just dropped in while someone was putting things together, so it's just a heads up, especially if you see things like that in other articles.&#160;: ) --24.23.84.46 05:21, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm adding a weasel words tag to that section. It seems that almost everything listed is accompanied by something talking about how "some consider it a positive portrayal because of so and so" followed by "Some consider it a negative portrayal because of so and so" without citing any sources. 199.126.137.209 02:17, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a misuse of the "weasel words" template. What you are concerned about is assertions of fact about what "some people" think and a lack of citations supporting those assertions, not abusively and sneakily non-neutral language, which is what the "weasel words" template is for. If you want to be lazy&#160;:-) the template you want is "fact", not "weasel words". Better yet, just re-word the passages to get rid of the "some people"-type of phrasing without losing the information, e.g. "The portrayal could be construed as negative because... yet as postitive in that..." — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 09:47, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>In the article there are too much heroes! There are nearly the same number of evil: this fact contraddict the meaning of the article. An albino who is not a villain isn't conseguently an hero! For example, "Casper" from Me, Myself and Irene is not an hero [--anon.]</p>

<p>This article seems like it needs some cleanup. Especially in the list of evil albinos section. The article says that the traits of an evil albino are "pale skin, platinum blonde hair, blue or red eyes." I think that the person in question needs to at least have pale skin to qualify for the list. When you think of "stereotypical traits of albinism", pale skin is the most prominent. I believe the following names could be cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roy Batty - He doesn't have pale skin. Just because he has bleached hair does not mean he is immediately an evil albino.</li>
<li>Dracula - This one is hard to call. But I think it is clear that his pale skin is used not to distinguish the villain from the hero, but to establish that he is a vampire. The red eyes could also be interpreted this way. The white hair could just be an artistic choice; vampires usually have black hair, so giving him the opposite makes him seem more interesting.</li>
<li>Solomon Grundy - His hair and skin <i>are</i> white, but I think it is more likely that his creator was going for a zombie/vampire look, which makes sense if you look up the backstory for Solomon Grundy.</li>
<li>Kefka - I've never played any video games which include Kefka, but based on what little I know, it looks like he just wears face paint. If he is any stereotype, it is the "Evil Clown/Jester."</li>
<li>Ramirez - See <a href="#Sephiroth_of_Final_Fantasy_VII" title="">#Sephiroth of Final Fantasy VII</a></li>
<li>Stamper - See Roy Batty</li>
<li>Dark Bakura - See Sephiroth</li>
</ul>
<p>I think all of these could be deleted, unless someone has a good argument in favour of one of them.</p>

<p>Before I delete them as countless others have before me, is there any evidence the Malfoys can even be remotely associated with albinism? In the films they are normal (in terms of appearance), and I don't recall the books mentioning pale skin. If no one responds to his by tomorrow, I'll remove their mention. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EViceroyInterus_1662.html" title="User:ViceroyInterus">ViceroyInterus</a> 19:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Draco Malfoy's most prominent physical characteristics are his pointed nose, pale skin, and white-blond hair. There have been many mentions that he looks exactly like his dad. He also has "cold, grey eyes". In addition from the 6th book, he is described as "tall" and "thin". However, I don't believe that JKR was focusing so much on his supposed albinism as much as she was focusing on his resemblance to the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> race. JKR has compared the Malfoys to Nazis before. O well, do what you want. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragix_c9db.html" title="User:Dragix">Dragix</a> 01:57, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would Mugatu counts as an albino? In the flashback of him, he doesn't have the white hair etc hence my confusion... --MelinaNoctua 20:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jacobim Mugatu - The only stereotypical albinism trait he has is his white hair. I can recall no mention in the movie of him having albinism. It is probably supposed to be implied that he dyed his hair that colour because he thinks it is fashionable.</dd>

<p>Some names presents in the albino heroes are wrong. In the films "me, myself and Irene", "distubing behaviour" and others, albinos are presented not as evil, but there are described as stupid, crazy and they are continuosly bullied by other characters. They aren't evil, but you can find in those films a lot of prejudices about albinos, so those films don't deserves a so positive citacions.</p>

<p>About Rei Ayanami, I think that she can be considered an albino because she haven't only white hair and pale skin, but also red eyes, a tipical color of albino's eyes in movies.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Any mention of Rei - Although some artwork depicts her with paler skin, throughout the entire series she has normal skin tone. Her hair is blue. The only albino trait she has are her red eyes. I don't think this can be interpreted as a reference to albinism; in anime, the creators can make the hair/eye colour of a character whatever they feel like.

<p>Another thing that seems like it deserves cutting is the absurd example contained in the beginning of the article. Despite what the article says, the reason that Keel Lorenz is not considered an "evil albino" is because <i>nothing</i> about his character suggests that he is one. He is visually impaired because it is suggested that he is very old. He is white-haired for the same reason. So really the only thing that fits with the evil albino stereotype is his villainy. It definitely has nothing to do with the supposed albinism of Rei Ayanami or Kaworu Nagisa. Smooth Nick 01:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re: "Bill" - that bit of the film is modern manga style animation - pretty much anyone looks Asian in that style. Also, Bill is played by David "Kwai Chang Caine" Carradine. He may not BE Asian, but he certainly looks Asian enough that he got the part in "Kung Fu" over Bruce Lee. I also seem to recall the character having some significant item of jewellery (a ring?) that identified him as Bill. To be honest, I haven't seen the movie in a while either, but I'm pretty sure that that guy is meant to be Bill. He certainly didn't strike me as being an albino. Cheers. [--anon.]</dd>

<dd>Nope, he's already been removed once, and the lists intro specifically rules out this kind of character. He's emphatically not an albino; he's an asian undergoing the same fictional gene therapy process that turned his boss from an Asian guy into a European guy.

<p>I dispute the Uber-Morlock from The Time Machine. His "albinism" seems more due to the fact that he comes from a race that has evolved underground.

<dd>Well, I don't know about evil-albino's, but this Candy character is certainly an example of the stereotypical condescending asshole albino.</dd>
<dd>"These lists do not include fantastic characters whose appearances are similar to albinos, but for reasons other than actual albinism". If an underground dwelling, monkey-man from hundreds of thousands of years in the future isn't a "fantastic creature" I don't know what is. Further, albinism implies a freak/random condition that goes against the natural genetic order of a species; where as the fact that all Morlocks are white-skinned is proof-positive that this is not albinism. They are a race that has white skin due to dwelling and evolving underground. In this sense, I agree with the previous poster that compared him to an alien. Candy seems to think he actually called him an alien which is learly untrue.</dd>

<dd>Sorry. I do have short patience for people to remove sourced information from articles based on their personal opinions, especially when they've already been blocked lately for other disruptive antics.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, please stop quoting selectively. The part you left out is: 'Exceptions are characters who are broadly perceived as members of the "evil albino" category due to the distinction being lost on audiences, where this confusion can be reliably sourced,' and in this case it was reliably sourced. Because this example is borderline, I'm not reverting it, but leaving it up to wider discussion (for that matter, it might be worth discussing, in another topic, whether the "exceptions" clause just quoted should even be retained. I'm rather neutral on the matter.</dd>
<dd>On the other bits: It is my understanding that animals that have evolved to be pigmentless due to subterranean dwelling (e.g. the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_blind_salamander.html" title="Texas blind salamander">Texas blind salamander</a> among many other such animals) <i>are</i> in fact albinistic. They certainly cannot spontaneously generate pigment if you take them out of their dark environment. Bears further research and an update to the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html" title="Albinism">Albinism</a> article, so I guess I should thank you for inadvertently pointing out a way to improve that one. If I'm right, the fact that the subhuman Morlocks are all white just reinforces the point that Ueber-Morlock is an "evil albino", not an evil something-else-that-is-white-for-unknown-reasons.</dd>

Again, I don't think this is really worth arguing about and I left U.-M. out of the list, until it can be reliably sourced whether or not organisms lacking pigmentation from evolving in cave environments are albinsitic or are pale for some other reason (an important point for the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html" title="Albinism">Albinism</a> article, and more to the point pending a consensus determination here whether to "would be lost of the audience" qualifier should be retained in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_bias.html" title="Albino bias">Albino bias</a> article (if it does, which it may well be since it is sourceable, then U.-M. has to go back in, logically). — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 02:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The first creatures who exhibit such features would be considered albinos, but if the characteristic became selective and, eventually, a defining characteristic of the species, then the lack of pigmentation is no longer a "disorder". According to Stedman's Medical Dictionary, "albino" is used to describe "a person or an animal lacking normal pigmentation." It would not be "normal" for a Morlock to have pigment. At least, based on the limited scientific observation I had of this imaginary sentient creature in a movie I saw once. Very scientific. (Sorry, sometimes making these kind of arguments reminds me of how disturbingly nerdy I can be). Interestingly, using that definition, the "Albino twins" are actually albinistic since all other personified programs in the Matrix have pigment. The film claimed that they were left over from an earlier version of the Matrix. If they'd ever shown other personified programs from that earlier Matrix and if those personified programs also lacked pigment, then I would argue that they were a whole different "species" of program and should not be considered albinistic. As odd as it may seem after reading that bit of thought experiment, it does relate to the question of "would be lost on the audience." When you rigidly define terms like "albino," it really does not directly matter whether the audience misinterprets it (and we've seen plenty of that with the faulty anime examples). Those misinterpretations may reflect poorly on albinistic people (and I think should merit discussion in the article), but a person is either albinistic or is not. There was bias in the portrayal or there was not (though I readily admit that there may be situations in which the bias was a bit unintentional). I dunno, I'm sort of new here. How was this handled in discussions like "racism." If you perceive it as a racism, does that make it so? Also, I'm going to go ahead suggest that what we are really seeing is not necessarily albino bias but a larger "lack of pigment" bias of which albinism is the largest targeted subgroup.

<dd>Good food for thought, with the quibble that the "first creatures..." vs. Stedman's "lacking <i>normal</i>" (emphasis added) dichotomy is a false one, absent any evidence (not forthcoming, I'd wager my left arm) that Stedman meant "normative from the viewpoint of the species under discussion" rather than (overwhelmingly more likely) "normative from the viewpoint of biological science", which expects organisms to be pigmented unless subject to albinism, leucism or a related condition. All that said, I reiterate that this seems to be a "Wikipedia-moot" point until such time as either a) unpigmented cave-dwellers are reliably sourced as albinistic, not pallid for other reasons, or the "unless the difference would be lost on the audience" divergence is consensus-upheld. (I'm not even insisting on the latter - it was just inherited it from an older version of the article; but I lean toward supporting it very strongly, for reasons better brought up in a new topic about that issue if anyone else considers it worthy of discussion, an "if" I'm pretty skeptical about.) — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 10:41, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There are two occasions I can remember off the top of my head. The episode where everyone gets snowed in at the school, Kent Brockman commented on the storm's consequences. "Albinos: almost invisible". Then there was one of the Halloween episodes, I can't remember the number, but the story was the French had nuked Springfield and transformed the citizens into mutants. One scene showed the Winters brothers packing musical gear into a truck. Homer mows them down with his car, screaming "Die, you chalk-faced goons!" 86.1.57.92

<dd>I think it must be the second one. The first one just seems to be silly (though admittedly "Black people: Almost invisible" wouldn't go over too well if he were commenting about nighttime with a new moon.) Anyway, the first person to try adding this stuff without sources did mention Treehouse of Terror (i.e., the annual Halloween episode). So I think we're on the right track.

<dd>It is not a question of a rush rather that the lead para seriously misrepresents the article. I am not sure that merging material from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html" title="Albinism">Albinism</a> is the answer. I think that the question of societal prejudice is better dealt with in that article. This article deals with popular culture so why not keep it that way and retitle it <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism_in_popular_culture.html" title="Albinism in popular culture">Albinism in popular culture</a>; a whole load more NPOV than the present title? It also becomes the main article from the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html#In_popular_culture" title="Albinism">In popular culture</a> section.

<p>Sorry, I was unaware that the "<a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a>" issue had been debated before. Basically, my issue is with the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Joshua (played by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Busey_449b.html" title="Gary Busey">Gary Busey</a>; see also next entry), in <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Lethal_Weapon_e91d.html" title="Lethal Weapon">Lethal Weapon</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>) is a seemingly psychopathic hit man, conflictingly described as "legally blind" which could have been accurate, but shown to be an excellent marksman, which would not be. He was specifically referred to as "albino" in the film.</li>
<li>Joseph (ironically, played by <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Busey_9722.html" title="Jake Busey">Jake Busey</a>; see previous entry), in <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Contact_%28movie%29.html" title="Contact (movie)">Contact</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>) is a religious extremist turned suicide-bomber.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an example of irony, cosmic or otherwise. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmic%20irony" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmic%20irony" rel="nofollow">Per dictionary.com</a>, cosmic irony is <i>the idea that fate, destiny, or a god controls and toys with human hopes and expectations; also, the belief that the universe is so large and man is so small that the universe is indifferent to the plight of man; also called irony of fate</i>. Irony in general stems from a sharp contrast between what you or a character would expect and reality. Two related actors who each play albinos in different films is not ironic; it is simply a <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coincidence.html" title="Coincidence">coincidence</a>.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I may simply be unable to see the irony in this situation, and I would ask that SMcCandlish please explain. However, if it's simply a matter of "they're father and son, and they both played albinos once, wow," it's not irony, and I'll be removing it. I see that the reasoning back in early February was that "the odds of that happening are low," which has nothing to do with irony. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:07, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">Irony</a>: "Cosmic irony is a sharp incongruity between our expectation of an outcome and what actually occurs." There's probably a more authoritative source than that article, but I thought it would do for now. Your dictionary may well be one, and I may have to revise my assessment of what kind of irony this is. Ironically (pun intended), the broader dicdef you give is pretty much precisely that which the WP article gives for the narrower term, so the point is probably moot for purposes of this discussion, since our article here doesn't specify what kind of irony it is.</dd>
<dd>The Buseys' case is irony (whether cosmic or otherwise) because our expectation of the outcome, namely what sorts of narrowly-defined roles two related actors, who are not albinistic (and don't even look vaguely albinistic the way some Nordic people do - the Buseys simply happen to blonde, which is a very common trait among Anglos) would be cast to play, is in sharp incongruity with what actually occurred (they were both cast as evil albinos, which even the stereotype's critics say has only been a role in a move 68 times in the last 40+ years, and psychotic evil albinos at that, compared with more broadly-defined roles like "sericomic action hero", "underdog" or "femme fatale"). It would be like casting <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanne_Woodward_0efb.html" title="Joanne Woodward">Joanne Woodward</a> as a woman from a former Mafia family who is accused of a murder she didn't commit (cf. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Newman_7c26.html" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> and <i><a href="../../../a/b/s/Absence_of_Malice_f30e.html" title="Absence of Malice">Absence of Malice</a></i> if the references aren't clear).</dd>
<dd>Also, I'm not sure why you think it is a coincidence. For it to be a coincidence, it would have to a fact that the casting director(s) who cast Jake had never seen (or had totally forgotten) Gary's role, and/or that knowledge of it in no way affected their casting choice of Jake, both of which are highly unlikely given the high profile of both <i>Lethal Weapon</i> and Gary Busey. The fact that Gary Busey and Dar Williams were both cast as evil albinos yet neither are albinistic is coincidence, and not irony - there is no conceivable connection at all between the two events. So, I think it is simply the case that you are or have been unable to see the irony, not that there is no irony. &#160;:-) <s>PS: They are father (G.) and son (J.), not brothers.</s> I see you noticed that already (edit conflict).</dd>

<dd>PS: I think a quick look at <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html#Usage_controversy" title="Irony">Irony#Usage controversy</a> may be helpful here. It seems to me that you are using the classical sense of the word, which really only relates to fiction - situations with two "audiences" that have different understandings of a situation, such as the characters and the actual audience, or two characters with different levels of awareness. I'm not. I'm using it in one of the non-literary senses, such as that provided in these examples at <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html#Usage_controversy" title="Irony">Irony#Usage controversy</a>:
<ul>
<li>Ironically, Sir Arthur Sullivan is remembered for the comic operas he found embarrassing, rather than the serious works he hoped would be his legacy.</li>
<li>Adolph Coors III was the former heir to the Coors beer empire. Ironically, Coors was allergic to beer.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The section goes on to say "The American Heritage Dictionary recognizes a secondary meaning for irony: 'incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs.' This sense, however, is not synonymous with "incongruous" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony." This is basically what I'm getting at, and I believe it to be an extremely widespread and well-understood usage of the word "irony".</dd>

<dd>PPS: The point of mentioning it at all in the article is that the stereotype is ingrained enough that familial typecasting appears to be happening. If there's some other way of getting this across... — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 18:06, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, you seem have come at this from two angles: that it's an incredibly unlikely thing, and that it's a fairly logical thing. I'll discuss them both separately.</dd>
<dd>First, you've said that it's incredibly unlikely that two related actors be cast in similar roles. That's not irony. Cosmic irony is not simply "The odds of this are low." It's "It's so unlikely that these things would happen, and yet so appropriate, that the gods must be playing with us."</dd>
<dd>Second, you've said that it's frankly logical that they be cast in similar roles: the casting director probably said "Gary Busey was such a good evil albino, I think I'll see if his son is interested in playing a similar part." A logical progression of events in a way you'd expect is, I think, the opposite of irony.</dd>
<dd>I'm not insisting on a classical literary "double audience" here. I'm just insisting that, beyond mere unlikelihood, there has to be an extra element of "that's so appropriate/inappropriate!" In the Coors example above, it's not just an unlikely coincidence that Adolph Coors III was allergic to beer, there's also a surprising incongruity there: you would <i>expect</i> the heir to a beer empire to drink beer. There is no such element to the Busey case.</dd>
<dd>In reference to familial typecasting, smells a little bit <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:ORy</a> to me. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 18:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Stating blatantly that familial typecasting is happening, without a source, would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but suggesting that it is a possibility because the possibility is plainly deducible from the facts with basic logic is not OR, and that's why the suggestion was implied rather than stated as a fact. There is no prohibition on using words like "maybe", "might", "could" or "possibly" in WP articles, after all (though their use is necessarily restricted in a lot of ways by <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, various clauses in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, etc.)</dd>
<dd>I have not posited that the casting choice was logical, only that it was not just some random coincidence, like it raining on Tue. both this week and next week (which would not be ironic). The fact that it makes sense in a (more emotional, not logical) way plays directly into your quasi-definition that it would be ironic if both a) the odds were low and yet b) it were strangely appropriate. I think the casting choice was in another sense (primarily a marketing one) not logical, in that it's a bit over-the-top and blatant. But it doesn't make it inappropriate on the ironic level. (Had I been the casting director, I would have thought, "Heh, that's a cute idea - it would be pretty ironic - but, um, <i>no</i>. Why don't we look for someone who's actually albinistic. Or at very least isn't related to another 'evil albino' actor, because there ain't no Oscar for 'Most Whimsical Casting' after all".) Lastly the "gods must be playing with us" aspect only applies to cosmic irony as defined in your dictionary, which I've already said wasn't the definition I was using; I'm instead using the broader definition of irony that you provided yourself, which did not include that element. I.e., the case seems to be precisely an instance of "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs", per the <i>AHD</i>.</dd>

<dd>This is incorrect:
<dl>
<dd><i>suggesting that it is a possibility because the possibility is plainly deducible from the facts with basic logic is not OR, and that's why the suggestion was implied rather than stated as a fact. There is no prohibition on using words like "maybe", "might", "could" or "possibly" in WP articles, after all (though their use is necessarily restricted in a lot of ways by <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, various clauses in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, etc.)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You absolutely, positively must have a source. You cannot make logical, qualified deductions and insert them into an article. That is the essence of what original research is.</dd>
<dd>The "gods must be playing with us" aspect does not only apply to cosmic irony as defined at dictionary.com. I phrased it in a very classical, literary way, but it's totally necessary. If you'd like to cite a different kind of irony, maybe we can discuss it, but "cosmic irony" means that weird unconnected occurences came together in an inexplicable way and the result was both unexpected and highly appropriate. That contradicts what you're arguing: that a casting director thought Jake might be as good as his father at the evil albino role.</dd>
<dd>Above and beyond any irony issue, if you're making edits based on the assumption that a casting director cast Jake because of Gary, you need to have a source, or it's original research. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 18:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Strongly disagree on your interpretation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (and/or my edits in relation to it) here. Perfectly logical deductions can be made without doing OR. For example, at the article on a pool player who won the WPA Men's World Nine-ball Championship it is a perfectly fine deduction to say in the article that so-and-so is a professional pool player, because the event is closed to amateurs. Secondly, there is no general prohibition on suggesting possibilities. Neither of these constitute "introduction of a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea" or putting forth an unreferenced argument or "analysis, synthesis, explanation, or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments" (though <i>asserting</i> a typecasting trend would be, and asserting a theory that was why both Buseys landed such roles would be - please note that I do not assert any such theory in the article or here, only the logically deducible possibility, which is permitted under WP:OR, as explained below), nor is either example a neologism or novel definition. That's all WP:OR covers. Both the pro player case and suggesting a possibility in the Busey instance constitutes making "straightforward ... logical deductions based on fully attributed data that neither change the significance of the data nor require additional assumptions beyond what is in the source." In both cases the datapoints are sourced (player won, and the tournament is pros-only; Both Buseys were cast in these roles in these films, and the roles are as characterized here), no additional assumptions are required (a pro is a pro, and there's no evidence of WPA making exceptions, or the player falsifying credentials, etc.; the possibility, not assertion of fact, implied by the irony is self-evident), and the significance of the data are not reinterpreted (doesn't change anything about him winning or about the nature of the tournament; doesn't change anything about the fact that both Buseys were in such roles, or the nature of the films or the actors or the roles).</dd>
<dd>To be clear on the "gods" point, I am saying that I am <i>not</i> citing cosmic irony as defined by your source, but irony in general as defined by the <i>AHD</i> and by your own broader definition (which the WP article on irony also used as the defintion of "cosmic irony", possibly incorrectly.) I.e., I have already "cited a different kind of irony".</dd>
<dd>I'm not making edits based on any assumption about a casting director's reasoning; that was only mentioned in talk:space as a look at probabilities, to argue against your assumption that it was mere coincidence. You seem to be commingling our discussion with the text of the article.</dd>

<dd>No, you're incorrect. They're not the same at all. Stating that a participant in a professionals-only event is a professional is logical and requires no assumptions. Stating that Jake was cast into a role because his father was in a similar role requires an assumption and is original research. I realize that you did not state this in the article, but you've said that it's ironic <i>because</i> of the above assumption, and so stating that it's ironic in the article is original research.</dd>
<dd>The casting of Jake and Gary is not out of place, inappropriate, or inconsistent, which is what "incongruous" means, so it's not ironic per AHD's defintion. I'm not sure why you're so insistent on this point; you're stretching the definition of "ironic" to the point where it's meaningless in order to force it onto the article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, you seem to be commingling our discussion with the text of the article, which does not stating that Jake was cast into a role because his father was in a similar role. My rambling discussion with you on this talk page has suggested that possibility (even probability), nothing more. I haven't stated that the irony is <i>because</i> casting people chose Jake due to his father's similar role, only that it's ironic because they were cast in a similar role and are father and son. The fact <i>suggests</i> a purposeful "cute" casting choice, but the article doesn't say that, and it's not a particularly important point off-article anyway, was just a possibility/probability against your "coincidence" assertion. That is, the irony mentioned in the article doesn't <i>depend</i> on such cutesy casting decisions which are only a likelihood in the background that militates against the assumption of non-ironic blind coincidence. Also, you've misread the "incongruous" bit - the incongruity (as per the <i>AHD</i> definition) is that between the <i>expectation and the reality</i>, not between two aspects of the reality. And, the "no, you're incorrect" bit is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>, because I did not liken the pro pool player situation <i>to</i> the Buseys situation, I simply pointed out that neither of them are OR; i.e. they are two examples of two different things that are not OR. The sports example is akin to simply pointing out an irony, without commenting further on it. The suggesting a possibility example was simply an example, since the article isn't actually doing this in the first place, but could. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(outdent) Rather than continue to debate this stuff at further length, I'll try a compromise edit, which will satisfy me that the irony will be apparent (most WP readers are pretty smart after all), without actually stating that it is an irony.

<dd>The compromise solution satisfies me completely. Whether or not I feel like it's <i>ironic</i>, it's definitely <i>interesting</i> and deserves mention. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to mischaracterize your arguments or build a straw man. I'll try to explain where I was coming from. I feel like if you want the article to mention the irony of the situation, you should explain why it's ironic with the facts available and no other assumptions or theories about what may or may not have happened behind the scenes. I feel like any explanation that relies on unsourced theories, however logical, can't be used to prove your point, and that's why I latched onto them so hard. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess my counterpoint would be boiled down to "the irony wasn't explained in the article and didn't need to be, so what my personal theory is for why it's ironic isn't really of any consequence"; the reader was left to draw their own conclusions completely (and still are, just more so).

<dd>Understandable. I may have been overzealous in my edits, so I'm perfectly happy to discuss any of them. Are there any particular changes that I made that strike you as problematic enough that you think the material should be back the way it was? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 20:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. But I have a big headache right now, over lots of tooth gnashing at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSNUM_3545.html" title="WP:MOSNUM">WP:MOSNUM</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, so I don't want to to get into it right this moment. I think I am in agreement with you that this stuff needs to be very well sourced or the entire article will be questionable and subject to AfD. I think that some of your source verification determinations are a bit too personal POV and are thus OR themselves, as novel interpretations of the source material, but those points might be debatable. I would rather see the lot restored and tagged with the appropriate inline templates, but well, article histories exist for a reason, so it's perhaps not a huge deal either way. Really, I'm more interetested in the larger question of whether the couple of cited websites - pretty much the only sources in the world on this topic - can be considered reliable enough sources for the purposes of WP. If not, this entire article has to be deleted. If they are reliable enough then we needn't nipick whether one particular entry is too POV or not, since it isn't WP making the assessment, we are simply quoting it from an external source. It would be really cool if some body of scientists had published a piece in <i>Nature</i> about albino bias, but it hasn't happened. Albinistic people are rare enough in the population that the issue doesn't attract enough critical mass to generate the press and studies we'd like, so we are left with sources that are necessarily biased. I think I for one have tried pretty hard to ensure that counter opininons (e.g. the movie studios saying that the Matrix twins were not intended to represent "evil albinos") get represented as well. I <i>believe</i> I'm doing a good job at this, but if I'm failing at that, let's discuss how to improve the wording. Like you, I'm here to write an encyclopedia, not put forth personal opinions. NB: I am tacitly arguing that the sites <i>are</i> reliable enough to be cited, though noting that they have an editorial slant, since both clearly pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - they've both been cited numerous times by major media sources, and at least Vail's has been relied upon heavily by NOAH, which is the largest organization of its kind, and well-established. To me it is a lot like citing Rush Limbaugh or Stephen Colbert. Doing so is permissible, but it isn't the same thing as citing <i>Nature</i> or the <i>Princeton Law Review</i>. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No worries, there's no rush. I freely admit that I personally feel that Dr. Reese has an agenda and is clearly reaching with some of these "accusations". The fact that there's not really a lot of published counterpoint makes me uneasy because it's obvious (to me) that he's playing fast and loose with what's a reasonable deduction and what's a leap of faith. With "fringe science", for example, we can cite authority after authority who will gladly say "this guy is full of shit", but as you well note... with albinism it seems that there's a dearth of available material. The fact of the matter is, the article comes off rather one-sided and it makes me worried. The concern I have is that we're relying so heavily on ONE source of information and we are presenting it not just as the opinion of one man (which is, honestly, what it is... regardless of how many news organizations lend him credence via reference) but as rigorously researched "fact". I, like you, would like to see a balanced article, but I don't know that I agree quite so readily as you that Dr. Reese's theories should stand as unchallenged reliable sources. Regardless, it'll all come out in the wash, I suppose... I bet that we'll have a much better article by May or so.&#160;:) With respect to the edits that you say come from my personal POV, I'm guessing you're talking about my removal of the reference to Reese's contentions regarding the connection between albinism and other disease. I grant that the essay we're citing makes such an assertion, but really... it's so blatantly falsifiable that it's frankly laughable. I would be comfortable with including it if we used a format like "Dr. Reese asserts that this fits a pattern of showing albinos as diseased", but not if we state it as a fact, cite or no. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 21:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I understand your desire to avoid negative associations, but I think the link was appropriate. After all, we have Satan linked from the End of Days entry, why not from the Passion entry? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 17:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because that makes it a redundant wikilink, on top of an unhelpful one. I didn't much care for the original link under EoD, but we certainly don't need two. Doesn't have anything to do with "negative associations", just usability. People are overwikilinking like gangbusters these days, but the MoS is pretty clear that if the link will not take a reader to something that significantly adds context it shouldn't be in there. Another "Satan" link doesn't help the reader in any way and will just lead them down a rathole, especially in this case, because there isn't anything in particular <i>about that movie character</i> at the Satan article. It's a lot like linking "United States" or "1989" at every occurrence. The MoS advises against this; context-free wikilinking just makes prose harder to read without serving the reader anything useful in exchange. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 18:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough... given that, shouldn't the initial mention be linked then? I would argue either link the Satan from the Passion entry and de-link the one from End of Days or else put the Passion entry further down the list. I don't much care which. Come to think of it, whichever entry ends up wikilinked, what about linking to <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan_in_popular_culture.html" title="Satan in popular culture">Satan in popular culture</a> rather than <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>?

<dd>Works for me. I'd prefer to link to the one in EoD because the context make is more clear that the link is going to an article about Satan <i>per se</i> rather than one about a particular movie character.

<p>They're sort of placed willy-nilly as it stands, with no real rhyme or reason (at least as far as I can tell) to the ordering. I would suggest that we choose a scheme and try to stick with it. I'm inclined to suggest time as a good metric by which to measure. Earlier portrayals should go higher on the list than more recent ones. I'll go ahead and attack it if I get someone to agree with me...

<dd>Yeah, that generally works for me; the list has been very willy-nilly. Please do note that there is (or was? the deletions arent' all firmly in my mind yet) a three-way tie-in when it comes to the Buseys, and to <i>Lethal Weapon</i> which is referenced in an entry just following Gary and Jake's lines. There's a fair amoun of "flow" there that I wouldn't want to see lost. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 21:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm... well, as far as "flow" is concerned, I'm guessing that the best way to deal with that would be narrative (as opposed to list format) text in each section that deals with any potential tie-ins that arise. I did delete the Jake Busey entry because there wasn't any real evidence that the character was albino and there was also no reference that the public "at large" was confusing the character for an albino (which seems to be one of the criteria we have for inclusion on the list)... I'm certainly not opposed to mentioning in the narrative portion however, that Dr. Reese asserts that there's a "connection" of some sort between dad's role in Lethal Weapon and son's role in Contact... but based on current standards, I don't see that we can include Jake on the list. I'm perfectly willing to be swayed of course, and feel free to add him back in while we discuss it here.&#160;:) It's just that I did a bit of research before deleting Jake and the only references I can find are the Skinema article (which is unsupported assertion) and a couple of isolated references to the character as an albino... but isolated references do not "public perception" make. Also, there are a few hits that attempt to point out that blond hair doesn't make Busey an albino in Contact. On a totally separate note, I did find a link that may be of use to the article. At least, it gives us something to reference other than Reese's material. <a href="http://nymag.com/movies/features/16997/" class="external text" title="http://nymag.com/movies/features/16997/" rel="nofollow">New York Magazine</a> talking about albino villains in film. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 22:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If I didn't already I think I will restore the other Busey entry for now, as Reese's material constitutes a non-Wikipedia "synthesis" under <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>\<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and no one has shown that Reese is broadly an <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unreliable source</a>.
