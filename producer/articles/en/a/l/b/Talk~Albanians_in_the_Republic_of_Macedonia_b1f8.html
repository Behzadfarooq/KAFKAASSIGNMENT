<p>The reason I've moved this article is because it has no mention to the Albanians living in the Greek part of Macedonia, and focuses exclusively in what has happend in the FYROM. I've edited it to disambiguate between <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Republic_of_Macedonia_2192.html" title="Socialist Republic of Macedonia">Socialist Republic of Macedonia</a> and <a href="../../../f/y/r/FYROM_4615.html" title="FYROM">FYROM</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a>, "Macedonian" proselytizing (sic) and actions taken by the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Orthodox_Church_8c91.html" title="Macedonian Orthodox Church">Macedonian Orthodox Church</a> etc. If you have any doubt about what these mean you should probably read the corresponding articles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, besides the article's technical inefficiencies that can be fixed in relatively short time, I have several doubts about the article's neutrality and its accuracy, regarding if the revoked rights of the Albanian minority were effectively granded by the local or the federal constitution of Yugoslavia etc. <a href="../../../e/t/z/User%7EEtz_Haim_186d.html" title="User:Etz Haim">Etz Haim</a> 14:25, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgars.html" title="Bulgars">Bulgars</a> as a minority because this is a nation that has disapeared more than 1000 years ago. I don't know what the author has in mind here, may be <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarians.html" title="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a>? Recently there are some organisations to protect the rights of the Bulgarians in Rep. of Macedonia but in my opinion it is better not to list Bulgarians as a minority in Rep. of Macedonia. Some of the Macedonians consider themselves Bulgarians while others do not. However all of them consider themselves Macedonians (the question is only whether this is a separate nation or not). Hence it is not possible to talk for Bulgarian minority in Rep. of Macedonia. (!!!! BUlgarians should be there!!!!! In a democratic country as Macedonia even if one person declares as Bulgarian he shall have the right so. Actually the population in Macedonai should be called as follows Macedonian Slavs, Macedonian Albanian, Macedonian Turks, Macedonian Roma, Macedonian Serbs, Macedonian Bulgarians) Freestylefrappe: I removed the no longer relevant conversation regarding neutrality and I have no problem with removing Bulgars. I dont see why this article needs to be cleaned up though...does anyone have any specific complaints concerning the viability or quality of this article? Would anyone be willing to write a Bulgarian or Slavic Macedonian outlook on the ethnicity of FYROM?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, Freestylefrappe! I think the article needs a better explanation about this: "The three most debilitating circumstances for Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia currently are lack of rights under the constitution, harsh taxes, /.../ alleged harassment and racism organized by the state."
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>What changes the constittution needs</li>
<li>What about the taxes - are they different for Macedoninas and Albanians (probably not)</li>
<li>I don't understand what this "harassment and racism organised by the state" is for.</li>

<p>Thanks! My comments to some parts of the text follow:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1 Albanians of the Republic of Macedonia ... do not speak Macedonian&#160;</dt>
<dd>I think it is better to replace this text by one of the following: 1) Albanians ... do not have Macedonian as their mother tongue. 2) Albanians ... do not have Macedonian as their mother tongue and some of them do not even understand Macedonian.</dd>
<dt>2 the Macedonian majority under the new constitution dominates the army, police, judiciary system, economy and the government. ... difficulty in obtaining jobs and licenses due to bias in government regulation&#160;</dt>
<dd>Ofcourse this text can stay as is but it would be nice if you provide us with information which parts of the constitution and the governmental regulation the Albanians in Rep. Macedonia object.</dd>
<dt>3 Under the current law of Macedonia any Albanian candidate trying to become a member of the parliament must receive 3 times as many votes cast in his favor as a Slavic Macedonian candidate in order to win an election&#160;</dt>
<dd>Why? More comments would be nice here.</dd>
<dt>4 Although Albanians comprise around 40% of population of the Republic&#160;</dt>
<dd>Probably 20% instead of 40% (The official census shows albanians to compromise 25.17% of the population. Whatsoever this number is not that much realistic. over 30% would be much more realistic. Over 33% of the students in elementary schools, high school and university are albanian. This is a great fact!!</dd>
<dt>5 Albanians and other ethnic minorities suffer from restrictions in voting, education, employment, defense, housing conditions&#160;</dt>
<dd>I think that "voting" should be removed from this list.</dd>

<p>Guys, the article as it is now (9 July 2005) contains a discrepancy. The beginning says: “Albanians are the second largest population group in the Republic of Macedonia and comprise 20 percent of the population” And later on it says: “Although Albanians comprise around 40% of population of the Republic of Macedonia” I know this (as any related) issue will be sensitive, but as a mathematician I can say 20&lt;&gt;40 (or shall we have debates about this too?) Can you not take an official statistic from the Bureau of Statistics? Finally, not sure when and where “the referendum for independence happened”… I lived in Macedonia at the time, and did not witness nor hear about it. Can whoever wrote that provide some evidence to the contrary – e.g. publications from that time. Otherwise, I would suggest to remove the reference as it seems like fiction, not a fact. [IG, 9 July 2005, 2:30 GMT]</p>
<dl>
<dd>Almost all of the information on this page was derived from the UNPO website. Any discrepancies in this article were caused by edits made based on outside knowledge, or depending on who you ask. The Albanian minority claims 40%, the Slavs claim they makeup only 20%. In regards to you never hearing about the referendum...if you're not Albanian you probably wouldnt have heard. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> July 9, 2005 05:36 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The history part should be modified, as it presents incorrect information. 450 000 moved to Turkey?! This part is obviously what the Albanians believe is the truth, maybe the title should be changed to 'Albanian View'</p>

<p>I cannot find the information about ethnic composition of the municipalities of Macedonia. Does somebody have some information about this?

<dd>The western half of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> is primarily <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albanian</a> and the northern half <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a>.

<p>I think that whole article is an Albanian POV inclined, but that'd be understandable, considering the fact that I am a Macedonian. I have asked <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> to do joint look and revision (if needed) of this and the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_NLA_c8bc.html" title="Macedonian NLA">Macedonian NLA</a> (a bit inclining to the Macedonian POV, perhaps?) article, but apparently, he has withdrawn from the English Wikipedia, and he has no intentions to get back. I believe that he got scared of all the nationalism that is all present here on this Wikipedia. There are some factual inaccuracies in the text that need correcting, like for example that the Albanian High education is considered illegal - this is not true, since the state <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universiteti_i_Tetov%C3%ABs_7223.html" title="Universiteti i Tetovës">University of Tetovo</a> is perfectly legal for almost 2 years, and there was the the private <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_European_University_11d1.html" title="South East European University">South East European University</a> that has offered higher education in Albanian a couple years before. Also, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandar_Rankovi%C4%87_a13a.html" title="Aleksandar Ranković">Aleksandar_Ranković</a> was a cruel Minister of Interior Affairs of Yugoslavia as a whole. He was a Serbian, not a Macedonian. And where is the info about the 2001 Macedonian War crisis, the Framework Agreement, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Ahmeti_2a10.html" title="Ali Ahmeti">Ali Ahmeti</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Union_for_Integration_0dfd.html" title="Democratic Union for Integration">Democratic Union for Integration</a>?</p>
<p>However, at this time, I have no time to engage in this article much, I'll only change the numbers of the ethnic group according to the new census (the Albanians, <i>officially</i> constitute a larger minority).

<dd>Mainly this article is in need of updating and disambiguation. I just hope this isn't the disambiguation Ninio, Miskin, and Theathenae have been implementing.

<dd>Did I ever assert that it is irrelevant?&#160;:-) It is a POV, that might be true, or might not be, but it should be implemented! But how can we find what exactly is their perceived percentage? That is why, we should attract some Albanians to this discussion.

<p>Some of this numbers are just hilarious! There were 162524 Albanians in Macedonia according 1953 census. And yet 450,000 were deported in the 1950s and 1960s! How is this possible. Additionally “Tens of thousands were tortured and an all out genocide of Albanians took place in well-populated cities like Shkup (Skopje) and Monastir (Bitola).” So I guess this means every male Albanian over thirthy? Give me a break, this sounds like the Bulgarian claim that 100,000+ of Bulgarians were tortured in Macedonia because of their Bulgarian conscience. One can ask himself if there are any Macedonian living there. --<a href="../../../c/i/g/User%7ECigor_f0eb.html" title="User:Cigor">Cigor</a> 02:19, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find the double standards glaring here. They use the number of people voting for Albanian parties to determine the size of the Albanian minority in FYROM, but they reject using the number of people voting for Macedonian Slav political parties in Greece (and probably in Bulgaria) to determine the size of the Macedonian Slav minority. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 17:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your point. The truth is that the strength of an ethnicity can't be used basing oneself on the power of minorities parties, as there is always some spillover; it can't be said if all the voters are Albanians (Torbesh and Turks may vote, on the ground of common religion): and Albanians can vote for mainstream parties, and also non voters may be major or minor, and minors in the ethnicity also.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 17:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The big difference is that in Bulgaria and Greece, Macedonians are not recognized as a separate ethnicity. Also I don't understand why there are numbers ranging from 20 to 40%, but election results that undoubtedly add extra information, should be deleted?

<dd>I think the election results are unreliable on the grounds that a) there is little or no evidence that most Albanians vote along ethnic lines (i.e. that spillovers are small) and b) as Albanians are largely Muslims, they are like Roman Catholics and have large families, many Albanians are too young to vote, and c) many Albanians may chose not to vote. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 18:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe so, but if there are claims that state they are almost double from official (internationally monitored) censuses, I think for the sake of neutrality, we should have all views/relevant facts represented.

<p>Hi Aldux, you make accusations of a subjective natute as "not hard work" e.t.c. Lack of satisfactory sources is not unusual unfortunately in quite a lot of the work contributed in Balkan related articles. Excluding no one, not even you. Seems like using double-standards. Anyway you are propably right in making reverts but do try to keep an open mind while doing it, you drive people away of these articles. I dont think this is your objective (<a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaas_K._D._f487.html" title="User:Haas K. D.">Haas K. D.</a> 01:30, 21 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

Instead of refuting the insertions, he reverts to a version that is purely subjective and one-sided, it is so evident for someone who has lived for years in the region. Most of the things I instert come from primary sources. e.g. everyone knows, the government buldosed on several occasions the self financed university of Tetovo, there are thousands of weetnesses and the videos of the actions perpetrated by the goverment are stored on many archives. If one ask the BBC for a copy (of course you have to pay for it) they would supply you with one.</p>
<p>Most of the sources that try to minimize or totally erase the problems that the Albanians have had and are continuing to have, come from secondary and biased sources.</p>
<p>Having said all the above it is indeed sarcastic for <small>[removed personal attack. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 21:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)]</small> (aldux) to claim that he is blindly rv to a version that is “better”…!!</p>
<p>I hope there is a higher authority here to minimize the damage caused by chauvinists and corrective measures need to be taken. If this is not possible, this article then should be removed from the public.</p>

<p>Panonian,</p>
<p>You claim that your map is according ot the census of 1981.</p>
<p>If one sees the map one would automatically see that it is a pure fabrication. Even if the census of 1981 is a fabrication itself, in this census there are many areas in macedonia that have a mixture of albanians and macedonians. In your map, even Skopje is not mixed!!!

<dd>Well the way I read the map, "mixed" means that there is no ethnic group that constitutes majority (i.e. &gt;50%).

<p>give me a break!!! if we even use you scientific and extremely objective way of exposing the data, the region of Debar should also be in pink as according to the census 70% were Albanian!

Look man, I am not trying to suppress you or anything like that, but your edits does not make any sense. For example you are claiming “this number is largely affected by the fact that on average the ratio of the number of voters required to elect an Albanian is one to three vis-à-vis the Macedonians”. Firstly, this is not true, second it still doesn’t explain the Albanian proportion of total votes (not parliament members). Second, “The Albanians who have the Macedonian citizenship, but, who work in other countries are not allowed to vote (and be included in the census) in case they have not been to Macedonia for a period of 12 months; this regulation does not apply to the Macedonians, even if it did it would not alter the balance by much, as the vast majority of the citizens who work abroad are Albanian.” Again this is not true. I live in USA and still can’t vote in the elections from here. I must be an Albanian.</p>
<p>“according to Albanians, these statistics are not reliable as the number of Albanians, as well as that of other minorities, was always undercounted. Additionally, Albanians were unable to contest them due to repression from the authorities”.</p>
<p>Well what about the statistics in Kingdom of Yugoslavia? There were 440,000 Albanians in the entire country in 1921 as opposed to ~3 milions now (Kosovo, Macedonia,Serbia and Montenegro). If that is also unreliable do you want me to pull up Ottoman statistics?</p>
<p>“Albanian families were prohibited from having more than two children (Milosavlevski and Tomovski, 1997:205, and Politika ekspres 10-6-1986). Ironically, these measures stimulated the Albanians to have more children and select Albanian names for their children.” Politika ekspres as a source? And what is the name of Milosavlevski reference? So let’s see there was a law to limit Albanian families which caused even bigger growth?! So which is it, the law was never there or it was never implemented?</p>
<p>“In the late 1980s when the autonomy of the province of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> was revoked, and the repression of the Albanian population significantly increased, these developments also took place in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The Albanian language was removed from public sight, Albanian families were prohibited from naming their children with Albanian names…” Crap after crap. I happened to attend high school in the late 1980s and the building was actually two high schools – one shift was an Albanian high school (Zefljus Marko), other shift was Macedonian one (Nikola Karev).</p>
<p>Tell me something ,Objectivee have you even lived ever in Macedonia? Because judging your edits you have clearly not. Stay healthy, I sincerely mean it. --<a href="../../../c/i/g/User%7ECigor_f0eb.html" title="User:Cigor">Cigor</a> 19:38, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Additionally, regarding the alleged suppression of Albanians during the 1990s, how do you reconcile the fact that Albanian parties were part of the Government (ruling coalition) every single time, even though it was not always required for the winning party to make alliance with them (to get majority in the parliament). Tell me, which country in the Balkan has better treatment of Albanians than Macedonia?

If that is also unreliable do you want me to pull up Ottoman statistics?" the government actualy reported 600,000 the number of albanians in yugoslavija, that was more or less the last verdict prior the break up; there was no official report that said there are 3 million albs in jugoslavija. a propos if you check the official reportings, the usual phrase would be "u smislu".</p>
<p>"Albanian families were prohibited from having more than two children (Milosavlevski and Tomovski, 1997:205, and Politika ekspres 10-6-1986). " I did not add this, but, I know that I was born as a result of the goverment trying to impose on the albanians not to have babies. I am a living example&#160;:) The gov advised the albs not to have babies, and they entered a very delicate field: you dont tell to an albanian man how many babies he should have because his mentality will force him to have a few more babies as a result. as for the source, you go find it is out there, follow the reference.</p>

<p>"“In the late 1980s when the autonomy of the province of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> was revoked, and the repression of the Albanian population significantly increased, these developments also took place in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia.

This is not my injection to the article, but, as for the naming of the children is concerned, I am willing to remove this as I dont think it is correct.</p>
<p>Nobody denies the fact that there were schools in albanian (which were actually very scarce, and in certain zones). the phrase refers to other important sectors, like the university level education, use of albanian at work, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, a <a href="http://www.publicinterestregistry.org/Search/WhoIsSearchResults.aspx?txtWhoIsSearch=macedoniansinalbania" class="external text" title="http://www.publicinterestregistry.org/Search/WhoIsSearchResults.aspx?txtWhoIsSearch=macedoniansinalbania" rel="nofollow">whois</a> check, reveals that this domain is owned by the president of the so-called <a href="http://www.mhrmi.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.mhrmi.org/" rel="nofollow">Macedonian Human Rights Movement International</a>, who lives in Toronto, Canada (not Albania) and who also owns <a href="http://www.makedonija.info/" class="external text" title="http://www.makedonija.info/" rel="nofollow">this</a> propagandistic site (<a href="http://www.afilias.info/cgi-bin/whois.cgi" class="external text" title="http://www.afilias.info/cgi-bin/whois.cgi" rel="nofollow">whois</a>). Quite obviously, the chances of that site which claims to represent the "Macedonian minority in Albania" being a hoax are extremely high, considering that there's nothing stopping me starting a site about the hypothetical Chinese minority in Albania and claiming all sorts of human rights abuses. If this site were in some way related to the topic, then fine, but it isn't, so it has no place here. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 10:52, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
