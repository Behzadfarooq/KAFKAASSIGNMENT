<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Pike was born in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, son of Benjamin and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in <a href="../../../b/y/f/Byfield%2C_Massachusetts_78e2.html" title="Byfield, Massachusetts">Byfield</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newburyport%2C_Massachusetts_eada.html" title="Newburyport, Massachusetts">Newburyport, Massachusetts</a>. He attended school in Newburyport and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framingham%2C_Massachusetts_e061.html" title="Framingham, Massachusetts">Framingham</a> until he was fifteen, at which point, having passed the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a> entrance exam but unable to afford tuition, he began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucester%2C_Massachusetts_de82.html" title="Gloucester, Massachusetts">Gloucester</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairhaven%2C_Massachusetts_3d4c.html" title="Fairhaven, Massachusetts">Fairhaven</a> and Newburyport.</p>
<p>In 1831 Pike left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a> and later moving on to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence%2C_Missouri_37fd.html" title="Independence, Missouri">Independence</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>. In Independence, he joined an expedition to <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taos%2C_New_Mexico_9fc4.html" title="Taos, New Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>, hunting and trading. During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llano_Estacado_9a6a.html" title="Llano Estacado">Llano Estacado</a> in New Mexico and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. Trapping was minimal, and after traveling about 1300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Smith%2C_Arkansas_3826.html" title="Fort Smith, Arkansas">Fort Smith</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>.</p>
<p>Settling in Arkansas in 1833, he taught school and wrote a series of articles for the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas_8f37.html" title="Little Rock, Arkansas">Little Rock</a> <i>Arkansas Advocate</i> under the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen_name.html" title="Pen name">pen name</a> of "Casca." The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the staff of the newspaper. Later, after marrying Mary Ann Hamilton, he purchased part of the newspaper with the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowry.html" title="Dowry">dowry</a>. By 1835 he was the <i>Advocate</i>'s sole owner. Under Pike's administration the <i>Advocate</i> promoted the viewpoint of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Whig_Party_bdd4.html" title="United States Whig Party">Whig party</a> in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas.</p>
<p>He then began to study law, and was admitted to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28law%29.html" title="Bar (law)">bar</a> in 1837, selling the <i>Advocate</i> the same year. He was the first reporter for the Arkansas supreme court, and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled <i>The Arkansas Form Book</i>, which was a guidebook for lawyers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Edit section: Military career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Military career</span></h2>
<p>When the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a> started, Pike joined the cavalry and was commissioned as a troop commander, serving in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Buena_Vista_4bfb.html" title="Battle of Buena Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. He and his commander, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Selden_Roane_6751.html" title="John Selden Roane">John Selden Roane</a>, had several differences of opinion. This situation led finally to a <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duel.html" title="Duel">duel</a> between Pike and Roane. Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.</p>
<p>After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a> for a time beginning in 1853. He wrote another book, <i>Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence</i>. Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field and becoming an advocate of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, although retaining his affiliation with the Whig party. When that party dissolved, he became a member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Know-Nothing_Party_f8dc.html" title="United States Know-Nothing Party">Know-Nothing</a> party. Before the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> he was firmly against <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">secession</a>, but when the war started he nevertheless took the side of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>.</p>
<p>He also made several contacts among the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> tribes in the area, at one point negotiating an $800,000 settlement between the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creek_%28people%29.html" title="Creek (people)">Creeks</a> and other tribes and the federal government. This relationship was to influence the course of his Civil War service. At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> chief <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ross_%28Cherokee_chief%29_13ee.html" title="John Ross (Cherokee chief)">John Ross</a>, which was concluded in 1861.</p>
<p>Pike was commissioned as a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_22.html" title="November 22">November 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, and given a command in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Territory_1bdc.html" title="Indian Territory">Indian Territory</a>. With Gen. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_McCulloch_3dee.html" title="Benjamin McCulloch">Ben McCullough</a>, Pike trained three Confederate <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiments</a> of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cavalry.html" title="Indian cavalry">Indian cavalry</a>, most of whom belonged to the "<a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Civilized_Tribes_2f13.html" title="Five Civilized Tribes">civilized tribes</a>," whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable. Although victorious at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pea_Ridge_5633.html" title="Battle of Pea Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a> (Elkhorn Tavern) in March, Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray. Also, as in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one point drafting a letter to <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> complaining about his direct superior.</p>
<p>After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalping.html" title="Scalping">scalped</a> soldiers in the field. Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_C._Hindman_01f6.html" title="Thomas C. Hindman">Thomas C. Hindman</a> also charged Pike with mishandling of money and material, ordering his arrest. Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the Confederate Army on July 12. He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insubordination.html" title="Insubordination">insubordination</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, and held briefly in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren%2C_Texas_8189.html" title="Warren, Texas">Warren, Texas</a>, but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.</p>

<p>Pike faced the postwar years unable to earn the trust either of his former comrades or of the Union victors, and subsequently relocated to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> and later to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. He was however at length given a formal pardon by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, and therefore enabled to continue his career in public life, becoming an associate justice of the Arkansas supreme court, later practicing law in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a> from 1867-68 (where he also served as editor of the Memphis <i>Appeal</i>), and finally moving his law office to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1870, becoming editor of the <i>Patriot</i> newspaper.</p>

<p>He had in the interim joined a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonic_lodge.html" title="Masonic lodge">Masonic lodge</a> and become extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Rite_845f.html" title="Scottish Rite">Scottish Rite</a>'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859. He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of thirty-two years), devoting a large amount of his time to developing the rituals of the order. Notably, he published a book called <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morals_and_Dogma_of_the_Ancient_and_Accepted_Scottish_Rite_of_Freemasonry_38ce.html" title="Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry">Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry</a></i> in 1871, of which there were several subsequent editions.</p>
<p>Pike is still sometimes regarded in America as an eminent<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and influential<sup id="_ref-Pikeinfluence_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pikeinfluence" title="">[2]</a></sup> Freemason. His anti-<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> pronouncements were seen as representative of American freemasonry by Catholic sources.<sup id="_ref-PikeItaly_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PikeItaly" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, in his published response to the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanum_Genus_3428.html" title="Humanum Genus">Humanum Genus</a> of Pope Leo XIII, it is evident that he had no particular antipathy to Catholicism as a religion nor to membership of Roman Catholics in the lodge. His fight was against the desire of institutional Catholicism to suppress Freemasonry by force.</p>

<p>Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects, and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts. His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten. Several volumes of his works were self-published posthumously by his daughter.</p>
<p>In 1859 he received an honorary <a href="../../../p/h/2E/Ph.D._5b53.html" title="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> from Harvard.</p>
<p>Pike died in Washington, D.C., aged 81, and was buried at <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oak_Hill_Cemetery_af8b.html" title="Oak Hill Cemetery">Oak Hill Cemetery</a> (against his wishes — he had left instructions his body be cremated).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> his remains were moved to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_the_Temple_96f3.html" title="House of the Temple">House of the Temple</a>, headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite.</p>
<p>Immediately prior to the Civil War, Pike had been persuaded by his friend, William James Rivers, to move to Charleston, South Carolina and to join the Palladians. Rivers was a famous professor emeritus of Ancient Languages and produced a great number of documents for Pike. Another friend of Pike's in Charleston was a student of Rivers, Henry Timrod, Charleston's wealthiest citizen and poet laureate of the Confederacy who wrote South Carolina's state song. These collaborations were unfortunately interrupted by the start of the Civil War, which separated the three friends. Pike became a Brigadier in the Confederate army, Rivers a professor in Columbia and afterward president of Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, and Timrod, who lost all his family, including his little son, as well as his entire fortune in the war, sickened and died in Columbia. Although Pike continued to be in contact with Rivers until the end of his life, none of the three friends ever returned to Charleston again.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Edit section: Albert Pike and rumours regarding the Ku Klux Klan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Albert Pike and rumours regarding the Ku Klux Klan</span></h2>
<p>One of the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Klan</a> founders, Captain John C. Lester, wrote a 119 page book in 1884, in which he recalled the founding of the Klan fifteen years before. The only person that Lester mentioned was "Gen. Forrest," undoubtedly referring to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest_6db5.html" title="Nathan Bedford Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>. Lester does not mention Pike.</p>
<p>Fleming republished Lester's memoir in 1905 and added a list of names and pictures of "Klansmen". These included Pike but also Rev. D.L. Wilson, who had been Lester's co-author but not a Klansman. Thus if the inclusion of Pike on the list was a mistake, then it was not Fleming's only one.</p>
<p>Davis published her "Authentic History" of the Klan in 1924. She disagreed with Lester and regarded Fleming as not knowledgeable about the Klan. She also said that David L. Wilson was wrong to say that the original Klan was a failure. (This is not surprising since Davis was actively supporting a revival of the Klan at the time of her publication.)</p>
<p>Virtually all books or articles that claim Pike was part of the Ku Klux Klan use Fleming, Davis, other authors who cite Fleming or Davis, or else use no sources whatsoever. As one source puts it, "Research into primary source material will reveal that there isn't any primary source material" that proves or disproves Pike's association with the Klan. It is noteworthy that when the Klan was founded in <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulaski%2C_Tennessee_826c.html" title="Pulaski, Tennessee">Pulaski, Tennessee</a> around Christmas 1865, Pike was living in Arkansas, and there is no record of him journeying to or being in Pulaski.</p>

<p>Pike's contributions to the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, combined with his unique life and written works, has made him a person of note in virtually every conspiracy that mentions Freemasons.</p>
<p>Below are literal straight forward quotes by Albert Pike that supporters of conspiracies sometimes cite in support that Pike was indeed a Luciferian (all are from his book <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morals_and_Dogma_of_the_Ancient_and_Accepted_Scottish_Rite_of_Freemasonry_38ce.html" title="Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry"><i>Morals and Dogma</i></a><a href="http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/apikefr.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/apikefr.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/md/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/md/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>):</p>

<dd>"LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darknesss! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!" p.321</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled, to conceal the truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it, or would pervert it."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry ... It is well enough for the mass of those called Masons, to imagine that all is contained in the Blue Degrees; and whose attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain."</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, if one reads the text as a whole, there are literally thousands of quotes which are irreconcilable with a belief in slavery, or with disrespect for established religions. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Page 3 -- "Under Claudius and under Domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the ugliness of the tyranny. The foulness of the slaves is a direct result of the atrocious baseness of the despot... And so Humanity wages war against Humanity, in despite of Humanity... Tyrants use the force of the people to chain and subjugate -- that is, enyoke the people. Then they plough with them as men do with oxen. Then the spirit of liberty and innovation is reduced by bayonets and principles are struck dumb by cannonshot."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Page 4 -- "Therefore it is one of the fatalities of Humanity to be condemned to eternal struggle with phantoms, with superstitions, bigotries, hypocrisies, prejudices and the pleas of tyranny. Despotisms, seen in the past, become respectable, as the mountain, bristling with volcanic rock, rugged and horrid, seen through the haze of distance is blue and beautiful. The sight of a single dungeon of tyranny is worth more, to dispel illusions and create holy hatred of despotism, and to direct FORCE aright than the most eloquent volumes. The French should have preserved the Bastile as a perpetual lesson; Italy should not destroy the dungeons of the Inquisition.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Page 6 -- “Though Masonry neither usurps the place of, nor apes religion, prayer is an essential part of our ceremonies. It is the aspiration of the soul toward the Absolute and Infinite Intelligence which is the One Supreme Deity… Thought, meditation, prayer are the great mysterious pointings of the needle. It is the spiritual magnetism which connects the soul with the Deity. These majestic irradiations of the soul pierce through the shadow to the light.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Page 17 -- “Masonry has its decalogue… These are its Ten Commandments:
<dl>
<dd>II. Thy religion shall be to do good because it is a pleasure to thee, not merely because it is a duty…</dd>
<dd>Thy soul is immortal! Thou shalt not degrade it!</dd>
<dd>III. Thou shalt unceasingly war against vice!</dd>
<dd>Thou shalt not do unto others that which thou wouldst not wish them to do unto thee!</dd>
<dd>IX. … Thou shalt render good for evil!</dd>
<dd>Thou shalt not misuse either thy strength or thy superiority!</dd>
<dd>X. … Thou shalt be just!”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Page 21 -- “In the works published for the use of the Craft, we are told that the three great tenets of a Mason’s profession are Brotherly love, Relief and Truth. And it is true that a Brotherly affection and kindness should govern us in all our intercourse and relations with our brethren&#160;; and a generous and liberal philanthropy actuate us in regard to all men. To relieve the distressed is peculiarly the duty of Masons -- a sacred duty, not to be omitted, neglected, or coldly or inefficiently complied with.”</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>Page 329 -- "To honor the Deity, to regard all men as our Brethren, as children equally dear to Him..."</p>
<p>He also cites repeatedly from texts from throughout the world, so that there can be no doubt that he regards the Negro and Oriental races as human and therefore subject to these laws of liberty, equality and justice. For example,</p>
<p>“The trinity of the Hindus became among the Ethiopians and Abyssinians Neph-Amon, Phtha and Neith -- the God Creator, whose emblem was a ram.”</p>
