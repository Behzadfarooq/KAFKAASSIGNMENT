<p>Albany High School was established in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a> after H. M. McIntosh, editor of the <i>Albany News and Advertiser</i>, initiated a campaign and to raise the funds necessary to erect the school. It was the first high school established within the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County.html" title="County">county</a>.</p>
<p>Approximately two years after the school opened it was destroyed by a fire of an unknown origin. Classes were temporarily held in the town <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courthouse.html" title="Courthouse">courthouse</a> while the Academy was rebuilt. Student enrollment rapidly increased during the first two <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decade.html" title="Decade">decades</a>, leading to overcrowding. In response to the rapidly increasing student enrollment, expansions and additions were made to the school and eventually a new high school building was built in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. This building contained ten classrooms, and was located at the intersection of Monroe Street and Society Avenue. In 1925, the high school moved to another building located at 1000 North Jefferson Street. The high school moved to the current building on Residence Avenue in the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. <a href="http://albanyhightimes.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://albanyhightimes.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
