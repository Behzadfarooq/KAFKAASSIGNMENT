<p>Thanks for the message you left at my Talk page...I've looked at your A-League article, and I reckon it's not too shabby. I called the page the "Hyundai A-League", on the premise that if the sponsorship or the league name changes, you could do a re-direct to a new page. Anyway...I reckon the following changes could be made (you could do them, or I will on the weekend):</p>
<ul>
<li>The "owners" are the chairmen of the clubs...</li>
<li>Mention of sponsorship and broadcast rights</li>
<li>Stadiums have been confirmed...the team data could be added a table</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that it's fine. If you make the changes, or someone else does, I'll turn my page into a re-direct page, pointing to yours. If you think we're on the right path, then let me know. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDan_9e8b.html" title="User:BigDan">BigDan</a></p>

<dd>Hiya there.. just dropping you a line to say that I think your A-League article is more than good enough to move into the main article space!

<dd>Hmmm - I started one a while ago and there was a very helpful page which lists the steps to make one... But I can't find it now, which is a bit frustrating! I'm a member of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">Wikipedia: WikiProject Formula One</a>, which I think is well set out. But from what I remember, you create a page in the Wikipedia namespace (in our case, create the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_A1_Grand_Prix_6d33.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject A1 Grand Prix">Wikipedia: WikiProject A1 Grand Prix</a>), then on the page, you basically start with a brief description of the project and what the goals are (eg to keep up to date, consistent info on <a href="../../../a/1/_/A1_Grand_Prix_8049.html" title="A1 Grand Prix">A1 Grand Prix</a> series)... Then put a place for members to sign up, a heading for Infoboxes and Templates (which we obviously do not have yet), and make a short "to-Do" list. You'll want to add it to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProjects_7fef.html" title="Category:WikiProjects">Category: WikiProjects</a>, and the list at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia: WikiProject</a>. Have a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_best_practices_7a2e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices">Wikipedia: WikiProject best practices</a>, which is the best help page I could find. Then probably just leave messages on peoples talk pages - probably best to start with those who have already contributed to the <a href="../../../a/1/_/A1_Grand_Prix_8049.html" title="A1 Grand Prix">A1 Grand Prix</a> page, and it will probably (hopefully) grow from there.

<p>I decided the NPOV tag had been on this page for too long, as such I've edited it to the best of my ability to conform to Wikipedia's NPOV policy. As you have declared an interest here I wonder if you could review the section and raise any objections you may have to the new version.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for getting back to me. I too believe at I am coming to the article unbiased, it's just such a difficult balancing act due to the enormous amount of comment these incidents have attracted over the years. Overall though I think it could be natural to view the section as biased against Schumacher simply by the presence of allegations, nevertheless I think any balanced commentary of his career must recognise these allegations (whether they are well founded or not). Having said that I never expected my new version to be perfect and welcome any NPOV revisions or suggestions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't include this as its POV but just for interest when researching the incidents I came across a M.Schumacher tribute site. The author (a self confessed Schumacher fan) said he honestly believed '94 was a genuine accident but '97 was a blatant attempt to take Villeneuve off and that the 1994 incident received undue attention due to revisionism, i.e. commentators equating the two when looking back.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "discrete" team orders; yes it isn't really Schumacher specific, but I just included it because <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Brawn_e72f.html" title="Ross Brawn">Ross Brawn</a> said it after the FIA banned team orders (I think his words were something like it will just go "underground") — perhaps more at home at <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuderia_Ferrari_ae22.html" title="Scuderia Ferrari">Scuderia Ferrari</a>. I also thought the emphasis that <u>all teams</u> can practice team orders <u>when it suits them</u> balances the ==Team Orders== section. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 12:09, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed you've done a bit of work on the finals systems, particularly the NRL's final 8. Do you have any time to clean up these articles and maybe start standardising the articles on finals? I think that an article about finals in general, maybe linking to the individual systems would be good. It could be called simply Finals systems or Play-off systems or something like that. I don't really know, but I think that outside Australia and some countries that have been sportingly influenced by Australia, the various final systems are unknown. Most countries just seem to use straight knockout systems if any at all, so some people might be surprised to find other ways. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdEdition_9f3c.html" title="User:ThirdEdition">ThirdEdition</a> 03:06, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>DNS stands for when a car does not take a a race start. Makes sense. By having Ret listed that mean the driver has actually started in that race and will count a race starts towards the driver race start tally.. The formation lap does not count as a lap at all as it is not added towards the race classification. For when does a driver 'start' a Grand Prix? To my mind he does so only if he is on the grid when the flag drops or light goes green at the final start. Should a driver have failed to compete the formation lap, for instance (as was the case with Prost at Imola in 1991), he cannot truly be said to have started the race. In the case of restarted events such as the British GP in 1986, poor Jacques Laffite certainly did start the race, but this was declared null and void and he was not presented to take the restart, which is the only one that counts. For true official race results is best to get them off www.forix.com as they receive their race results from the officials. Yes I know formula1.com is official but not 100% official in statistics. If you decide to leave it as Ret then you must give all the drivers a race start count!</p>
<p>I have spend hours in researching and asking many F1 statistician who are famous and know more on Grand Prix. All the statisian I have contacted and got back told me it is actually DNS not Ret, they also have mention the formula1.com is not very accurate with their race results. The formula1.com is incorrect as listing as ret instead of DNS for 2005-USA. This were the responses from the following people. Renowned F1 statistians, like David Hayhoe or Autosport's Peter Higham agree that all Michelin drivers were DNS in 2005-USA, but consider a RET if a driver didn't made a re-start, for example. That was the common view in the past - no contemporary source listed Lauda as a DNS in 1976-Germany - and they simply ignore the current "null and void" FIA rule. I totally agree to change it as DNS not Ret as they didn't take part on the first lap.</p>
<p>Here is a intersting fact. Button will start his 100th race start in the 2005-China race. But according to wikipedia when doing the math by adding all Button race starts it would be his 101st race start in China as Button has been listed as Ret instead of DNS for this year 2005-USA race. Does this make sense to you. That means wikipedia will have an extra race start for all the drivers who have no started in the 2005 USA race have an extra race start which wouldn't be official to the drivers stats.</p>
<p>I am trying to help you all to have accurate data on Formula 1 on wikipedia. I DO beleive the formula1.com site doesn't not give out accurate race classifications. As I have been involved with FORIX and autosport.com for many years as my job is to look for incorrect data on their server. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasu_28f6.html" title="User:Andreasu">Andreas</a> 04 October 09:36</p>

<p>Hello. Round four of Wikipedia Mind Benders will open on Thursday, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>. This round will be drastically different from round three; part one will consist of a creative project, and part two will be developed from there. The full details will be released when the round opens. Time and speed should not be major factors in this round; thus, there is no exact opening time for the round as speed will not factor into the scoring.

<p>In reply to your message:</p>

<dd><i>hi mate, I was thinking of making a comprehensive list of the top-grade rugby league premiers in Australia, but I wasn't sure what title it should have since the comps have had different names... I thought List of Australian rugby league premiers was most appropriate, but might be a bit misleading thanks to the Australian Rugby League.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You ask a complicated question! I was going to suggest that it would perhaps be better kept as a subtopic of the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league_in_Australia_25f1.html" title="Rugby league in Australia">Rugby league in Australia</a> article. This seems most appropriate. It would go under the heading of "top tier premiers" or "1st grade premiers". However, its relevance in this article is question when one brings up the topic of the NZ Warriors. Perhaps the best idea is to not create one list. But to link the documents together where this information can already be found, I.e. you'd link the NRL article to the ARL article and it to the NSWRL article. More then that, you'd link the sections of the articles to the other relevant sections and make sure those sections are titled consistently.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the links big and flash. Perhaps a table of some light colour. Make the links consistent on all pages.</li>
<li>A <i>list of</i> article is somewhat in appropriate also because it means that both the NRL article and your list will have to be kept up to scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>On that last note, if you want to still go a-head with your list, do so, but turn the relevant sections from NSWRL,ARL,NRL articles into templates. So that in all the articles they can be templates and thus only one change is required when updating them! Although I'm not sure if this is desirable because people may modify the templates thinking their only used on your <i>list of</i> page, which then may make them not work with the original articles... *sigh* this turned out a little long!</p>
<p>Lastly, if you decide to go with your list, with or with out the template idea then a good name maybe...</p>

<p>Say, not that I really have a problem with it, but I'm kinda wondering why you're removing the template from the A1GP race reports? (especially after you put so much work into them...)

<dd>I suppose mostly because the Template space is cluttered with undocumented and unused templates like this that do little more than structure a few characters of wikitext. It's much better to teach people to use straight wikitext than templates. If these describe some sort of standard notation, document the notation itself on your <a href="../../../f/1/_/WP%7EF1_b8ae.html" title="WP:F1">WP:F1</a> project page and provide "copy-and-paste" code for your editors. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 08:22, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With your neutral vote would you anticipate that the vote would be discounted or should it be used to calculate the total votes and the consequent percentage majority and thus be registered as a half vote for for and a half vote against the move? <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 10:16, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed it based on the labels used from an official TV network of F1 during qualifying. Actually, I also saw "Sauber BMW" instead of "BMW Sauber". As I recall the naming of the cars were "STR Cosworth", "RBR Ferrari" "Sauber BMW", and "Aguri Honda", despite the official names of the teams. For example, the car Ferrari is called that despite the fact that the official name is "Scuderia Ferrari Marboro". The reader can just click the link to read more on the details. But if you really believe that it should be changed back, I don't mind.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../n/o/y/User%7ENoypi380_7d93.html" title="User:Noypi380">Noypi380</a> 09:53, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An unfortunate side-effect of your current delinking of months meant that in a whole heap of Formula One articles, the team <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_Engineering_a603.html" title="March Engineering">March Engineering</a>, which was wrongly linked to the month as <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> has all become delinked. I know it shouldn't have been pointing to March but now it is difficult to find and correct those incorrect links that I've only just become aware of. Is there any way to find all of the occurences of this other than going through SmackBot's contribs?

<dd>Hi, how about I give you a list of articles that include "Formula One" ,"Formula 1" or Formula one" and a link to March as of earlier this month? <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 11:23 <a href="../../../2/6/_/26_March_04e7.html" title="26 March">26 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).

<p>This is an amazing list! I wondered if it would be an idea to footnote the strange .143 points occurences with a brief summary of the explanation given at the pointscoring article - people are clearly going to be surprised by seeing it (I certainly was!), so rather than making them do the hard graft of searching it out, footnoting it (maybe with a link to the pointscoring page) would be helpful, and add significantly to the list.
