<p>Albert Ritchie was born on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">August 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> to relatively distinguished parents. His father, Albert, had served as a member of the Maryland Constitutional Convention in 1867, as a Professor of Law at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Maryland%2C_College_Park_4efc.html" title="University of Maryland, College Park">University of Maryland</a>, as City Solicitor of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, and as a judge. His mother, Elizabeth Caskie Cabell, descended from a <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Virginia_7937.html" title="Governor of Virginia">Governor of Virginia</a> and of Joseph Cabell, a close associate of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p>
<p>Ritchie moved to Baltimore with his family shortly after his birth and received his early education from private schools. He received a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">bachelor's degree</a> from <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johns_Hopkins_University_14b6.html" title="Johns Hopkins University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in 1896, and his <a href="../../../l/l/2E/LL.D_6002.html" title="LL.D">LL.D</a> from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Maryland_School_of_Law_35f7.html" title="University of Maryland School of Law">University of Maryland School of Law</a> in 1898. He entered into practice with the firm of Steele, Semmes, Carey and Bond in 1900, and in 1903 was appointed Assistant City Solicitor of Baltimore. The same year, he formed his own law practice with Stuart S. Janney. Ritchie continued to serve as Solicitor until 1910, and continued to practice law with Janney until 1919. In 1907, Ritchie was appointed as a professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law.</p>
<p>In 1907, Ritchie married Elizabeth Catherine Baker of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catonsville%2C_Maryland_0941.html" title="Catonsville, Maryland">Catonsville, Maryland</a>. However, in June of 1916, Baker filed for divorce under the charge of abandonment, since Ritchie had left her to live with his mother in 1910. He did not challenge her claim, and the divorce was finalized soon thereafter. Ritchie never remarried, nor did he have any children.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1910, Ritchie was appointed as People's Counsel to the Public Service Commission of Baltimore. He garnered much attention for fighting to lower gas and electricity prices for the people of Baltimore that resulted in annual savings of $500,000. Ritchie resigned on February 16, 1913 to return to his law practice, where he took up a case against a local utility company for producing inferior quality gas. The Public Service Commission sided with Ritchie on the issue, and the result was further savings $200,000 annually for the residents of Baltimore.</p>

<p>Ritchie's actions did not go unnoticed, and he was nominated to be <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Maryland_a336.html" title="Attorney General of Maryland">Attorney General of Maryland</a> in 1915, a position he served in from December 20, 1915 to December 20, 1919. In the primary election, Ritchie defeated challenger William Milnes Maloy, who would later challenge him for Governor, by 20,000 votes. In the general election, Ritchie defeated his Republican rival, Albert Doub, by 25,000 votes. As Attorney General, Ritchie economized the state government by having the state law department assume the legal activities of nearly every department, with the exception of the Public Service Commission, thus eliminating the need for other departments to hire outside legal counsel.</p>
<p>On June 3, 1918, Ritchie took a leave of absence as Attorney General to serve on <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Industries_Board_3fb5.html" title="War Industries Board">War Industries Board</a> as General Counsel. Established as a result of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the War Industries Board was one of the most influential of al the wartime organizations established by the government. While on the board, Ritchie became a good friend of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Baruch_e5e6.html" title="Bernard Baruch">Bernard Baruch</a>, the chairman of the board, and a man who would later support Ritchie's presidential aspirations. The Board was dissolved in December of 1918, and Ritchie returned to his position as Attorney General.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Ritchie_5863.html" title="Edit section: Governor of Maryland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Governor of Maryland</span></h3>
<p>During the gubernatorial election of 1919, Ritchie made his interest known and quickly gained support from the state democrats. He went unopposed on the primary ticket, but the general election proved to be considerably more challenging, and also proved to be one of the closest elections in state history. Out of nearly 225,000 votes, Ritchie won with a mere 165 votes to spare, defeating Republican challenger <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_W._Nice_8cba.html" title="Harry W. Nice">Harry W. Nice</a> 112,240 to 112,075. Across the state, however, Republicans gained control of the legislature, and succeeded in electing Republicans and <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_Baltimore_10fa.html" title="Mayor of Baltimore">Mayor of Baltimore</a> and Attorney General.</p>
<p>During Ritchie's first term, he worked to improve the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_education.html" title="Public education">public education</a> system by establishing standards for the counties and by distributing wealth from the richer to the poorer counties. His actions were successful, and the Maryland educational system emerged as one of the best in the nation. Ritchie also invested considerable funds in expanding and improving the highways of the state, resulting in Maryland emerging as having one of the best highway systems in the country.</p>
<p>Ritchie was a strong opponent of the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_135b.html" title="Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Eighteenth Amendment</a>, which established prohibition, and was a staunch advocate of <a href="../../../s/t/a/States%27_rights.html" title="States' rights">states' rights</a>. He also gained national attention for his refusal to cooperate with the administrations of Presidents <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_G._Harding_03fa.html" title="Warren G. Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Coolidge_91e2.html" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. During a miner's strike in 1922, Ritchie refused a request from Harding to break up the strike by force, instead choosing a diplomatic alternative. The situation was peacefully defused.</p>
<p>For the first time in state history, Ritchie was nominated for a second term as Governor in 1923. He was again unopposed in the primary, but during the general election faced Alexander Armstrong, his successor as Attorney General. In a campaign which focused on his accomplishments as Governor and defiance of the Eighteenth Amendment, Ritchie easily defeated Armstrong by a plurality of 43,000 votes. His second term began on January 9, 1924.</p>
<p>It was during his second term that Ritchie was nationally considered as a potential Presidential candidate, due in part to his acclaim as a fighter for the freedom of Maryland from extensive federal interference. Because of an election law that changed the date of election that passed during Ritchie's first term, his second term only lasted three years.</p>
<p>Ritchie had announced early on his intentions to seek a third term as Governor, but, unlike in 1919 and 1923, he faced opposition in the primary elections of 1926. Ritchie's old rival, William Milnes Maloy, whom Ritchie had defeated in 1915 for nomination to Attorney General, again chose to challenge Ritchie for the Democratic nomination. Ritchie was easily nominated, having defeated Maloy by 81,500 votes. During the general election, Ritchie was challenged by Republican Addison Mullikin, who made issue of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conowingo_Dam_02c4.html" title="Conowingo Dam">Conowingo Dam</a> construction project which he felt Ritchie had handled poorly. Nevertheless, Ritchie won the election by over 60,000 votes and won Baltimore City and 14 of 23 counties in the state. He was sworn in for his third term on January 12, 1927.</p>
<p>During his third term, Ritchie further worked with the state transportation system, calling for the construction of new highways and bridges, and for the improvement of the railways. Ritchie also pursued one of the earliest programs of conservation of the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, enacting strict game and fishing legislation. A corruption scandal emerged towards the end of Ritchie's third term involving employees of the State Roads Commission who were accused of <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embezzlement.html" title="Embezzlement">embezzling</a> $376,000. After a long investigation, and after Ritchie established a committee to investigate the allegations, those responsible were arrested. The Governor and the State Roads Commission were absolved from blame.</p>
<p>Ritchie was nominated for a fourth term in September of 1930. State Senator <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_McIntosh_b76a.html" title="David McIntosh">David McIntosh</a> of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_County_87c6.html" title="Baltimore County">Baltimore County</a> had initially announced his candidacy for governor, but withdrew upon Ritchie's announcement that he would seek renomination. Ritchie secured renomination easily, and faced William Broening, the Republican Mayor of Baltimore, during the general election. Ritchie won re-election by one of the largest majorities up to that time, having won by a plurality of 66,770 votes.</p>
<p>Throughout his 15 years as Governor, Ritchie called the legislature into special session several times, including once in 1920 to vote on <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_suffrage.html" title="Women's suffrage">women's suffrage</a> in Maryland, and again in 1933 to ratify the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1933. Ritchie tried, but failed to achieve nomination as President during the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1932_79d6.html" title="United States presidential election, 1932">election of 1932</a>, and declined an offer by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to be his running mate.</p>
<p>Ritchie's popularity as governor reached its peak during the early years of his fourth term, but gradually began to wane following the catastrophic economic impact of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, and also because of growing jealously within the party as a result of his long tenure as Governor, and because of a <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching_in_the_United_States_0822.html" title="Lynching in the United States">lynching</a> that had occurred on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland_Eastern_Shore_cc25.html" title="Maryland Eastern Shore">Maryland Eastern Shore</a>. In 1934, he succeeded in securing the Democratic nomination as Governor, defeating challenger Charles Henry Conley. In the general election, Ritchie faced Republican <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Nice_5fe1.html" title="Harry Nice">Harry Nice</a>, who he had defeated in the election of 1919 by 165 votes. Under the slogan of "right the wrong of 1919", Nice defeated Ritchie 253,813 to 247,644.</p>

On February 24, 1936, Ritchie died suddenly and unexpectedly of what was determined to be a <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_hemorrhage.html" title="Cerebral hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a>.
