<p>Hey again - Another two cents.</p>
<ul>
<li>"1.1 How Albanian compares with other languages"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't quite what I meant. It's a collection of vocabulary, but the words aren't all <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>. What I was thinking (and it should probably go later in the article, say in the vocabulary section) will take a bit more research. For other branches of Indo-European, there are specific articles for the branch (Germanic languages, Slavic languages, etc.) which ideally would summarize how the branch developed from proto-Indo-European and maybe how it relates to other branches. But for the Albanian branch, there's just Albanian (maybe that could be your next project - people would appreciate it!). What I thought would be useful would be a list of <i>cognates</i> showing how Albanian relates to other IE languages. *gw → /g, z/, etc. Well, most of the details belong in the Indo-European article, which currently has nothing on Albanian, but it would be interesting to have a few of the quirks here too. Even just a list of indigenous Albanian numerals and pronouns, showing their similarities but also divergences from other IE languages, would be interesting. Or maybe some examples of how Albanian can look quite different from Greek, even when the words are related.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is the only diff in the phoneme inventories of Gheg and Tosk that Gheg has a set of nasal vowels? Are all the vowels found nasalized? Also not clear from the text or the table if final schwa reduction is a feature of Tosk, or of Gheg compared to Tosk.</li>
<li>Case: I refer you to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan_Sprachbund_92bf.html#Syncretism_of_genitive_and_dative" title="Balkan Sprachbund">Balkan genitive-dative merger</a>. Albanian does not have a genitive case, and it should be removed from the table. Perhaps you could have a note, <i>instead of a genitive case, Albanian uses with dative with the preposition X</i> or something. The constructions aren't identical in Albanian, unlike Bulgarian, but <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case.html" title="Case">case</a> is an inflection of the noun, and Albanian doesn't inflect its nouns specially for a genitive. Or you could leave just the dative row, but label it "genitive/dative", and in a note say <i>for the genitive, the preposition X is used</i>.</li>
<li>Don't know what you mean by 6 "types" of mood. Should it be 6 moods?</li>
<li>The word for a negative imperative is 'prohibitive': "In prohibitive clauses [or "negative commands", if you prefer], the particle <i>mos</i> is used".</li>
<li>The English pronunciation equivalents are confusing, especially with their odd mixture of capital and lower case letters. I find them illegible. If you want a spelling pronunciation, I have one at <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_pronunciation_key.html" title="Asteroid pronunciation key">Asteroid pronunciation key</a> that's worked pretty well and which you might use. Or you could simply remove this and stick with the IPA and sound files, which should be enough for anyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>84.70.84.73::hello, Just a couple of words about colour words in Albanian used in the comparison chart. The word for 'yellow' in standard literary Albanian is 'i verdhë' and not 'i gjelbër/i blertë'(which mean green); 'jeshile' in the green column is just another synonym for 'i gjelbër/i blertë'. However, in various areas in Northern Albania and Kosova, 'i gjelbër' (but to my knowledge not 'i blertë') means 'yellow', while 'i verdhë' means 'green'. To complicate matters further, I personally know of a couple of villages in Kosova where people use 'i verdhë' to mean 'blue'.</p>

<p>First of all the phrase "and by smaller numbers of ethnic Albanians in other parts of the southern Balkans, along the east coast of Italy and in Sicily, in southern Greece, and in Germany, Sweden, the United States, Ukraine, and Belgium." is copy paste from <a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:jg-toagRQ9YJ:www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109785+by+smaller+numbers+of+ethnic+Albanians+in+other+parts+of+the+southern+Balkans" class="external text" title="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:jg-toagRQ9YJ:www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109785+by+smaller+numbers+of+ethnic+Albanians+in+other+parts+of+the+southern+Balkans" rel="nofollow">Britanica</a>, that means using it is a possible copyright violation.</p>
<p>Apart from that I think that the previous phrasing (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albanian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27757716" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albanian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27757716" rel="nofollow">see here</a>) is more NPOV. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 10:43, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is not about the Arvanites or their language. We are talking about the (officially inexistant) Çam Muslim and Orthodox communities. I'm sure that that's what <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> is talking about and I don't think that Britannica is POV (imagine that). I also highly doubt that it is a possible copyright violation as it is a phrase. If you like, I can ask the Help Desk to check it.

<p>REX we've been through all these before. The Chams were about 40.000 and they left (let's not get into the reasons now), during the 2nd world war. And the majority of the Cham people were muslims, like the majority of Tosks were christians. All these people are reffered by scholars (for example the editors of Britanica) as Albanians. The majority of "Albanians" (sic) in Greece are not the Chams nor the Albanian workers (since 1992) but the Arvanites. They spoke Arvanitika which some scholars call Albanian, etc. With your search on Albanian language, you 'll see various things that perhaps I've already read, and I think that you'll agree with me. Please give a shot, trying to understand my explanation.</p>
<p>As for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> if we could copy-paste it, it would be interesting, but I'm afraid we can't. Read <a href="../../../1/9/1/Talk%7E1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_f056.html" title="Talk:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica">Talk:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/1/Wikipedia%7E1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_18ad.html" title="Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>. Both the 1911 and the current Britannica are excellent encyclopedias but a) we can't copy-paste from the new one because of copyright (we can't even use the name Britannica for citing the 1911) and b) read <a href="../../../p/d/_/WP%7EPD_9540.html#Please_don.27t_data_dump.21" title="WP:PD">WP:PD</a> about bias - I'm not making it up, I'm trying to help you and to discuss that change. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 12:42, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What about the 30,000 Shqiptarë, don't they exist? Honestly, are you saying that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> has published a <i>gross inaccurracy</i>? I simply fail to see why you are trying to cover up the fact that there are ethnic Albanians in Greece. What about the 600,000 Albanian immigrants, they even outnumber the Arvanites! If you object to quoting Britannica, why didn't you object to the following, which has been there for months and was removed by me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albanian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27644090" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albanian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27644090" rel="nofollow">diff</a>:<i>Languages sharing a common origin with <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosk_language.html" title="Tosk language">Tosk</a> are spoken in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> enclaves and appear to be related most closely to the dialect of <a href="../../../%C3%A7/a/m/%C3%87am%C3%ABria.html" title="Çamëria">Çamëria</a> in the extreme south of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>.</i> That is a blatant copypaste of Britannica which under POV processing resulted in that. Or does copypasting individual sentences amount to copyright violation only in selective cases? As far as I know it isn't (5% is allowed). The only think we can do is to ask if it is. Perhaps quoting Ethnologue's figures is a copyvio.

<p>I'm not trying to cover up anything. I've wrote about the ethnic Albanians who came to work in Greece (check my text for the word 1992). Verify with a wikipedia expert what I wrote if you don't believe what I write, or if you can't understand the links I gave you before. PS Ethnologue allows to be cited as a refference and they are linguists. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 13:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Can I please point out that I myself am Arvanite, or in our own language, Arberesh! We are very much Albanian, but of pre=Ottoman heritage and therefore do not call ourselves Shqiptars. Many Arvanitika people fail to call themselves Albanians because of the association with Shqiptars, which we are not. I find it odd that anyone could say that we don't exist, someobody forgot to tell me I was dead!</p>

<p>I'll repeat a question I posed a few months back, in the hope that somebody has an answer. In the audio examples provided, Albanian <i>r</i> definitely sounds like an English <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_approximant.html" title="Alveolar approximant">alveolar approximant</a> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɹ</span>), not a Spanish <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_flap.html" title="Alveolar flap">alveolar flap</a> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɾ</span>) as claimed in the article. Can anyone confirm this? No audio is provided for <i>rr</i> to establish whether it is in fact an <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_trill.html" title="Alveolar trill">alveolar trill</a> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">r</span>). Also, <i>gj</i> and <i>q</i> are given as the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_palatal_plosive.html" title="Voiced palatal plosive">voiced</a> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɟ</span>) and <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_palatal_plosive.html" title="Voiceless palatal plosive">voiceless palatal plosive</a> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">c</span>) respectively, even though they sound more like the postalveolar affricates <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate.html" title="Voiced postalveolar affricate"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">dʒ</span></a> and <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate.html" title="Voiceless postalveolar affricate"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tʃ</span></a> rather than true palatal plosives.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 13:46, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, should have said "before <i>ε, η, υ,</i> and <i>ι</i>". Palatal before front vowels, velar elsewhere. This is very common allophony. It could lead to a phonemic split eventually, as it did in English and the Romance languages.</p>
<p>Also, I wouldn't place too much confidence in the University of London page either. (Omniglot truly is unreliable, so we need not even go there except to get ideas to check out elsewhere.) The problem is that it is very common to give 'close enough' phonemic correspondances, and this page appears to be a homework assignment for an elementary linguistics class. The author could easily have copied the example from some other source without knowing anything of the language. (They might have had the palatal symbols merely for convenience, like you see for the Indic languages, and the author could have taken them at face value and added unjustified IPA descriptions. This happens all the time!) Or s/he could have simplified things to make the problem more accessible to the students. What you really need is a detailed phonetic description of these sounds, rather than just IPA labels. Indic langages don't have palatal stops, even though they're listed with the phonemes /c/ and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɟ/</span> in dozens of references. I'm not trying to claim that Albanian doesn't have these sounds - I've never heard the language - but this isn't a convincing reference. However, there would be no need for the letters <i>q</i> and <i>gj</i> if they weren't phonemes, so I think the alphabet itself is reasonably good evidence that they are <i>somehow</i> different from <i>ç</i> and <i>xh</i>. And without any better reference, we might as well leave them as palatals. I just think we should confirm this if we can. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:54, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry, I take some of that back. If Rex can attest that Albanian <i>qen</i> is pronounced as Greek <i>κεν</i> (that is, that it is a pure stop and not aspirated or an affricate), and furthermore that <i>q</i> is pronounced the same way before all other Albanian vowels, then this would be confirmation of the existance of palatal stops in Albanian, even if technically original research that should be supported elsewhere if possible. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:58, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That doesn't prove that <i>q</i> is a palatal stop, only that it contrasts with <i>ç</i> (I presume you could just as easily contrast it with <i>k</i>).

<dd>Just want to add my experience about Albanian /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɟ</span>/, /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">dʒ</span>/, /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">c</span>/ and /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tʃ</span>/. I am Italian, but I've been a dozen of times in Albania. I am always very curious about language matters, and tried to learn the most I could of Albanian.<br /></dd>
<dd>Once I asked a young girl from the area of Gramsh to teach me the difference between those sounds and she repeatedly pronounced the word 'paqe' (peace) in the correct way and — to put in evidence the difference — as it was written 'paçe'. Well, to my ear there was no difference, but she laughed a lot because in her opinion the difference were clear.<br /></dd>
<dd>It is known that if two sounds are allophones in the sound system of one's mother-tongue there is the possibility that it is not discriminable for him when in other language these are different phonemes.<br /></dd>
<dd>This often happens to Italians when try to learn English. It is hard for us to distinguish the words 'sing' and 'sin' as in Italian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ŋ]</span> is an allophone of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/n/</span>. The same happens for us with French city names "Cannes" and "Caen". There is plenty of exemples like this.<br /></dd>
<dd>All of this to say that what seems not discriminable for strangers can be absolutely evident for those who speek a certain language.<br /></dd>
<dd>Finally, I think that the exemple brought by Rex on the words "çaj" and "qaj" is the definitive proof that closes the argument.<br /></dd>

<p>Hello, I saw your edits to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian language</a>. I'm concerned that they may be a bit <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. I have a recent Albanian grammar book in front of me right now and it clearly says that there exists a "gjinore" (genetive) and a "dhanore" (dative). If you look at <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan_linguistic_union.html#Case_system" title="Balkan linguistic union">Balkan linguistic union#Case system</a>, it says that <i>in the Balkan languages, the genitive and dative cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) are merged</i>, it doesn't say that a genetive case does not exist. You say that <i>the equivalent of a genitive is formed by using the prepositions i/e/të/së with the dative</i>. Your version seems to imply that a genetive does not exist. While this may be true as far as linguists are concerned, it's a rather novel way to look at it, since the genetive is listed in every Albanian gramar book. Also, if you look at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_grammar.html" title="Romanian grammar">Romanian grammar</a>, they list a genetive there as well. Now I'm no linguist, but it does seem like original research and would make Wikipedia stand out like white amongst black if this novel apprach is taken.

<dd>We can do further referencing with the Balkan Sprachbund. Meanwhile, can you give me a single noun in Albanian that has a genitive? Do any of the books that claim a genitive give a single example? (The fact that the Albanian language has separate names for genitive and dative may only mean that it translated these from Latin or Greek.)</dd>

<dd>I once found an Aymara grammar that showed the language had the exact case system of Latin. Unfortunately, Aymara is nothing like that - the author simply assumed that all languages had Latin grammar. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 19:57, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, but it also may not. This all seems like original research to me. In Romanian (and I know this for a fact) nominative and accusative are always identical and genetive and dative are always identical. Why can we say that Romanian has two cases instead of four. The Balkan Sprachbund is about the two cases being identical. That doesn't mean that the genetive no longer exists.

<dl>
<dd>Well, yes: If Romanian has two cases, we should say it has two cases. Why, does the article say it has four? And yes, if Albanian has a single genitive-dative case, then it has one case, not two.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think you might be confusing the roles that case plays with morphological case itself. Hungarian is supposed to have 25 cases (there is debate about whether this is true, but that's irrelevant for my argument). Spanish has no case at all in its nouns. However, using prepositions, Spanish may well be able express the 25 cases of Hungarian. That is, the case roles may exist in both languages. Or perhaps Spanish with prepositions can only express half of the case roles of Hungarian: we still wouldn't say that Spanish has 12 cases. Spanish nouns don't inflect for case at all, and case is an <i>inflectional</i> category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Take the English clause <i>Mary! John just gave the dog a bone</i>. Now, the case <i>roles</i> (that is, the equivalent cases in Latin) are vocative (Mary), nominative (John), dative (the dog), and accusative (a bone). But this has nothing to do with the English case system: English only has a genitive vs. non-genitive. There is no dative, or vocative, or accusative in English nouns, and it would be misleading to have a table of English case that listed
<dl>
<dd>nominative: <i>the dog</i>. accusative: <i>the dog</i>. genitive: <i>the dog's</i>. dative: <i>to the dog</i>. vocative: <i>O dog!</i>. ablative: <i>from the dog</i>. instrumental: <i>with the dog</i>, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This completely misrepresents the English language, but seems to be what we're doing with Albanian. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 20:31, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, check out <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_nouns.html#Case" title="Romanian nouns">Romanian nouns#Case</a>. They talk about <i>syntactic case</i> and <i>morphological case</i>. The latter is 'case' in the traditional sense, and they say that nominative = accusative is one case, and that genitive = dative is a second case. Syntactic case (case roles) is a more ambiguous concept, and one where different authors are likely to disagree substantially depending on their theoretical bases. But morphological case is straightforward (do the nouns have a separate inflection, or do the not?), and this is what is normally illustrated in case tables. And <i>voilà</i>, the Romanian case table only has two entries (not counting the vocative, which we left out of the Albanian description). <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 20:44, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe, however, on what authority are we saying that this "one case" is called dative and not genetive. It could be the other way around... After all, in Greek the "one case" is the genetive (modern greek).

<dd>Call it genitive-dative if you like. (That's what they do in the Romanian article.) The label isn't important. The reason I chose the word 'dative' was because the genitive role is conveyed with a preposition, and I had assumed therefore that a bare noun would be interpreted as dative. If you believe that's not the case (ahem!), please correct it. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 21:05, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You say: "The equivalent of a genitive is formed by using the prepositions <i>i/e/të/së</i> with the dative.". This seems to me that it is not exact. <i>i/e/të/së</i> are called "nyje përaparme" that can be translated as "preposited articles" and, as you surely know, are used also with the adjectives. Prepositions are called "parafjala" and are for exemple <i>nga, tek, në, nëpër, me, për</i> and so on.<br />
I have in front of me a grammar written by Gjovalin Shkurtaj where cases are listed as five (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive and ablative). Gjovalin Shkurtaj was listed in the article we are discussing as a well known albanologist (the old article stated: ...and Gjovalin Shkurtaj who is probably the most distinguished socio-linguist in Albania today. He is the head of the Department of Linguistics at Tirana University). Now the Albanology section has been deleted. I think that Kwami's point of view on the dative-genitive merging is substantially correct, but it is a linguistical point of view and contrasts with the sense that Albanians have of their own language. They are tought at school that Albanian has five cases and will be surprised to read that they have only four (and would regard it as an error).<br />

<p>I don't see the point of the extensive table. I understand that it is useful to put Albanian in its Indo-European context, but in a general encyclopedia article like this, it is pointless to include every IE language you can think of, unless it makes a particular point: if, for example, some Albanian form can only be connected to Tocharian or Old Prussian and no other attested IE form. I have trimmed the table, but it could probably stand further trimming. The languages that are most relevant are: representatives of several IE branches (ideally as old as possible, so Latin rather than French etc.), and languages which have been in contact with Albanian since IE unity, notably Greek, South Slavic, Romanian, and Italian (to show borrowings). But the current table doesn't show borrowings.... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:09, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>i have added blertë to the list with gjelbër for 'green', and i have annotated the notes, since only kuq, verdhë, and gjelbër are borrowings (coccum, viridis, galbinus). the similarities with welsh are due to both languages borrowing the same words from latin, which therefore leads to the similarities between romanian and italian with albanian, since both are descendants of latin. though this does not include Alb zi 'black' and Welsh du, which are from entirely different sources (see below).</p>

<p>hundë means 'nose' but is not in any way related to most of the words for nose in the other indo-european languages. i didn't make the chart, but i can only assume the purpose of putting it in, just like comparing 'kuq', <i>nënë</i>, or <i>blertë</i> is to show words that are not related to most other indo-european languages, to convey the mixture in albanian.</p>
<p>i sadly do not have access right now to orel's albanian etymological dictionary, so i can't give you an etymology of the word. all i can say is that the initial h- probably comes from an sk-, based on what else i know about albanian etymology. so, clearly, no relation to NOSE.</p>

<p>for whoever added the "vocabulary" section, you should be aware that you are quoting dated material. i realize that it is accepted practice to quote this bit as often as possible when in Albania, as if to establish some sort of solid link to the past, but to presume that 1) Albanian has not significantly changed in 2000 years and that 2) the modern Albanian word forms, which if truly represented in the names listed (Thetis, Dhea, Malion, etc), would discount all etymological reconstructions that attach it to indo-european, is entirely preposterous.</p>
<p>Take for instance Thetis, supposedly equivalent to Alb <i>det</i> "sea". Notice the fuller forms of Italo-Albanian <i>dejt, dejët</i> and dialectal <i>dēt</i>, both of which indicate a much larger or fuller form, and this probably just 1000 years ago. The typical reconstruction is *<i>deubeta</i>, related to English <i>depth</i>. Further, a modern <i>d</i> cannot come from a former <i>th</i>. The two cannot be linked.</p>

Does it really mean (Balkan)Albanian or rather Caucasian Albanian? I would like to see the sources.213.216.208.231 10:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, "la lingua Albanesca" cannot be Latin, since Latin does not have article "la".213.216.208.231 09:53, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>who here besides me sees a similarity to the finnish and french languages? because from what i see, most albanian place names always have those two dots on them, like most finnish place names, Example: Kotla-Jaarve, and i also noticed a similarity between written shiqp and the french language in a book about albania i read. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.175.1.237_1f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.175.1.237">71.175.1.237</a> (talk) 16:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Many people have. The problem is that the data are sparse and hard to interpret. There are also many cranks in this field.

<p>The table of comparisons is fouled up. The columns for Albanian words often align with the wrong other languages columns. The person who created the table should fix it. Or it should be totally removed.</p>
