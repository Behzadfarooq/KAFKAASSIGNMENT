<p>AOR is term mostly used for "adult oriented rock", which has NO hint for album etc. (teens do have money to buy albums) - aor means the type of slow melodic but not "noisy" rock oriented to adults, typical bands are TOTO and Foreigner, but NOT Pink Floyd - which belongs mostly to Progressive Rock category, please listen my favorite Pink Floyd piece "Interstellar Highway".--arl</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ummm... I believe you are confused. 1st of all, the song is Interstellar Overdrive by Pink Floyd. Secondly this page is for the Radio Format AOR which indeed played Pink Floyd constantly. You are likely confused with the music genre AOR or Melodic Rock which is largely a recent, but retro style that is mostly inspired by some bands that received airplay on AOR radio stations in the late 70s and early 80s. These bands (somewhat popular in their day), like Touch, Roadmaster, 707, etc - never made the jump to the classic rock format. In recent years, mainly outside the US, there has been wave of bands aping this style. --DannyRay 19:07, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pink Floyd is big on the AOR format. Same with other 'progressive rock' bands like Yes. --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 14:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The list in this article is absurd. Black Sabbath is NOT AOR.--annon</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've heard a lot of Black Sabbath on AOR stations. "Paranoid" and "Iron Man" are pretty popular tracks.--<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 14:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree- the list here is completely misleading and simply covers many genres that are simply not AOR. If people are in agreement I will try and re-categorise the 'pure' AOR bands and include a sub-category of 'sub-AOR' for those groups that touched on the genre at times during their career but could also cross over into hard rock, prog etc. Harryurz 18:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the list is fine (though there are a few questionable artists on there). I removed obvious ridiculous entries like a-ha (I've never heard them played on an AOR station, and I certainly never heard Kate Bush on an AOR - though it would be cool if they did). This list should be a representative overall sample of artists played on AOR stations since the beginning of the format in the 1970s. Some might seem strange, like Seals &amp; Crofts, but they did get airplay in the format back in the 1970s. Perhaps the list should be separated into categories like 'artists on AOR stations today' and 'artists that were played on AOR in the past'. This could get confusing, since AOR has more or less split off into different genres like active rock and classic rock. --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 14:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
They need an AOR disambiguation page, AOR can also meen "Area Of Responsibility" in where military forces may be assigned.<a href="../../../m/_/j/User%7EM_jurrens_ea13.html" title="User:M jurrens">M jurrens</a> 16:59, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe that the A is for "album" rather than "adult". One key feature of AOR stations that distinguised it from say, top-40 was that they played not only the official singles from a given album, but often played other cuts from the albums that were never released as singles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the radio industry, the "A" in "AOR" stands for "Album", not "Adult". There is no radio format with the official name "Adult-oriented Rock". There is, however, "Rock AC". --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 14:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I recall that just before Tripple A was coined (mid-to-late 80s?), stations leaning in that direction were called Adult Oriented Rock. They were softer in sound but perhaps the playlist was deeper than AOR in the 80s. In those days KEZX in Seattle may have fell under this catagory. --DannyRay 19:07, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also I agree the list is suspect. There are notable ommissions, and there are other artists listed who'd barely get airplay on an AOR station (Rick Springfield&#160;?!?) --208.204.155.241 16:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>While a few radio stations may be currently known as AOR, by and large radio format really doesn't exist any longer. The closest format for comparison is Active Rock or Triple A. The Classic Rock format culls its core tracks from the heyday of AOR - but in reality most stations just use an oldies approach to programming, focusing on the AOR hits that crossed over to Top 40. --DannyRay 19:07, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd say that musicians like Shania Twain, Kelly Clarkson, Lifehouse, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, and Green Day are also AOR because we have an AOR station in my area that plays them as well as REO Speedwagon, Pure Prairie League, Boston, Doobie Brothers, Journey, and other AOR bands.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not an AOR station. Sounds like either a <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_AC_4d5f.html" title="Hot AC">Hot AC</a> or an <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_hits.html" title="Adult hits">adult hits</a> format. AOR doesn't play Mariah Carey and Kelly Clarkson. Green Day, yes.--<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 14:22, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page has extensive lists documenting the music played on this format. The scope of the lists are somewhat broad covering artists and tracks that may not have been played on every station operating as AOR. Some stations focused more on hard rock while others embraced a much more laid back sound. Nonetheless I advocate that these include the wider spectrum of music played on all stations. If you are adding artists or songs to the lists, please do not make deletions without posting on the discussion page for comment.</p>
<p>As the lists grow, as some point it might be wise to move them to their own pages.</p>

<p>I would dispute <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_East_cf52.html" title="Head East">Head East</a>'s inclusion on this list, or at least add a qualifier. While it's true you can't find their original albums and songs anywhere, I still hear "Never Been Any Reason" quite often on classic rock stations and it appears on an awful lot of '70s compilations. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpanishCastleMagic_8c3c.html" title="User:SpanishCastleMagic">SpanishCastleMagic</a> 22:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
