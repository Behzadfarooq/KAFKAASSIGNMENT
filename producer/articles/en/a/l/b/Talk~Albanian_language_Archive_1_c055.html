<p>This page is being supervised by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Languages_a9a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Languages">WikiProject Languages</a>. I've just gotten into the project myself, and I've gone and fixed the old pronunciation guide, which was very good but focused on alphabetization. The article as it stands then talks again about the alphabet, and then gives examples using IPA, but these do not coincide with the tables in the Sounds section. What is <i>ll</i> exactly? Velar? Velarized? Pharyngealized? How do we represent it? The examples also show the palatal consonants as palatalized velars; which are they? --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbanian_language_Archive_1_c055.html" title="Edit section: Origins of Albanian">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of Albanian</span></h2>
<p>Even if Albanian is descended from Illyrian, Illyrian would still be extinct. English is descended from Old English, and further back some Germanic dialect, but they are extinct. French is derived from Latin, which is extinct (as an everyday spoken language, at least).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then that can be mentioned in the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrian_languages.html" title="Illyrian languages">Illyrian languages</a> article. The only point of putting it here that I can see is to insinuate that <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a> have not been in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> for that long. Most sources I have seen do not support that, and I want to maintain the article in <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. As it is, the article says "Albanian is thought by some to derive principally from the Illyrian languages" which is not necessarily fact, but just the majority opinion. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 00:43, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I guess it is still worth mentioning here why we cannot know for certain whether Albanian language descends from Illyrian. This is because of the scarcity of our knowledge about Illyrian, not because Illyrian is extinct.</p>
<p>If there should be no continuity between Illyrian and Albanian, this doesn't entail that the ancestors of Albanians have not been in Albania so long. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 09:25, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't mind you writting your own version of the truth, but if we are using the same historical sources, we should remain faithful to their original wording.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's what was in this article when I came to Wikipedia. I didn't make it up, and I don't know if it is true. Are you saying you do know what's true (if so simply state based on what)? If you're not saying that then you are just making unsubstantiated claims. If we are to allow unsubstantiated sources, then I would rather leave what I found here. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 01:02, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am unaware of any sources that you might have but from what I see in your History of Albania page you recognize the 11th century Byzantine document. that document is from 1043 and mentions Albanians in the army of Giorgas Maniakis, pretender to the throne, conqueror of Southern Italy and Sicily. The Albanians are mentionned as mercenaries that he had brought to Durrës (Dyrrachion) from Southern Italy. Prior to that, there is no mention of Albanians or an Albanian state unless if you wish to claim the Greek principalities as somehow truly Albanian in everything but the name?</p>
<p>You can draw from that whichever conclusion you may wish to...</p>

<p>Three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not that it makes a difference, but was "danse" intended to be "dance"?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is "earnings" the best word with which to illustrate the schwa, especially to people (such as me, much of the time) with <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhotic.html" title="Rhotic">rhotic</a> accents? I was going to replace it with "wom<b>e</b>n," but I wasn't sure that was a big improvement. A schwa is usually (always?) in an unstressed syllable, so it's hard to come</li>
</ul>
<p>up with a good example.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's not the same as the <i>e</i> in wom<b>e</b>n. An Albanian would spell earnings as ërnings. A similar sound is also <b>a</b>llowed. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How do <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> speakers say "gondola"? Is it the sound I've seen as "gh" (i.e., <a href="../../../s/a/m/SAMPA_53ec.html" title="SAMPA">SAMPA</a> /G/)?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That one proved hard for me to figure out. I have heard some Spanish speakers make that sound when mispronouncing some words, but I couldn't remember any correct pronounciations. Perhaps it's more of a sound a Spanish speaker would make when pronouncing <b>J</b>ohn, but not quite. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the way Spanish speakers pronounce the initial "y" (as in "yo") is meant here. As to "g", in "góndola" it should be quite normal; it is different between vowels where it is pronounced as a fricative "gh", as in "luego". So I think: the Albanian "gj" is pronounced approximately like the Spanish "y" in "yo". <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 19:40, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't "yo" pronounced more like i-o? In which case it would be more like the "j" sound in Albanian. The "gj" sound is somewhere between the albanian pronounciations of "xh", "q" and "j" (the tongue is held flush against the palate). Like I said, I couldn't think of a word in a different language that made the same exact sound. By the way, the "q" pronounciation I gave is also a bad approximation, but again... --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 03:09, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My book says that "gj" is pronounced like "j", except that it is what technically is called a "stop" or a "plosive consonant". Perhaps those wirds are defined in the Wikipedia, I forgot to check it. So, I think the same description holds for the Spanish "y" in the initial position, though it might differ in some nuances. I think they pronounce "John" as "Yon", or maybe not precisely so. And there might be regional differences in the Spanish pronunciation. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 07:42, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I looked at it, but I lack the expertise (meaning I don't quite understand it, and it probably would not be as exact in the pronounciation). Perhaps a combination with the present guide could be done. If you want to tackle the SAMPA guide, you are more than welcome to. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I will make a couple of changes to the article to reflect these points. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 18:36, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have prepared a pronunciation sound file for the Albanian alphabet. I will upload and link it as soon as the Wikipedia is ready to accept uploads. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 23:09, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Done, let me know how it sounds. One thing though, for every consonant, there is an extra <b>ë</b> sound after them because that's how the sounds are pronounced in Albanian. That sound is not part of the consonant sound (except for the letter <b>ë</b> itself of course). I don't know if there are any technical ways of explaining this or if it is obvious enough, so I didn't say anything. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 02:50, 7 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure what he meant here. We cannot know whether it's old or not since it was not written until recently.

<p>Albanian is Satem ,[ Satëm means "your momma" in albanian] meaning it pertains to the Eastern branch of Indo European, centum being the western one. yes qind is centum,satem. Even though q in albanian is pronounce like the ch in the german word blümchen , i think the eastern branch is the one that changed the k to a 'sh' or 's' sound , while centum had the k unchanged. you gots to study ancient avestan to dig this stuff.

<p>I was wondering which word the Albanian Muslims (the majority) use to denote God, Allah or Zoti. Seeing as how I was raised in a Catholic Albanian family from Montenegro (I believe Albanians call it Malesi) I had only heard Zoti, and I was wondering whether the Muslims referred to God as Zoti as well. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStamford_192a.html" title="User:Stamford">Stamford</a> 00:44, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say that most use Zot to refer to God, and that includes Muslims. But Allah is used in many sayings, most of the time people don't even mean it in a religious way and they might even be Catholics or Atheists for that matter. For example: <i>Allahu na ruajt</i> (literally Allah protects us) or <i>Ishallah</i> (Allah-willing).

<p>This isn't about anything in the article, I just want to confirm somethings: I have seen a number of linguistic references (<a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Pokorny_6844.html" title="Julius Pokorny">Julius Pokorny</a>, Demiraj) say that words such as <i>gjarpër</i> (snake; compare to Latin <i>serpens</i>) and <i>gjumë</i> (sleep; compare to Latin <i>somnus</i>) are native to Albanian: Demiraj for example lists both in his Albanian Inherited Lexicon, and he doesn't say they are from Latin, and neither did Pokorny (though Pokorny's work is from 1959). So, that's what I'm trying to verify, whether these words are native to Albanian and the Latin words are cognates, or whether they are words that were borrowed from Latin. I would prefer that they are native to Albanian, because the more Latin words that Albanians have, the more people try to say that Romanians originate from "south of the Danube" near Albania. And if someone decides to respond, please provide a current reference. Decius 05:46, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know much about Albanian at all, but I would say I'm 95% sure that those are cognates, not borrowings from Latin. Why wouldn't Albanian borrow those words with <i>s</i> rather than <i>gj</i>? It wouldn't make much sense if they were borrowings. Furthermore, looking at other words that I do know are cognates, not borrowings, it seems clear that at some point, Albanian had a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_change.html" title="Sound change">sound change</a> of *s &gt; gj (though I don't know what the environment was) (for example, Alb. <i>gjashtë</i>, Latin <i>sex</i>, English <i>six</i>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_b6da.html" title="Proto-Indo-European">Proto-Indo-European</a> <i>*s(w)ek^s</i>).

With the exception of older encyclopedias, the Toska and Ghega are described as distinctive language. Further studies have shown the truth that Albanian language are divided up in two principal dialects, Gheg in the north and Tosk in the south, are separated roughly by the Shkumbin River. The big difference between the Albanian dialects has it's explanation:</p>
<p>The swedish dialect have many similarities and their is no big difference between them, this is because the country Sweden haves a low-level surface and the contact between the swedish dialects have been extensive. In Norway which is topographic alike Albania, high mountains with inaccessible and isolated places, the norwegian dialects are very different to one another cause of the almost non-contact between them.</p>
<p>The Gheg dialect is known to be slightly more archaic than Tosk. A good example to illustrate this is the evolution of the name of the city Vlora in Southern Albania. In antiquity, this city was called Avlona. The Italians call it Valona. In Gheg it is Vlona. In Tosc and now official Albania, it is Vlora, with an 'r'. Here we're dealing with rotacism i.e. 'n' evolves into 'r' for which we can display many other examples. In this respect, as well as others, Gheg is more archaic, and has therefore preserved an older version of our language.</p>
<p>But I have reasons to believe that the Arvanites in Greece and the Arberesh of Italy speak the oldest versions of our language, dialects even more archaic than Gheg. For instance, the word for 'tongue' in Arvanitika is gluha. In Gheg, it is guha; as you can see, the 'l' has been eliminated. Finally, in Tosc and official Albanian we see the most recent form; gjuha. Here the 'l' has been eliminated and the 'g' sound as evolved into the 'gj' sound, which is the equivalent of 'g' in English as in George, but with a much smoother sound to it (the 'xh' sound in our language is the real equivalent to the English 'g'). The arvanitika form is definetely the oldest variant; it's also used by the priest John Buzuku in his book "Meshari" (The Missal) in 1555, a book which was written in the Gheg dialect.</p>
<p>Another example to display this archaic form of Arvanitika is the word for crying, which in Arvanitika is kliaj. In Gheg it is kjaj, or kaj; here, the 'l' has been transformed into 'j' which is common in our language. Recently though, the 'j' has also been eliminated, thus it is just kaj. In Tosc it is qaj; here the 'k' has evolved into 'q', a sound which is the English equivalent of ch as in change, but with a much smoother sound to it (the 'ç' sound is real equivalent to the English 'ch'). The same change is obvious in Makedhonía becoming Maqedonía, where 'k' becomes 'q' but also 'dh' becomes 'd'!</p>
<p>The Arvanites also say klumesht instead of qumesht to milk. This is why I believe their dialect is the most archaic one. And it wouldn't be surprising. Beeing that they were spearated from the main bulk of our population, they preserved the language spoken then, and therefore it has evolved less. The same applies for the Icelandese; beeing that these Vikings separated at an early stage from the main bulk of the Scandinavians, they preserved the most archaic form of ancient Old Norse.</p>
<p>Arvanítika is definitely a variety of Tosk Albanian that have preserved the most archaic form of ancient Albanian language with which it is somewhat mutually intelligible and also to a much lesser degree with Gheg, and is not independent from Albanian language like Theathenae is trying to imply, neither is the dialect spoken by the Arbëreshë people independent from Albanian language. The both dialects are variety of Tosk Albanian, one is influenced by Greek language and the other one by Italian language. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 09:35, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps Tosk is a dialect of Arvanitic, then, if Arvanitic is the original language? Your examples probably indicate the Greek influence on Arvanitic more than anything else. 'Tongue' in Greek is <i>glóssa</i> and 'he cries' is <i>klaíei</i>. These are both ancient Greek words, not loanwords from Arvanitic or Albanian. It could be the case that Arvanitic preserves ancient Illyrian words which were close cognates of their Greek counterparts, but I would be more inclined to believe they were borrowed directly from Greek, or that Greek influenced the original Illyrian forms. I wouldn't take Arvanitic as an accurate reflection of the original Illyrian tongue, precisely because of this heavy Greek influence. Gheg is probably far closer to the mark, because of its relative isolation and lack of contact with Greek and Latin.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 10:07, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Three points: 1)There is no convincing evidence that the Albanian languages are descended from Illyrian languages; 2) Arvanitic <i>gluha</i> may well be from PIE *glogh-ya, from which ancient Greek <i>glossa</i>/<i>glotta</i> also come; 3) Arvanitic <i>kliaj</i> may well be from PIE *kleu, from which anc. Greek <i>klaio/klao</i> also come. I'm betting a linguistic reference would say they are not from Greek. Decius 13:44, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are of course those who believe the Arvanites descend from the Pelasgians and other pre-Hellenic peoples of Greece. I tend to be rather more sceptical about such claims, or claims such as Albanau's that "Language X" is the "true original language" or that the Albanians are the "original people" of the Balkans, etc. The <a href="../../../p/i/e/PIE_6ab0.html" title="PIE">PIE</a> forms you cite are of course hypothetical, so no one can be certain. It is also conceivable that Arvanitic lost the 'l' along with its Albanian relatives but regained it under the influence of Greek. From PIE *glogh-ya to gluha to guha and back again to gluha as a result of the influence of glóssa. The possible scenarios are endless. As for the Illyrian controversy, the problem with all the palaeo-Balkan languages is that they left behind almost no records. We know too little about them to know for sure whether any modern languages descend from them, especially when these modern languages have scant written records themselves.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 14:09, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Finally, I want to say that the two words mentioned above, of the great safety, they are of Greek origin, however the Arvanitic words are not borrowed directly from Greek, the forms indicate that, the forms are akin to Toska and Ghega much more then to the Greek form. However, I never used this as an argument that Albanian language have Illyrian origin. The words may have been borrowed from Greek somewhere between 1000- 1500 century, we have many Greek words in the Albanian language from that time, so with with all well meaning don't disort the things I say. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 14:25, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All modern linguists without a pan-Albanian agenda like you would call Arvanitic a distinct language, not a dialect of Tosk, even if they are closely related. I did not say Gheg and Tosk had an Ausbau relationship; they are very different languages. "An <a href="../../../a/u/s/Ausbausprache.html" title="Ausbausprache">Ausbausprache</a> (also called an ausbau language) is a language which has a standard spelling, a standard grammar and a relatively wide and clear vocabulary (and is thus almost identical with a standard language). Two language forms that allow easy mutual communication can nevertheless be regarded as two different languages if they are each an Ausbausprache according to this definition." Arvanitic is of course much closer to Tosk than Gheg, but they still have only about 50% mutual intelligibility. Perhaps Arvanitic and Tosk are not even close enough to be in an Ausbau relationship in the same way that Serbian and Croatian or Hindi and Urdu are. But Arvanitic does have its own <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_alphabet.html" title="Arvanitic alphabet">alphabet</a>, orthography and grammar, as well as a very distinct and heavily Greek vocabulary. And the Arvanites themselves have a Greek national identity that is completely distinct from the Albanians. National identity alone is enough to separate the otherwise almost identical Serbian and Croatian languages, which are much closer to each other than Arvanitic and Tosk. These are scientific facts. You can choose to ignore them, but they are not open to debate.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 14:48, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more thing. Gheg and Tosk are considered dialects of the same Albanian language only because their speakers choose to belong to the same nation, not because Gheg and Tosk are actually mutually intelligible or particularly similar in a purely objective linguistic sense. That's fine, but don't project that concept onto peoples like the Arvanites who do not belong to the Albanian nation. The use of the reductive term <i>dialect</i> for Arvanitic in this context is entirely arbitrary and political, not to mention unscientific..--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 15:36, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What a incredibly boneheaded remark, you actually mean that Tosk and Gheg are Ausbausprache, like Danish and Norwegian, that's so inaccurate. I can't find any logical reasoning in support of your thesis, and once again you are distorting science. Presumably you have been reading an older encyclopedia, a few older encyclopedia's mention the Tosk and Gheg as two distinct languages but this is spurious logic at its worst. This theory have been rejected by linguistics who have studied Albanian dialectology (unlike you), they have come to the conclusion that Tosk and Geg are the two principal dialects of the Albanian language. It is relevant to mention that difference between the dialects of the Albanian language are much, much bigger then other dialects of other European languages. In concern to the Arvanitic language spoken by the Arvanites people in Greece and the Arberesh language spoken by the Arberesh people in Italy, the two languages are approved to be a variety of Tosk Albanian by linguistics, <a href="http://print.google.com/print?id=tRGSmX1ziNkC&amp;pg=118&amp;lpg=118&amp;dq=Arvan%C3%ADtika&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DArvan%25C3%25ADtika%2Bword%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;sig=I7U8bCh_-BdbwoY80hSgfO_fiQA" class="external autonumber" title="http://print.google.com/print?id=tRGSmX1ziNkC&amp;pg=118&amp;lpg=118&amp;dq=Arvan%C3%ADtika&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DArvan%25C3%25ADtika%2Bword%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;sig=I7U8bCh_-BdbwoY80hSgfO_fiQA" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://print.google.com/print?id=PBeGOLDusJgC&amp;pg=1&amp;lpg=1&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DArvan%25C3%25ADtika%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;sig=hbbVLyhh81VcLlAuvbitililU4w" class="external autonumber" title="http://print.google.com/print?id=PBeGOLDusJgC&amp;pg=1&amp;lpg=1&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DArvan%25C3%25ADtika%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;sig=hbbVLyhh81VcLlAuvbitililU4w" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<p>Albanians have today a lower literacy rates, because, the communist in Albania have reduced the lack of literacy dramaticly. Today one who speak grammatically correct Tosk Albanian can understand a Geg speaker who speak grammatically correct Geg and vise versa, and can also comprehend the written dialect. While one who speak vulgar Tosk and another who speak vulgar Geg can't understand each other so well or not at all. Since people in Albania and in other parts in the Balkans, both Tosk-speakers and Geg-speakers, are learning the Albanian unit language the difference between Tosk and Geg are rapidly disappearing and due to the movements. Therefore Tosk and Geg have no longer limited mutual intelligibility, now, Tosk and Geg is mostly mutually intelligible. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 20:04, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Theathenae, REX, Albanau, et al.: Could we please, I beg you, not let the revert war from <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> and the vitriol from <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanites_53e1.html" title="Talk:Arvanites">Talk:Arvanites</a> spill onto this page?</p>
<p>Let's agree that the issue of Arvanitic is at best secondary on this page. The current version seems to split the difference between dialect and language by placing the phrase "Languages sharing a common origin..." in a section called "Dialects". One nod to REX, one to Theathenae. I don't think any 'innocents' reaching this page will be scarred by this combined usage.</p>
<p>The comparative advantage of this page relative to already established authoritative encyclopedias, such as Enc. Britannica, is, besides the free accessibility, the contribution of native speakers and native - or otherwise highly qualified - linguists. After all, what is more likely: that, say, a dispassionate Englishman visiting this page will care more about the linguistic features of modern standard Albanian, or that he will seek here the subtleties of Arvanitic and its relation to Tosk Albanian (esp. given that these are discussed to death on another, dedicated page)?</p>
<p>As a native speaker of Albanian with a strong interest in languages and linguistics, I could contribute a fair bit of technical information about the Albanian language, but I won't bother doing so on a page that has degenerated into chaos. You may remember another user, Dori, who made some decent contributions, but in the end pulled out from Wikipedia altogether. I think that was a pity, but not entirely unjustified. <a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApapa_2553.html" title="User:Apapa">Apapa</a> 06:54, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hoping that the dialect/language compromise above resolves the 'Arvanitic' tension, I would also hope we can sort out the intelligibility question between Tosk and Geg. (Just these two, say anything you want or nothing at all about the intelligibility of Arberesh and Arvanitic with Tosk/Geg, I am almost completely disinterested in those.) Anyone who has grown up in Albania knows that the two dialects are mutually intelligible, with the exception of some isolated, extreme forms. The Republic of Albania, though fragmented by its geography, is too small to have or sustain such significant splits, let alone any "inherent" ones. Even the sealing of the borders between Yugoslavia and Albania has not produced such a wall of mutual unintelligibility. Kosovars and southern, Tosk-speaking Albanians certainly find each-other's accents very "heavy", but it's most unusual for them to find each-other unintelligible.</p>
<p>Yes, this does mean that <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> is wrong on this point. If you read the preceding link, this error is perfectly understandable: I gather that their main focus is not linguistic research per se, but "primarily to provide the speakers with native language biblical texts." Furthermore, their statement does not even purport to be authoritative: "<b>Reported to be</b> inherently unintelligible with Gheg Albanian" (emphasis mine.) Their proportions for Geg/Tosk speakers in Rep. of Alb., 300K vs 2.9mill, are also completely off the mark. The split, like the geographic one, is a lot more balanced.</p>
<p>The current, full, online version of Enc. Brit. puts it best: "Gheg and Tosk have been diverging for at least a millennium, and their less extreme forms are mutually intelligible."</p>
<p>So, in the interest of accuracy, I will try and act on the above, very gingerly and trying not to step on anyone's toes, least of all on those of our non-Albanian neighbors. I hope you will let this be, so we can move on to more interesting features. <a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApapa_2553.html" title="User:Apapa">Apapa</a> 06:54, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening Apapa. I liked the data you provided about the language changes in the '70s. I've read somewhere that Shqipe is not 100% Tosk but also has some Gheg elements (10% perhaps). If you know more about this, please add the relevant information.</p>
<p>Let me also say that you may want to consider improving the phrase <i>are mutually intelligible depending on the level of speakers' <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy.html" title="Literacy">literacy</a> and proficiency in standard Albanian. In their purest <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernacular.html" title="Vernacular">vernacular</a> forms, Gheg and Tosk are inherently unintelligible</i>, rather than replacing it with <i>are mutually intelligible, except in their more extreme forms.</i> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 15:48, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Matia; hi Rex. You are absolutely right, Matia, Standard Albanian is not 100% Tosk but does incorporate elements of Geg, esp. of the literary Geg tradition. (I am not sure how to quantify the proportion of each dialect's contribution.) I think that section can be improved and expanded significantly, which I might attempt to do, if the page proves to be a stable and constructive medium. (I can also establish a grammar page and link to it, along the lines of the Latin grammar page.)</p>
<p>It is true, btw., that a certain measure of linguistic 'violence' was inflicted upon Geg speakers and their dialect, and that this was in large part due to the fact that the Communist elite, who emerged as winners of the WWII power struggles, were in large part southerners. But it wasn't all arbitrary. Phonetically, and lexically etc., Standard Albanian is closest to the Elbasan variant, which is on the boundary between the two dialects. So, it is very different from many of the southern Tosk regional variants and much closer to Geg than any of them. I think it's a good compromise, but more importantly, it was a natural choice, because this region produced many of the early influential scholars who established the study and teaching of the modern language. Moreover, many writers had already made this choice long before the Congress of 1972 formalized it. Elbasan is, then, to Albanian what Tuscany is to Italian.</p>
<p>As for the <i>intelligibility</i> phrase, I can honestly say that I did think about it long and hard, before altering it. The problem with the phrase is that it's quite concise and specific and therefore leaves hardly any room to maneuver. There are two factual claims there: a) that the mutual intelligibility is dependent on the mediation of Standard Albanian and b) that the 'pure' versions are inherently unintelligible. Now, I personally would not care much whether these points were in fact true or not; one outcome does not please me more than the other, as an Albanian or a student of languages or history etc. It just so happens that the statement is incorrect and I will probably call the attention of the Ethnologue people to it, so they can fix it. a) is easy to see because Standard/Literary Albanian was codified only in the early '70s, and if you go further back in time and pick an average Geg and an avg Tosk, they'd communicate just fine, with the occasional raised eyebrow (and with each probably laughing silently at the other's funny accent). b) this part suffers from this notion of 'inherent unintelligibility' - besides the problem of 'purity', which is thorny because you have regional variants even between Geg and Tosk, yet none of them can be considered to coincide with a 'pure' Geg/Tosk. But, in fact, because the divergence has only been going on for about a thousand years and over a relatively small area, that 'recent' common root and the area of change dictate an <i>inherent intelligibility</i>, which can be occasionally marred or obscured by regional 'flavors', but is far from being obliterated. That's why I felt that the pithy EB formulation of <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/lla/archives.shtml#eric_hamp" class="external text" title="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/lla/archives.shtml#eric_hamp" rel="nofollow">Prof. Hamp</a>, which I paraphrased, was best at conveying this fact - which is evident to Albanians - to foreign readers. I hope I am expressing myself clearly.</p>
<p>In any case, if I get the time to contribute in more detail about the features of each of the dialects (to a separate, linked page and perhaps with transcribed examples of several Geg and Tosk variants from different regions of Albania), the degree of closeness would become apparent, through visual inspection, even to non-Albanians. <a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApapa_2553.html" title="User:Apapa">Apapa</a> 23:59, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we should copy these comments on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbanian_language_46d5.html" title="Talk:Albanian language">Talk:Albanian language</a>, they are interesting, and perhaps other people would like to read them too. I'm guessing that Ethnologue talk about more <i>archaic</i> versions of Tosk and Gheg (perhaps before 1900, or something similar). As for the percentage (90% -10%) I've mentioned it because I hoped you knew more than me about it. Maybe we 'll find something in the long run. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 08:36, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, Matia. Given that the two dialects have been diverging for most of the past one thousand years [although recently increased internal migrations might reverse that trend], I'd say that the further back in time you go, the closer they'd be to each other. I'd also find it a little strange than an organization like Ethnologue, which focuses on creating and disseminating biblical texts in native languages, would focus primarily, or even at all, on archaic versions of such dialects. But then, they provide a very brief statement and don't describe their sources and discovery process, so we can only speculate what they had in mind. <a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApapa_2553.html" title="User:Apapa">Apapa</a> 20:30, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a>, in light of your revert on this topic, I'd like to ask you again to participate in this discussion before taking unilateral action. A revert war not does not serve our audience well at all. I am trying very hard to explain myself in full <i>before</i> taking any action, and it seems that at least Matia is appreciating such contributions. Don't you think that is more constructive?</p>
<p>As you can see, a fairly constructive discussion has been taking place above on the relative merits and authority of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>. Won't you please join in? And I ask you again, could we leave aside the issue of Arvanites and the sentiments it seems to inspire, while we discuss <i>this</i> page?</p>
<p>To be clear, both the Tosk and Gheg entries in Ethnologue are wrong on the topic of intelligibility. I outlined the 'why' above. The Gheg page has other glaring errors that further undermine its authority, e.g. the Albanian name of the language is given as 'Shgip', not 'Shqip'. So, I am not altogether sure why you place so much faith on this site, to the disadvantage of all other sources and arguments. Are we really helping Wikipedia if we blindly anchor ourselves to the errors of others?</p>
<p>Furthermore, once you leave out Arvanitic, what are the controversial implications of whether Tosk and Geg are or are not mutually intelligible? Really, I, along with probably most other Albanians, wouldn't really care if in fact the two dialects were <i>inherently unintelligible</i>. For me it's not a loaded issue at all. All it is is a glaring error on Wikipedia that dilutes the worth of this page and hence of any contribution made to it. Now, if I were curious whether some Greek dialect of the north is mut. intel. with one from the Peloponnesus, I'd simply take a 'yes' or 'no' on faith, from any native Greek speaker, because I imagine they can a) easily tell and b) have no reason for misrepresentation. Same thing for Italians and their various dialects and so on... So I am puzzled that you feel so strongly about this, that you are prepared to override any and all other sources or contributors, purely on the basis of your own non-native knowledge (I presume?), your emotions perhaps, and finally one source, the Ethnologue, which does not even purport to be authoritative on the subject, but on the contrary, explicitly qualifies one of its statements as secondhand ["reported to be..."]</p>
<p>I need to know if you are prepared to consider at all the possibility that Ethnologue might be wrong, or whether instead you think this page should be subordinated, w.r.t. this topic, to the Ethnologue and no other source or contribution. Because if it's the latter, then I'd be forced to try and get the Ethnologue people to correct their errors before correcting any such in the Wikipedia, and that's too high an entry barrier for Wiki contributions, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I really do think we can be more cool-headed and constructive about this and am genuinely interested in hearing from you. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApapa_2553.html" title="User:Apapa">Apapa</a> 22:33, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, REX. As I say on my page, I am almost more fascinated by 'Wikipedia, the experiment in social interaction', than its content. My first choices for content are still closely edited encyclopedias, with <i>invited</i> contributions, that have earned their authority in the open market. So I am a Wikiskeptic. Nevertheless, I see great potential in Wikipedia and I start with the assumption that those who return repeatedly and spend time on a topic do so out of genuine and constructive interest, whereas vandalism is mostly perpetrated by transients. So, I expect that Theathenae will be interested in a real conversation, one as free of irony and unhelpful emotions as can be had. But in the end, I will refrain from significant contributions until the page appears stable and constructive.

<p>Hi Rex,</p>
<p>A couple comments on the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps Geg &amp; Tosk are only marginally intelligible? Lyovin, for example, reports they are unintelligible.</li>
<li>I would point out that there are longstanding native Albanian communities in Italy and Greece, not just recent immigrant communities as in Sweden. I'm not sure of my history here, but I wouldn't be surprised if Albanians have been in some parts of Italy as long as the Italians!</li>
<li>You don't make it clear that there are Albanian communities in Montenegro, not just in Kosovo, until you discuss Geg.</li>
<li>Your consonant chart is missing <i>ch</i> and <i>xh</i>.</li>
<li>It would be nice to include a phoneme chart for Geg as well. Shouldn't be too hard to come by.</li>
<li>I wouldn't call <i>ë</i> "schwa", but instead a 'mid central vowel' (if that's what it is). The word "schwa" has implications of being unstressed and easily elided, and not necessarily being mid central. I assume Albanian <i>ë</i> can be stressed?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It depends. Originally, it couldn't be stressed, but the currently, in Gheg it cannot be stressed, but it seems that there are some cases in Tosk where it can be stressed. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 23:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, probably best to leave it as <i>schwa</i> then. Might want to explain it's not normally stressed. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 01:37, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Unfortunately, I can't play the sound files. I am always suspicious about claims of a language having palatal stops. They're really quite rare. You say they're like Hungarian (which are affricates as often as stops), but also like Czech, and the Czech sounds aren't palatal at all! They're palatalized coronals, quite a different thing. Also, I've always heard that Albanian <i>q</i> and <i>gj</i> were palatalized velars.</li>
<li>Discuss written forms before Hoxha? There were a couple alphabets invented for Albanian; you could link to those.</li>
<li>Case: It doesn't look like Albanian has separate genitive and dative cases. Rather, the genitive appears to be formed from a preposition plus the dative. You may find references that claim there is a genitive, but that doesn't mean much. Many traditional grammars use Latin as a model, and try to force the language into the Latin case system. Can you find examples of words that have distinct genitive and dative cases? If not, I would relegate the genitive to a footnote.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, there are no distinct forms for Genitive and Dative. See: <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan_linguistic_union.html" title="Balkan linguistic union">Balkan linguistic union</a> <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 23:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Might want to point out that similar definite suffixes are found throughout the region (at least in Romanian and Bulgarian, I believe) as part of a <i>Sprachbund</i>. Albanian is the most likely source for this areal feature.</li>
<li>How about a chart comparing old Albanian words with other branches of Indo-European? There were some convoluted sound shifts in Albanian, which took it a while to be recognized as an Indo-European language. Just look at the word for 'three'. That would be interesting to talk about.</li>

<p>The map contains a couple of serious errors in need of correction. <i>Arvanitika</i> is concentrated in <i>southern</i> Greece, well away from the Albanian border, and is not considered a dialect of Albanian by the overwhelming majority of its speakers.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 12:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um Theathenae, this article is not about the Arvanites who are well away from the Albanian border and consider their language seperate from Albanian. It is about <i>inter alia</i> those precious individuals (estimated at about 30,000) who form Shqiptaret of Cameria. They consider their language a dialect of Albanian and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sali_Berisha_42e9.html" title="Sali Berisha">Sali Berisha</a> and the <a href="../../../u/%C3%A7/k/U%C3%87K_603a.html" title="UÇK">UÇK</a> see them as an important footstep for the aim of forming a "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Albania_7973.html" title="Greater Albania">Greater Albania</a>". This has nothing to do with the Arvanites (who reject Berisha's claims, they are useless for these purposes). If only the Helsinki Report didn't say that they spoke Arvanitika, life would be so much easier. Sadly though, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> steps in and imposes this map. Anyway, Theathenae, I and everyone else have agreed to calling Arvanitika a language in its own right, despite the fact that all sources and the consensus on the talk page require us to do the opposite. In <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consideration.html" title="Consideration">consideration</a>, the least you can do for this <i>enormous favour</i> is to stop being so rigid. The Arvanites are irrelevant here. Why have all references to them been removed? Because it's not about them. It's about the Albanian language.

<p>Sorry, read the Helsinki Report. There are people who live in northwestern Greece, who are Arvanites and perceive themselves to be Albanians (ie they believe that Arvanites and Albanians are the same thing). Also, given that the sources (well explained on <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">Talk:Arvanitic language</a>) including <a href="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-74918" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-74918" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a>, which says: <i>All of the Albanian dialects spoken in Italian and Greek enclaves are of the Tosk variety and seem to be related most closely to the dialect of Çamëria in the extreme south of Albania.</i> Doesn't this indicate that an Albanian dialect is spoken in Greece. Who speaks it. You assert that the Arvanites in southwestern Greece do not speak an Albanian dialect, therefore that leaves us with the Arvanites of Epirus who have no objection to being called Arvanites. Also, as the Helsinki Report say that they speak Arvanitika, it is accurate.

<p>If you like, "Arvanitika" could be replaced with "Arberishte". As Arvanitika is written in the Greek alphabet, it wouldn't cause confusion. Especially considering that Arvanitika can refer to the speech of both these people.

<dd>I honestly don't think it can. The Helsinki report says nothing about whether the <i>Shqiptár</i> of Epirus actually identify as <i>Arvanites</i>. It simply slaps the label on them without exploring the possibility that perhaps they are just an extension of the ethnic Albanian population of neighbouring Albania rather than belonging to the distinct group of people that specifically call themselves <i>Arvanites</i>. If they call themselves <i>Shqiptár</i>, why would they call their language <i>Arvanitika</i>? Does it not make more sense that they would call it <i>Shqip</i>? As for whether or not an Albanian dialect is spoken in Greece, I presume more than one is spoken since the influx of the 1990s.&#160;;)--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 13:44, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but the Helsinki Report doesn't make such provisions. It says that Arvanites are those whose mother tounge in Arvanitika and that there is a 30,000 strong number in northwestern Greece who call themselves in their own language Shqiptar (Albanians). You cannot question sources, you know that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. We are looking for verifiability (of which we have plenty), not truth. Also, the Helsinki Report is no clear on the composition of the Epiriote Shqiptar. Does that number include the Çam for example? Who knows? We'd better play it safe and just assume that the Helsinki authors know something we don't. They aren't just writing off the top of their heads. Anyway, the Albanian designation is in Epirus, not Attica or Evia.

<p>And which clause says that? Can you copy-paste please *smirk*? I have explained why that link belongs here. If credible sources say something, who are you to say otherwise? This has nothing to do with the Arberor. It is relevant to the Shqiptar (who speak the same language/dialect as the Arberor). If you can find a source to support you POV, please produce it. Also, I have conceded to that blatant POV push in the title of <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> in return for a consideration which has not yet become apparent. If you refuse to accept the sources and WP policy I will have to re-initiate the poll to move the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> article.

<dd>This isn't about bargains or doing deals, and such an approach would not be looked upon kindly by the arbitrators deciding your fate. This is about the facts. We actually have no sources that define the language of the <i>Shqiptár</i> of Epirus as <i>Arvanitika</i>. In fact, if you look carefully, the report actually calls their language - surprise, surprise! - <i>Shqip</i>. And I quote: <i>they have preferred the term Arvanite (Arberor in their own language) for the people and Arvanitika (Arberichte) for the language, as opposed to Albanian (Shqiptar for the people and Shqip for the language) that Albanians use for themselves and their language -with the exception of the Arvanites of Northwestern Greece, as mentioned above</i>. If you want to be technical, find a source that <i>specifically</i> supports your case.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 14:13, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh my, I have read that report time and time again, and I didn't notice that. So sorry. I'll initiate procedures for changing the picture immediatly.

<p>I removed the reference to the Arvanites from the picture. I daren't imagine what bogdan will think (he made to original).
