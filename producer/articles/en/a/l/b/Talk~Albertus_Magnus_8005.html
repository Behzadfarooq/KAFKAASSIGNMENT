<p><br />
Magnus studied at the University of <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padua.html" title="Padua">Padua</a>, a major scientific center at the time, and joined the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Order_2f62.html" title="Dominican Order">Dominicans</a> in 1223. After completing his studies he taught theology; about 1240, he went to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and achieved the degree of master in sacred <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> in 1245 or 1246. For the next thirty years he worked as teacher and administrator, as provincial of his order in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and as <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratisbon.html" title="Ratisbon">Ratisbon</a>, tramping across <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. At Cologne and Paris he had <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_b8c6.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> as his student.</p>
<p>He worked on logic, philosophy, theology and exegesis, studying nature in detail. He wrote down his unbiased views of his environment in a huge encyclopedia. He was also experienced in <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">botany</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, and <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanics.html" title="Mechanics">mechanics</a>, which made some people think of him as a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">magician</a>. Magnus also tried to introduce the thinkings of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristoteles.html" title="Aristoteles">Aristoteles</a> into the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, a task that was later completed by his scholar Aquinas.</p>
<p>From 1270 on he stayed in Cologne; today, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cologne_2e1b.html" title="University of Cologne">University of Cologne</a> carries his name. He was canonized and declared a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_the_Church_aba9.html" title="Doctor of the Church">Doctor of the Church</a> in 1931. He is the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patron_saint.html" title="Patron saint">patron saint</a> of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_science.html" title="Natural science">natural science</a>.</p>
<p>More text to integrate: The Dominican's house in Cologne is the St. Andreas Kloster. The house and church is still there and contains the shrine of Albertus Magnus.</p>

<p>Why is Albert categorized as an "occult author"? I'm not even exactly sure what the category means. Does it merely mean he wrote about spiritual subjects? Or is it more specific? <a href="../../../m/l/o/User%7EMlouns_fbae.html" title="User:Mlouns">Mlouns</a> 06:01, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The category of Occult authors refers to those whose work deals with magic, spell-craft, and religio-magical traditions. It includes such forms of writing as grimoires, wonder books, and spell books. It includes topics such as the kaballah, tarot, alchemy, astrology, and folk magic. In the case of Albertus Magnus we are presented with a complex situation: there are a number of wonder books and collections of folk magical spells and other grimoire-like material that are attributed to him -- but they were almost certainly not written by him. Among these, the most famous is <i>Egyptian Secrets of Albertus Magnus.</i> I would be perfectly content to see those responsible for the page on Albertus Magnus create a page on "Pseudo Albertus Magnus" -- but until that is done and the links are properly reformatted, there is no other place to link the author of the books attribued to Albertus Magnus except to the Albertus Magnus page. I am working in the occult and folk magic sections, not the Catholic cleric sections, and i would be glad to collaborate on a compromise that would leave everyone happy. What say you? <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineyronwode_cae5.html" title="User:Catherineyronwode">Catherineyronwode</a> 06:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that a good compromise would be to have an alternate entry for the works attributed to him that he did not actually do. But like you, I'm not sure how to work that in wikipedia. Perhaps you could add a few words in the main Albert entry explaining the situation, since right now, the categorization kind of comes from nowhere. Maybe later it would be expanded into a separate article. <a href="../../../m/l/o/User%7EMlouns_fbae.html" title="User:Mlouns">Mlouns</a> 14:38, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All right, i will attempt to create a short subsection on this topic for the Albertus Magnus page. I also agree that a new pge called Albertus Magnus (Spurious) be created. (The scholarly name for the unknown author(s) who wrote the occult books is "the Spurious Albertus Magnus" -- but if the word "Spurious" comes first in the Wiki name, rather than in a trailing parenthesis, the new page will fall out of alphabetical order in Wiki's auto-generated category pages, which would not be good, since occultists generally refer to the author(s) of these works as Albertus Magnus for short, even through we know they were not written by Albertus Magnus.) I do not have time to do the full writing this morning, as i have other tasks at hand, but i will try to get to this before the week is over. Please be patient with me, or, if you are so inclined and can get to it more quickly than i can, please take it on yourself. The plan is to (1) produce a short sub-head within the AM article, and then (2) create an AM(S) page. At that point there will be (3) a disambiguation link at the top of the AM page and (4) a disambiguation link on the AM(S) page, (5) retention of the short subhead on the AM page itself that describes the issue, with (6) a link in the AM subhead leading to the new AM(S) page. Does this accord with what you proposed? <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineyronwode_cae5.html" title="User:Catherineyronwode">Catherineyronwode</a> 18:39, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed the date of birth from 1193 to 1206 and added his status as "first son" (this was important in his day) as this is the information as it appears in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> and is properly referenced. If someone wishes to include a birth reference to 1193, or a range of dates, then please do so, otherwise the simpler 1206 should stand. Also, his status as first son is referenced and cannot be removed based on original research, i.e. because "there is no record of opposition to his entry into the Dominican order" - this should also be referenced before inclusion (an inferrance doesnt trump a reference, and we frown on original research). If there is no commentary I will restore both points. <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvan_1d4e.html" title="User:Istvan">István</a> 17:52, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
