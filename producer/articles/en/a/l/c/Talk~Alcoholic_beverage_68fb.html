<p>Many studies used as sources do not disclose or consider proxy variables (unapparent variables that significantly affect the outcome than the claimed causative variables of the study), so many of the "facts" are incorrect. For example, many studies put ex-drinkers and lifetime abstainers into one group, which makes the "abstainer" group less healthy overall.</p>

In reality, research began addressing this problem years ago and the results remain the same. In addition, many of the mechanisms whereby alcohol reduces cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death, are clearly understood. So not only is it an established fact that alcohol in moderation reduces cardiovascular disease, but we know how it reduces them. There is consensus about this in the medical research community. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> 18:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do the negative effects of alcohol correlate to consumption? How do the positive effects of alcohol correlate to consumption?

<p>Apparently the only verified benefits have been from red wine due to the antioxidants in the tannins, not the alcohol. The only other benefit from alcohol, is that drinking some alcohol (i.e. wine) prior to eating will serve to kill bacteria in the food. Also, in times in the middle ages when town/city water supplies were contaminated with e. coli, it was safer to drink beer than to drink the water. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 18:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>However, alcohol in itself is indeed solely toxic. --<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> 19:55, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So why does the article say that moderate alcohol consumption is good for one's health? -71.50.156.132</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are rasonable questions, but there are very good reasons why the article reports that moderate drinking is good for heath. The consensus within the medical research community is that the consumption of alcohol in moderation causes better health and greater longevity than either abstaining or abusing alcohol. Well known medical authority Dean Edell, M.D., asserts that "you would have to be living on another planet not to know that alcohol -- in moderation -- is good for your health."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Research demonstrates that the risk of dying in any given year is 25 percent lower for those who consume moderate amounts of alcohol. Abstaining from alcohol is a health risk factor; that is, it increases the chance of poor health and death. That’s why the science-based Harvard Good Eating Pyramid recommends the moderate consumption of alcohol (beer, wine, distilled spirits) for everyone except those with a good reason not to drink.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many of the mechanisms whereby alcohol leads to better heart health are understood. Among other things, drinking alcohol in modertion lowers LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and raises HDL ("good" cholesterol), reduces blood pressure, increases coronary blood flow, reduces platelet aggregation, reduces fibrinogen, and increases fibrinolysis.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some critics suggest that the benefits of moderate drinking could be obtained from a regimen of eating a very low-fat diet, vigorously exercising regularly, eliminating salt from the diet, and losing weight. However, Dr. Eric Rimm of Harvard reports that people have increases of 10 to 30 percent in HDL ("good" cholesterol) in a week from drinking alcohol. That’s much easier for most people than following a demanding diet and exercise program. In adition, the consumption of alcohol in moderation further enhances the health benefits of a good diet, a vigorous exercise program, and successful weight loss.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the abuse of alcohol can have negative health consequences.David Justin 16:59, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's a bunch of bias and misinformation, "David Justin" (which not a real username, just a person who doesn't want to be held accountable for their post). You're trying to make eating moderately and exercising seem like a very hard thing. <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">Weasel words</a>, like "demanding" and "diet", are used. You also attempt to argue that eating moderately and exercising is a complicated process by increasing the number of things one can do in your contrived list of things to do ("eating a very low-fat diet, vigorously exercising regularly, eliminating salt from the diet, and losing weight") by adding unneccesary statments - "eliminating salt from the diet" and "losing weight". The "eliminating salt" statement is not factual because sodium is a vital mineral required for vital bodily functions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium#Notable_characteristics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium#Notable_characteristics" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The "losing weight" statement is obviously there to make their list seem longer - losing weight is a result of exercising and does not need to be stated. In addition, "<i>Vigorously</i> exercising" and "<i>very</i> low-fat" are weasel statements.</dd>

<p>because it seemed too simplistic and possibly inaccurate. My impression was that there is no uniformity in the legal status of alcoholic beverages among "muslim" countries (whatever that means); and that even among countries that adopt the strict Islamic law as state law would allow commerce and consumption of alcoholic beverages by Christians and Jews.

<dd>Now that's what I call some heavy references. "Some teachers when I was in school". I live in Islamic Republic of Mauritania, where, as in most countries that accept the term "islamic" for their state, foreigners are allowed to import alcohol through their embassies, and foreign owners of retaurants are allowed to sell alcohol to foreigners. And I'm only talking about the law here. As it is a lucrative business, practice is even cooler. I don't think you could find more than 2 countries in the world that would actually apply death penalty to locals drinking alcohol, let alone foreigners. One of my best friend was found drunk in the street in Saudi Arabia (there is hardly a more muslim country) last year, and spent one night in jail, as he would have in Nevada.

<p>That's one thing that bugs me about the Federal Government, how it always loves to hang highway fund money over the heads of the state governments in order to force feed legislation down the throats of the states.</p>
<p>Another problem is that I don't think that kids are getting the education they need about drinking. From age 6 up to the day before their 21st birthday, the message is "don't drink, don't drink, don't drink." These government people give no thought about how to educate people on drinking other than to tell them not to until they turn 21. As a result, on their 21st birthday a lot of people go out and drink themselves sick.</p>
<p>In my family, I was taught to treat alchocol with respect at all times, and to never drive while under the influence. That education started while I was in high school, and continued up until I was 21. My parents made sure that I had the proper introduction to alchocol. In my mind, the home is the best way to truly teach kids about drinking, and to make sure their ready for that responsibility when the time comes. I think that one of the reasons underage drinking is such a problem these days is because the kids aren't getting the proper introduction that they need.</p>

<p>They probably could get in trouble with their school in the US. I'm from Germany. When I was 16 we were buying alcohol and cigarettes at a gas station. Suddenly there was this tourist from America standing in front of us. She was totally shocked when we told her that underage drinking is legal! Finally she took several pictures of us drinking and smoking in public. I would love to get these pictures&#160;:-)). Damn, we forgot to tell her that sex under 18 and prostitution are legal too (and the possession of small amounts of weed is not punished). Thank you America, I will never forget this great moment in my life&#160;:)))</p>

<dd>It sounds quite inaccurate to me. Beer has about 5-8% alcohol, so a 12-ounce beer is between 0.6 and 1 ounces of alcohol. Wine is 12-14% alcohol, so a 5-ounce glass is 0.6-0.7 ounces of alcohol. 80-proof liquor is 40% alcohol, so a one-ounce shot is 0.4 ounces of alcohol. So the quantity of alcohol being described as "a drink" varies by over 100% -- from 0.4 ounces to 1 ounce.</dd>

<p>Average fatal dose determined by weight? It's all based off of how well your liver works. Which is why someone who has a weight of 272lbs can drink 6 beers in one hour and still be below a BAC of .08, while another person with an identical build and a weight of 275lbs can drink three beers in an hour and blow over a .08. Weight is good for LEO's to make quick guesses, to determine a course of action, but it's rare that those actually come close. CPL Andy</p>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, <i>all</i> alcoholic beverages contain small amounts of methanol (some more than others). Since ethanol is an antidote to methanol poisoning, a small amount of methanol in your drink will not poison you. It is the methanol that gives certain drinks their characteristic "warmth" (or burn for those with a little more methanol). For example compare a plain grain alcohol to scotch or tequilla. If an alcoholic beverage contains too much (or primarily) methanol, that is when blindness and death becomes part of the picture. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 23:40, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The difference between U.S. and German law has occasionally led to severe problems with exchange students from the U.S. who visited Germany. The problem stems from the fact that when the pupils are in Germany they are subject to German law, but as visitors from the U.S. (and pupils of an American school) they should still obey U.S. law (this argument is purely a moralistic one). Their German hosts might not have a problem serving them German beer but the pupils might be in trouble when they return to the U.S."</p>

On the other hand, such an anecdote might be better suited to a "don't ever trust the powers that be"-article, with a link from here.

<dd>I completely agree and just checked here before removing it. Whether or not it's relevant information for some purpose isn't really the point -- rather it's not relevant for an encyclopedia article on alcoholic beverages. Not only that it singles out Germany, but in fact the point holds for the majority of western countries. Beyond that suggesting that one is bound to US laws when outside of the US is (a) silly and (b) again, not encyclopedic. More relevant would be the fact that drinking is often off limits within the agreement between the exchange organization and the student. However if that information is relevant anywhere it's in an article on student exchange programs.

<p>I moved this paragraph here from the "Uses" section because there are some problems with it. First, it doesn't really fit in the "Uses" section. Second, the mentioned study is not referenced, although it is referenced from an identical paragraph in the <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acinetobacter.html" title="Acinetobacter">Acinetobacter baumannii</a> article. Third, this paragraph doesn't properly summarize the information in that reference (which is only an abstract for an unrefereed poster at a conference-- not an authoritative work) e.g., the bacteria were fed ethanol, not the nematodes. Fourth, the bit about "common misconception" isn't really objective.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A recent study indicated that ethanol has been found to stimulate the virulence of <i><a href="../../../a/c/i/Acinetobacter.html" title="Acinetobacter">Acinetobacter baumannii</a></i>.

<p>EVERYONE WHO DRINKS ALCOHOL MUST DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH. THEY ONLY DRINK IT TO GET DRUNK AND THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR HEALTH. --72.65.235.79 19:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, a healthy individual drinking 28 standard drinks a week or less (no more than 6 on any one occasion), is not at risk from their alcohol consumption. Some studies have shown 2 glasses of red wine a night have beneficial cardiovascular effects - reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiac sudden death. <a href="../../../w/2E/r/User%7EW.Ross_3bba.html" title="User:W.Ross">W.Ross</a> 01:11, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So - let me understand. One of the reasons you would like everyone who drinks alcohol is because they have no respect for their health, right? I'm looking for a stronger word than "ridiculous". As for "only drinking to get drunk", maybe you shouldn't go to that much high school and student parties. They're obviously not for you. If that can be a comfort to you, most non-drinkers in the western world end up, like you, on the internet, because they don't get out of their homes. Maybe you could make a precedent by managing to drink just a glass or two, <i>without getting drunk</i>, and you might actually learn something. If you don't understand what I'm saying, please say so, and I'll write it in caps.--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 13:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't the article mention the fact that some alcoholic beverages (especially red wines) contain small amounts of GHB and GBL? Reference: <a href="http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;ID=6513&amp;DocPartID=6040" class="external free" title="http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;ID=6513&amp;DocPartID=6040" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;ID=6513&amp;DocPartID=6040</a></p>
<p>Although these small amounts would have no effect if taken alone, I'm certain that it has been proven that alcohol and GHB/GBL inhibit each other's metabolism, which would cause a lowering of dosage (of both agents).</p>
<p>Other's opinions? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_PEA_1de3.html" title="User:Mark PEA">Mark PEA</a> 20:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
