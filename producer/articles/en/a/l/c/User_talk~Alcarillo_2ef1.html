<p>I'm new to wikipedia and have been editing the article on <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Idema_b368.html" title="Jonathan Idema">Jonathan Idema</a> alone for a couple of days. I was wondering if you could take a look and tell me what you think. It has a long way to go, but I think it is moving in a good direction. It had issues with neutral point of view and lack of source citation, and still does. I've been adding references and have neutralized some wording.</p>
<p>I'd like to add one of those "TF7 not for release" photos you see here <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=idema&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi," class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?q=idema&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi," rel="nofollow">Google Image results</a>.

<p>I think it's pretty funny that someone listed your username as an alias of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_A._Cafasso_41c5.html" title="Joseph A. Cafasso">Joseph A. Cafasso</a>. It would be obvious to this blogger that you aren't Cafasso if they looked at your history, they would see that you were not involved in the article until moderation became necessary.

<dd>Thanks for the reply! That was my inkling as well. Then I found this <a href="http://www.melissadata.com/lookups/zipstreet.asp?InData=31522" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.melissadata.com/lookups/zipstreet.asp?InData=31522" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>; no "Mallory" at all (??).

I'm wondering if it's just a peculiarity that in local custom both are acceptable but in "ofishal" circles it's Mallory.

<dd>It is "o" on the roadmap too (as well as the phone book). I live about 15 miles from there, but I'm over there a couple times per week.

<dd>This is the feedback I got from one of my family members:
<blockquote>
<p>"ANSWER: BOTH! Yes, it is one of the unique and charming features of the St. Simons Village...some parts of the road are spelled with the "o" and others with the "e". I read the folklore on it some time ago, but can't remember what the hell it is all about. Makes for some interesting small chat."</p>

<p>Another interesting thing with streets is <s>Demery</s> Demere on st. Simons. People who live here pronounce it "DIM ir ee". Outsiders invariably say "dee MIR". So if they say the latter, we lean over menacingly and inquire "you're not from around here, are you?" <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 16:22, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know -- it happened to me many years ago. I just received a shake of the head and a fairly polite chuckle. (It's "Demere", BTW...&#160;;)) My guess is that it's a French word in origin, spelled "Demeré" at one time. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcarillo_8ef2.html" title="User:Alcarillo">Alcarillo</a> 17:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point of the paragraph was that Cafasso is drawing substantial ire from certain quarters on the web. The article never made any assertions that what was being said about him were true or not.

<dd>You are asserting on that edit that he has been called a "con artist" by some blogs. But blogs are not to be used as sources for controversial material about living persons. You also added: <i>It is currently not known whether Cafasso has been prosectuted for criminal offenses.</i> that is in contradiction with our policy of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<p>Alcarillo, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is a policy that is taken very seriously at Wikipedia, and it explicitly excludes blogs as a source for negative claims about living people. Unsourced speculation about whether someone "has been prosecuted for criminal offenses" is also clearly prohibited. Jossi has been kind enough to gently point that out to you, rather than taking stronger action. What other action do you feel needs to be taken at this point? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I sourced a non-speculation that Cafasso has spent time in the Middlesex County NJ jail with a link to the phone number of the jail's records room. Speculation as to whether Cafasso has a criminal record (he doesn't) does not come out of the blue. Sourcing with the records room phone number was deemed unacceptable.

<dd>No, I don't think that would qualify as proof. It would have to be records made public and published somewhere (I have no idea whether court records are available to anyone but people in the courts system), or if there was a newspaper article that referenced the case. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcarillo_8ef2.html" title="User:Alcarillo">Alcarillo</a> 16:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lot of this stuff is just plain public record, but one has to deal with whatever kind of bad website the govenment agency throws at you. In the case of the Middlesex County jail, members of the general public can call the records room and obtain information (or confirmation of information), but to get it in writing from them requires a court order. Also, they will not tell you the reason for incarceration. Why these restrictions? I don't know. But the basic info is available to the general public. As nearly as I can tell, Wikipedia considers making a phone call original research, whereas Googling isn't. Also, voyaging into government public records databases is considered original research, whereas citing the smallest hometown paper isn't, as long as it's on the web.</dd>

<dd>Since I have other venues of publication, I won't even go as far as saying that this is disturbing to me, since I don't have to live by these standards. But there is plenty out there that is quite verifiable that doesn't meet the standards of Wikipedia editors like Jossi with whose positions on citation I disagree.</dd>

<dd>There's a lot of patent nonsense that makes it into the mainstream media; citations of court cases, public records, etc. should trump random newspaper articles. But often the public records databases are the worst implemented on the web. (This is especially true of things like corporate registries. Ever tried to use the Panama corporate registry?!? And then there are the Florida and Nevada registries. Yuk.)</dd>

<dd>From my standpoint, public record = verifiable. I think if you are dealing with matters of public record, even of records that are difficult to get at, Admins should be gentler in their tone. <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleasantville_520c.html" title="User:Pleasantville">Pleasantville</a> 18:56, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Public records are "primary sources" and so need to be handled with great care, if at all. Secondary sources are much preferred for encyclopedia writing. Typical problems with public records include not being sure if the person mentioned is the same as the subject, taking single episodes out of context by not including the outcomes, etc. If the topic is notable there will be secondary sources available. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 00:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been accused recently of actually <i>being</i> Cafasso by one of Idema's wannabe minions. If that were the case, I could definitively say whether or not Cafasso has a criminal record, but it would still be of no use b/c it's a "primary source."
