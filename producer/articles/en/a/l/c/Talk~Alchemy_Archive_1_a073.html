<dl>
<dd>Yes it is, and I'm going to fix it. 'Pan' means 'all' and 'akeai' means 'to heal', so a 'universal panacea' is a 'universal universal cure'. Protozoid 22:44, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Eclecticology</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>From the perspective of modernity, which holds modern science as the pinnacle of knowledge and awareness, <i><b>alchemy</b></i> was the discipline that gave birth by way of schizogenesis (by way its very scissipation) to the modern science of chemistry. In the wake of the modern, alchemy and alchemical thought were supposed to have all but disappeared, with critical <i>hermeneutics</i> and <i>chemical physics</i> as its divided and divisive offspring. But as this article will show, not only has the alchemical precursor to these disciplines perdured and endured beyond the bounds of its supposed bane, but in fact its scissiparous progeny -- especially the science of modern physics and chemistry -- have of late (and into the forseeable future) been moving steadily back, while endlessly progressing forward, to the fundaments of alchemical theory itself ... for instance in contemporary physics with the acknowledged relevance of the manipulator in any and all experimental inquiry, the proven persistence of the uncertain on the horizon of 'specificity' and scientific 'certainty' (Heisenberg's <i>uncertainty principle</i> -- the indubitably alchemical ambiguity of scientific entelechy -- <i>q.v.</i>), the now-limitless subdivisibility of the so-called indivisible (the 'atomic' as in fact endlessly 'sub-atomic' -- <i>sublimely</i> so, indeed), <i>et cetera</i> ... A similar list could be drawn up on the side of the hermeneutic arts (artistic theory and criticism), with Derrida in the role of Heisenberg for instance. In any case -- <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 02:58 Sep 8, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverted anonymous contribution</span></h2>
<p>I've reverted from this contribution by anonymous. One does not explain alchemy to an encyclopedia reading public by trying to outdo the alchemists in the use of obscure pedantic language. When he later corrected the spelling of the word "lead" (i.e. the metal) to "led" the seriousness of the contribution was in even greater doubt.</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt; Alas, too many presumptions -- the presumption<br /></li>
<li>&gt; that the anonymous constribution was contributed<br /></li>
<li>&gt; by a native speaker of English ("the spelling of<br /></li>
<li>&gt; the word" put "the seriousness of the contribution"<br /></li>
<li>&gt; into "doubt"); the presumption that the writer was<br /></li>
<li>&gt; a man and not a woman ("<i>he</i> later", et cetera);<br /></li>
<li>&gt; the presumption, triumphantly inscribed at the end<br /></li>
<li>&gt; of the article, that "With the birth of modern chemistry,<br /></li>
<li>&gt; alchemy was made impotent" and that "As scientists<br /></li>
<li>&gt; began to discover and rationalize the clockwork of the<br /></li>
<li>&gt; universe, alchemical theories were thrown to the waste<br /></li>
<li>&gt; bucket, unneeded and forgotten"; and the presumption of<br /></li>
<li>&gt; reversion -- the utter elimination of the contribution<br /></li>
<li>&gt; altogether, on the basis of these other presumptions.<br /></li>
<li>&gt; And if all of these presumptions were wrong? ... If,<br /></li>
<li>&gt; for instance, the woman who had contributed to the project<br /></li>
<li>&gt; was in fact a francophone expressing herself to anglo-<br /></li>
<li>&gt; phones? If she was moreover a student of alchemical philo-<br /></li>
<li>&gt; sophy (the history of alchemy from antiquity to modernity)? ...<br /></li>
<li>&gt; No: better to consign these contributions to oblivion and<br /></li>
<li>&gt; reinstate the former "eclectic[<i>o</i>]logical"/"reading public"<br /></li>
<li>&gt; presumptions. The critical absence of an <i>a</i> in le<i>a</i>d (the<br /></li>
<li>&gt; English word for the element <u>Pb</u>, <i>Plumbum</i>, from the <u>Latin</u>)<br /></li>
<li>&gt; reveals a hesitation that merits not only the Eclectic's<br /></li>
<li>&gt; doubt, but more -- much more: "even <i>greater</i> doubt." Indeed,<br /></li>
<li>&gt; the greatest doubt of all! This is the veritable sign of signs,<br /></li>
<li>&gt; true testimony to a pedagological poverty, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i><br /></li>
<li>&gt; The absent <i>a</i>. Such a thing is definitely the revelation<br /></li>
<li>&gt; of an total lack of "seriousness" ("the seriousness of the<br /></li>
<li>&gt; contribution was" thereby cast "in even greater doubt").<br /></li>
<li>&gt; Best of luck on your <i>logy</i>, Eclecticology. <i>À jamais encore</i>.<br /></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transmutation</span></h2>
<p>This article is truly excellent. We should recruit more students to donate their research papers here.</p>
<p>My only criticism: it should be noted that the philosopher's stone was real, and has been found, that being bombardment of lead with atomic particles to turn it into gold. Their methods were primitive, but their goal, if not practical, was at least attainable given some level of technological 'magic'.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A</i> philosopher's stone is a superheavy element which, when placed by or around a base metal, gradually transforms it into a nobler transition element by fission fragment spallation. Maybe one can make a natural lightning fusor to make a light radioisotope (intense source would be lithium, funny and apropos that lithos means <i>stone</i>) as the philosopher's stone which can then accomplish the same.&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysdexia_bda0.html" title="User:Lysdexia">lysdexia</a> 23:03, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Essay?</span></h2>
<p>This text is really well written and informative , but I suspect that in it's current state, is more of an essay, rather than an NPOV article. It claims that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"From today's perspective, these perceptions have some validity, but if we are to be objective we should judge them in the context of the times they lived in".</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the basic assumpsion that the article is built on, of course it claims to be objective, and in some degree it is, however, this type of writing style, asserts an <i>opinion</i>, or some analysis, but it is debatable whether it is a fact. I think a slight rewording may be benefitical (for example: "we should" is POV), this analysis of alchemy may be dominant today, but may change in a 100 years like it changed a 100 years ago.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Slant towards mystic/spiritual side of alchemy</span></h2>
<p>More generally, the article is nice but my feeling is that it is too slanted towards the mystic/spiritual side of alchemy. While that aspect may have been important to the alchemists (or to some of them), we must not forget that the art was valuable to society only because of its "pedestrian" technological value, e.g. in metallurgy; and flourished only because of that. Also, saying that the matter transformations were only a cover or excuse for mystical concepts is taking things too far. Rather, my sense is that the mystical imagery of the alchemists was often only a technical jargon for describing the material processes (just as we today use antophomorphic language for computers, e.g. "the program knows this" or "the computer doesn't like that"). Other times it was an attempt to make sense of the material observations by means of "real but abstract" ideas (like the "caloric" of later chemists and the "bond energy" of today). The view espoused by the article would then apply only to the most extreme instances of this viewpoint <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>In the life and writings of John Dee it is possible to see a parallel development to that of Paracelsus, insofar as Dee was also redefining the alchemical and magical traditions by the application of more modern methodology. {<b>I am far from being an expert on Dee, but I have read Fell's biography and many comments about him and his work. I haven't seen anything suggesting that he was any good on alchemy (much less a "parallel to paracelsus"), and his "angelic" contacts through Kelley seem to be as close to "magic" as he would dare to get. Apart from his general scholarly knowledge and perhaps some contributions to astronomy and mathematics, he seems to have been basically an earnest student of occultism who (like many of his time) wasted most of his life trying to make sense of other occultists' nonsense.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unsympathetic debunking</span></h2>
<p>This article is an unsympathetic, debunking of alchemy from a strictly material, Newtonian perspective of science. Come on, as C.G. Jung observed, any fool can see that the alchemists were on the wrong track as regards scientific enquiry. All of their terminology is to do with exploring the unconscious psyche and the individuation process. What the alchemists groped around for was a language to describe the psyche, and all of their chemical terminology was just a smoke-screen to the uninitiated. We would not even be disputing this point were it not for Jung's study of alchemy, take for example the quotation below</p>
<p>'I have often beheld as a miracle, that artificial resurrection and revivification of Mercury, how being mortified into a thousand shapes, it assumes again its own and returns into its numerical self'. A perfection quotation upon how the alchemist perceived the mystery of experimenting with chemicals. (Religio Medici Part 1:48)</p>
<p>An example of the alchemist experiencing the NUMINOUS in the laboratory rather than any attempting any scientific observation. Try reading the labrinthine texts of Norton, George Ripley or Browne and you will realise that these people were little interested in the laboratory for purely scientific purposes. Alchemy remains inter-related to the development not only of science, but also religion, art and philosophy, this article is deciodedly lop-sided in its discussion a a complex subject. Alchemy is much more a proto-psychology and an underground protestant symbolic language whose study was MAN as Jung stresses again and again and again. Read him . The laboratory of the alchemists was the unconscious and was concerned with self-knowledge and understanding of the self, chemistry was just an off-shoot. The true alchemists recognised THEY were the subject of experimentation much more than nature's properties. Read my essay at www.levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.http Sorry but for myself and doubtless for other scholars of alchemythis article really smacks of poorly digested comprehension and as for the statement</p>
<p>'By Boyle's time, alchemists had disposed of most of the occultist beliefs that once plagued?? the Art, but still they clung to the hermetical beliefs?? that had been carried down through the millennia. Boyle did away with this.</p>
<p>This article as the above statement amply demonstrates demands either a rewriting or a more authorative scholar to expound upon what is amulti-facted topic embracing NOT ONLY embryonic scientific development but also psychology and religion . The Norwikian</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I do agree that we in the modern age are tooquick to dismiss once-truths, I find it amusing that you imply Newton would have dismissed achemy, considering he was a closet alchemist himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Haha yes, you're right, despite Newton being heralded as the founder of modern science by many, he was in fact fascinated with alchemy. However as of 02 June 05 the article does reflect that. All in all this article does appear excellent - I'm currently studying alchemy as part of a History of Science course at Cambridge, and have found little to disagree with.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Take a look at Frances Yates' books on the subject and you will find just how influential Alchemy has actually been on the influence of science. Click on the Ernest Rutherford article on the Wikipedia and you will find our old friend Hermes Trismegistus, supposed author of the Emerald Tablet which began alchemy, on his coat of arms. In fact you can't divide the fact that Newton was an Alchemist from his science. THey are integral. Its we who have misunderstood is brand of mechanistic science. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePeg_7930.html" title="User:ThePeg">ThePeg</a> 22:35, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alchemists are more properly proto-scientists than pseudo-scientists; the latter term can't really be applied to a time before the development of the scientific method. I've removed a reference to something that Carl Jung supposedly missed. From my understanding of Jung this does not seem likely. I've removed the "golden goal" reference; that <b>specific term</b> does not appear to have been used by alchemists, and now its very common use in football becomes a significant distraction.</dd>

<dd>The references to various authors are in the format (Name, page) leaves something to be desired. Are these direct quotes? Are there copyright issues involved? (Nobody has raised this issue in the last six months so it's probably okay for now.) The Paracelsus quote should fall within fair use, but the page is from what edition?

<p>No, exactly quoted material is in quotation marks or indented. All fall under fair use, and in fact most are from translations of documents hundreds of years old. The paranthetical references indicate from whence the concepts, ideas, or assertions are taken, thus allowing the reader to verify their correctness or to gain further information along those lines. I left the attribution list off the original submission since at the time Wikipedia wasn't tracking that, and the list added length to an already long document.

<p>Did India have a separate alchemical tradition? I Know that it had an extensive and well-known medical tradition, e.g. Aryuvedic medicine; but did it have a discipline that considered the study of matter transformations in general (i.e. a "proto-chemistry") and/or the philosophical connections betwen matter transmutation and spiritual development (akin to Western hermeticism)?<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a></p>

<dd>Yes. You should particularly look at the Tamil form of "medicine" known as "Siddha", instead of Aryuveda. It is a quack alchemical pseudo-science based on minerals which is aimed at healing.

Logically then, one would certainly have to know a good bit about astrology in order to use alchemy effectively, and Newton along with other prominent alchemists definitely knew this. For more informations see <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies_ae8a.html" title="Isaac Newton's occult studies">Isaac Newton's occult studies</a>.</i> Did Newton Really practice the occult?

<dd>Good call, although that Occult Studies article needs some work. Whilst Newton spent a lot of time working on alchemy he mostly kept his work private - I don't think it is correct to say he was a well known alchemist in his day. It is only recently that his papers have been studied. Although he is known to have read books on astrology, he almost certainly did no work on astrology. Newton was very organised in his research and maintained notebooks for everything he worked on. His library contains no papers suggesting that he worked on astrology. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 00:24, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
