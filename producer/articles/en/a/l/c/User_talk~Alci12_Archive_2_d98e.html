<p>As far as I know none of these "barons" are listed in any kind of reference work like peers and baronets are in Debrett's, Burke's, Cracroft's, Who's Who, etc., so presumably the articles consist entirely of unverifiable information. (Baron of Fulwood, for instance, contains an enormous amount of information that could well be true, but could equally be complete fabrication. Give me a keyboard and half an hour and I'm sure I could produce an equally detailed article on the equally verifiable title Baron of Proteustoun that's been passed down through my family for generations.) At the very least they're original research. Could we not just propose their deletion on this basis? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 16:24, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for notability, they're equivalent to Lordships of the Manor in England, and I believe they have been officially compared to being "Landlord of the Dog and Duck" by someone in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> says renomination is fine, especially if the previous nomination ended as "no consensus" (which this did). As long as we put our case well it should be okay. (At the very least, we need to eliminate all erroneous references to feudal barons being called anything but "John Scott of Glenporridge". Anyone reading these articles would think they are a big thing, which is certainly an impression that needs to be corrected.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 18:13, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your courteous heads up on the <i>Cowley</i> reference - much appreciated. By all means go ahead and edit. This is under the heading "Divorced wives who remarry", isn't it - a point which crops up every now and then in English literature and fiction, so worth including the old practice although now obsolete, I think. The first two sentences should stay, shouldn't they, but the third one should no doubt be qualified to make clear the point you mention. The first two sentences refer to an excellent and interesting source on what was actually accepted in society at that time. I hope you will feel that the words <i>"customary"</i> in the first sentence, and <i>"common practice"</i> and <i>"not a matter of right" "merely a matter of courtesy, and allowed by the usages of society"</i> in Lord Macnaughten's words make the first two sentences quite correct - indeed, he is rather at pains, isn't he, to distinguish the <b>"matter of right"</b> from the <b>"matter of courtesy... allowed by the usages of society."</b> Anyway, I will be interested to see what you think. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelseaboy_a649.html" title="User:Chelseaboy">Chelseaboy</a> 19:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, could you please have a look at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lovat_d38c.html" title="Lord Lovat">Lord Lovat</a>'s talk page. There is currently a debate about the naming of the titles because of numbering issues. I am saying that we should go by the Lord's legal numbering, not how his Clan number him. Could you give your opinion? Thanks.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 20:03, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your help on the Lord Lovat matter. I will keep looking to check the article names arent changed. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 11:14, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How bizarre. To be honest, if he hasn't seen reason when you and Berks105 have explained it to him as thoroughly as you have, I'd assume he's not going to. Hopefully he'll give up his quest when he realises we're not going to let him push his POV here. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 17:28, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This guy gets a little more confusing since (a) he's a baronet, and (b) he was raised to the peerage as a life baron, actually before his father died and he inherited the baronetcy. It also gets confusing since there's also another Baron Wolfson (David Wolfson) in Lords. Some of these guys just have too many titles. This Wolfson also has a brother named David, but I have no idea if that's the same person as the other baron. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 17:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may need your help at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lovat_d38c.html" title="Lord Lovat">Lord Lovat</a> again. I think Canaen is pushing is POV again, he's not giving up on the numbering of the Lords, insisting that because apparently the general public refer to them differantly we should account for this.

<p>We could just rewrite it.

<dd>I see exactly where you are both coming from. Sounds like a good addition to me.

<ul>
<li><b>Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum</b> and of the Vaal in the Colony of Transvaal, and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk</li>
<li><b>Baron Kitchener of Khartoum</b> and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk</li>
</ul>
<p>But why do they have "and" at the start of the territorial qualification? Usually it would be Baron Kitchener of Khartoum, of Aspall in the County of Suffolk; or Baron Kitchener of Khartoum, of Khartoum and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk.</p>

<p>Feel free to delete or change that paragraph if you like.

<dd>You certainly terminate an abeyance, the title is legally held by no one but has co-heirs who the sovereign (the CFP) decide between by calling the title out in favour of one claimant. I'm not sure there is any correct phrase for dormant titles, they are held by whomsoever the LP rules say - seeking a writ is the means by which people tend to prove their right but historically and even today many peers have never sought a writ but were/are unquestionably the holder of the title in law and were recognised officially by the state as such. I suppose it comes down to how you define dormant (i) any title whose holder hasn't made out a claim or the more strict and for mine correct that (i) there is assumed to be an heir if only he could be found and his claim made. I'd call the above peerage unclaimed/unproven or disputed rather than dormant as it was a simply dispute between known claimants for a fairly obvious outcome. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 18:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd certainly agree that you can't "terminate" a dormancy. It's also clear that it's not a legal status, it's merely an informal term to show that no one is or was recognised as holding the title during a certain period. I'd be tempted to say "dormant 1991" and "recognised 1997" or something similar. As for why he didn't have to disclaim, I don't believe there's any obligation to leave the Commons until the succession is clear; Lord James Douglas-Hamilton presumably thought he had to in case either he was recognised as a peer just before a crucial vote or the outcome of a vote was challenged due to his potential status as a peer. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 15:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering how some peers seem to have a pretty weak knowledge of their own titles and correct use thereof I wonder if some even know they have a baronetcy. However if there are examples of peers who have proved their claim to the peerage but are not on the baronets roll that would settle the matter of them using cross proof for claims. I thought you had to provide birth/marriage/death + two affis - though I appreciate you case is as simple as they get in terms of proving a claim. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 11:43, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>KBs automatically became GCBs (not KCBs) when the Order of the Bath was expanded.

The warrant expanding the Order was published as a supplement to the London Gazette of Jan 3 1815 (and reprinted in The Times on Jan 5). This warrant lists the names of the GCBs and KCBs. Gunning did indeed become a GCB in 1815, and was in fact the most senior Civil GCB.

<p>Hi Alci, awhile ago you said that it was an act of parliament which restored the title of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lovat_d38c.html" title="Lord Lovat">Lord Lovat</a> in 1854.

<p>Hello. Regarding the viscountcy of Hanworth, I see that you have named the present holder's nephew Harold William Charles Pollock (b. 1988) as the heir presumptive.

<dd>Now I thought that an eldest/elder son could in any event, both in Scotland and England, use his father's arms subject to a different helm and adding a label. The same applies to later sons in England but definitely not in Scotland, the English being far more heraldically sloppy than the Scots. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 18:59, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry people. Peerage certainly trumps a knighthood, but according to Scots and English custom every peer is given knightly status automatically. On all official correspondence to my Grandfather from non familiar intimates, he is addressed as Sir Douglas. As far as the Châtelherault dukedom goes, it was confirmed upon the male heirs of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hamilton%2C_11th_Duke_of_Hamilton_e286.html" title="William Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton">William Douglas-Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton</a> by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_II_ed88.html" title="Napoleon II">Napoleon II</a>, which the head of the Douglas-Hamilton's certainly is.

<p>I do not have a clue what an inescution is, but the use of the Escutcheon of France is perfectly valid as the joint arms of Hamilton and the house of Bonaparte were joined by the marriage of Princess Marie, Napoleon's granddaughter (perhaps there should have been a label over the top of the Fleur de Lys for her considered but not verified illegitimacy) and Duke William in 1843, the very same date that Châtelherault was confirmed . That Dukedom was confirmed on Heirs Male and about which I am afraid you seem to have some very shonky information. As to the 'Sir' question, have you consulted Debretts or Who's Who? Manual of style aside, every grade of male British society from King to commoner is refered to as "Sir" in correspondence, and even more especially when one has been given the degree of Knighthood, which the 14th Duke of Hamilton had been given twice over, irrespective of the heriditary chivalry his peerage lent him. <i>Nemo me impune lacessit!</i> <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendandh_25f1.html" title="User:Brendandh">Brendandh</a> 23:14, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Under Scots law of arms Lyon must have registered arms for them to be lawful, the arms registered for Hamilton do not include the escutcheon (fyi Inescutcheon is an escutcheon born within or upon the shield) The Hamilton 'creation' by N was in 1864 and was as I said to heirs male (French Law) not heirs male whatsoever (Scottish). You can't confirm someone to a title which they have no lawful claim in France anymore than you can here. So it was a new creation by default which is now extinct. I strongly suggest you read up about French peerage law as it's not Scottish and will help your understanding. As to sir in correspondance that has nothing to do with knighthood but is standard letter address form. I'm called sir in letters and sometimes in spoken use but it's no sign I have a knighthood. You are confusing totally different things. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 23:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Weeel, lets agree to differ, and that difference should be represented in article form. Fiction to fact, there are letters patent at <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennoxlove.html" title="Lennoxlove">Lennoxlove</a> house confirming the honour but not the revenue of the French title, the 11th Duke of H did not really need the extra cash as he was the richest man in Scotland at the time. When the 12th Duke of H died he left all his un-entailed possessions to his daughter who then proceeded to marry the Duke of Montrose, which is why Brodick Castle is not part of Hamilton estates today, but was part of the Graham enterprise before its sale to the National trust. All entailed property and title went to the 13th Duke, Alfred, including the nominal Duchy of Châtelherault ( and that is the correct spelling!). Likewise, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Douglas%2C_1st_Earl_of_Angus_02f1.html" title="George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus">George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus</a> inherited his Earldom through Bastardy and the current Duke of H. holds that title. I will still cite Who's who and Debretts as to courtesy naming: I am not talking about article title but the content. On correspondence the Duke of Hamilton is referred to as the "Most Noble and Puissant Prince", now I would agree that that is slightly over the top for an encyclopædic article, but "Sir" is a title of dignity which covers most grades of nobility and certainly this Hamilton. If I were to give the the 14th D of H his full honorific: The Most Honourable and Noble Puissant Prince Group Captain the Duke of Hamilton, Brandon and Châtelherault, Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale, Earl of Angus, Arran, Lanark and Cambridge, Lord Aven, Innerdale, Machansyre, Polmont, Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest, Baron Dutton, that might seem extreme, but it seems rather frightful to not honour a twice knighted man his earned prefix, (especially in his intro). For example look at the brouhaha as to the naming of British Monarchs, most notably <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VI_of_Scotland_22b9.html" title="James VI of Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VII_of_Scotland_e6f1.html" title="James VII of Scotland">James VII of Scotland</a>, and their status as Kings of England. As to the Earl of Derby, let him prove it in an other arena than Wikipedia. As before <i><a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemo_Me_Impune_Lacessit_ce3c.html" title="Nemo Me Impune Lacessit">Nemo Me Impune Lacessit</a>!</i> <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendandh_25f1.html" title="User:Brendandh">Brendandh</a> 00:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Post Scriptum</i> The honour of the Duchy of Châtelherault Was confirmed upon William the 11th Duke of H. by the French Emperor. However the duchy had been held since the time of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hamilton%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Arran_2819.html" title="James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran">Regent Arran</a>, the first Duke. It was awarded by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_France_3812.html" title="Henry II of France">Henri II</a>. Since then every Earl of Arran (including the present D. of H.) has held that position no matter what later and illegal republican govrernments of France might say. What aristocracy of the "Ancien régime" survived did so because it was not in France. The late eighteenth and nineteenth century chroniclers did an enormous amount of rewriting of national history. In a <i>quasi</i>-nationalistic fervour, through guilt at the massacre of the revolution, they seemed to have written all foreigners out of the history books. If one were to speak to the Seneschal of mid sixteenth century France today, (fiction admittedly) he would be under no doubt as to who the Duchy pertains. To cap all, the arms of THE Douglas-Hamilton with the arms of France in-Escutcheoned does not fall within the remit of Lyon. It was a transnational alliance of the top drawer and therefore up to the parties involved to decide and later on discussion with Lyon and his French counterpart to matriculate. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendandh_25f1.html" title="User:Brendandh">Brendandh</a> 02:46, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are only so many times I can repeat this. Wiki has a style guide for the writing of articles agreed by the users. The guide says knighthoods are not to be included with peers, so it is a simple matter that if you include them they will be removed. If you want to try to get agreement to alter the style guide so you can include what you wish good luck in your efforts.</dd>
<dd>There no such thing as a transnational authority with the right to overule Scots law of arms. The Hamiltons have Scottish arms which by law much be those registered with Lyon.</dd>
<dd>Re-read by comments on the remainder of the title. The original French title had a strict remainder which could not see it held by the Hamiltons today. You cannot apply Scottish law to French titles, succession has nothing whatsoever to do with the transmission of the earldom it's solely according to the remainder under French law. The chroniclers nor the republicans altered the remainder of the original title which was to heirs male and female. N's grant was to heirs male (french law) which would have died with him. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 11:00, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sources I was looking for were for the mode of operation of letters patent and writs of summons (what they confer, limitations, etc.) and the actual text (as there were three big quoted chunks). I see it's been demoted, but it won't do any harm to add the references if you have them.
