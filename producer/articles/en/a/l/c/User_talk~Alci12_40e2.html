<p>Now that I understand how this "talk" system works... Thank you for correcting me about Lord Huntingtower several days ago. I have a question about it. If you look at the page for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Grant%2C_Lord_Huntingtower_11f3.html" title="John Grant, Lord Huntingtower">John Grant, Lord Huntingtower</a> you will notice that one or two of my citations (London Times) refer to him as a Baron, and also say his mother is "Baroness Huntingtower." Is it correct for an English publication to call a Scottish lord this way? --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasiraghitrio_6397.html" title="User:Casiraghitrio">Ashley Rovira</a> 16:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fixed. You don't have anything for the claim that the stall plates are left in place in St Patrick's cathedral by any chance? I'm struggling to track anything down for that. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I saw that one, but it looks to me like those banners are just left because the Order is dormant as it says standard practice was to remove everything (except perhaps the stall plates). I've found references for the names being displayed on wall plates in Dublin Castle and the picture in the article shows that the names are recorded on boards in the Cathedral, but nothing to show that it was the practice to leave the stall plates in place. If we can't find anything to back that up, I'll replace it with the information you just posted. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:50, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Scots law seems to have had much more scope for the revocation of titles — several titles (the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Strathearn_aee6.html" title="Earl of Strathearn">Earldom of Strathearn</a>, for one) seem to have been "cancelled"/"revoked"/"withdrawn"/"recalled" (which all seem to indicate some kind of cessation of the title without the formality of an attainder required by English law), and it would seem this was not as final a thing as it would have been in England (other titles often being exchanged for the ones taken away). But, at any rate, however it was termed or enacted, it seems to be pretty common ground that this Baronetage ceased to exist, and the only person who appears to believe otherwise has decided that any source that says otherwise is (by virtue of that fact) mistaken... <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 18:17, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So many things like this seem to be unclear in Scottish cases (the CP is full of things like "X is presumed to have been created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Y at some point between June 1684 and August 1685") that it wouldn't surprise me if there simply isn't a record of how exactly it happened, so I wouldn't get too worried about it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 18:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. Is it possible that the letters parent are still extant and could be looked up somewhere?

<dd>Well if it was a British baronetcy you could look it up in the London Gazette, but afaik the Edinburgh gazette doesn't have entries online that early - all assuming they are even published prior to 1707. I've never had need to find out. The DA baronets does seem wrong. A quick look seems it's a new creation and it can't be numbered correctly. The precedence might be of the earlier creation but the numbering can't. I think someone has just made an error. Again it's one of those 'how was the old creation extinguished' questions. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 13:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I've been behindhand about this. Yes, those should perhaps have another place than the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">Knight</a> article. See <a href="http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/EarlsDesmondUJA6-1858/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/EarlsDesmondUJA6-1858/index.php" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, which states that "In Ireland, at an early period, those who possessed knight's fees were called knights, and often took the name of the land they held by military service." In addition, they don't seem to use the style of "Sir X" but "X, Knight of...". So it's really more closely connected with <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_service.html" title="Knight service">knight service</a> than anything else. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 06:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It probably is slightly risky, yes, but it's happened a couple of times (the Barony of Grey (of Howick) now held by the Earl Grey, for instance, was created whilst the Barony of Grey (of Codnor) was abeyant, and of course in that case the latter is now extant). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 15:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All his titles perished upon his execution and attainder in August 1553 <i>except</i> the Earldom of Warwick, his son <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dudley%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Warwick_b92e.html" title="John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick">John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick</a> having been summoned to Parliament in that title in January 1553.

<p>Yes you're right, it would be very extraordinary and so I think it was only a number lathe operator. 1951 would make more sense, since then the knightship was connected with his appointment as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Lord Privy Seal, while in 1915 neither he nor his father had done something what such an honor would justify.

<p>Hello again. My source was Debrett's. They state that the new patent of 1641 was with remainder to the Earl's daughter Elizabeth and her husband Sir Patrick Ogilvy and list the third holder of the earldom as (3) Elizabeth and Patrick. They don't say explicitly that they held the title jointly, but I presume this was the case (although my knowledge regarding the legal aspects of peerage titles is very limited, so I don't know if it is legally possible for a husband and wife to hold a title jointly). However, there is no doubt that Patrick was a peer in his own right. It would be interesting to known what Burke's and The Complete Peerage say on the matter, but I don't have access to them, unfortunately. <a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETryde_3c31.html" title="User:Tryde">Tryde</a> 10:05, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I think I have spotted a mistake by you (a rare thing, indeed). I believe the heir presumptive to the barony of Methuen you added, Christopher Paul Mansel Methuen-Campbell, is deceased. According to <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~conqueror/genealogy_html/i677.html" class="external text" title="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~conqueror/genealogy_html/i677.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> source he died in 1998. The correct hp should be his son James Paul Archibald Methuen-Campbell (b. 1952) (source: Who's Who 2003 edition). I think we have to be very careful regarding info on contemporary people as something like this might be considered offensive to family members and others.

<p>The article seems to be extremely confused. <i>He is recorded as Member of Parliament for Edinburghshire from March 12, 1685 to 1686 and was on the Convention in 1689, all as Sir John Lauder of Haltoun, and again in parliament from 1689 to 1693 as Sir John Maitland of Ravelrig.</i> But it says he changed from Maitland to Lauder in 1693, so what was he doing as Lauder in 1685? Or am I missing something? Cracroft's doesn't mention a name change, but does say he had two different styles as a Lord of Session, firstly Lord Ravelrig and later Lord Halton. But at any rate, before becoming Earl of Lauderdale he was John Maitland for almost 40 years and supposedly only John Lauder for 2, so it would seem natural to put his article at the Maitland name. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 16:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the names just got switched in that particular sentence. I quote from his ODNB entry: "In March 1685, as Sir John Maitland of Ravelrig, he was elected to parliament as a commissioner of the shires for Edinburgh, and he represented the same constituency in the 1686 parliament...He was also appointed a lord of session on 28 October, with the title of Lord Ravelrig...In July 1691 Maitland received a charter of the barony of Hatton and took the name of Lauder. He sat for the shire of Edinburgh in the parliamentary sessions of 1693 and 1695 as Sir John Lauder of Hatton, but following the death of his elder brother Richard, succeeded in the latter year as fifth earl of Lauderdale." <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 22:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>No, but Cracroft's indicates that the Act of Parliament reversing the attainder is now considered (rather unusually) to have been intended to reverse the attainder retroactively, effectively saying "the people who would have been Earls but for the attainder are now to be considered as if they were Earls". I wonder if, in this case, we should therefore use the old numbering. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 17:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose so. I mean, we're not obliged to follow what Parliament says, but in this case it seems more to be an acknowledgement that the original denial was wrongful than an actual reversal, so on balance it's probably better to include them. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 21:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, very interesting, and very odd indeed. I'm not entirely sure what's being talked of, though: they talk about "stamping" and "passing under the Great Seal", and it's possible the two are different things (the latter happening first). <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~david.beamish/peerages.htm" class="external text" title="http://website.lineone.net/~david.beamish/peerages.htm" rel="nofollow">David Beamish</a> says the peerages were created on 16th, 17th and 18th July, so I suppose it's possible that they passed the Great Seal on those dates and the LG announcement was delayed for some reason (possibly until this stamping thing had happened). I'd imagine that if stamping and passing the Great Seal are the same thing, then (as they seem to be insinuating) it wouldn't be entirely legal for him to take his seat until November. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 12:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without a doubt. The refusal would presumably be on the basis that the fees weren't paid (I'm not sure when the requirement to pay those fees ended, but it seems it must still have existed then). And re what you say about summoning people to Parliament without peerages, I wonder if it could be argued that Lord Milford Haven's possible summoning without an actual peerage could have created some kind of peerage by writ. (A bit off the wall, doubtless, but then I find quirky instances like this intriguing.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 15:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cracroft's has it as dormant in 1611. It was recreated as a British peerage in 1776 for Alexander, Lord Polwarth, only surviving son and heir of the 3rd Earl of Marchmont, which would suggest it was considered extinct then. I can't imagine it was an English peerage, and any supposed inheritance by the Earls of Home seems very suspect to me. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 14:52, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alci, Several months ago you commented on a reorganization of the St John Orders articles. I'm trying to figure it out again, and your help in reaching a consensus is most welcome <a href="../../../k/n/i/Talk%7EKnights_Hospitaller_f07e.html#Bringing_order_to_Orders" title="Talk:Knights Hospitaller">here</a>. This is an effort to keep the discussion in one place. Thanks a lot.--<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvadb_288e.html" title="User:Evadb"><font color="blue"><b>Eva</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/v/a/User_talk%7EEvadb_794e.html" title="User talk:Evadb"><b><font color="red">b</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evadb_7e94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evadb"><b><font color="green">d</font></b></a></sup> 19:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, nice to read you once again. You are right, some people really might well look for <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_Ashdown_6e0a.html" title="Paddy Ashdown">Paddy Ashdown</a> under this search string, so I have taken up your suggestion and made a disambiguation page from it.
