<p>Many studies used as sources do not disclose or consider proxy variables (unapparent variables that significantly affect the outcome than the claimed causative variables of the study), so many of the "facts" are incorrect.

In reality, research began addressing this problem years ago and the results remain the same. In addition, many of the mechanisms whereby alcohol reduces cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death, are clearly understood. So not only is it an established fact that alcohol in moderation reduces cardiovascular disease, but we know how it reduces them. There is consensus about this in the medical research community. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> 18:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is not an established fact that alcohol use in moderation leads to improved cardiac health, though indeed the bulk of the research suggests such a fact. Recent meta-analyses indicates at least the possibility that much of the prospective research has a systematic inclusion error (see Fillmore et al in Addiction Research Theory 4/06). The theoretical mechanisms through which such use leads to improvement in health is counterbalanced by mechanisms through which such use would lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The verdict on this is not yet in, but given the extensive morbidity and mortality from alcohol intake, doctors are playing it safe for the better health of their patients. Do no harm. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 20:07, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current edit reads, "In earlier historical periods, the quantity of alcohol necessary to reduce heart disease was largely produced by these microorganisms[citation needed], but in the modern world humans tend to consume far larger quantities of fat and cholesterol than in Paleolithic times. Therefore it might be necessary to drink a moderate quantity of alcohol to achieve the same benefit.[citation needed]" I find this to be completely fallacious as there is consensus that heart disease is a lifestyle_disease and therefore could not have been a prevalent cause of death in the Paleolithic era. No matter what the current research and epidemiology says (and I concur with the mainstream view that alcohol consumption is epidemiologically linked to longevity) the notion that alchohol is some sort of *essential nutrient* flies in the face of mainstream conceptions of human nutrition. In particular, no *essential* biological role (i.e., a function of ethanol that could not be provided by endogenous activities) has been discovered. Ethanol may have medicinal value, and may extend longevity, but the theory stated above is poorly founded, uncited, and probably not advanced by an experimentalist. In the absence of a peer reviewed citation, the above statement should be stricken completely. I'll do so in a few days, in the absence of a coherent rebuttal. <a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENamfFohyr_4f40.html" title="User:NamfFohyr">rmbh</a> 20:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The theory behind why alcohol might help longevity is based not upon nutritional issues but partially upon changes in cholesterol and HDL levels that result. I wouldn't yet go so far as to say that mainstream thinking is that alcohol truly helps longevity as there are substantive and evidence-based studies that show this not to be true (Fillmore is just one, albeit an important one). I suspect the verdict isn't yet in. The Paleolithic era argument is unlikely for a variety of reasons, the main one being that lifespan was probably far briefer than would have been necessary for cardiac disease to play a significant role in longevity at all. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so there's some agreement regarding the 'Paleolithic' theory being unsubstantiated, which is transparent. Drgitlow, I agree that there are studies refuting the position that regular, moderate alcohol use is detrimental to health. I also agree that a putative mechanism involves modulation of cholesterol and HDL (this would be what I meant by medicinal value; such effects are also observed with statins, for example). I disagree with your argument regarding 'mainstream positions.' The presence of a refuting study does not automatically change (or establish) a mainstream position. Statements from medical associations, such as the AMA, are evidence of a mainstream position. An excellent refutation of the mainstream position is not, in itself, a position. To satisfy NPOV, I would ask for a demonstration that tetotaling is advocated by an association of medical professionals (in a published press statement), or as the principal conclusion of a peer-reviewed review article (not a primary finding). <a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENamfFohyr_4f40.html" title="User:NamfFohyr">rmbh</a> 20:01, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that's a very reasonable position. The AMA does not currently have policy on the subject and I'll check to see if the American Society of Addiction Medicine does. Various cardiac specialty organizations may have positions as well that we should explore. I think you're right that the mainstream position in the public eye is pretty clear, but I don't know that there is a stated mainstream position among physicians. I could be wrong though...I'm not a cardiologist and they may well have a public position on the matter. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 05:21, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ben Best, editorials exists to facilitate debate of this type (your citations comprise a single documented debate); the existence and tone of the editorial demonstrates my point, that the mainstream view (pro-drinkers) is being contested by a minority body of scientists/physicians (pro-tetotalers). If this position were actual mainstream, and well-evidenced, then one could use a) multiple epidemiological studies on differing populations b) experimental studies on model organisms or tissues, and c) review articles that summarize the consensus position. Nine years after the publication of this editorial, has the Royal Society of Medicine reached a consensus recommendation? I mean, the American physicians aren't completely in the pocket of industry (for example, they still advocate for marijuana and against tobacco, fairly consistently, which is probably fairly labeled anti-establishment) but I haven't seen a growing consensus that is consistent with your personal view. <a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENamfFohyr_4f40.html" title="User:NamfFohyr">rmbh</a> 03:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest a different name for this page. Controversy shouldn't be part of the title. The title should describe the information in this page. Controversy is inherent in the description of all sides of the issue. Here are some options for a name change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health benefits of alcohol</li>
<li>Benefits and risks of alcohol</li>
<li>Moderate consumption of alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these titles require modifying the information on this page to contain more information about, say, the risks of alcohol.<a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">User:nereocystis</a> 06:41, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC).</p>

<p>After thinking about this a bit further, I suggest that this page change direction slightly and discuss all health aspects of alcohol consumption, regardless of the quantity. It would mention a few items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Health benefits and risks of moderate consumption of alcohol, as it is today.</li>
<li>Health risks of higher consumption, including any benefits of high consumption.</li>
<li>Health risks of low alcohol consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason I want to move in this direction is that the range of moderate consumption to high consumption is a continuum, not an absolute separation with, say, 2 drinks being moderate consumption with an entirely different set of risks for high consumption which is 3 drinks or more. I want to include cirrhosis, and drunk driving, even though the risk is lower with moderate consumption. Perhaps the title could be "health and alcohol consumption".<a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 06:45, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find it bizarre that consuming 30g/day of alcohol can be considered "moderate drinking". I rarely drink that much in a month! Still, good news for the brewers... wonder which one funded the research?</p>

<p>Exactly what constitutes moderate (or sensible) drinking) varies widely from country to country. <a href="http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/HealthIssues/1110565592.html" class="external text" title="http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/HealthIssues/1110565592.html" rel="nofollow">What is Moderate Drinking or Alcohol Consumption?</a> In addition, it depends on who is asked. A member of the WCTU would say that any consumption is excessive, whereas an alcohol-dependent person would likely say that consuming a quart of 80 proof whiskey each day is moderate. And yes, the pattern of consumption is important.</p>

<p>There's been quite some research recently testing the claims about moderate drinking, and the Center for Disease Control's findings need to be mentioned. Namely, the CDC claims that the existing findings were corrupted by massive supressed variable biases, such as much higher incidence of poverty amongst nondrinkers, and that these things could explain the measured positive effect. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Ritchie_6195.html" title="User:Scott Ritchie">Scott Ritchie</a> 04:51, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Scott- I think the CDC suggests that the relationship between moderate drinking and health benefits *may* have been influenced by uncontrolled variables and that therefore the benefits of moderate drinking may have been exaggerated. This hypothesis (which is a very reasonable one) was first proposed by Shaper in 1988. However, at an international conference a few years ago, he acknowledged, as I recall, that his hypothesis had not been supported by subsequent research that addressed the issue. Since then, the evidence against his hypothesis has continued to grow. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>"Some controversy persists about the apparent higher CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) risk among abstainers. For example, a much publicized hypothesis (Shaper et al. 1988) suggests that the group of abstainers studied may have included persons with pre-existing alcohol-related health problems who were already at high CAD risk (i.e., "sick quitters"). However, studies that differentiate between lifelong abstainers and past drinkers suggest that both of these types of nondrinkers are at higher risk of CAD than are current drinkers (Renaud et al. 1993; Maclure 1993; Klatsky 1994). In addition, a prospective Kaiser Permanente study of alcohol habits and CAD hospitalizations (Klatsky et al. 1986b) showed that former drinkers and infrequent drinkers (i.e., those who consumed less than one drink per month) were at similar CAD risk as lifelong abstainers. All other subjects had a lower CAD risk independent of a number of potential indirect explanations (i.e., confounders), including beverage choice (see the section, "The Role of Beverage Choice," p. 19) and baseline CAD risk (i.e., pre-existing CAD risk as evaluated at the patient's initial examination). In a prospective study of total CVD mortality (Klatsky et al. 1990a), former drinkers had higher age-adjusted CAD and overall CVD mortality risk than lifelong abstainers, but the difference disappeared when adjusted for other traits. Among current drinkers, lighter drinkers had the lowest risk for both total CVD deaths and CAD deaths, yielding U-shaped mortality curves with lowest risk at one to two drinks per day and at three to five drinks per day, respectively. Mortality curves were not influenced by differences in patients' baseline CAD risk or by the occurrence of pre-existing CAD."(“Moderate drinking reduced risk of heart disease,” Alcohol Research &amp; Health, 1999).</p>
<p>Since this article was published, other research has found that lifelong abstainers and heavy drinkers both have higher mortality rates than do moderate drinkers. Such studies include:</p>

<dd>Hi Scott- Looks like we both misspoke. The CDC is making no assertions regarding the relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and health. One of the many studies it funds each year has called into question the validity of that relationship. A summary of the study in question follows:</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Article: Naimi TS, Brown DW, Brewer RD, Giles WH, Mensah G, Serdula MK, Mokdad AH, Hungerford DW, Lando J, Naimi S, Stroup DF. Cardiovascular risk factors and confounders among nondrinking and moderate-drinking U.S. adults. Am J Prev Med 2005;28:369-373.</p>
<p>Summary: The authors state that studies suggest that moderate drinkers have lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality than nondrinkers and heavy drinkers, but there have been no randomized trials on this topic. Although most observational studies control for major cardiac risk factors, CVD is independently associated with other factors that could explain the CVD benefits ascribed to moderate drinking</p>
<p>The authors used data from the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a population–based telephone survey of U.S. adults, to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors and potential confounders among moderate drinkers and nondrinkers. Moderate drinkers were defined as men who drank an average of two drinks per day or fewer, or women who drank one drink or fewer per day. After adjusting for age and gender, nondrinkers were more likely to have characteristics associated with increased CVD mortality in terms of demographic factors, social factors, behavioral factors, access to health care, and health-related conditions. Of the 30 CVD-associated factors or groups of factors assessed, 27 (90%) were significantly more prevalent among nondrinkers. Among factors with multiple categories (e.g., body weight), those in higher-risk groups were progressively more likely to be nondrinkers. Removing those with poor health status or a history of CVD did not affect the results.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that their findings suggest that some or all of the apparent protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on CVD may be due to residual or unmeasured confounding. Given their limitations, nonrandomized studies about the health effects of moderate drinking should be interpreted with caution, particularly since excessive alcohol consumption is a leading health hazard in the United States.</p>
<p>Comments: Epidemiologists are only too aware of confounding in interpreting their results of observational studies among humans. It has long been known that social status, education, income, and many other factors modify the relation of alcohol to health and disease outcomes, and there is methodology available (and still being developed) to help adjust for confounding and to judge the impact of residual confounding in a study. None of this is discussed in the present paper. Using the best available techniques to adjust for confounding, almost every epidemiologic paper published has found that for a given age, gender, race, educational and smoking status, etc., moderate drinkers are less likely to die from coronary disease. Further, interventional studies in humans and extensive animal studies show dramatic reductions in most cardiovascular risk factors when alcohol is given in an experimental situation; this is also not commented upon by the authors.</p>
<p>Overall, this paper does not add any real insight into potentially confounding variables that we all deal with daily. Further, the risk of some of the factors they list such as diabetes and even obesity have now been shown in animal studies and limited interventional studies in humans to be reduced by moderate intake of alcohol. Hence, it would be expected that such risk factors would be more common among nondrinkers, as some of them (perhaps even a more favorable “general health status”) may be the result of alcohol intake. The implication of this paper that previous studies showing protection against CVD from moderate alcohol consumption have largely ignored many such factors is erroneous.</p>
<p>A number of statements throughout the paper cannot be supported by data. For example, by stating that “moderate drinking has a relatively small effect size relative to other risk factors,” the authors ignore a large amount of recent data showing much greater effects on HDL-cholesterol from alcohol than for any other lifestyle factor, more decrease in platelet aggregation from alcohol than other factors, much greater effects from moderate alcohol use on risk of death from CVD among diabetics than from other approaches for lowering risk. There are also a number of problems in the analyses done for this paper. Simply giving each factor one point and adding the number of factors together to get a “CVD Risk Score” is naïve, as very detailed equations have been worked out by the Framingham Heart Study and others that give proper weight for each component of a risk score. In fact, the authors of this paper do not even discuss the degree of impact on heart disease risk of the factors they list.</p>
<p>The authors end by stating that we should not consider alcohol use as a way of reducing heart disease risk as “there are safe and effective strategies to decrease CVD mortality.” They do not comment, however, on how often individuals are successful in losing weight and keeping it off, on the great difficulties many addicted smokers have in trying to stop smoking, or on the cost and potential side effects of the medications they suggest as alternative ways to reduce CVD risk.</p>
<p>No one is urging individuals to drink more (as very small amounts on a regular basis are not only the safest but most effective way of reducing cardiovascular risk), and no one is urging everyone to drink alcohol, as there are many conditions (previous problems with abuse, certain health conditions, against religious or ethical beliefs, etc.) that serve as contraindications to alcohol intake. Nevertheless, it is incumbent among all of us to provide balanced and scientifically sound information for physicians to use in advising individual patients about alcohol use or non-use. A paper such as the present one does not help in getting balanced information across to the public or the health profession.</p>
<p>Lay Summary: This paper points out that nondrinkers in the U.S. tend to have many unhealthy lifestyle and physiologic factors that may increase their risk of heart disease. The authors suggest that some of the purported reduction in risk of heart disease from alcohol intake may be due to these factors. Epidemiologists always strive to adjust for those factors that can be measured and comment upon those that cannot be measured or adjusted for when evaluating the effects of alcohol intake on heart disease risk. The current paper does not add much to our understanding of this ongoing challenge.</p>

<dd>Here's an older article I just found, discussing what may have been a much better paper in the British Medical Journal: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/377381.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/377381.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC link</a>

<dd><i>They explained that earlier studies may have shown improved health among moderate drinkers simply through a statistical quirk. Many of the previous studies had shown results in the form of a U graph, with moderate drinkers having the lowest death rates, while heavy and non-drinkers had the highest. However, such figures could be skewed because sick people are more likely to be non-drinkers - they do not drink because they are ill, rather than being ill because they do not drink.</i></dd>

<p>I think that Article gives misleading picture of the discussion. It is definitely not true that all the studies show that alcohol is beneficial. See the following article for example: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/377381.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/377381.stm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> --128.214.200.176 10:01, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article doesn't say that all studies demonstrate health benefits of drinking sensibly. I don't know of any area of medical research in which *all* studies report the same or consistent findings. However, as this article says, there is *consensus* among medical researchers regarding the relationship. That's not a point of view but a fact.</dd>

<p>I guess I fall into the category of non drinking heavy exerciser,now I must admit I have no true medical or nutritinoal (al least not enough) knowledge as to affirm or discuss,but at least folk-lore wise,many members of my family have had unusually long lifespans(rangingh from 86 to even 104) and most of them were either non drinkers or extremely light ones. Now I admit that many of the people's longevity was influenced by their mountain life,but many others who lived in more common urban environments also achieved unusual long periods of life being light to null drinkers. In a more completely unscientific level,probably more than half of the moderate to heavy drinkers I know sport negative physical effects of alcohol such as the proverbial beer gut or what I call the "duck arse" Furthermore,many medics I ve consulted from time to time about training did say alcohol facilitated weight gain.I was surprised to find many elements in favor of alcohol consumption,but it seems still like a great controversy,and it is not uncommon of men to support their lifestyles with arguments i na way that could somehow possibly ease their minds about it and casually enough,roughly 90% of the world population consumes alcoholic beverages in one form or other.</p>
<p>No I'm not saying the "positive effects" faction or the "negative effects" one are right or are wrong,since I would easily be overcomed with well written well documented corrections. It just seems strange to me that a decisive conclusion about a subject so familiar hasnt been reached yet in the scientific community El Gostro 02:50, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The current article is incomplete and reflects its origins as an article entitled "Moderate drinking controversy".

For medium and high consumption, the figure is 75754 deaths. So, broadly, low consumption has some beneficial effects whilst higher levels have none. <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunquam_Dormio_ecde.html" title="User:Nunquam Dormio">Nunquam Dormio</a> 09:27, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just noted some untranslated medical jargon in the section "Cognition", specifically near the end, the line, "although a number of studies have noted a measurable diminution in neuropsychologic parameters in habitual consumers of moderate amounts of ethanol, others have not found such changes." Does anyone know what is meant by "neuropsychologic parameters"? <a href="../../../g/b/m/User%7EGBMorris_6b8a.html" title="User:GBMorris">GBMorris</a> 01:43, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
