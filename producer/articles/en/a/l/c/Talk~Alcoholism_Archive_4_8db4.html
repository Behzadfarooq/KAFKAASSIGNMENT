<p><i>For background on this decision, see <a href="../../../a/l/c/Talk%7EAlcoholism_Archive3_2b8b.html" title="Talk:Alcoholism/Archive3">Archive3</a></i></p>
<p>I think we're very close to something useable and it's just a matter of a couple of words. Let's try to find the common ground between these two:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Alcoholism</b> is the consumption of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a>—which contain the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug.html" title="Drug">drug</a> <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol.html" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>—to the extent that such use causes physical or mental harm, or interferes with the drinker's normal personal, family, social, or work life.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Such <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_%28medicine%29.html" title="Chronic (medicine)">chronic</a> use causes a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">diseased</a> condition marked by <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_illness.html" title="Mental illness">psychological</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_physiology.html" title="Human physiology">physiological</a> disorders.</li>

</ol>
<p>What about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>3. <b>Alcoholism</b> is the consumption of, or preoccupation with, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a> to an extent that such use causes physical or mental harm, or interferes with the drinker's normal personal, family, social, or work life.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The resulting chronic use can result in many psychological and physiological disorders.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Note that "addictive medical condition" is one of two major meanings, the other being "chronic excessive drinking". A person who no longer drinks could be considered an "alcoholic" under the first meaning, while a frequent, heavy, deleterious drinker who does not appear to satisfy the medical diagnosis can still be considered an "alcoholic" under the second meaning.</dd>
<dd>Clearly, it seems that the medical diagnosis is currently prevalent in the field, but the fact remains that all general sources do include that other meaning and it is not necessarily clearcut to distinguish between the two.</dd>
<dd>The primacy of the medical diagnosis may also be a recent phenomenon: The OED, 1989, whose definition appears to be primarily based on the 19th-century meaning, has alcoholism: "The action of alcohol upon the human system; diseased condition produced by alcohol." All of the quotations, spanning 1852 to 1882, indicate the "excessive drinking" meaning, not the "addictive medical condition" meaning. If the article is to be specifically about the modern medical definition, then that needs to be explicitly stated, and the other definition still warrants mention as it is the origin of this meaning. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>?<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It sounds like we need to add a section for "Historical treatments of Alcoholism", or maybe "Historical views of Alcoholism". It seems reasonable that the main article would deal with contemporary views, but there is a lot of historical info that would be interesting and useful. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 22:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no question that alcoholism has been redefined over the years. One of the reasons for the 1992 JAMA article was as an attempt to bring consensus to an area that had previously been fraught with multiple perspectives. If anyone had said that there's poor consensus in defining alcoholism, I'd be the first to agree. Still, I think it is reasonable for us to use more recent definition sources, at least for the first paragraph, then potentially explore earlier ones later in the article. The '92 definition does not talk of excessive use or of craving or of urges. The first paragraph above labelled "1." works. So does the third one, because preoccupation is spoken of in the DSM-IV definition. The second one doesn't quite fit. When you get right down to it, alcoholism is the repeated use of ethanol despite one's best interests. But we can't really say that, can we? <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 23:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Needless to say, I'm thrilled that we seem to be achieving something like consensus on this. I'm just waiting to hear from R. Rapplean before making any changes to the article itself. I'd also like to hear from Centrx, but he's a busy guy and his contributions may be infrequent.

I'm going to make the change in the article now, but if anyone, especially <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> (who didn't have a chance to comment yet) does have a serious objection, then we can revisit it.

<dd>As mentioned I am in favor of door number three, but based on the history of this article, I'd really like to get Robert's opinion/buy off on this prior to making any changes. Again, based on the history until Robert buys off I do not feel we have consesus and for us to make changes without his opinion, if nothing else, looks bad. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 18:21, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sorry for taking so long to get back to this - had a bit of a busy 24 hours. I believe that this is a workable compromise, although I'm not the least bit opposed to <i>"alcoholism is the repeated use of ethanol despite one's best interests"</i>. We could fill in the details in later sentences. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 23:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks Robert. I agree that we can fill in the details later in the article, both on that, and other topics as well. I think this constitutes "full consensus" for our little workgroup (O we band of brothers) so I'll go ahead and make the change. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 23:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Marked by...disorders" means both that it results in these disorders, but also that it can be caused by these disorders, such as with a depressed person using alcohol to drown his sorrows. That is, the disorders may be found <i>together with</i> alcoholism, not only as a direct result of it. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>?<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro, second half</span></h2>
<p>I'll copy in the remainder of the intro below this (I took the liberty of bluelinking "disease"). I wanted to offer an observation about cites: Cites are a <i>good thing</i> in any article and a <i>necessity</i> in a complex article, but the presence of 7 cites at the end of a single sentence suggests that a rewrite might be in order for the sake of clarification. Regarding the actual <i>content</i> of these sentences, I have no problems with what's being expressed there, but this is where your collective expertise is so important: is there a general consensus that this is a good representation of the issue?</p>

<dd>I'm going to be in a meeting for the rest of the afternoon, but I'll check in this evening. If no one else has started by then I'll have a go at it. If all 7 cites are necessary (I haven't read through all yet) then I would look at simply re-arranging things so that it's a bit tidier. My initial thought is that having more than 2 cites per statement ends up <i>confusing</i> rather than <i>clarifying</i> the issue. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 19:14, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gentlemen, I do not feel we have consensus yet on the first section/sentence yet that sentence has now been changed in the article which puts Robert in an awkward position should he object to it. I can't speak for Robert and I think "preoccupation" is an excellent compromise but he has yet to chime in and has expressed specific concerns regarding the opening sentence/para.

<p>While waiting for RR to get back to us, I followed the link to MOS which Flonight provided for us (above) and based on the guidelines there, I have a sketchy proposal for the second half of the intro (not even the actual words yet; just an idea about <i>what</i> needs to be there):</p>
<ol>
<li>Trim down what we have now to simply mention the epidemiology/controversy exists. Save all the details for the main body of the article.</li>
<li>New sentence re: diagnosis and treatment. As above, this should be a brief mention without going into details.</li>
<li>New sentence re: societal impact, politics and public health.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just my first thought after reading through things again.

<dd>Let me back up a little and rewrite this (without compromising my thoughts at all) segment. Obviously, there will be disagreement and we'll need to compromise...one problem here is the definition of "medical." Rather than trying to define that, I'd stick with using terms like "physicians." The other problem is this whole "controversial" thing. I know MM has posted extensive references to there being a controversy, but even the Supreme Court isn't a medical resource and the other evidence cited is not from peer-reviewed literature in the medical field. The fact that sociologists have a different perspective is important to underscore. The fact that the legal system has a different perspective is also an important area to cover. But we shouldn't confuse people into thinking that their physicians are uncertain or are still arguing about something that they've long ago agreed upon. That's been my whole gripe from the start. MM has made clear to me how extensive the controversy is, but it still hasn't crossed the line from the lay public into the physician community.</dd>

<dd>I actually think that the 3rd sentence is essentially "details" that should appear in the main text rather than intro. I'm also wondering if we can "dumb-down" the first category a bit; I'm not at all sure an average reader will grok <i>Addiction medicine specialists</i> and <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> doesn't have a page by that name to explain it.

But I think you're right that it's not a known entity like Internist or Surgeon or Psychiatrist. Even within medicine, many doctors think that addiction specialists are psychiatrists...they're not.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't seem accurate to say that "physicians agree" that alcoholism is a disease given the fact that at least one in five doesn't agree and with some evidence that the proportion of those who disagree may be higher. I think we could honestly say that the majority agrees.</li>

<li>It would seem to be incorrect to assume that the AMA speaks for American physicians. Its membership has declined over the years and is currently only about 244,000 of the 800,000 active US physicians. At best, it can be said to speak for only about 30.5% of active US physicians.</li>

<dd>Wow MM, great input and many excellent points! In fact, they tie in neatly with something I wanted to bring up. There is some heated discussion on <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> regarding systemic bias and "U.S.-centrism" in our articles. I think that the more we can "globalize" this article the wider its appeal will be. I'm not suggesting something silly like dropping all cites from the AMA...but maybe we could avoiding referencing too many American organizations in the main text, or try to tie-in with some international organizations. This is just a little something to think about, I don't see it having a major impact either way. Your latest revision of the intro looks good to me; the syntax of the second sentence seems a little awkward because it has been revised so many times, so I might suggest a minor tweak there. Otherwise, I'm good with it! And I'm putting it in bold below this so it doesn't get lost. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 04:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Medical Man is absolutely correct to say that while the AMA may be the "voice" of American Medicine, it no longer has adequate membership to put the necessary oomph into its message. That said, the way the AMA develops policy is through a representative system made up of delegates from medical state and specialty societies. THOSE societies have much greater membership, and the specialty societies are probably much closer to 100%. So the AMA policy was established based upon a vote of the delegates from the other societies, not internally by its own members. One of the really strange things about the AMA is that if you're an AMA member but NOT a member of a state or specialty society, you actually have no voice at all within the AMA policy-making body. Another oddity is that the AMA could have no members at all yet would still represent American Medicine due to its house of delegates. That's a big reason why the AMA remains a powerful lobby in Washington (for good or bad) despite their primary membership being what it is.</p>
<p>I disagree with Medical Man's statement about physicians in which he notes that at least one in five doesn't agree. That was the result of a single non-random survey and an unvalidated source. I'm not saying it's not possible that the survey results aren't representative of physicians in general, but I'm saying it's highly unlikely. The type of survey that was conducted is the usual step that might be taken prior to conducting a research-oriented random survey.</p>
<p>But...and here's the best part...I'm pretty comfortable with MM's suggested revision. I'd probably amend the last sentence slightly to read: The disease theory remains controversial primarily outside the physician community, where there is disagreement on the issue after many years of debate. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 04:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So what we have so far is:</p>
<p><b>Alcoholism is the consumption of, or preoccupation with, alcoholic beverages to an extent that such use causes physical or mental harm, or interferes with the drinker's normal personal, family, social, or work life.[3][4] The resulting chronic use can result in many psychological and physiological disorders. Most physicians consider alcoholism an <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Addiction">addiction</a> and a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">disease</a> influenced by <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic.html" title="Genetic">genetic</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_psychology.html" title="Human psychology">psychological</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_environment.html" title="Social environment">social</a> factors.

<dd>I am in great disagreement over the change in direction of this definition. We went from describing what alcdoholism is and somehow got side tracked into an article about doctors opinions and non-doctor opinions and we're making some all inclusive claims again. That sort of thing erodes credibility. Again, I think we'd be wise to discuss an objective othwerwise we're going to get side tracked as it appears we are doing now.

<dd>It is important to recognize that nearly all disease states have extensive controversy - what is the REAL cause of juvenile diabetes, for example. You'll see extensive controversy in the scientific literature regarding the RIGHT way to progress scientific research to determine how to cure diabetes (something we haven't achieved yet because we still don't know the entire mechanism). And yet the entry about diabetes doesn't say "is not completely understood by anybody" or "is very controversial." If we're really putting together a NPOV, then it's important to truly be neutral. The medical field is as comfortable with its position on alcoholism as it is with hypertension or cancer, which is to say there is much uncertainty accompanied by confidence regarding the current approach and treatment methodologies as being the best currently available. This isn't an article about the controversies; rather it is an article about alcoholism. I'd therefore suggest that we keep the controversies but not place them throughout an otherwise well-educated entry. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 20:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that we need to keep controversies in perspectives. On the other hand, I think there's good reason why there haven't been great controversies (at least beyond the research community) about juvenile diabetes. JD has no history of being considered the result of moral failure, inadequate willpower, degenerate character, or lack of religious faith. Those who suffer dibetes haven't been accused of wasting their family income, abusing their spouses, neglecting their children, costing the taxayer unnecessary expense for treatment, or engaging in violence and crime because of their disease. Concern over diabetes has never led to a national prohibition against the manufacturing, distribution or sale of sugar.

<p>On #2, Could you better define epidemiology for me? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 22:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure. Epidemiology is a branch of public health which covers the study of incidence, distribution, and control. Typical areas of epidemiologic research include the percentage of the population impacted by a given condition, the distribution pattern and possible cultural and geographic implications, the cost of not treating to the public, the cost of treating to the public, and so forth. So a typical entry for epidemiology of a disease might say: "x% of people suffer from abc, with y% of those individuals ultimately dying of their illness. A greater percentage of those in the northeast have abc than those in the southwest. It is unclear as to whether this is the result of environmental conditions or of other factors. Due to extensive complications of abc, the cost of treatment averages $z per patient per year." and so on. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 23:13, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article should also address the etiology or cause(s) of alcoholism. Epidemiology is typically the first step in trying to understand a disease. However, we have much better confidence in our understanding once we know the actual physiological proceses at work. HIV/AIDS provides a good example. The first step was epidemiological; who was suffering the disease, where did they live, where did the disease spread geographically and demographically, what common characteristics did suffers have, etc. But that was preliminary. Next came research to understand the physiological processes at work. That then permitted good pharmacological research on the disease.<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> 02:55, 11 July 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/d/User_talk%7EMedical_Man_ec7b.html" title="User talk:Medical Man">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Medical_Man_d574.html" title="Special:Contributions/Medical Man">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>

<p>Ok, I think we need to take a step even further back and ask who our audience is. I think we can rule out medical professionals -- they have much better references for such a thing. As such, I think that the epidemiology should be deprioritized because that's largely useful to people who have to deal with many cases of it. It shouldn't be entirely removed, though, because it is of interest to our audience from the perspective of "how common is this". We also want to include social impact, obviously, and be able to give an overview to someone who wants to volunteer to facilitate for groups that help alcoholics.</p>
<p>Instead of "The typical course of a case of alcoholism", can we approach that from the perspective of "How to identify alcholism"? I think that the content would be very similar, but that the later would be a question that your typical reader would want answered.</p>
<p>I definitely like the "available treatment methodologies and their outcomes", but as Medicine Man hinted at above, I feel that we need to first describe the many factors involved with a person's decision to drink, and that they all need to be addressed for a treatment to be effective. Can we move "Current theories on the causes" above that? We should definitely mention that the lack of ability to identify a single cause makes treatment of it very difficult and often unsuccessful. Although this information isn't firm, I think it's important to know before people consider available treatments.<a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 17:59, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't disagree with your rearrangement, but I'm worried. How alcoholism is identified depends in large part upon how it is defined, which depends upon which model one follows. Under the medical model, alcoholism is diagnosed, fairly simply, with reference to the disease description in any of a number of textbooks (such as the DSM-IV). Those who disagree with that model, however, would have other approaches which, in some cases, don't include diagnosis at all. So we might want to go this route:</dd>

</dl>
<p>I only disagree with this because it suggests a false dilema about which theory is most accurate. Pretty much everyone agrees, for instance, that peer pressure and believe that alcohol consumption provides value to a person's life are definitely components in the addiction. The moral incompetence theory, on the other hand, has wide acceptance and poor scientific support. Pharmacological extinction has the reverse condition. Nonetheless, I happen to know various people who would probably fall into all three categories, and require treatment for each of them. Additionally, treatment methods don't just target a single cause. AA, for instance, goes head to head with the moral issue, and treats the neurochemical addiction by providing its members with "supplementary fortitude". Antibuse treats the neurochemical addiction via counter-stimulation when the drinker drinks. I believe that the Betty Ford clinics treat the physical dependence through detox, and provide life counciling to try to convince the person that they don't want to drink, and then teach the person how to distract themselves from the craving. Pharmacological extinction relieves the person of the craving naturally, and deals with the dependence by allowing the drinker to reduce his intake over time.</p>
<p>All of this means that there's significant overlap between the theories, so we can't seperate them out as cleanly as that. This is why in the original article I separated out the three forms of addiction that alcohol causes, and then was planning on describing how each treatment deals with each form of addiction. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>As far as "how it's defined" is concerned, I think we can stick with "continued drinking after negative consequences become obvious" and describe how to identify it from that perspective. A person who doesn't drink any more but still has the urge probably doesn't need US to tell him how to identify it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 21:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And that brings us back to another key question: who are the readers that this is being written for? You're right that some people will come here because they're wondering if they're alcoholic. But others will come because they want to know what the history is of the term (which we haven't really discussed at all); still others will be concerned friends and family members looking to make sure their loved one takes the path most likely to result in improvement. That's why I think we have a responsibility to not only be fair to the Wiki methodology but also to present information in a manner most likely to be useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your original approach is concerning to me only because it suggests that alcohol <i>causes</i> alcoholism. While alcohol is indeed a necessary ingredient without which someone could never become alcoholic in the first place, it doesn't cause the onset of the disease through biochemical or behavioral alteration. If an individual is a social drinker, we can't turn them into an alcoholic through provision of alcohol. On the other hand, if someone has never before had alcohol, we have to assume they have about a 10% chance of being alcoholic (but not knowing it because they've never had alcohol). Does alcohol turn those 10% into alcoholics? Not in a medical sense - they were there to begin with but didn't know it. But in a generic sense, perhaps one could make that argument.&#160;??? <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 03:48, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, I've added "history" as a section for this article. I agree with your comments in that paragraph, and feel that the direction we're headed covers them. Let me know if you feel otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why my direction suggests that. Could you elaborate? I do feel that uncontrolled drinking is the primary indicator of alcoholism. There are others, of course, but they all stem from uncontrolled drinking. I also think that the 10% genetic propensity for alcoholism is one of the things that could truly be referred to as a disease. Call it "Alcoholism Predisposition A", or something similar in medical jargon if you will. It's only a predisposition, though, and doesn't bloom into alcoholism unless the person gets into the habit of drinking. Essentially, drinking and "AP A" must both exist in the same person for the condition to develop. How can we convey that? How medically supported is that? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 15:38, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the best way for me to answer that is by example. I got called once to a college fraternity identified by the school as being a place where alcohol use was "out of control." In interviewing the students, I found that nearly all of them drank great volumes of alcohol from time to time. Many of them drank with abandon during parties and at other times. Only a few (about 15%) were alcoholic, based upon repeated use of alcohol despite hardship (grades dropping below their acknowledged abilities, losing girlfriends, being put on academic probation, arrests secondary to public intoxication, etc.) and some of these individuals were drinking less in total quantity than some of their friends who had no such problems. If I had tried to diagnose these students because of uncontrolled drinking, I wouldn't have had a clue. There's no question that some of those students who drank a lot but hadn't had problems yet might end up being diagnosable, but at the time they weren't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my book, all those who have alcoholism have the genetic propensity (whatever that turns out to be precisely) because I believe this disease to be genetically moderated, but I can't readily prove my contention. All I can do is point to studies (such as the Shedler/Block studies) that indicate significant differences in children between those who eventually end up with substance use disorders and those who don't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the condition isn't about a habit. Alcoholics drink differently than others from their very first drink when they recognize what the alcohol does to/for them. Talk to 50 alcoholics...they not only remember their first drink, but recall it with a smile and a sparkle in their eye. Talk to anyone not an alcoholic...their recollection is about the same as if you asked them when the first time was that they had cranberry juice. Who knows? It didn't mean anything to them. And if it didn't mean anything, then it can't cause a problem. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 01:28, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can barely stand alcohol, and I remember that my first drink was gin out of a glass soda bottle when I was 15. Some friends of mine in highschool went to a park, and one of the girls was dating a 23 year old, who brought the gin. Although I got drunk, I merely remember it as being dizzy and confused. I have an exceptional memory, though, so that doesn't in any way disprove what you said.</p>
<p>The college issue that your describing is an excellent example of what we might call "Alcoholism Predisposition B", which is social circumstances that provide a very high psychological benefit to drinking. Everybody has their personal set of scales in which they value experiences, and people who are fresh out from under their parent's thumb have an unusually high valuation of new social experiences. It isn't unusual, uncommon, or unexpected that some of these teenagers value new social experiences more than they value their educational experiences. Alcohol is a social lubricant in that it makes dealing with unfamiliar people much easier, and as such runs rampant under these conditions.</p>
<p>It's drinking alcohol beyond the point where it is causing obvious, chronic damage to your life. This is still a form of alcoholism, even though its root cause isn't the aforementioned "AP A". It's just that this form of alcoholism requires a completely different form of treatment, and goes away quickly when the person is removed from the encouraging environment. There is significant overlap between sufferers from AP A and AP B because they are mutually supporting. We might even go on to categorize things like "AP C", where the person drinks as a coping mechanism for unpleasant or stressful life circumstances and other psycho/social maladies. Personally I like to lump them in as being a psychological addiction, but then again I'm not trying to treat them.</p>
<p>So, again, we definitely CANNOT call heavy drinking alcoholism unless it's causing obvious, chronic damage to the drinker's life. Once that qualification is met, though, it becomes alcoholism regardless of the cause. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 16:10, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You've got an interesting definition going. It's not the standard in the field, but it's pretty reasonable, and your last paragraph is entirely correct. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 21:07, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the entire idea of a genetic propensity for a neurological addiction throws a lot of the "standard in the field" on its ear, I'm afraid, and the evidence I keep digging up seems to support it. I've certainly bent no shortage of my neurons over trying to sort this all out.</p>
<p>So I think we're finally coming to an agreement on how to characterize "active" alcoholism. I'd like to temporarily table the discussion of "passive" alcoholism (where a person needs a support group to help them resist the desire to drink) and "remissive" alcoholism (where a person has reverted their drinking conditioning, but could return to alcoholism if they drink without an opioid antagonist in their system) for a later time in favor of going back to discussion what direction the article should head in after the initial description of alcoholism.</p>

<p>Running with being able to identify alcoholism as "continued consumption of alcohol dispite obvious, chronic damage to the drinker's life.", I think we can start with the various cannonical methods of recognizing it, maybe with a summary that characterizes the obvious symptoms for non-doctors.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Robert, you speak of active, passive, and remissive alcoholism. These terms are not part of the medical perspective on alcoholism. From a medical perspective, one either has the disease or one does not. As in hypertension, an individual taking antihypertensives may bring his blood pressure back to normal. Thirty years later, that individual may still have normal blood pressure if he's been taking his medications. He still has the disease of hypertension. But it's been properly treated and the individual will not have the morbidity or mortality rates that one would expect from a case of untreated hypertension. Similarly, an alcoholic receiving proper treatment and not drinking will have morbidity/mortality rates that are close to normal. I suppose one might put descriptors upon the different states - a hypertensive taking anti-hypertensives, a diabetic on insulin therapy with normal hemoglobin a1c measures, an alcoholic who isn't drinking - all are in the same place with respect to their illness, but they still have the illness. I understand that you're still approaching this from a non-disease perspective and are therefore taking a different route to get to the descriptions, but it's tough for me to imagine that we're going to get a consensus if we're ultimately at odds about definition, cause, treatment, and beneficial outcomes. I'm not sure what the 'right' thing to do is, however. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The "active, passive, and remissive" conditions are my words for three states that an alcoholic can be in, which really need to be differentiated. An active alcoholic is currently drinking more than is healthy for him. A passive alcoholic is someone who suffers from a strong desire to drink (obsesses about it), but is abstaining for whatever reasons. A remissive alcoholic is someone who has extinguished the desire to drink, but can re-develop it if they drink without an endorphin blocker. Technically they are all alcoholics, but their condition is in a different state and needs to be handled differently from a treatment perspective. What terminology would you like to apply to these? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 03:29, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I absolutely understand how you're defining your terms, and it's not a bad categorical approach, but it isn't a standard. In medicine, the terms used are partial remission and full remission, both of which can be either early or sustained. The remission states refer to the presence or absence of disease symptoms, so they don't refer to whether someone has stopped drinking, although you can generalize that an individual in full remission is likely not drinking at all. I actually prefer your terminology, since it is MUCH more clear and would probably be used accurately by clinicians and easily understood by the lay public. But I don't think this article is the place to introduce new terminology not generally used in the field. If, on the other hand, there's a citation you could use to indicate that these terms have been suggested as a new approach, that would work. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 04:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
On that point, I have to agree with you that my terminology might be considered original research, which is definitely against Wikipedia policy. The idea of a person being completely clear of the desire to overdrink is pretty well new to the field, so I'll ask the doctors in Finland what their preferred terminology is, and if they have a reference for it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 16:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I've checked with the good Doctor and he tells me that the terms he thinks are most commonly used are "active alcoholics", "remissive alcoholics" (but that we should double-check with what the AA calls them and use that instead if it's different), and "post-alcoholics". Apparently the post-alcoholic stage is so new that there's no established term for it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 19:22, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That works for me. I don't feel that people grasp a concept unless they have a word to tie the ideas to, but that's not really our job, I guess.</p>
<p>I was raised in St. Louis, Mo, and currently reside in Denver, CO. I have contacts in Finland because I spent a bit of time researching Dr.Sinclair for an interview I did with him for <a href="http://www.intellectualicebergs.org" class="external text" title="http://www.intellectualicebergs.org" rel="nofollow">Intellectual Icebergs</a>. Sinclair is one of those strange inexplicable creatures that actually acts out of a desire to help his fellow man. Many people claim that they do, but when it comes right down to it they're usually too tied up in their own wealth or ego to let go of ideas that do more harm than good. What I discovered in my research is that Dr. Sinclair's work is very well reasoned and strongly supported, but not very well accepted because it contradicts the work of people who have more influence, and have their egos, career or income tied to a competing philosophy.</p>
<p>Dr. Sinclair was raised and trained in the US, but currently works for the Finnish health department. He has been very helpful in providing me with requested information to help me understand the quagmire that is alcoholism treatment in the US and Europe. I've also made a few calls to his institute an the Contral clinics, although the language barrier is often a problem, and Dr. Sinclair himself has been very responsive to my requests and provides some extremely valuable insight into both the medical and political issues. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 17:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we'll be more effective in the tactical discussion (what words do we use to explain alcoholism) if we have a clear set of objectives for the remaining definition first. So rather than talk about what to write in this section, let's talk about what our objective is for the remaining definition section. If we first have an objective then I think finding the words will come much more naturally. It would be worth reviewing what we have agreed upon to give us an idea of how to approach finishing the definition. I'll have some thoughts on the subject but I plan on not being here much over the weekend. I'm not saying wait for me, only that I might not be around much. Anyhow, it's something to think about and what we have agreed upon I think is very respectful to the reader and non-confrontational. I think the reader would so far say "Ok, they're not trying to sell me anything and what they're saying makes sense" and want to continue reading. So far the introductory definition seems quite credible to me. 06:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In reviewing the cites in our first paragraph, both of the remaining cites are to other encyclopedias (Medline Plus Medical and Britanica). I think that it's a very poor showing that, for our first paragraph, we have to point to another encyclopedia and say "See, they think so, too!" After some consideration, I think it would be a better policy to back up our opening section with the rest of the article, and if we need to back up individual statements in the rest of the article, then we should find more authoritative sources than other encyclopedias.

<p>I'm not trying to prove a point only to correct a verifiable error on the Alcoholism page.</p>
<p>The 15 million alcoholics is only an estimate, not a verifiable fact. (And where is the reference supporting it?) All we have are estimates of the incidence of any diseases or behaviors because no census (to my knowledge) has been taken of these diseases or behaviors. A CDC estimate is an official estimate of the U.S. government. So it appears that to be in every way as strong a statistic as the 15 million estimate. So over 45 million is roughly three (3) times 15 million.</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, there. This is one of the resident eggheads. Non-smoker, you are quite correct that tobacco smoking is a bigger problem than alcoholism, but let me disect the terminology here. I'm going to quote a few numbers here to start us off:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Alcoholics: about 15 million (as per the NIAAA)</dd>
<dd>Tobacco smokers: about 45 million (let's assume you're right)</dd>
<dd>Alcohol drinkers: about 200 million (as per SAMSA)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For alcohol, there is a clear distinction between alcohol users and alcohol abusers. Most of us just plain don't have a problem with it, and can occasionally drink it safely on a regular basis with no hint of long-term damage. Most of us do not suffer from the addiction that it causes in others.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Tobbacco doesn't have that quality. 100% of all tobbacco smokers will get addicted over time. Nicotine supplements and replaces choline in such a way that our body forgets that it needs to make its own. Also, there is no way to smoke tobacco safely. Even small amounts of it will increase your risk of cancer by small amounts, while large amounts of it will increase your risk of cancer by large amounts. Thus, you <b>could</b> make the argument that all tobacco use is a drug abuse problem.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Where the real problem comes in is that there is no standard definition for the term "abuse" because it's a term that's been used too much by people with political agendas to mean "use of something that I don't approve of". Once you tie a term to morality it takes on a relative quality necessary for a line that people draw immediately beneath themselves to identify who they are superior to. Thus, in our current culture, drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco become "use" while alcoholism becomes "abuse".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do know that tobacco induced medical costs far exceed alcohol induced medical costs, although it would take some doing to dig up the numbers, and the total cost of alcohol would also need to include property damage, divorce bills, and similar difficult to pin down expenses. Can anyone else give some input on this? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 17:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks RR, I knew I could count on one of the editors here to reply in more depth and detail than I'd be able to. My strongest objection to Non-smoker's changes was the addition of the cite which linked to a smoking-related website. I may well have been overreacting when I deleted the text that was added; my primary concern was trying to manage the size and scope of this article at a time when we're trying to trim extraneous details. If other editors feel that the text was appropriate, I won't object again. I do think that we need to be concerned about the overall size and readability of this article however, and any further additions should be carefully scrutinized. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 18:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The page says that "alcoholism is the most common substance abuse problem." But that is simply wrong if 15 million are addicted to alcohol and 46 million are addicted to tobacco. Why not say that "alcoholism is one of the most common substance abuse problems"? That would seem to be accurate. Are you going to let an error stand to avoid linking to a page citing the source of a statistic?

<dd>In retrospect I have no significant objection to the sentence reading "alcoholism is <b>one of</b> the most common substance abuse problems." That phrase would be acceptable, but the link is not. Citations in an article about alcoholism should link to the topic of alcoholism, not websites about cigarette smoking, heroin addiction, crystal meth, or any other unrelated topic. Please feel free to re-insert your original phrasing, but I hope you won't add the link again without consensus to do so.

<dd>As for the addition of the word "estimated", since we don't actually state a number down to any precision it can safely be assumed that it's an estimation. All numbers of that form are an estimation, simply because you can't exactly take a weekly nation-wide survey and ask everyone if they're an alcoholic. Numbers for tobacco users are a little easier to pin down because health insurance keeps tabs on it, but lying about smoking for health insurance purposes is common, and those who don't have life insurance are more likely to smoke than those who do, so those numbers are similarly suspect. I favor leaving out the "estimated" because it can be presumed, but will look to see if Wikipedia has a policy on that kind of concept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The cites, on the other hand, are another issue. We're definitely trying to eliminate cites in the opening paragraphs. Also, the page that is referenced doesn't say anything about alcoholism.

<p>I'd like to make several points regarding this discussion. The first is that there are many people for whom nicotine/tobacco use does not become an addiction. While all tobacco use is "bad" with respect to causing health-related consequences, one can make the same argument for alcohol (although alcohol in small quantities is said to be helpful from a cardiac perspective, it is harmful from multiple other perspectives, including hepatic, neurologic, etc.). There are many who smoke cigarettes "once in a while" when they go to social occasions or when they're with someone else who smokes, yet do not become addicted for whatever reason. This is a subject of ongoing research to determine why some people get addicted to nicotine quickly while others do not. There's no question that alcohol addiction is a MUCH greater problem in terms of cost to society and # of people afflicted than ALL other substance addictions combined - except for nicotine, as pointed out above. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 04:47, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My experience with tobacco smokers is that nicotine addiction takes several months of continuous smoking in order to set in. Unlike alcohol, nobody sucks down their first Camel and says "I gotta get me some more of that!", they think, "That's not so bad, and now I fit in with the cool crowd!". The psychological/social addiction sets in first, giving time for the physical addiction to get its grip. I smoked myself for about three weeks just because I was curious and I didn't get addicted, but the trial period was too short for that to be meaningful. The primary reason that the factors of nicotine addiction are so difficult to pin down is because the signal to noise ratio is so high. The cost/benefit formula for the initial picking up of the habit involves nearly intangible benefit and negligible cost, so it's often swamped by other considerations.</p>
<p>I will admit, though, that my statement of 100% nicotine addiction is based on those who have picked up smoking. It may be that the unaddictable percentage just forget to purchase the next pack at some point, but I've never met anyone who has smoked for a while and then just lost interest. I'll have to start asking that specific question. I don't think that anybody has done a study where they take x non-smokers, ask them to smoke a pack a day for a year, and then find out how many of them can easily quit, so I think that the evidence is out either way.</p>
<p>But back on topic, can we say "Second only to nicotine addiction, alcoholism is one of the world's most costly drug use problems. Alcoholism is more costly to our world's societies than all other drug use problems, excepting nicotine addiction, combined." <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 16:00, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Non-smoker, an <i>apparently</i> new user with absolutely no contrib history outside this article has suddenly appeared and begun inserting references about cigarette smoking into an article about alcoholism. While honest consensus between editors is critical to our project, I am somewhat dubious about the honesty of these contributions. I really don't feel that they are relevant or productive, nor do I feel a need to compromise by inserting irrelevant or inappropriate material for the sake of appeasing an editor with a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a>.

<p>Hi, doc, thanks for voicing your concern. Fortunately, in this case, nicotine addiction is in my field of expertise (social impact of drug use), and I can verify that his claims of social damage and addiction rates are reasonably accurate, at least in the US. I feel that referencing nicotine addiction, but not specifically smoking, gives the reader a feel for where alcoholism falls in the heirarchy of drug-related social problems. If you would like this to be cited then we can tag it as needing citation, but I'm comfortable with the statement. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 20:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a>, I noticed that you added the word abuse after the word drug in the third sentence of the article. That's a very politically charged word, and I'm not sure we can fairly use it. Most people don't know the difference between immoral, illegal, and harmful, and our population would apply varying amounts of the three to that word depending on their background. Some people, for instance, would insist that you can't abuse something if it isn't illegal - that it would be misuse or overuse. Others would insist that there's no difference between use and abuse. This is especially a problem when attempting to apply those words to legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco. Would you mind if we changed the wording to "drug use", but still linked it to the drug abuse article? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 02:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I definitely need to thank everyone who has caught my misspellings. I'm making small changes while code is compiling, so I don't always have time to triple-check my spelling.

<p>Hi, Palx. Opine much? Dependency refers to the body's physical adaption to a persistant high alcohol level. It's a very strong indicator of alcoholism, but is not the ONLY strong indicator of alcoholism, nor is it a required symptom for alcoholism to be diagnosed. There is a misperception that the dependence on alcohol is synonymous with alcoholism, but dependence is an adaption while alcoholism is a misdirected drive. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 16:20, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The big reason, Palx, is that dependence itself can mean many things. To some, dependence is synonymous with addiction; to others, dependence refers to a physiologic state. Psychiatrists use the term dependence the way other physicians use the term addiction. Dependence to some is a disease state while to others it represents a natural mammalian response to specific groups of drugs. Because of the many standards (and resulting confusion) around this term, we elected not to incorporate it within the definition of alcoholism itself. That way, we can be clear about what alcoholism means without using other terms which, while clear to some, might not be clear to all readers. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:12, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h1><span class="mw-headline">Terminology Section</span></h1>
<p>I took a stab at the definition of Addiction. It's a simplification of what the article has to say, and I think that's what we need here. Please let me know if you find a problem with it.</p>
<p>I'd like to revisit our definitions of 'abuse' and 'dependence'. Right now the page currently reads:</p>
<p><i><b>Abuse and Dependence have standard medical diagnosis definitions in the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM-IV-TR_39ab.html" title="DSM-IV-TR">DSM-IV-TR</a>, but this terminology is now under discussion for change as DSM-V is being prepared.</b></i></p>
<p>What this translates to is that "abuse and dependence have definitions, but these definitions might change". I think we'd be better off if we actually provided the readers with a definition that's currently accurate. I do have to say, though, that most politicians have never opened a DSM, and they have more influence over the commonly understood definition of abuse than any doctor does. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 18:19, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A Psychiatrist's definition of abuse</span></h2>
<p>Hey, Dr. Gitlow. I noticed that you adjusted the aforementioned section to say:</p>
<p><i><b>A psychiatrist would probably quote the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM-IV_1fd8.html" title="DSM-IV">DSM-IV</a> and state that the presence of abuse is based upon the definition provided there.</b></i></p>
<p>I was hoping to give the reader a better perspective on the considerations a medical professional would have for labelling something as abuse. This kind of says that "if you're not smart enough to read the DSM that I'm not going to tell you." Could you elaborate a little for our audience? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 00:01, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See what you think of the changes I implemented just now. I'm trying to avoid actually putting the full working definition of 'abuse' and 'dependence' as defined in DSM-IV, but we could present an overview of this in a sidebar. I figured that would be covered in the entries for abuse and dependence, but now that I've just looked those up, there really isn't much there. Think it belongs here? <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 03:16, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a definite improvement, but I think you misunderstand how most people think of the DSM. To be more specific, most people don't know the DSM from Billy Joe Bob. To illustrate how this effects people's comprehension of what you're writing, I'm going to copy what you wrote here, replacing all references to the DSM with references to Billy Joe Bob:</p>
<p><i><b>The term abuse has a variety of possible meanings. Within psychiatry, Billy Joe Bob has a specific definition involving a set of life circumstances which take place as a result of substance use. Within politics, abuse is often used to refer to the illegal use of any substance. Within the broad field of medicine, abuse sometimes refers to use of prescribed medication in excess of the prescribed dosage or to use of a prescription drug without a prescription. The term can therefore cause confusion due to the possibility that an audience doesn't share a single definition.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Dependence also has a variety of definitions. The standard psychiatric diagnosis of dependence is defined by Billy Joe Bob, but here the terminology is being reconsidered by Billy Joe Bob due in part to the many working definitions for dependence.</b></i></p>
<p>The first paragraph works because it actually describes abuse, but the second one doesn't actually tell the audience anything. I believe that what we're really looking for here is a summary of the definition, using the DMS as your reference. Does this convey what I'm trying to get at? I'd write it myself but I figured it would be better from someone who knew the DSM better. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 17:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, many of the entries here refer to concepts that aren't discussed in this article, and we need to fix that.</p>
<p>Could we have a bit of brainstorming about the various ways of identifying an alcoholic? I'd like to put each major method under its own subheading. Obviously the DSM and CAGE models belong there.</p>
<p>I'd also like to expand on my first paragraph that describes the difficulties involved in diagnosis.

<dd>The CAGE isn't a diagnostic test. It is simply a screening test used to identify those individuals likely to have alcoholism. As an analogy, to diagnose primary hypertension, one might conduct a screening test of measuring blood pressure. A single result of an elevated blood pressure may have many causes, one of which is primary hypertension. The DSM definition of alcohol dependence is a diagnostic definition for the disease of alcohol dependence (DSM's term for alcoholism). The 1992 JAMA article's definition of alcoholism is another diagnostic definition for the disease. From a medical standpoint, a physician will ask a series of questions designed to determine whether an individual's intake of alcohol has led to adverse outcomes in a repetitive manner. If the answer is 'yes,' then the individual is alcoholic. If 'no,' then intake of alcohol may be either nonpathologic or causing something other than alcoholism. For instance, let's say an individual comes in to see me complaining of significant anxiety, but has NO other problems. And let's say that individual honestly reports drinking 2-3 beers each day. That patient possibly has an alcohol-induced anxiety disorder. I then tell the patient that their anxiety, which is causing significant discomfort, may be a result of alcohol intake. I recommend cessation of alcohol use and a re-examination in 1 month. If in one month the patient has not stopped drinking despite the possible adverse reaction, now I must consider alcoholism as one possible diagnosis. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:30, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is definitely an important distiction, and one of the reasons why I wanted to rename the section "Identification" instead of "diagnosis". Remember that our target audience doesn't contain a lot of medical professionals, so if it gets to the diagnosis stage we probably just need to give a brief overview of "how do them doctor guys know, anyway?" As such, the screening is a good tool that people can use in order to help them decide that maybe they really do need to see a doctor about this, and as such is perfect for our audience. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 03:29, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that this can be fixed by changing the leading word "diagnosis" to "identification". I agree that diagnosis isn't terribly hard. If a person tells you that they have trouble not drinking then that pretty well settles it (oversimplification, I know). The difficult part comes in when other people are trying to decide if their loved ones are alcoholics. This usually involves attempting to apply the observer's priorities on the drinker, which is more often than not a mis-match. This is where the difficulty comes in. Again, trying to keep the non-medical-professional audience in mind.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Diagnosis</span></h3>
<p>In 1992, a joint committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine was formed to establish a definition of alcoholism that could be used in a clinical setting. That committee defined the condition as a "primary, chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. The disease is often progressive and fatal...characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably denial. Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Curing by moderation (Reposted comment from archive)</span></h2>
<p>There is reason that healthcare professionals have a tough time accepting any treatment that involves continued drinking. The Pendery article in Science in 1982 (Science. 1982 Jul 9;217(4555):169-75.) essentially blew the moderation movement out of the water by demonstrating that over the long-term, patients who truly had alcoholism and who tried to drink in moderation either a) died of alcohol-related disease, b) ended up with significant morbidity due to alcohol-related disease, or c) had successfully entered abstinence. One method of diagnosing the disease is to simply see whether a patient tries to control their alcohol intake; if they do, they probably have alcoholism (noone tries to control their orange juice intake -- if they did, one would think there's something wrong). <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 16:53, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're mistaking pharmacological extinction with moderation. Moderation is an attempt to use personal habits and willpower to attempt to decrease one's drinking habits to a more healthy level. Pharmacological extinction is an attempt to reverse conditioning placed upon a person's neurochemistry by providing stimulus, but by blocking the reward mechanism. I agree and accept that moderation doesn't work, but there is a great deal of evidence indicating that PE does. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 21:45, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Regarding_Pharmacological_Extinction" id="Regarding_Pharmacological_Extinction"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding Pharmacological Extinction</span></h2>
<p>I think that the countersite on pharmacological extinction needs to be more closely examined. PA isn't an attempt at moderation, and the cited study is dated 1982, before PA was developed, which was around 1992. PA is based on observations that overdrinking prone rats have overactive endorphin systems. Endorphin is our body's chemical mechanism for making us want to perform behaviors like sex, exercise, and fighting, which aren't terribly productive or efficient in their own right but which provide notable benefits in the long run. It has been demonstrated that the consumption of alcohol releases endorphins in our system, so the theory is that alcoholism is caused by the inappropriate rewarding of our neurological system when we drink.</p>
<p>Pavlov demonstrated that providing a stimulus coupled by a reward causes conditioning, but he also proved that providing the stimulus without the reward causes the extinction of that conditioning. Bell without food results in cessation of salivation over time. For alcoholism the bell is all of the sensations involved with drinking alcohol, and the reward is an endorphin reward to our neurons. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist. In short, it blocks our bodies from being rewarded when we drink. Thus, if we drink alcohol while on naltrexone, our neurons unlearn their drinking impulses.</p>
<p>So, again, it has nothing to do with attempting to moderate drinking, it has to do with providing stimulus without reward so that the urge to drink is extinguished. Thus, any study which involves moderation without naltrexone use has nothing to do with this. Similarly, any study which involves naltrexone (or nalphamene, or noloxone) coupled with abstinence or abstinence encouraging therapies (like AA) similarly demonstrates nothing about PE. If you would like a complete list of the studies which have been performed involving opioid antagonists, let me know. I have a list that was updated around Nov 2004. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 02:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Robert, the PE approach is a behavioral modification approach combined with neurochemical findings. And I see your point about it leading to abstinence through a process which involves some continued use of alcohol for the behavioral modification to occur. It's a fascinating idea. My understanding of it is that it works theoretically as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alcohol causes the production of endorphins. In some individuals, alcohol causes endorphins to a greater extent than usual. This causes those individuals to have a reduced ability to refuse alcohol (because, simply put, the alcohol is too enjoyable for them to refuse even if it causes them hardship). Naltrexone, among other drugs, stops the endorphins from getting their message through by antagonizing the neurotransmitter system involved. Therefore, if you give the naltrexone and these individuals drink, they will no longer feel the enjoyment they once did. Behavioral modification will result due to the lack of positive feedback and the drinker will ultimately be able to stop drinking on his or her own.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While liver toxicity is an issue with naltrexone, the doses necessary here would be low enough as to present a low risk of hepatic damage (in general), even when combined with alcohol. I reviewed the Sinclair paper from Alcohol &amp; Alcoholism 36(1)2-10. 2001 that discusses this in greater detail. What Sinclair reports is something that hasn't been replicated well in US trials since the US trials haven't followed his instruction that naltrexone be given simultaneously with alcohol. This provides a potential explanation as to why the US trials for naltrexone have been less than successful. All very interesting and deserving of additional study. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:43, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is almost correct. Right idea, but the theory states that it's a neurochemical effect, not a behavioral one. In order to clarify, I want to Quote Dr. Sinclair directly:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"On the other question, you are correct that mixing naltrexone and disulfiram together will not work. Many people would expect it to, but this expectation is based on the incorrect common sense understanding of behavior (CUB). CUB says that a person sits and contemplates what behaviors will bring pleasure and what will bring pain, and then choose to make the behavior expected to produce the most net pleasure. Inherent in this view is the idea that pleasure and pain add together algebraically. Like pleasure has positive numbers and pain has negative. So if you have behavior that produces something good (+2) but then you shock the person for doing it (-3), the end result is the algebraic sum -1, so the person will avoid doing that. If you only give a little shock (-1), the sum is +1 and the person will continue doing it. If you really wollop them (-5), then the sum is -3 and the person will avoid the behavior completely. This seems so logical. It is the basis for our legal system, the basis for economic, the basis for how most people raise their kid, and the basis for how most people treat others. It is, however, definitely incorrect.</i></dd>

If you look in after drinking (without naltrexone) and then getting beat up in a fight, you will find the pathway causing drinking is being strengthened - the endorphins are still there producing the reinforcement. At the same time pathways the cause getting out of that bar and avoiding fights are also being strengthened. End result, the guy continues drinking but someplace else."</i><br />

<p>The reason I want to make this distinction is because people's lives give them -10s when they drink. They lose their jobs, their spouses, their property, and can wind up in a gutter. This doesn't make them stop drinking alcohol, even though sensibly and obviously the net effect is quite negative. It just tells them that they need to get help, and sometimes even that isn't enough, which is why they have interventions. There's more to it than an intellectual assessment of the benefits.</p>

<p>Hi, Doc. Thanks for making the correction on the detox section. I was finding it tough to believe that any alcohol center actually administers alcohol as part of in-patient detoxification. It's terribly contrary to their philosophy. I'll remove the chunks of the previous paragraphs that conflict with it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 21:00, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Until at least the late 80s, some VAs were still using alcohol on a tapering dose schedule, but I don't think that's done anymore. When you get right down to it, as far as the brain is concerned, there's no real difference between alcohol and the other sedatives, so the conflict to using alcohol for the taper is psychologic or philosophic rather than biologic. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 18:26, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd tend to agree, but the bias is still there. Theoretically the endorphin conditioning might be getting worse while you're tapering, whereas it wouldn't with other GABA immitators, but the person's probably already deep in the throws of endorphin conditioning by then anyway, so it wouldn't matter much. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 22:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, folks. The references section has gotten out of control as an unreadable mishmash of cites that may or may not actually be pertinant to something that is still in the article. Could you help me out here? I'd like to maintain a permanent section in the talk page that specifically lists the significance of each reference to the article at large. Many of these articles are not readily accessible, so I'd like to create a guide to their significance so the reader doesn't have to go digging into a bunch of medical journals to figure out what the purpose of the cite is. I'm going to use this site from Dr. Sinclair as an example of how I'd like to see the cites explained. In the article I'd like to see them ordered based on the position of the text in the article that they support. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 16:42, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is an <i>excellent</i> idea, and without question, something needs to be done. It appears that many of the cites are redundant in the sense that they point to articles which say essentially the same thing. I'd like to suggest a couple of ideas, but I'll wait for input from others before taking any actions:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate some of the redundant cites.</li>
<li>Try to avoid referencing the websites of individuals, even if they are MDs. I think these don't have as much credibilty as the numerous journals we can link to.</li>
<li>If any sentence actually needs more than a single cite, that might indicate that we need to rewrite the sentence for clarity.</li>

<p>The article has been Tagged for "Systemic Bias", specifically "U.S.-centrism". Ironically, I had voiced this concern previously and was considering how to best address the problem. Unfortunately, the editor who added the tag didn't offer up any suggestions (which I consider a bit sloppy; adding a tag without any follow-up is actually a <i>dis-improvement</i>). My only idea so far is to check out the World Health Organization and see if they offer more "global" statistics, and I haven't actually done so yet.

<dd>[Jacob] Having not commented, yet used Wikipedia extensively, this conversation gave me the push to begin. Enough said, while I am not in a position to comment on the above debate, I would strongly argue that the page Alcoholism should contain something similar to a 'Cultural Perceptions of Acceptable Alcohol Consumption' section in the begining or at the end to put the discourse into a global or at least Western context (examples of both are available). The point should not be to dispute medical facts on the negative effects of alcohol, but rather show that perceptions of alcohol consumptions vary widely from country to country. So, using the CAGE test many many Scandinavians would be alcoholics. While they might be, it might also be the case that societies and cultures deal differently with heavy (weekend) alcohold consumption and their societies are not falling apart. This is arguably a subjective point of view. Yet, for instance, the official Danish PR body of the ministry of health (Sundhedsstyrelsen) recommends a maximum intake of 21 (14 for females) units of alcohol (a 33 cl bottle of beer is one unit and so is a shot of strong alcohol (vodka, snaps etc)) per week. From the Wikipedia page I get the view that such recommendations would make officials in other Western countries shake their heads in disbelief. As said, this serves not to dispute medical facts or ruling beliefs, but merely to put this hotly debated topic into perspective. Finally, making such a section should also not be a 'trojan horse' to say that North Americans (or others) are too strict in their definitions, but - again - just to show how societies and individuals deal with the abundance of alcohol and the cultural acceptance of indulging in such abundances differently. Documenting such the above points would be fairly easy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi, Jacob, and welcome to the conversation. I hope you don't mind that I moved your paragraph to this topic, it really seems to belong here. This would be very useful in taking some of the geographic bias out of the <b>Identification</b> section. I think that the proper way to present this would be to give examples of the two extremes (for instance, places in the middle east where any alcohol is sinful), and then give a general feel for what kinds of people have what kinds of social tolerances for alcohol. I'm a bit tied up with other information gathering activities, but would anyone else like to take a whack at that? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 04:21, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are a few issues here: the first is that we can't confuse what should go in the <b>Alcohol</b> article as opposed to what should go in the <b>Alcoholism</b> article. Alcoholism, the condition defined by the World Health Organization, is akin to all other health conditions in that it is not defined by virtue of culture, country of origin, or any other parameter other than being human. Just as one either has hypertension or not, independent of whether a particular race has a lower or higher than human population average for blood pressure, one either has alcoholism or not, again independent of the usual intake of alcohol among one's peers. The fact, of course, is that the likelihood that one suffers from alcoholism is nil if there's no alcohol around, as is common among particular cultural groups.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maximum or minimum recommended intake levels are indeed defined differently by different groups, and with much controversy among various cultures, but those issues apply to alcohol, not to alcoholism. I'd therefore vote that we leave that topic out and rather focus on the defining aspects of alcoholism. I recognize, as we've discussed here, that there are differing definitions - but I don't believe there are any who would define the condition based upon cultural factors. Worst case scenario is that of an individual who has lost his home, finances, and health as a result of his alcohol intake - an alcoholic in any culture. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 04:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Having slept on it, I have to agree with Dr. Gitlow. One of the things that is tough to understand about alcohol is the relationship between alcoholism and drinking. Drinking doesn't cause alcoholism, but alcoholism does cause drinking. There's a verifiable unidirectional causal relationship there. The only berring that this might have on the article would be that it's more difficult to spot alcoholism in cultures where heavy drinking is common and socially acceptable, and over-diagnosed where it isn't acceptable. In St. Louis, Missouri, for example (which works extra hard because it isn't "officially" in the bible belt), someone who regularly drinks heavily on the weekend will often be considered an alcoholic, even though true alcoholics would consider five days of sobriety a major victory. In your typical US college town it's difficult to tell the difference between someone who just can't let go of the bottle and someone who has no sense of how much money their parents are wasting on their lack of desire to attend classes.</p>
<p>In general I'd say that it warrents a mention, but that an in-depth examination of this, while good information, doesn't really fit in this topic. Can I have opinions from other editors, please? <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 15:38, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's very important to globalize this article as much as we can and one way to promote that is to include a discussion about the issue of differences in diagnosing alcoholism in different countries, even when using the same diagnostic tool. Different physicians in the same country will diagree on a diagnosis of alcoholism using DSM-IV. We should expect that these differences will be even greater between physicians in different societies. In short, whether or not a person is diagnosed as alcoholic will depend to some degree on the society in which he lives. An anthropologist or sociologist could probably add a great deal to this discussion.<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> 01:05, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/d/User_talk%7EMedical_Man_ec7b.html" title="User talk:Medical Man">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Medical_Man_d574.html" title="Special:Contributions/Medical Man">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dl>
<dd>For example, when PIRE estimated the economic costs of underage drinking in the US, over one-third of its final estimate was based on “pain and suffering.” It also ignored the economic benefits generated by that drinking and other important components of any legitimate economic analysis. It’s own figures actually suggest not the annual economic cost of $61.9 billion that it reported, but a net economic benefit of $21.7 billion. That’s a big difference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is wide spread. Economists have found similar problems with cost estimates published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Not only are it’s cost estimates also gross rather than net, but up to 80% of the final figures are often highly debatable as being pseudo costs. The problems go on and on.</dd>

<dd>Let me give another example from a completely different field. Here in the northeast, there is an ongoing debate as to whether a wind farm should be built in Nantucket Sound off Cape Cod. Self-proclaimed experts have written editorials and participated in debates, some very much in favor and some very much opposed. As a citizen with absolutely no knowledge as to whether this is an economically or environmentally appropriate approach to take, I'd very much like to hear from the real experts. But I have difficulty distinguishing the people who really know from the people who know nothing but think they know a great deal, or from the people who simply are trying to make a point but who know how to use the media to accomplish their task. I fear that is what happens with alcoholism and it brings us back to our whole controversy issue again. Is there a controversy in the media? Yes, absolutely. Is there a controversy among the community of medical experts in the field? Nope. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 17:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Drs. Alan Marlatt and Nick Heather are both highly regarded experts in alcoholism research and treatment.

<dd>I'm afraid both Alan Marlatt and Nick Heather are psychologists, not physicians, and therefore don't tend to approach issues using a medical ethic. Whether they're seen as "highly regarded experts" is an opinion.

<dd>I can see why you feel comfortable about there being a controversy, and I've come to totally understand your perspective. Indeed, there appear to be strong viewpoints held by sociologists, strong viewpoints held by psychologists, and strong viewpoints held by physicians, all of which appear to be at odds with one another. These groups have different diagnostic strategies, differing opinion regarding treatment outcomes (because they're all treating different things based on different definitions, and looking for different outcomes based upon differing strategies as to what is a "good" outcome), and differing opinions regarding the mechanism of the problem. So even the question as to who is a highly regarded expert is up for grabs - in my opinion, to be an expert in a disease state, you'd need to have certain qualifications. But of course circular reasoning comes into play there; if alcoholism is not a disease, then my specified qualifications wouldn't matter. I've said before that there isn't a controversy - and I stand by that to the extent that within the field of qualified medical experts in addiction medicine, there is no controversy about alcoholism's status as a disease.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Our assertion about early onset of drinking</span></h2>
<p>Our generalization in the second paragraph that "Those with alcoholism tend to start drinking alcohol at an earlier age than those without alcoholism" may have only limited applicability. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) says that early onset of drinking is later associated with certain alcohol-related problems in "some Western countries" <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:fUBjpK-NpDAJ:pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh284/258-268.htm+%22early+onset+of+drinking%22+cross+cultural&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:fUBjpK-NpDAJ:pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh284/258-268.htm+%22early+onset+of+drinking%22+cross+cultural&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>The NIAAA also notes that "It is not clear whether starting to drink at an early age actually causes alcoholism or whether it simply indicates an existing vulnerability to alcohol use disorders (26). For example, both early drinking and alcoholism have been linked to personality characteristics such as strong tendencies to act impulsively and to seek out new experiences and sensations (27). Some evidence indicates that genetic factors may contribute to the relationship between early drinking and subsequent alcoholism (28,29)." (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Alcohol Alert, #59, April, 2003.)</p>
<p>Unless we research the applicability of the statement globally and also address the highly controversial issue of causality, I think we should delete the assertion.<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> 02:15, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedical_Man_33d8.html" title="User:Medical Man">Medical Man</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/d/User_talk%7EMedical_Man_ec7b.html" title="User talk:Medical Man">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Medical_Man_d574.html" title="Special:Contributions/Medical Man">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Medical Man makes a good point, and I agree with him since the statement is very easily misinterpreted. Here's the issue as I see it - there has been some early research demonstrating that those who have alcoholism started drinking at an earlier age, in general, than those who don't. Some people interpret that as meaning that if you take a given individual and don't allow that individual to start drinking until age 21, you have reduced that individual's chances of being alcoholic. There is no evidence that this is the explanation to the research finding. There are nearly half a dozen other possible explanations of the research finding, but at the moment I concur that unless we want to go into a detailed discussion of this, we should simply exclude the material. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 15:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll second-second this decision. We'd have to get into a discussion about causal and casual relationships for people to understand this. Also, the fact that there's no evidence to support the idea of alcohol at an early age resulting in alcoholism states pretty clearly that there's no evidence to suggest that including this statement would benefit the reader. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 17:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"This is generally accomplished in a majority of patients entering treatment through a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism therefore supports an abstinence-based approach, unlike the harm-reduction approach that is supported for opioid dependence."</p>
<p>The above doesn't make sense... how does the "therefore" get put in there? (I added "usually therefore", to bridge HR treatment and abs treatment (most folks in HR hope it's a bridge for the worst cases) but it's still somewhat nonsensical).. "entering treatment through a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms"... That says nothing about abstinence, unless the reader is supposed to *infer* that therapy requires abstinence (nope), self-help groups require abstinence (nope), or development of coping mechanisms require abstinence (no, but it sure *helps*).</p>
<p>Does Gabbard go into better detail on the theory that treatment = abstinence, or does he start from a theory that all non-abstinence treatment is not to be counted as treatment? I'm even wondering if he's working with since-discredited models that it is reasonable, healthy, or even *possible* to have a 100% ethanol free diet. (There's a sticky line here.. most fruit juice contains ethanol, but it is not intentional ethanol use, or abuse(?), to drink orange juice.

The quick talk-page summary is that it's just about impossible to eat a healthy diet without consuming *some* alcohol on a regular basis, but if the ppm is low enough, it's diluted to trace amounts. Some background on raising the issue: I work in a field where "five nines" is a normal term for the field (that's 99.999%), and "nine nines" (99.999999999%, or .000000001%) is considered an optimal target. Contrast this with some interesting(?) brochures I once saw at an AA meeting, which recommended against eating homemade Ice Cream(!), because vanilla extract often contained alcohol, and people were worried that it might lead to relapse. *sigh*. I could write a really big essay here on how people in early stages of recovery tend to think in absolute terms (I will consume lots of alcohol, or I will not consume *any* alcohol), but to summarize the screed/rant/essay, Antabuse can be taken with alcohol, as long as the amount of alcohol is fairly minor, because there is no such thing as a 100% free alcohol diet, if a person consumes anything capable of fermentation.

<p>Actually, in support of what Ronabop says, I understand that alcohol is also produced naturally as part of our digestive system, although in small amounts. A sugar is six carbons long. As part of the krebs cycle it gets cracked in half, and then another carbon gets pulled off. That's how yeast and higher creatures create metabolic energy. The result is alcohol. As higher level lifeforms we can then crack the alcohol in half generating just a tad bit more energy, so generally the alcohol doesn't hang around too terribly long. It's an over-abundance of alcohol in our system that triggers alcoholism, not its actual consumption. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 05:33, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the wording at the very start of the section from Substance Abuse Disorders to Substance Use Disorders, the currently preferred term. The reason the term was changed is that Substance Abuse Disorders refers to the entities such as Alcohol Abuse, Opioid Abuse, etc., but not necessarily to the dependencies/addictions such as Alcoholism. Substance Use Disorders includes all the conditions related to pathologic use of substances. This terminology change is taking place gradually, and you'll see many references out there to "substance abuse disorders."

<p>Ashmoo asked for citations on two statements. The first one was for the idea that many studies have been done demonstrating naltrexone to be of questionable value in supporting abstinance.

<p>I could probably provide about a dozen more. How many do you feel is sufficient?</p>
<p>Also, he requested citation for "For those who don't understand the mechanism involved, these results have been assumed to reflect the effectiveness of the two treatments in combination.". I'm not sure what he's asking for on this. Maybe a physician's opinion survey performed by someone like Reuters? This information was gathered in an unofficial manner, having discussed the issue with a couple dozen or so medical professionals regarding their and their professional associate's thoughts on the matter. Do you feel that this needs rephrasing? Does someone have better information on this?</p>
<p>I also noticed that he had a problem with "This logic is faulty because it assumes that the two treatments are merely complementary, like two people pushing a car, as opposed to sequential, like turning a doorknob and then pulling on it.", stating that it is "POV demagogic unsourced comment". You're big on making sure that nobody uses words in an original manner, aren't you? I'll accept that the statement may be "leading", the same way that a description of addition leads people to believe that things can be summed. I don't believe, however, that it in any way takes advantage of people's prejudices, fears, or suspicions. Please support this statement and/or provide a better way to describe this phenomena to the reader. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 23:50, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Looking for more information on Allele testing</span></h2>
<p>Twintone, do you have any more information on the testing that you mentioned in the "testing" section? "A1" sounds a bit vague. I'd like to put something in that describes what evidence exists that this allele is linked with alcoholism and addiction, and more specifically what KINDS of addiction. For instance, does this apply to tobacco addiction as well as narcotics and alcohol? Please cite references if you can.

<dd>Robert, I'll look up some more stuff when I can. I heard <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Drew_aade.html" title="Dr. Drew">Dr. Drew</a> talk about this on his Discovery Health show and then it took me awhile to find it online. What he said, however, was that tobacco addiction is different so it won't test for that. This test will only help doctor's forsee risks for patients that might get hooked on alcohol or opiates. The A1 does sound vague and not having a medical degree I'm not exactly sure what that means except it's the type of allele linked with that genetic coding. The test is fairly new, and I don't know if it's even officially out on the market so hopefully there will be more information available about it soon!--<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwintone_bdcf.html" title="User:Twintone">Twintone</a> 20:38, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In answering part of my own question (and just to get this information somewhere where it can be organized into a coherent statement, this piece of information refers to the TaqI polymporphism (A1 vs. A2) of the dopamine receptor gene D(2), abbreviated "DRD2 TaqI A1". The word allele is fancy genetics talk for "option". Those with the A1 allele of this polymorphism show a mild but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and alcohol versus those with the A2 allele of this polymorphism. ( <a href="http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/41/5/479" class="external free" title="http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/41/5/479" rel="nofollow">http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/41/5/479</a> ) It appears that this allele plays no part in nicotine addiction ( <a href="http://international.drugabuse.gov/downloads/SmokingCessation.pdf" class="external free" title="http://international.drugabuse.gov/downloads/SmokingCessation.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://international.drugabuse.gov/downloads/SmokingCessation.pdf</a> ) This is all very interesting, and I think it should be moved higher in the "identification and diagnosis" section once the details have been fleshed out. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 21:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2nd paragraph</span></h2>
<p>well, glancing over this talk page it looks like you've been beating the shit out of the lead in to this article, so sorry my 2 cents might feel more taxing. anyways, the 2nd paragraph:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>The biological mechanism of alcoholism is unknown. While alcohol use is required to trigger alcoholism, the majority of the population can drink alcoholic beverages with no danger of suffering from it. One of several other factors must exist for alcohol use to develop into alcoholism. These factors may include a person's social environment, emotional health and genetic predisposition. An alcoholic can develop several forms of addiction to alcohol simultaneously (psychological, metabolic, and neurochemical) and they all must be treated in order to effectively treat the condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><i>The biological mechanism of alcoholism is unknown.</i></li>

<dd>this really really needs further explaination. one of those 'wtf' moments there. especially when you just spent the first paragraph explaining how fucked up it can make you (to put it in kind vernacular prose).</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>While alcohol use is required to trigger alcoholism, the majority of the population can drink alcoholic beverages with no danger of suffering from it.</i></li>

<p><br />
Hi, Joe. Thanks for your comments. I'll try to address them as fully as possible, and make adjustments where needed.</p>
<p>Regarding the first two points, alcoholism isn't the consumption of alcohol, it's the inability to stop drinking alcohol in the face of obvious problems. The biological, mental, and social problems caused by the uncontrolled consumption of alcohol are pretty well understood, but the medical community can't agree on a reason why an alcoholic can't just put the bottle down and leave it there. The uncontrolled alcohol consumption is caused by alcoholism, not the other way around. Maybe this needs to be more strongly described in the opening paragraphs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here is where I get confused again: 'The biological mechanism of alcoholism is unknown'. I'm still not sure what this is poking at. You just said it was pretty well understood. I thought originally it was about genetic predisposition (talked about below), but there is a sentence later on about that.
<dl>
<dd>My statment was that the problems that <i>drinking alcohol</i> causes are understood. Drinking alcohol isn't alcoholism, it's the most notable <b>symptom</b> of alcoholism. Alcoholism is an unreasonably strong desire to drink. In the archetypical alcoholic, that desire to drink precludes employment and relationships with others. Even for those who do manage to push alcohol away, the desire to drink continues to wear on them, requiring ongoing efforts at self-control. Even though they no longer drink they still suffer from alcoholism. Although various theories exist for this compulsion, no single theory has a strong enough backing or experimental evidence necessary to be considered authoritative. Does that explain it?
<dl>
<dd><i>One of several other factors must exist for alcohol use to develop into alcoholism.</i> So should we say then that alcohol is both a symptom and a catalyst? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup><small>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_sandbox_peerreview_b694.html" title="User:JoeSmack/sandbox/peerreview">p-review!</a>)</small> 19:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Not a catalyst - catalysts don't get used up in the reaction. More of a trigger. The consumption of alcohol is the symptom, and the urge to consume alcohol is the actual condition. I think that you have the idea now.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On further thought, I think that part of the problem with describing alcoholism is that the word is used to describe two completely separate conditions. The first is the alcohol-triggered endorphine addiction, and the second is the psychological perception that drinking alcohol is more important than earning a living, raising your kids, getting an education, or any of the dozens of other things that a responsible individual does with their lives. These two are both referred to as alcoholism, and a lot of people keep insisting that it has to be one or the other. Food for thought, but something that'll get slapped with an "original research" if we actually try to mention it in the article. Maybe it's something that belongs at the top of the discussion page. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 19:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>The genetic predisposition is a stickier matter. There exists a single known test for dopamine receptor genetic predisposition, that only has a small influence on predisposition. While there's a lot of evidence that there's a strong correspondance between either endorphin production or reception and alcoholism, nobody has yet developed a test for that, so it remains unproven. Even if there were, there are numerous people who suffer from an intellectual misperception of alcohol's value in their lives, and overdrink because they feel it's providing them with benefit that it's really not. College kids are common sufferes of this, and it is also referred to as alcoholism. The first kind of alcoholic (physically addicted) continues to drink when they leave the encouraging environment, whereas the second kind (psychologically addicted) doesn't. This creates an immense bias against the first type because the second type just assumes that they're weak-willed pantywastes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Backing off from the brain-science, how about epidemiology? The college student stuff sounds about right (i just graduated college), but in terms of 'genetic predisposition' - a child of an alcoholic parent is many times more likely to become an alcoholic themself, right? This may/may not be hard coded into DNA (maybe this is what you meant by 'biological mechanism is unknown'), but incidence nevertheless skyrockets for kids with besotting parents.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The disease theory was moved to its own topic for two reasons. The primary reason was because it was taking over the article. Roughly two thirds of the article at one time was dedicated to point and counterpoint on the disease issue. The second reason is because it's an extremely minor point of nomenclature that's really only important to politicans and the medical facilities administrators that want the politicians to fund them. Since nobody can agree on the physical basis for alcoholism, neither side has any hard evidence to present, making the entire argument POV by nature. It breaks down into a "he said, she said, Dr. X said" argument where each side has no shortage of experts and none of it is really meaningful to those who actually want to understand the problem.</p>
<p>I guess what the issue of the Disease Theory comes down to is that its existence in this article is too tempting to POV hacks. While it seems sensible that there's "no reason why it couldn't get a paragraph or two", the history of this article demonstrates that people just won't leave off at a paragraph or two, or five or ten. Its inclusion tends to denigrate the quality of the article to the point of unreadability.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Man, I know how you feel. I started wikipedia with and still regularly look after <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. A similar POV fork exists in <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a>. Stuff like that can get messy, and it's hard to deal with effectively.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, thanks for chiming in. I feel that your questions identify areas that probably require more thorough explanations in a lot of places. Part of the problem with this article is that very little professional work has been done to cross-examine the various opinions of how alcoholism works. Any time I put two words next to each other in a way that hasn't already been done in a proper double blind placebo controlled peer reviewed study, somebody slaps "pov", "original research", or "cite needed" on it, so properly describing even the patently obvious aspects of alcoholism can be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>It is signifitant to contemplate that an alcoholic can only truly classify themselves as such. whether abstinent or practicing, any addmission, either external or internal (if honest) is a significant proof that one is alcoiholic (or addictive)</p>

<p>The precise definition of addiction is debated, but in general it refers to any condition which results in the continuation of behaviors demonstrated as harmful to that person.

<p>Does this mean I can't be addicted to coffee? I don't think that it has ever been demonstrated as harmful to me (or maybe thats just the addiction talking).

<dd>You can be as addicted to coffee as you want to, I won't stop you *grin*. Caffiene increases incidence of heart and colon problems, depletes B vitimins, and causes sleeping problems. Anything can be done in excess, even water, and excess is pretty much defined by the point at which it causes problems. I've even gone so far as to say that you can be addicted to cheese and potatoe chips because they can cause cholesterol problems, and yet people continue to consume them to great excess.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The real problem here is that people assume an addiction has to be to something illegal, or that something has to be immediately life threatening to be harmful. But, as stated at the very beginning, the precise definition is heavily debated. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 21:25, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
