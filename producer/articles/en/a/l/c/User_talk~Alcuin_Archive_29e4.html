	    <p>Hello Alcuin- Thanks for dropping by the Corrupt Bastard Caucus post. I am newbie to wikipedia by experience but not by time necessesarily. I do not know the faetures and perhaps do not have the time to do it all right now but guidance is helpful.</p>
<p>I am an independant and I am of the belief that the Democrats are no better than the republicans. They are all corrupt and the mission is to screw the little guy out of anything simple pleasure they can. They have a bureaucracy in place that is not unlike an onion skin, one layer after another, just to get any kind of straight answer.</p>
<p>I may need to change my posting name. I may have people that want to kill me at this point. You can find more that I have posted elsewhere by putting 'salmonshark' into a search engine. Ru\ight now I am posting at the trail blog at Anchorage Daily News. I have heated up some rails there. I would rather be strumming and learning new songs!!!!</p>

<li>Oh, ok. You should probably have that page deleted by placing a <i>{{db-author}}</i> tag in that article.

<li>Thanks, I'm new. Where's the page that tells you how to do stuff like that?</li>
<li>Also, what's the convention for communicating with other members?
<ul>
<li>More info can be found on the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> page. Listing any speedy deletion tags at the top of a page will get an administrator to take notice and see if the page should be deleted per reason given and SD criteria. For communicating with other members, there are no set rules, but signing all comments with 4 tildes is recommended (which leaves your sig. and the current date/time), and I personally post replies on the other user's talk page (so they notice I'm talking to them), and I try to give my comments a context by posting what the other user left on my page. See you 'round&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 07:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/c/User_talk%7EAlcuin_Archive_29e4.html" title="Edit section: Johnny Cash albums">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Johnny Cash albums</span></h2>
<p>Hey Alcuin, first of all I have to say I'm very impressed with your work on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_discography_fcd4.html" title="Johnny Cash discography">Johnny Cash discography</a> page; you seem very knowledgeable indeed in this area. I am in the (quite tiring) process of creating pages for these albums because I found it a bit baffling that only a handful of Cash's records have been described in separate articles, and some of his best-known albums lacked a page. I base the articles and research on them on what I find on the <a href="http://www.luma-electronic.cz/" class="external text" title="http://www.luma-electronic.cz/" rel="nofollow">Luma Electronic</a> website, which I find very comprehensive and useful (one of the only things it lacks is track lengths, which I sometimes have to hunt down in the murkiest depths of the Internet). Aside from that, I use <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">All Music Guide</a>, but don't fully trust it when it comes to release dates and the like (Luma often gives precise release dates, which I assume are correct). I am trying to cover every original album Cash has recorded, as well as a handful of compilations. Again, the specifics depend on whether the compilation in question is notable in some way; for example, if a known song (or even just a new one) debuted in a compilation, I include that compilation's article. Similarly, if a single was released and hit the charts (like "Big River" from <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits%2C_Vol._2_%28Johnny_Cash_compilation%29_e06e.html" title="Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 (Johnny Cash compilation)">Greatest Hits, Vol. 2</a></i>), I include that as well. <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Records_715d.html" title="Sun Records">Sun Records</a> released numerous Cash compilations, but these were primarily made up solely of old Cash material and didn't chart, so I don't include most of them. There was also one album, <i>Mean as Hell</i>, which I wanted to write an article on in the beginning but decided against it in the end, as it was, if I'm not mistaken, practically a song-for-song replica of <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sings_the_Ballads_of_the_True_West_bf03.html" title="Sings the Ballads of the True West">Sings the Ballads of the True West</a></i> (although <i>Mean as Hell</i>'s cover is quite interesting), and no singles were released. Another example: <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lure_of_the_Grand_Canyon_2c93.html" title="The Lure of the Grand Canyon">The Lure of the Grand Canyon</a></i> didn't have any singles, heck it didn't have any Cash songs, but it was an early <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_album.html" title="Concept album">concept album</a>, so I saw it fit to create a separate page. In the last article I created (<i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 2</i>), the next album is <i><a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Thing_Called_Love_feb0.html" title="A Thing Called Love">A Thing Called Love</a></i>, because, as Luma's <a href="http://www.luma-electronic.cz/lp/c/Cash/cash2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.luma-electronic.cz/lp/c/Cash/cash2.htm" rel="nofollow">Cash discography</a> page suggests, a couple of singles (which charted) were released, the labum itself was also successful, and the album before it, <i>Understand Your Man</i>, was a collection of older songs released on a label called Harmony, with no singles released. So, in summary, I think it's a bit pointless to create an article for every single Cash record in existence (that would probably cover at least 200 albums and would be a titanic amount of work), but a lot of them do seem to deserve articles. I look forward to collaborating with you on the Cash album pages and the discography page. I can update you later on which albums I plan to create articles for, and you can see if that's alright with you. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 10:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the pages I've created so far have not gone past simple stub status&#160;;) but thank you for the kind words. After a while, it does become kind of tiring to find track lengths, infobox details and so on. But, that's Wikipedia, one sets a goal for himself/herself and attempts to get somewhere from there; it is my first undertaking of this scale though, amittedly. I'm glad you'll be helping out on the album pages, but there's no need to rush, so take all the time you need; I'll try to work on a few new pages in the meantime. Oh, and, I spent the earliest part of my life abroad, so I had to pick up something, though I'm in no way a flawless native speaker. Guess it's enough for Wikipedia, though&#160;;) Thanks again for your comments! <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 20:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great job! Now that's what I call impressive. Only several album pages remain now, and I'll try to work on some of them today/tomorrow. One album I've never heard of whose page you've created is <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Believe_in_Him_c493.html" title="Believe in Him">Believe in Him</a></i>, but it's hard to keep track of all of his records, so it's no wonder. However, I did not find the album on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_discography_fcd4.html" title="Johnny Cash discography">Johnny Cash discography</a> page; I'm not exactly sure what category it would fit into, though, since it was released on <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_Records_5fdc.html" title="Word Records">Word Records</a>. I'll look around for the track lengths you mentioned and several more details. And yes, it is very true that the charting sections should be added to the articles; I was originally intending to do that after all the articles will have been created. The personnel sections are a bit troublesome, as different pages list different personnel (AMG often lists only Cash and one other person), but we should add them as well. About the prose: on the contrary, I don't see anything wrong with yours, and working together on it will definitely be advantageous to everyone. One question: do you think an article should be written on the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Records_6082.html" title="Mercury Records">Mercury Records</a> <i>Classic Cash</i> release? I don't think any songs off that album charted and it's full of older songs, but it is distinctive because of the controversial decision to use synthesizers and such to "update" Cash's sound. And the compilations - I think we should consider writing articles on the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_Family_Records_89c6.html" title="Bear Family Records">Bear Family Records</a> series, as it encompasses a huge part of Cash's career. Good luck! <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 09:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I'll create the <i><a href="../../../m/e/a/Mean_as_Hell_195d.html" title="Mean as Hell">Mean as Hell</a></i> article soon; that's the problem if one omits an article, the data in several infoboxes must be changed. But we can handle it. I was working on a page for <i>The Johnny Cash Family Christmas</i> and searching desperately for track lengths today; found them on a site called StarPulse, but I didn't manage to get them as my computer almost got infected with damn malware (perhaps it actually did get infected). There should really be a site listing the track lengths, but I guess that's asking too much. In response to the <i>Believe in Him</i> issue, I think it might be necessary to create a section simply labeled "Other releases" or something of the sort; maybe we'll manage to get more than one album in there, and even if we won't, it'll not look bad.

<dd>Oh yeah, if Wikipedia wasn't fun (and kind of addictive), I don't think it would be half as popular as it is&#160;;). In any case, good move with <i><a href="../../../m/e/a/Mean_as_Hell_195d.html" title="Mean as Hell">Mean as Hell</a></i>, I agree. I created <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Johnny_Cash_Family_Christmas_b35a.html" title="The Johnny Cash Family Christmas">The Johnny Cash Family Christmas</a></i> without track lengths for the time being; in fact, for now, I'll not be adding track lengths (temporarily) if they'll not be immediately available. If there will be any missing, I will search for them using a safe system; the one I'm using cannot be called that, unfortunately. Oh, I also added <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Superstar_6e5b.html" title="International Superstar">International Superstar</a></i> to the JC discography page; it contains a handful of newly-recorded songs, I think, including a single which charted. I'm done for the day though, since it's 2 AM where I am&#160;;) Take care. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 22:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great job! Now we're basically almost done, thanks to you. I'll be away for most of the day, feel free to create articles for some of the remaining albums; alternatively, I can do them when I get back. And good job on creating the Harmony Records section in the Discography page. I'm still wondering where we should put <i>Believe in Him</i> though...ah well. By the way, have you listened to the Highwaymen albums? What did you think of them? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 07:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes we did! The Highwaymen's albums are quite interesting; nevertheless, the first one is undoubtedly the best, at least in my opinion. As far as I know, the alignment of the tracklists and infoboxes is the result of an internal flaw in the Wiki system; it would look better if aligned, but I guess we can't do anything about that. Regardless, I'm happy you expanded the <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love%2C_God_and_Murder_3b9e.html" title="Love, God and Murder">Love, God and Murder</a></i> page. <i>The Survivors Live</i> and <i>Heroes</i> inevitably must have articles, but, as they're one-time-only collaborations, I'm not sure what "chronology" to enter, if any. Also, in the <i>Classic Cash</i> article, you wrote something which I assume would clash with Wikipedia's "NPOV" policy; I personally don't have a problem with it, but some crazed NPOV purists might pounce upon you for it&#160;;). I'm gonna do some more minor work before I call it a night. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 20:18, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, it's quite alright with me, but perhaps in order to satisfy the NPOV freaks we should just mention that it was a controversial and generally not very well-received move. I'm doing some minor changes and additions right now; eg. I found out <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Johnny_Cash_Children%27s_Album_1ba8.html" title="The Johnny Cash Children's Album">The Johnny Cash Children's Album</a></i> was recently re-released, and added the track lengths that I found on AMG. I'll also be adding star ratings and such and adding general info on the album in question (notable songs, etc.). <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 21:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WHEW! I made some minor changes to several articles, but there will be more to come. After we've settled on the content of all the pages, we can add Personnel and Charts sections. Also, I noticed the infoboxes on the American Recordings album pages are a bit messed up (in my opinion, the additional "American series" infobox shouldn't even be there; we might as well create a "Columbia infobox", but that would be sort of silly). We'll be done with everything before we know it. One more thing: I noticed a 1978 Columbia compilation over at Luma called <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 3</i>. Do you think we should create a page for the album? For the record, Luma says it charted (#49), as did two singles (which fared alright). I'm all for creating it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 22:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm...you're right, on the one hand it is useful information and the small font is reliable, but on the other, few articles incorporate something like this. Perhaps the only alternative would be to create separate sections for this info, but that's up to you. It CAN stay the way it is if you want it that way, I'd have no complaints&#160;;) <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 13:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've done some expansion on all the articles I could, so I guess I'm pretty much done with the prose. I also tried to find track and album lengths, and succeeded for the most part; several albums, however, do not have track lengths, though I've searched all over. I plan to do some cleanup on some of the box set albums created by others (by the way, I'm impressed by what you did with the songs from the American series; the descriptions, I mean). We also need references for each album (invariably Luma, in my opinion, if not the album page, then the main Cash listing), a See also section for the same (<a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_discography_fcd4.html" title="Johnny Cash discography">Johnny Cash discography</a> should be there, I guess), singles boxes and personnel listings. Finally, there are about four to five more albums which require a page, I'll try to take care of that (this includes <i>Heroes</i>, <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 3</i>, <i>Survivors Live</i>, etc.). I decided to write an article on <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encore_%28Johnny_Cash_compilation%29_771e.html" title="Encore (Johnny Cash compilation)">Encore</a></i>, as "Song of the Patriot", a relatively well-known single, first appeared on it. That reminds me - we should add references to the Cash albums on pages with similar names (ex. <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits%2C_Vol._2_382f.html" title="Greatest Hits, Vol. 2">Greatest Hits, Vol. 2</a></i> gets you to an Elton John compilation), or create disambig pages. I think after doing all of the above (which IS a lot now that I think of it), we'll finally be able to say that we're done. Out of curiosity, do you plan to do something similar with another artist's discography? For example, I know Cash's music much better than I know <a href="../../../w/a/y/Waylon_Jennings_b525.html" title="Waylon Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a>', for example, but I guess I would be willing to do this again someday. <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Kristofferson_f0a5.html" title="Kris Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Nelson_7599.html" title="Willie Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> also have pages for only a handful of their albums. However, after Cash's discography, I AM taking a short break&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 23:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, well, the track lengths, as I've noted in most of my edits, are approximate; amateur sites tend to post unverified information, and that's where I got most of this info. I'm not hugely into country either, I'd call myself a Cash fan much sooner than I'd call myself a country fan&#160;;) But the pages DO need attention. In any case, I'm sticking with Luma and AMG on most future edits and new pages. Could you specify what the possible Sun pages you mentioned would contain and what it would look like? And finally, as you yourself said, this is supposed to be more about fun than work, and I didn't feel very overworked doing what I was doing. By the way, I'm not really sure if we should add <i><a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteen_Biggest_Hits_4053.html" title="Sixteen Biggest Hits">Sixteen Biggest Hits</a></i> to the chronology; it's just another of the dozens of generic Cash compilations, and I don't think even the page itself is necessary. We're approaching the finish line, let's get out the champagne&#160;;) <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 19:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I've added Charts sections to the appropriate articles (a hellish task), and a See also section where I put the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_discography_fcd4.html" title="Johnny Cash discography">Johnny Cash discography</a> page, it's a useful reference now. What's left now is an External links section to each article containing either the article's page on Luma or the general Cash discography page, as well as Personnel section, and I think we'll be completely done! <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 22:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since I have really enjoyed working with you on the articles and since I find your edits to be particularly useful, I'm awarding you a well-deserved barnstar.

<dd>I'm not going to be tireless much longer&#160;:) I'm going to go ahead and insert the personnel from AMG into the <i>American V</i> article, and that'll be all as far as personnel issues are concerned (in the articles without personnel, I couldn't find any info). On <i>Personal File</i>, I must have messed up somewhere, because I thought what I put was from AMG...but I'm glad you corrected it, because I found it a bit confusing myself. The template is an *excellent* idea, although it will be huge. Still, I'm all for it. <i>Life</i>...well, since it's a separately released compilation, it might be worth it to create a new article. Not so sure about <i>My Mother's Hymn Book</i>, as it's basically just a part of <i>Unearthed</i>, though it was released separately. However, if you think articles should be created for both, I'm OK with that. Also, I was wondering whether to create an article for <i>Original Sun Sound</i> (if I'm not mistaken)...doesn't that contain several previously unreleased tracks? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 18:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, the series is one of the milestones in Cash's career, so perhaps they may be worth special treatment after all. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 18:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I plan to create articles on two tribute albums released more or less at the same time, called <i>Kindred Spirits</i> and <i>Dressed in Black</i>. I haven't heard either, but some well-known (well, I've heard of most of them) artists contributed Cash covers. Do you think this is a good idea? I guess the album can't be added to the JC discography though, since it's not exactly him performing... <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 18:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The discography you posted looks very good; a bit messy, but there's a lot of useful info which can be incorporated into the articles.

<dd>Actually, by "discography" I meant the link you posted, not the actual Wikipedia page&#160;;). Around five external links is fine, as far as I'm concerned, especially given the differences in the information available on each of the websites. I think the Wiki page is quite fine, and the images make it much better, actually. I noticed the two links; go ahead and create the pages. Not really sure where we could fit in the tribute albums though, new section perhaps? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 11:22, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, and I definitely agree. Haven't heard of many others though, and these feature a lot of well-known artists. But the others are definitely worthy of an article. Btw., I'd remove the <i>Zooropa</i> cover image from the discography page, since the album contains only one collaboration with Cash, while in <i>Highwayman</i>, for example, basically all the tracks feature Cash. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 17:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks like good work recently on the Johnny Cash / June Carter Cash pages. I'd particularly wondered about the geneological question. I'd turned up enough to make it clear where the idea that June was related to Jimmy Carter came from, but not enough to confirm whether their ancestors were one Thomas Carter Jr. or two.

<p>So, it seems like the Cash page "accomplishments" section is in constant low-level turmoil over trying to explain the claim about him being in the "Songwriters' Hall of Fame" when he's really in the "Nashville Songwriters' Hall of Fame." (Perhaps the latter was once also known by the former name?)</p>
<p>It's possible that just deleting the reference to the erroneous claim on the Rockabilly Hall of Fame web page is the best approach. But I'm sure I've seen the claim somewhere else (maybe his second memoir?).</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not sure of the right approach, obviously, or I'd just do it myself. But, yes, there <b>are</b> "2 songwriters halls of fame," as you say ... but I thought that was the very point the article was trying, perhaps failing, to make. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStellmach_2360.html" title="User:Stellmach">Stellmach</a> 14:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I've been doing some investigating on AMG; I was searching for the first performances of the songs on <i>American V</i>. Here's what I came up with...note that in some cases, I'm uncertain as to what information should actually be used in the article. Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help Me - first recorded by Kris Kristofferson for <i>Jesus Was a Capricorn</i> in 1972; recorded by Gatlin for <i>Night Time Magic</i> in 1978</li>
<li>God's Gonna Cut You Down - although a traditional tune, it was apparently only recorded by Odetta for <i>Sings Ballads and Blues</i> in 1956</li>
<li>If You Could Read My Mind - originally recorded by Lightfoot for <i>Sit Down Young Stranger</i> in 1970 (I think the song itself should be de-linked)</li>
<li>The Evening Train (AMG found results for "On the Evening Train" and "Evening Train" - Williams never recorded it; recorded by Molly O'Day, Bob Paisley and Crooked Jades, but can be found primarily on compilations, so it's hard to tell when the song was actually recorded by the artists</li>
<li>Love's Been Good to Me - recorded by Frank Sinatra for <i>Sinatra!</i> in 1953 (unsure of this). Recorded by Glenn Yarbrough for <i>One More Round</i> in 1964</li>
<li>A Legend in My Time - recorded by Roy Orbison for <i>Sings Lonely and Blue</i> in 1960; recorded by Gibson for <i>Sweet Dreams</i> that same year (perhaps earlier in the year)</li>
<li>Rose of My Heart - originally recorded by The Whitstein Brothers for <i>Rose of My Heart</i> in 1984. Recorded by Moffatt for <i>Troubadour</i> in 1989</li>
<li>Four Strong Winds - recorded by Journeymen for <i>New Directions in Folk Music</i> in 1963</li>
<li>I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now - originally recorded by Ernest Tubb for <i>Jimmie Rodgers Songs</i> in 1951. Recorded by Cash for <i>The Sound of Johnny Cash</i> in 1962</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think of these? Which should be incorporated into the article? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 21:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So I noticed you started working on the Kristofferson discography as well. Would it be alright with you if I joined you? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 21:00, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, to make you feel better, I'll freely admit that I haven't heard a single album by Kris&#160;;). Matter of fact, I've only heard a handful of songs, but he deserves album pages. I'll start adding and creating soon. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 04:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I followed your lead and started creating articles going backwards chronologically. I think several might be missing from the list on the Kristofferson page (like <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Broken_Freedom_Song%7E_Live_from_San_Francisco_58f3.html" title="Broken Freedom Song: Live from San Francisco">Broken Freedom Song: Live from San Francisco</a></i>, which I added). In any case, I created <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Old_Road_f555.html" title="This Old Road">This Old Road</a></i> and the aforementioned <i>BFS</i>; thankfully, there will be less work on KK's discography than on Cash's&#160;;) <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 20:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now it's looking gigantic *rolls eyes*. I'm also having minor problems with the Family section, having done the Discography and Songs sections. First of all, I'm not sure how many articles there are pertaining to individuals related to Cash; second, I don't know whether to include people from the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carter_Family_698c.html" title="Carter Family">Carter Family</a>, such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Carter_a873.html" title="Anita Carter">Anita</a>, <a href="../../../a/2E/p/A.P._Carter_15b7.html" title="A.P. Carter">A.P.</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maybelle_Carter_2860.html" title="Maybelle Carter">Mother Maybelle</a>. Also, what I did with the songs, as is pretty obvious, is I practically copied the alphabetical listing of songs with Wiki links from the appropriate category. Finally, should there be any non-linked elements in the template, do you think? Any other ideas for what can be included? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 19:16, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, I don't know if entries like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Perkins_cf54.html" title="Carl Perkins">Carl Perkins</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Lee_Lewis_0199.html" title="Jerry Lee Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> (especially the latter; he was "only" a labelmate and infrequently collaborated with Cash) should stay.

<p>Hi Alcuin, Was reviewing prods and noticed you slapped one on this Pink Floyd bootleg album. I would normally agree, but I believe the album contains miscellany that is unavailable elsewhere which, given the stature of the band, would probably make this notable enough. I have left your original prod for now. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 11:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply; I certainly understand your reasoning. On another note, I've stumbled onto a slew of articles all penned by the same editor about bands from the 1960s. They almost all of them seem to fail WP:Music, but I would certainly appreciate a second opinion. I prodded a few before I realised that it seems to be a large-scale project, which has given me pause.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking: that's my view as well. Generally, a merge and redirect is best practice, although note that some of the musicians he is talking about are just journeyman players who brushed up with much more notable figures. I left the author a note on his page asking him to provide clear indications of notability per the Music guideline, so probably the best thing is to wait. But if nothing changes, I can do a set of redirects for the more dubious entries and leave those that more noteworthy. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 12:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My idea of polling people on what they want with the bow-tie articles hasn't exactly worked perfectly.

<p>So, we're done with Kristofferson (now who's doing all the hard work?&#160;;). And you're tirelessly creating articles for the Jennings albums already. I'll help out if I can, though this one seems like a hell of a huge task, almost as bad as Cash. Btw. I'm not sure I'm right, but <a href="../../../a/l/b/WP%7EALBUM_17fd.html" title="WP:ALBUM">WP:ALBUM</a>'s sample tracklist has the names of the composers written with a comma instead of a slash; not that it's that big a difference. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 21:58, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I'll help you out soon. Do you mind if I use commas instead of slashes in the articles I create? And hey, I'm not sure if I've even heard one full album from Jennings; as a matter of fact, I primarily checked samples on <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. I'll get started soon, in any case. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 19:30, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I split Waylon's discography into two subsections: "Studio albums" and "Compilations". I hope I managed to categorize them correctly, you might want to re-check them to make sure. I'll start creating articles in reverse chronological order in a short time. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a>
<dl>
<dd>Darn, as you probably noticed, I couldn't work on the album in the last couple of days. I'm returning from abroad in a few days, I'll go heavily into editing once that's done. By the way, an anonymous user added recording dates for <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_V_1f7f.html" title="American V">American V</a></i>. Now, I'm not sure if this information is confirmed. First of all, one of the sites you posted earlier, in a section with unreleased material, lists "On the Evening Train" as a track from around 2000, which sounds about right, since Cash's voice is considerably stronger in that song. I'm guessing several other tracks were recorded before 2003 as well (say, "I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now" and "A Legend in My Time" sound a bit pre-<i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_IV_90e8.html" title="American IV">American IV</a></i>, even). The other tracks, I'd say, might have really been recorded in 2003. But this is pure speculation, it's too bad Rubin &amp; co. probably won't release the recording dates (or is that info already available somewhere? I doubt it). In any case, I'm wondering if we should revert that edit. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 14:48, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, you might have noticed I created five articles for some of the albums which did not have their own page yet. I've also stored several infoboxes for soon-to-be-created articles, and these are in my <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_Sandbox_ed33.html" title="User:Cromag/Sandbox">Sandbox</a>. But the reason I'm writing is the last edit to the <a href="../../../w/a/y/Waylon_Jennings_b525.html" title="Waylon Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a> page by a user with no userpage, and it is this edit I find a bit troubling. It's like a semi-vandalism, except I'm sure he had good intentions, considering he created a pretty good article on <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heartaches_By_The_Number_%28And_Other_Country_Favorites%29%28album%29_c3aa.html" title="Heartaches By The Number (And Other Country Favorites)(album)">Heartaches By The Number (And Other Country Favorites)(album)</a> (I'll work on that one soon, needs fixing). However, he moved some compilations to the Studio albums section (among other things), I think, and confusion ensues for me. What do you think should be done about this? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 20:22, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll be glad to add some stuff to the articles you created; somehow, I consider it easier to write the prose than to go through all the hassle of infoboxes and track listings, which is why I didn't get it all done sooner. I've already added some information on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ramblin%27_Man_56dd.html" title="The Ramblin' Man">The Ramblin' Man</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreaming_My_Dreams_6229.html" title="Dreaming My Dreams">Dreaming My Dreams</a></i> and plan to do the same for the others. Frankly, I hate infoboxes and have pretty much given up on manually calculating the length of each album, but it goes without saying that they're an integral part of the standard album article/stub. Yeah, I'm getting annoyed with the Cash template guy too; this isn't exactly vandalism, but persistently reverting to his own version is ultimately pointless because we'll have the upper hand anyway. The next time he does it without giving a legitimate reason, I'm giving him a warning. Then I'll probably raise the issue officially. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 21:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, I'm going to start working on the Waylon articles soon (it's been a busy time for me and, unfortunately, it's not over yet). But I just wanted to mention that I found an interview with Cash which confirms that at least "On the Evening Train" was recorded in 2000, way before the dates listed on the <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_V_1f7f.html" title="American V">American V</a></i> page. It can be found here: <a href="http://maninblack.net/int_rs700.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://maninblack.net/int_rs700.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Near the bottom, Cash mentions Williams having written the song for "a singer named Molly O'Day in 1949". It's nothing major, but again, I'm not sure if the recording dates as they are in the <i>American V</i> article should stay there if they might be inaccurate. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 21:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, I'm pretty much done with the prose the albums whose pages you've created. I'll be writing articles for subsequent albums shortly. I don't think I'll be including separate sections with charts info; that can be mostly found within the articles. What's important right now is that the articles are actually created; not that much to go now. The prose is probably my favorite part of it all, though. As a digression, are you planning work on any other similar discographies in the near future? I'm not sure I'll be up to the job, especially after a tiring discography like Waylon's, but I might take a shot at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Allan_Coe_e543.html" title="David Allan Coe">David Allan Coe</a> someday. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Nelson_7599.html" title="Willie Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> probably deserves articles for each album as well, but I'd leave that for later, if anything. By the way, do you think the Highwaymen's albums should be included in the JC template? Under "Studio albums"? For the sake of completion, I say yes, even though it would be weird to see <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Road_Goes_on_Forever_512b.html" title="The Road Goes on Forever">The Road Goes on Forever</a></i> right after <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Recordings_%28album%29_3764.html" title="American Recordings (album)">American Recordings</a></i> in the template. But maybe that's just my irrational thinking. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 02:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, I recently stumbled upon what looks like a Christmas studio album by Cash, recorded around 1990-91, I think. I don't have links handy, but I think it's called <i>Country Christmas</i> and you should be able to find it on Amazon, at least. I heard some samples long ago and indeed, his voice on the record sounds more or less like it should have sounded around that time. So I guess we can take a shot at creating an article for it and adding it to the template/discography (and then we should remove the sentence in which it is claimed that <i><a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_Christmas_c4de.html" title="Classic Christmas">Classic Christmas</a></i> is the last of Cash's Christmas records from the appropriate article). <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 13:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, well, I'd say the combination of that information (it's also on the German site you posted a while back) and the fact that Cash's voice sounds stronger than...well, than on some tracks on <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_III_4686.html" title="American III">American III</a></i>, in fact, suggests that it is indeed the 2000 version. I too don't have the album handy (heh heh; plan to buy it though), but I doubt that information would be contained in the liner notes and such anyway. But alright, we can let it stay the way it is. On Waylon, I'm a completist, so I'll go ahead and try to do some more&#160;:). <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 17:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm actually for either merging or keeping them separate, and i'll explain.</p>
<p>I've upgraded the Global Highway article to become large enough to stand on its own (to me, at least). <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan_Railway_1b86.html" title="Cosmopolitan Railway">Cosmopolitan Railway</a> i feel, is the same way.</p>
<p>However, (and there always is a however&#160;:) ), both are nearly identical, in listing proposed connections for all the continents and nations.

I'd merge if you think it would not be too large, but i think both should make at least "honourable mentions" in each others' articles. <span style="border: 2px solid #330000; text-align:center; background: #C0C0C0; text-color: #DDDDDD; link: #A0522D; vlink: #000000"><b><a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaccoonFox_8c42.html" title="User:RaccoonFox">RaccoonFox</a></b> • <a href="../../../r/a/c/User_talk%7ERaccoonFox_3002.html" title="User talk:RaccoonFox"><b>Talk</b></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RaccoonFox_7a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/RaccoonFox"><b>Stalk</b></a></span> <b>00:25, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>I see you've recently made some minor revisions to the article I created on the Jethro Tull greatest hits album <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Masters_13de.html" title="Original Masters">Original Masters</a>. I appreciate the replacement of hyphens with em dashes in the track listing, but why shorten the type of album to "Greatest hits" rather than "Greatest hits album"? When you read the bit as "Greatest hits by Jethro Tull" it just doesn't click as well as "Greatest hits album by Jethro Tull". I also notice you only made the replacement on the Album WikiProject and not the body text. Why is this? Sorry to split hairs like so many others have done on this site, but thanks for your consideration <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilter1987_e2bd.html" title="User:Filter1987">Filter1987</a> 19:27, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Alcuin. The Johnny Cash template is currently under criticism from <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> and I consider many of the points he raised to be quite logical and, in essence, correct. Since we collaborated on the template, can you possibly add to the discussion and help transform the template (or perhaps break it up into smaller ones) so that it'll not be so huge? Thanks. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromag_12b4.html" title="User:Cromag">Cromag</a> 20:32, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
