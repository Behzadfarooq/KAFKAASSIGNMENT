<p>The text claims that "sed an early type of algebra to solve linear equations, quadratic equations, and indeterminate linear equations in the second millenium BC."</p>
<p>However I see no evidence that the Babylonians had a knowlege of operations and axioms that would be necessary to call the calculations they did an algebra rather than arithmetical calculations for particular problems with inferred formula. Nor do I know of any evidence that they could take two formula and equate them using an agreed set of operations to solve new problems; i.e. they did not have algebraic equations, they knew some formula, could solve for unknowns, but did not have a general understanding of operations or a general system for solving equations. Correct me if I am wrong.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 16:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following text was moved from the article, since it seems out of place (also could stand a rewrite):</p>
<p>"The process of "balancing and restoration" is important in algebra. It is the process of equaling both sides of any given equation. Basically, "whatever you do to one side of the equation, you do to the other". Also in Algebra: the distributive law which is used to properly factor out and solve equations."</p>

<p>You're certainly right that it "could stand a rewrite"! "To factor out and solve equations"?? Please! One factors <i>polynomials</i> or <i>numbers</i> or perhaps various other things; one does not factor <i>equations</i>. To "factor out A" is to pull out A when A is a factor shared in common by all terms; whoever wrote that failed to understand that "to factor out" does not mean the same thing as "to factor". I'm commenting on this here just so that anyone tempted to put this material back into the article will not make the same mistakes. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:00, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems to me an article about factoring polynomials could be started, and this section (which is awful) eliminated. What do people think?</p>
<p>I put a mention of <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_over_a_field.html" title="Algebra over a field">algebra over a field</a> in front in addition to the one at the end, to help the confused person wanting a definition of the word "algebra" not attached to a qualifier such as "Boolean" which they might possibly find in some phrase such as "Let A be an algebra over Q".</p>

<dd>that section is absolute nonsense . First of all Al-Khwarizmi was a persian mathematician , who was a zorastrian . Origins of Algebra do not stem from Islam as Zereshk claims.</dd>
<dd>Then the list of individuals is irrelevant and unsubstantiated propaganda to create some sort of appearance that Islam is the source of Algebra that is why it was removed.--65.144.45.232 04:32, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The removed content was added by Zereshk on Apr 14, 2005, hardly "long-standing". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 05:26, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trigonometry.html" title="Trigonometry">trigonometry</a> page was also blanked out.</p>
<p>I'll add an entire section about Arab contributions to algebra, trigonometry, and mathematics in general later. Presently, I'm working on a comprehensive list of mathematician biographies which will take a week or more.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 02:30, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, this article is pretty awful, particularly the "<a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra.html#Algebraic_equations" title="Algebra">Algebraic equations</a>" part. I started to rewrite it earlier today, but then gave up (I reverted my edits) and expanded <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_equation.html" title="Linear equation">Linear equation</a> instead.

<dd>I agree. All the problematic sections mentioned above have now been removed and where appropriate merged into other articles. Such topics are inappropriate for this article, which as <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> says should be about the "bigger-picture view". I think the reason those sections were added is that editors see this article and think it is about <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_algebra.html" title="Elementary algebra">elementary algebra</a>. The intro needs to make it more clear what the article is about. I added the dab message at the top, to help in this regard. Also the history section needs to be expanded to include "modern algebra", which would also help.

<dd>van der Waerden's book "A History of Algebra" would be a very useful reference for fleshing out the history section. It covers from al-Khwarizmi to Emmy Noether (in fact, that's the subtitle). Unfortunately, I don't have an easy way to get at the book, but maybe someone who does can take a look. The question is, how detailed do you want the history section to be? Also, it may be worth saying that abstract algebra is the study of algebraic structure in an abstract and general setting, rather than simply saying that one studies groups, rings, and fields; moreover, abstract algebra's use is pervasive throughout modern mathematics, and I'm not sure that comes across in the article. <a href="../../../n/p/a/User%7ENparikh_16f1.html" title="User:Nparikh">nparikh</a> 23:58, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ved algebra forstås også "bogstavregning" og "læren om matematiske operationer".</dd>
<dd>Man kan lave en grov inddeling af algebra i disse felter:</dd>
<dd>Elementær algebra hvor man ser på egenskaberne ved de reelle tal, hvor man regner symbolsk med bogstaver som repræsentere tal, og hvor reglerne omkring matematiske udtryk og ligninger studeres.</dd>
<dd>Abstrakt algebra hvor man ser på strukturer som legemer, grupper og ringe.</dd>
<dd>Universel algebra hvor man ser på egenskaber der er fælles for alle algebraiske strukturer.</dd>
<dd>Computeralgebra hvor man ser på algoritmer til symbolsk manipulation af matematiske elementer.</dd>

<dd>I've slightly expanded and cleaned up the algebraic structures section. I think using groups as an example and giving a few specific groups is a good idea, to give the reader the flavor of the material, but probably we don't need to go into significant detail about many different algebraic structures here. This material is better suited for a page specifically devoted to <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_structures.html" title="Algebraic structures">algebraic structures</a> than a general overview of algebra. We should probably link to that page, but the current version seems pretty obtuse and probably wouldn't serve as a good introduction for the type of people who find the basic material on this page useful. -- <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZarvok_710a.html" title="User:Zarvok">Zarvok</a> | <a href="../../../z/a/r/User_talk%7EZarvok_a100.html" title="User talk:Zarvok">Talk</a> 07:23, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. Also, this statement implies that in other types of algebra, symbols are not used "as 'place holders' to denote constants and variables". Is that correct? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 04:45, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm beginning to self-teach myself mathematics. Basic algebra was the last stuff I forgot so I'm starting there. My question is, what is the difference between basic algebra, intermediate, and advanced? What gets discussed in each of these that doesn't get discussed in the others? I understand that this is a kind of sophistical division, but I am curious anyways. Thanks for the help. 134.53.26.113 17:34, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Basic algebra (or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_algebra.html" title="Elementary algebra">elementary algebra</a>) deals with numbers and polynomials. At a basic level, you learn a few rules and learn some properties of finding roots of polynomials and the like, but at a more sophisticated level, you start to explore the <i>structure</i> of these objects. The rules you learn in elementary algebra are special cases of more general rules, and the numbers and polynomials are simple examples of more general objects (elements of <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Field (mathematics)">fields</a> and polynomials over those fields). And by considering more general cases, you study the properties of fields and <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Ring (mathematics)">rings</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Group (mathematics)">groups</a> and all their cousins (<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monoid.html" title="Monoid">monoids</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiring.html" title="Semiring">semirings</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semigroup.html" title="Semigroup">semigroups</a>, etc.) And that's where it gets fun&#160;:) - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 19:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I changed it to follow the suit of the rest of the article.

<p>Your example of Hellenistic only exlemplifies my point. Should Egyptian mathematicians be called Hellenistic instead of Egyptian? Of course not, because calling them Hellenistic makes someone assume that they were Greek. And just because they wrote and studied in Arabic doesn't imply Islamic; that was done simply because Arabic was the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_franca.html" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a>. Many scholars wrote in Latin, but are called <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">German</a>, not Italian.

I was hoping we could label all Islamic Scientist without ethnitices, since this totally irrelvant to this article, and since this is what I have been doing all time, and IMHO the one that is most accurate, as once <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Sarton_fe61.html" title="George Sarton">George Sarton</a>, a Belgian-American polymath and historian of science, in his book "Introduction to the History of Science" said:</p>
<p><i>On 8 June, A.D. 632, the Prophet Mohammed (Peace and Prayers be upon Him) died, having accomplished the marvelous task of uniting the tribes of Arabia into a homogeneous and powerful nation. ...In the interval, Persia, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, the whole North Africa, Gibraltar and Spain had been submitted to the Islamic State, and a new civilization had been established. The Arabs quickly assimilated the culture and knowledge of the peoples they ruled, while the latter in turn - Persians, Syrians, Copts, Berbers, and others - adopted the Arabic language. <b>The nationality of the Muslim thus became submerged, and the term Arab acquired a linguistic sense rather than a strictly ethnological one.</b></i></p>
<p>And the number of arab scientist are not as few as you might have thought( see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars_ecdc.html" title="List of Arab scientists and scholars">List of Arab scientists and scholars</a> - still incomplete). <a href="../../../j/i/d/User%7EJidan_3a52.html" title="User:Jidan">jidan</a> 16:48, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The axioms of group theory require that every element must have a unique inverse; this inherently suggests there is a (bijective) unary operator "inverse" that maps elements to their inverses.

<p>The history section is currently wrong. By 1535 Fontana and several others had the complete solution to the general cubic equation. By 1545 Cardano had published a method also due to Fontana that solved the general quartic equation. The section claims that these solutions are only for specific equations, but they are actually general. The reason for this confusion is probably that the solutions relied on reducing the equations to ones of a simpler form through various transformations.

<p><i>Origin of the Word Algebra</i> <i>The word algebra is a Latin variant of the Arabic word al-jabr. This came from the title of a book, Hidab al-jabr wal-muqubala, written in Baghdad about 825 A.D. by the Arab mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi.</i></p>
<p><i>The words jabr (JAH-ber) and muqubalah (moo-KAH-ba-lah) were used by al-Khowarizmi to designate two basic operations in solving equations. Jabr was to transpose subtracted terms to the other side of the equation. Muqubalah was to cancel like terms on opposite sides of the equation. In fact, the title has been translated to mean "science of restoration (or reunion) and opposition" or "science of transposition and cancellation" and "The Book of Completion and Cancellation" or "The Book of Restoration and Balancing."</i></p>
<p><i>Jabr is used in the step where x - 2 = 12 becomes x = 14. The left-side of the first equation, where x is lessened by 2, is "restored" or "completed" back to x in the second equation.</i></p>
<p><i>Muqabalah takes us from x + y = y + 7 to x = 7 by "cancelling" or "balancing" the two sides of the equation.</i></p>
<p><i>Eventually the muqabalah was left behind, and this type of math became known as algebra in many languages.</i></p>
<p><i>It is interesting to note that the word al-jabr used non-mathematically made its way into Europe through the Moors of Spain. There an algebrista is a bonesetter, or "restorer" of bones. A barber of medieval times called himself an algebrista since barbers often did bone-setting and bloodletting on the side. Hence the red and white striped barber poles of today.</i></p>
<p>I think it would be nice if the word origin was robusted up a bit, and actually made reference back to the document that was the source of the name: <i>Hidab al-jabr wal-muqubala</i> ":) --<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFish-man_46e0.html" title="User:Fish-man">Fish-man</a> 00:01, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The present version of the article states, following the requirement that a group must be closed under its binary operation: "In fact, it is redundant to mention this property, for every binary operation must be closed. So, the statement "a group is a combination of a set S and a binary operation '*'" is already saying that the operation is closed. However, closure is frequently emphasized repeating it as a group property."</p>
<p>I disagree that an explicit mention of closure is mere redundancy. Saying that a "binary operation must be closed" without specifying the set in which it is closed leads to ambiguity.</p>
<p>A subset of a group, such as the kernel of a homomorphism, inherits the operation from its parent group. The binary operation <i>is</i> closed with respect to the parent group in which it was defined, but it still needs to be verified that the operation is also closed in the subset <i>S</i> under consideration. <b>Example:</b> Addition is a binary operation defined on the integers, and subsets of the integers inherit that operation. If <i>S</i> ⊂ <b><i>Z</i></b> is the set {0, 1, 3}, 1 + 3 inherits an unambiguous meaning, and it is not an element of <i>S</i>. On the other hand, if <i>S</i> is the set 2<b><i>Z</i></b> = {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, ...}, then the inherited operation from <b><i>Z</i></b> is also closed under <i>S</i>, so <i>S</i> is a subgroup of <b><i>Z</i></b>.</p>
<p>One may argue that the operation "+<sub><b><i>Z</i></b></sub>" defined on <b><i>Z</i></b> and the operation "+<sub>2<b><i>Z</i></b></sub>" defined on 2<b><i>Z</i></b> are technically different binary operations, since one is a function from <b><i>Z</i></b> × <b><i>Z</i></b> → <b><i>Z</i></b> and the other is a function from 2<b><i>Z</i></b> × 2<b><i>Z</i></b> → 2<b><i>Z</i></b>, but in practice we hardly ever make this distinction. -- Heath 24.127.52.67 14:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strictly speaking it is redundant, because, as you have said, a binary operation is defined on specific set S, and must be closed. However, this is interesting to think about. Strictly speaking, I think the operation "+" on <i>Z</i> and "+" on <i>2Z</i> really are the same operation, since the elements in <i>2Z</i> really are elements in <i>Z</i>. It is not the case that <i>Z</i> contains an isomorphic copy of <i>2Z</i>, where then the two "+" operations would really be different. So then I think that if you have a subgroup, it actually isn't redundant to specify it must be closed under the given binary operation, since it really is the same operation as that of the larger group. In any event, I think the little blurb about closure is wordy and I would not object to its removal. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrokmoo_388c.html" title="User:Grokmoo">Grokmoo</a> 16:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed in the history timeline that there are several mentions of differential equations and solutions to differential equations, particularly when being attributed to Indian mathematicians. While I am skeptical of many of these claims, I think that the subject matter (differential equations) is not really related to the core of this article. So, as a way of shortening the rather long timeline, I think these references should be removed from this page, regardless of their veracity. I am removing them for now, but if someone has objections, we can put them back in until a consensus is reached here. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrokmoo_388c.html" title="User:Grokmoo">Grokmoo</a> 17:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>My students have had great success with my Precalculus course notes, which emphasize algebra. They have enjoyed my section on graphs of high-degree polynomial functions. I believe the Precalculus article is barely maintained by anybody.

<p>This article now has TWO reference sections, which seems excessive. In the first of the two, numbered citations are mixed in with normal references. I'd like to tidy this up. One idea is to put all numbered citations in a 'Notes' section, and the others in References. I'd also like to prune the external links using a strict application of the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> policy. Any comments on this plan? <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 16:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm not sure. The numbered references are really references, but they are being used in the page, whereas the other references are just for the general subject, I guess. I notice now that a number of the references don't seem (from the title) to pertain much to algebra; it is likely that information from these sources is confined to only a small section of the article, especially the history section. I think we should either get some inline citations for these references or get rid of them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I noticed that #2 and #3 in the numbered references are from the same source; shouldn't they just be one numbered reference? I'm not all that experienced with Wikipedia's policies on references, so I'll defer to your opinion. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrokmoo_388c.html" title="User:Grokmoo">Grokmoo</a> 17:15, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
