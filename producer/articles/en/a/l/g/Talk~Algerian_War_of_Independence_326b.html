<p>I agree this is a very extensive article with a lot of good information. However, like the person said before, the majority of the information was taken from the Algerian Country Studies page from Library of Congress. And although it is free for public use, Library of Congress asks in the FAQ's section that, "appropriate credit be given to the series." It's important to remember that a lot of time and effort went into gathering and researching the information presented on Library of Congress. Therefore, in order to properly acknowledge LOC, it's important to include quotes around the quoted passages.</p>
<p>Nogin001</p>
<p>An excellent article, at least from the point of view of someone whose knowledge of the subject is limited to having watched Pontecorvo's movie "The Battle of Algiers" 35 years ago. But one point: it draws extensively, which is to say quotes long passages more or less verbatim, from <a href="http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/algeria1954.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/algeria1954.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/algeria1954.htm</a>. I don't know if this is a copyvio, since I don't know the ins and outs of copyrighting sites of that sort, but someone who does may want to address the issue. In addition, some persons mentioned in the text, such as Abbas, are not properly identified; other references, such as ALN, have to be guessed at. This is probably a side effect of borrowing. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItalo_Svevo_b9c0.html" title="User:Italo Svevo">Italo Svevo</a></p>
<p>Much of it was copied from <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html" class="external free" title="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html" rel="nofollow">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html</a>, which is "is not copyrighted and thus is available for free and unrestricted use by researchers".

<p>Is this accurate?: "The most notable manifestation of the new urban campaign was the Battle of Algiers, which <b>began on September 30, 1956, when three women placed bombs</b> at three sites including the downtown office of Air France." Is it not true that prior to these bombings, the FLN had been assasinating French policemen and the French retaliated by detonating a bomb in the Casbah (killing civilians along, along with their FLN targets). Also, I've heard that of the three bombs, the one at Air France failed to explode. True? 68.156.53.188 20:49, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can "FLN terrorism in French Algeria" be a cause for the 'Algerian War of Independence'? If anything it would a tactic within that war. Surely the cause is the French colonial occupation.</p>

<p>The numbers in the new <i>harki</i> section seem highly controversial:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The term also came to include non-fighting Muslim Algerian who supported a French Algeria, as well as their families." - when? I've never seen it used that way, nor does harkis.com seem to use it that way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"According to the United Nations, in 1962 there were 476,000 Algerian Muslim fighting for the French army, and 50,000 non-fighting Muslim overtly supporting a French Algeria (mostly Arab and Kabyle rich elite)." - can you point out an exact source? This contradicts even the harkis' own website, which gives 263 000 <a href="http://www.harkis.com/harkis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harkis.com/harkis.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - and ignores the fact that many harkis switched sides to the FLN before the end of the war.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Including their families, they numbered at least 1 million, or about 10% of the total Algerian population." At most would be more accurate - can you cite any neutral sources for this figure?</dd>

<p><br />
Dear friends,</p>
<p>The events that generally constitute the Battle happened in 1957, not 1956. Although the date above for the bombings is apparently correct, (The quote seems to be from the LOC country study on Algeria.) The Battle for Algiers began On January 28, 1957 following the national strike.</p>
<p>Specifica dates of interest:</p>
<p>28 January: General strike begins in Algiers which is broken by the paras. 5 March: Larbi Ben M'hidi, FLN leader captured on 25 February, dies in custody. 21 May: Fall of the Mollet government. 29 May: An FLN commando unit massacres all the men in the village of Melouza who belong to the rival MNA. 12 September: Resignation of Paul Teitgen, secretary general for the police in Algiers, who protests at the torture methods used by the paras. 24 September: Head of the Algiers FLN, Yacef Saadi, is arrested in the Casbah.</p>
<p>The Battle of Algiers ends.</p>

<p>AtiN: Your second and third additions only say in misspelled, ungrammatical and prolix English what was already present in good English. The first addition, concerning the French Resistance, is unsourced original research denying validity to a peripheral comparison, which was however sourced, and is even more irrelevant to the article. As for targetting civilians I do not recall much about it in general at the moment - are you saying they did not target <i>German</i> civilians? (dubious, false imho) - but it is not controversial and well-known that after the war, there was a lot of score settling by the French resistance that got out of hand and killed innocent people - another reason this does not belong in the article, in addition to being unsourced and not really relevant original research, it would take a lot of space to get right. Put it in the French Resistance article and debate it there. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 05:54, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks John for your help in engish. The FFI never target civilians, even german civilian. The only murder reported is the murder of a german officier in permission. He was not in duty so he sould have been considered as a civilian. About the "réglements de compte", murder, women insulted just after the liberation it's not due to what we should consider as "resistant". Theses crims are crims of "resistants of the last minutes". But who consider resistants of the last minutes as resistants&#160;?</dd>
<dd>FLN was a terrorist organisation. It's a fact, not an accusation.</dd>
<dd>A encyclopedic article must notice a difference between criminals and resistants. Please do not make the confusion. <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAtiN_6b28.html" title="User:AtiN">AtiN</a> 14:48, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. Jacques Verges is gone. In English adjectives derived from proper nouns take a capital letter (majuscule) so Algerian is correct, and I changed 'flee' (actually the past tense is 'fled' back to 'left' because it seemed more neutral and less emotionally laden - the text implies that many of them left over a period of two years or so, which suggests that they weren't actually all fleeing. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 15:48, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About "flee" or "left" an encyclopedic article must respect a neutral POV. That doesn't means a neutral vocabulary. To flee mean to be force to left because of a danger. People can flee during years and years... I don't see that "two years or so" as a argument against the use of "flee". Between 1933 and 1939 jews left or fled germany&#160;? I think it's more correct to say "fled". <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAtiN_6b28.html" title="User:AtiN">AtiN</a> 19:31, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks again for your english teaching. I had a friend "pied noir", the son of a baker. He was born in Algeria, he's father was born in Algeria, all his familly was Algerian (most of them had ascendants from France). He was not a rich colon but a modest algerian French citizen. If you ask him "What is your country&#160;?" He will answer "Algeria". I ask him why he never come back, even to visit. Too painfull he said. "You know it's too painfull for me to go back to my country and realise it's not my country anymore". He speaks fluently Arab. Not academic Arab but Algerian Arab. He had Muslim and non-Muslim friends. For him it did not make any difference.</p>
<p>I also had Algerian friends and they are able to understand that the offical version of the history teach in Algeria is far from the reality. Official history in Algeria teach that French in Algeria were like German in France during the second world war.</p>
<p>The reconciliation between France and Germany is done. But the reconciliation between Algeria and France is not already done. It will probably take more time. The time necessary to read together our common history.</p>
<p>Personnaly I would like that EU enlarge not only to Turky but also to the mediteraneans countries.</p>
<p>I think that French are closer to Algerian thant to Norvegian. I dream to the progressive transformation of EU to EMU (Euro-Mediteranean Union). United in the diversity.</p>
<p>Some people dream to a strong Arabic and/or Musulim union and in a choc of civilisation. Some people want a Christian UE. I don't.</p>
<p>i thought this ritcle was well written and it helped a lot with my school paper. I didnt like what that random person blabed about at the end. can you say anoying?</p>

<p>In Benjamin Stora's book La Gangrene et l'oubli (pg. 15 La Decouverte/Poche 1998) he quotes historien Charles-Andre Julien saying that the quote attributed to Mitterand "La seule negociation, c'est la guerre" ("the only possible negotiation is war" or whatever) is probably false. Julien couldn't find one witness to substantiate the quote. Also, the fact that the war was simply referred to as "les evenements" for decades in offical french discourse and that Mitterand himself is recorded as saying that they should avoid anything that could appear as a sort of state of war seems to confirm this. I think the quote, besides being quite probably fictitious, does misrepresent the dynamics of the wars beginning. Spetts 22:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)Spetts</p>

I've seen there is an English (and Chinese) version now but I don't think the video summaries are written in these languages. It could came later as the site just opened three months ago.

<p>The use of torture by the FLN is not mentioned, there's only one occurence about the Harki, while the term refers to the French army. However torture was in use in both sides, this was war. It's like the use of torture is not acceptable from the French but is acceptable from the independists (same happened with the US in Vietnam and Irak). Godard's 1960 "<a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Petit_Soldat_3069.html" title="Le Petit Soldat">Le Petit Soldat</a>" (which was censored until the war ended) depicts the use of torture in both sides as well.

<p>the term "colon" is misused in the article. its use reveals a pro-Algerian view. Pied-Noirs were not colons but indigenous, Algeria was a French territory, legally won by war, since 1830 and most of them never went to France. that makes three or four generations living in French Algeria. By the 60s, the Pied-Noirs were not colons anymore but indigenous born from European roots (like the American or Australian citizens doesn't name "colon" themselves anymore, but still are from the native civilisations view), how can we name this in English? Actually the Pied-Noirs named "colons" the metropolitan French! Those who were not born in Algeria but who lived there (including militarymen, administrative, teachers, owners, etc), actually the metropolitans were richer than the Pied-Noirs. The metropolitan named the European indigenous "Pied-Noirs" and the Jews named them "the Pathos" for their catholic religion. the Muslim indigenous named "colons" as a pejorative term for all non-Arabs. Also it should be mentioned the European-origins indigenous, the Jews indigenous and the Muslisms did not lived together but in separate neighborhood cities. The Muslims lived in the outskirts in small towns named "village nègre" (English translation is easy) by the non-Muslim, the latter living in modern European style cities, by that time, Algiers was the 2nd French city after Paris. The communities were not isolated though as there were trading and civil relationship between European-origins and Jew-origins and Arab-origins Algerians. The Muslim Algerians kids went at French school with the Catholic Pied-Noirs and the Jew Pied-Noirs, and the adults worked for French companies, until nationalism and emancipation rose from the awareness of the colons defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and its retreat from Indochina. Hence this war was named Algerian War of Independence by the Arabs but Algerian War by the French. Actually, from the French point of view the Independence of Algeria would had been a cessession from the metropolitan territory involving the army, the Pied-Noirs, the Jews and the Muslims (like the US did <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British). The failed Generals <i>coup d'état</i> would had probably resulted in this situation. Also what the Free World names the "Vietnam War" is named "Vietnamese War of Independence" by the Vietnamese, which is true from their point of view the same way its true for the Algerians. Just naming the conflict from one or the other way indicates the point of view vis-à-vis the event, that's why I'm trying to neutralize the current article (understanding both points of view, except the French Communist pro-FLN fifth column). <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShame_On_You_c488.html" title="User:Shame On You">Shame On You</a> 20:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i have added a caption for the article's infobox picture and corrected the pictures summary: these French history events are confusing for our French historians who have materials, i wonder how foreigners can understand such complicated events with no background nor language understanding. Before it was the FLNC Corse picture, now these French barricade rioters confused with pro-FLN Muslims... Also having the OAS and France combatants in the same side is purely nonsense as the French government and OAS were deadly ennemies and absolutely not allies. Actually the FLN became France's ally against the OAS. This conflict was an independence war from 1954 until 1961 and became a civil war in 1962.<br />
Muslims were not living in European style urban areas but in villages, also they were not dressed with European suits but traditional clothes and the women wore <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burqa.html" title="Burqa">Burqa</a>, knowing this cultural facts you can be sure this picture shot in the center of Algiers cannot possibly features Muslims.</p>

<p>"It was a period of guerrilla strikes, maquis fighting, terrorism against civilians on both sides, and riots between the French army, the European-Algerians (Catholics &amp; Jews)—or the "colons" as they were called by the FLN"</p>
<p>First, this conflict was absolutly not a religiopus one. It was not about catholic but about French people. <i>What the fuck is the catholicism doing here</i>? In an other hand, reading this article, you have the impression that the jews had great importance in the war. But it was NOT a confessional conflict but a national one. Not about catholics, not about jewish, but about former Algerian, and French colons.</p>
<p>There is no "pieds noirs" in Algeria anymore, but lot of jews stayed. They stayed because they were here before the French invasion. <b>The jews who left were the french jews: they don't left because they were jews but because they were french.</b></p>
<p>Secondly, this last paragraph about Israel and the Palestine is, I am sorry, completely creazy. <b>There is absolutely no link between theses two conflicts</b>. The Algerian one was a colonial war in which people were fighting invadors from an other country, the Israeli-Palestinian one is about two country on the same land, with problems of recognition and territory. You are trying to associate them, because French action in Algeria was absolutly indéfendable. So, stop your propaganda, and clean up this article.</p>
<p>I was told yesterday that wikipedia had serious problems about the actual mid-oriental conflict; I begin to understand why.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. I've thus taken the liberty to remove the whole paragraph, putting it here (just in case someone really wants to take the pain to argue its legitimity on this article). <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 00:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC):

<dd>"==Influence on Palestinians and Israelis==</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinians.html" title="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>, even more than other Arabs, followed the Algerian War of Independence with sympathy and regarded its victorious conclusion as a precedent applicable to their own liberation struggle. Following <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, the efforts of <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>'s <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLO_68c8.html" title="PLO">PLO</a> to start a guerrilla campaign in the newly-occupied <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a> were consciously inspired by the Algerian experience. Later, in periods of extreme hardship for the Palestinian population there was frequent mention of the extreme sacrifices which the Algerians had to make and which were ultimately vindicated by the achievement of independence.</p>
<p>The Algerian War entered the internal Israeli political and military discourse following the outbreak of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Intifada_e467.html" title="First Intifada">First Intifada</a> in 1987. When Israeli forces started using harsh measures in an effort to break the Palestinian uprising, peace groups and left-wing parliamentarians pointed to the French Army's experience in Algeria as proving the futily of such methods. The film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Battle_of_Algiers_514d.html" title="The Battle of Algiers">The Battle of Algiers</a></i>, made back in 1966, was shown in Israel for the first time during the Intifada years, drawing considerable public attention and with critics often drawing explicit parallels with Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Horne_96f4.html" title="Alistair Horne">Alistair Horne</a>'s book on the Algerian war was published in Hebrew translation, followed by the work of <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Aron_4c46.html" title="Raymond Aron">Raymond Aron</a>. The <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Forces_0099.html" title="Israel Defense Forces">IDF</a> high command took the decision to distribute copies of Horne's book to all senior officers, a decision sharply criticized by right-wing parties as "defeatist".</p>
<p>Since the idea of evacuating Israeli <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlers.html" title="Settlers">settlers</a> came on the Israeli public agenda following the <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo_Agreements_9d9c.html" title="Oslo Agreements">Oslo Agreements</a>, the evacuation of the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieds-noirs.html" title="Pieds-noirs">Pieds-noirs</a> is being frequently cited as a precedent.</p>
<p>For their part, the settlers and their political supporters deny the validity of the comparison, on the grounds that Algeria is separated from France by the Mediterranean while Israel and the West Bank are territorially contiguous, and also that Jews have a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical.html" title="Biblical">Biblical</a> and Historical claim over the territory as the French in Algeria did not have. The main difference between the situations is that the French in Algeria still saw themselves as French and their motherland in France, while Jews are connected to Israel not through colonization but through their attachment to Israel itself. <i>Israel will argue that it's exactly the opposite — the Arabs are the historical colonial power</i> who seized the land of the indigenous people of the land of Israel. Israel argues that the Jews, continuously living in Palestine, are in no way strangers to the land.</p>
<p>During the public debate on the 2005 <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Disengagement_2e20.html" title="Gaza Disengagement">Gaza Disengagement</a>, some well-known columnists criticized <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a>'s decision to have each and every settler physically removed by army or police, and recommended instead the "de Gaulle Method" — i.e., withdrawing the army and leaving to the settlers the choice of remaining in the Gaza Strip or returning to Israel under their own power. The suggestion was, however, rejected out of hand by the Sharon Government.</p>
<p>At present, the history of the Algerian War continues to be frequently invoked in the ongoing political debate in Israel, with the prospect of further West Bank withdrawal and settlement evacuation high on the public agenda."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The parallel beetween algeria war and israelian-palestianian conflict does not respect the NPOV. Why? Because it would means that Israel is a stolen country. Everyone agree that Algeria WAS a stolen land (colonization is about solen land), while saying that Israel in itself is a stolen land is an ideological POV. Palestinian said they were doing the same than Algerian people because Algerian were anyway the "good ones" in the independance war. Then, it shouldn't be put as an evidence here. Sorry for my english, I'm actually French&#160;;)</p>
<p><br />
I am sorry but you dont have a point here. I dont understand how you can state that Algeria was a land stolen by the French. Given this, you have to follow with saying that United States is a land stolen by some colons to indian indigen people.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the recent changes which have corrected factual mistakes concerning dates - these need close reading to spot! I just have a remark concerning the removal of the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_crisis.html" title="Suez crisis">Suez crisis</a> from the <a href="../../../h/e/a/WP%7EHEAD_78a6.html" title="WP:HEAD">intro</a>&#160;: isn't it suitable for the intro to include it, as it is an important historical event, on an international scale, which was related, in some way, to the Algerian War? The intro does needs reworking (as the article in general) but unless someone argues the Suez crisis was really peripherical to the Algerian War, I do think it should be included <i>somewhere</i>. Concerning the Library of Congress issue, the best would be to re-word and use other source, I think. In any cases, it is best to use <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFootnotes_49e0.html" title="WP:Footnotes">WP:Footnotes</a> for the article, but that is a little detail that we will fix later.
