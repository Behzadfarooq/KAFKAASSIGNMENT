<p>Actualy, there is a programming language Algo. It was an algebraic language loosely modeled on ALGOL 58 and released in the early 1960's by Bendix for their G-15. I plan to put in a complete article Real Soon Now. --User:DJBrantley</p>

<p>Don't want to start an edit war, but surely the name of the language was <i>always</i> in all-caps during the time when it was an important language? I bow to those who say that "Lisp" is now normally in mixed-case but I think the articles on these languages should state and document the proper capitalization of the languages and the date when the capitalization changed officially (if it changed officially) or the approximate time of transition in usage (if the change was informal). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 14:15, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC) Cursory googling convinces me it was indeed ALGOL, all-caps.

The TeX version of the Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60 clearly uses the lowercase form. I don't have an original, so I don't know how authentic that is. The original Algol material I have usually uses capitals in the title and small caps in the text.

<p>The other character (miss by unicode) that was part of Algol was the <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/5tape.html#alcor" class="external text" title="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/5tape.html#alcor" rel="nofollow">ALCOR</a> "subscript 10". eg.</p>
<pre>
<b>real</b> n; n := 6.0221415₁₀23;
</pre>
<p>The one "byte" (6/7 bit) subscript-"₁₀" became a backslash-"\" in the 1967 version of <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascii.html" title="Ascii">ascii</a> and thus never made it into <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">unicode</a>.</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>Oddly the tens {⑽, ⒑, ⑩} do exist in unicode... something to do with the British wanting to support 12 pennys in a shilling. But the subscript <sub>10</sub> needs two characters in unicode.</p>
<p>Note "₁₀" was part of the ALCOR paper tape standard for Algol, also has been included in a German norm (<a href="../../../d/i/n/DIN_0756.html" title="DIN">DIN</a>66006), it has been discussed in <a href="../../../a/c/m/ACM_0d8f.html" title="ACM">ACM</a>: comm.ACM 7 No 7(424,447) (there called "subscript 10") and "₁₀" is part of a couple of Russian GOST standards.

<p>I reverted "These strategies facilitated recursion, avoided anomalous side effects that followed from the then-prevalent call-by-reference, and provided some polymorphism." back to "Call-by-name had certain limitations in contrast to call-by-reference, making it an undesirable feature in imperative language design. For example, it is impossible in ALGOL 60 to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable. However, call-by-name is still beloved of ALGOL implementors for the interesting “<a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunk.html" title="Thunk">thunks</a>” that are used to implement it." Call by reference is an option in Ada, C++ and Fortran, among other languages, so it's not exactly "then-prevalent". IIRC, it was a mistake in standardization to create call-by-name, and in retrospect, it was clearly the wrong choice. Every serious programming language designer has read about ALGOL 60 and call-by-name; none of them have used it in their programming languages.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 19:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, not really. Call-by-name in the form of lazy evaluation is the preferred calling mechanism for modern functional languages such as Miranda, Clean and Haskell. I'm guessing this was Sadorrest's intent in mentioning imperative languages. Simple call-by-name is inefficient because the same expression may be evaluated multiple times, but this is avoided in lazy evaluation. The mechanism is still avoided in imperative languages because it doesn't serve much purpose within that framework. The situation is different with a functional approach where lazy evaluation provides a theoretically cleaner mechanism and supports notions like infinite data structures.</dd>
<dd>It's unfortunate that Mdmi simply deleted the remarks critical of ALGOL and replaced them with an opposing set. There look to be valid points in both sets of remarks that can be made without violating NPOV. It certainly makes sense to indicate the reasons why call-by-name was avoided in imperative languages, but that does require saying that it was simply wrong. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">A B Carter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/b/c/User_talk%7EAbcarter_86c3.html" title="User talk:Abcarter">talk</a>)</small> 20:40, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It <i>was</i> simply wrong, though. Call-by-name as a tool has some advantages in certain environments. However, in ALGOL--in this article--it was a poorly thought-out choice that was widely agreed upon afterwards to have had little to no upside. I don't have access to a great library for this stuff anymore, but there was some stuff I copied off when I did that I'll try and summerize and cite in the next few days.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 15:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Still learning about ALGOL and my knowledge of its usages is weak. A quick search indicates that you're probably right, but I would be very interested in further comments and any references you have. What got me wound up was your final statement that call-by-name has not be used in any language developed after ALGOL. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">A B Carter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/b/c/User_talk%7EAbcarter_86c3.html" title="User talk:Abcarter">talk</a>)</small> 15:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, it is impossible in ALGOL 60 to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would assume this sentence belongs into the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evaluation_strategy.html" title="Evaluation strategy">evaluation strategy</a> article, like most of the discussion in this section. I would like to see a practical example (code) for this. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasJS_121f.html" title="User:AndreasJS"><span style="color:white;background:blue;"> Andreas </span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndreasJS_db1e.html" title="User talk:AndreasJS"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 22:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course it is possible. This example does not work:</p>
<pre>
begin
  integer i,j;
  integer array a[1:10];
  procedure swap(x,y); real x,y;
  begin
     real z;
     z:=x;
     x:=y;
     y:=z
  end;
  for i:=1 step 1 until 10 do a[i]:=-i;
  i:=j:=3;
  swap(i,a[i]);
  outinteger(1,i);
  outinteger(1,a[j]);
  outterminator(1)
end
</pre>
<p>However, when the original array value is saved first, it works OK:</p>
<pre>
begin
  integer i,j;
  integer array a[1:10];
  procedure swap(x,y); real x,y;
  begin
     real z;
     z:=y;
     y:=x;
     x:=z
  end;
  for i:=1 step 1 until 10 do a[i]:=-i;
  i:=j:=3;
  swap(i,a[i]);
  outinteger(1,i);
  outinteger(1,a[j]);
  outterminator(1)
end
</pre>
<p>The output of this code is -3 3. I tested it using marst-2.4.</p>
<p>I wonder when this case is relevant in real life. I would think that if an expression is to be used as a parameter, it would be declared value anyway. The only reason why call by name is undesirable is because it is expensive; apart from that, it is theoretically the best solution, it gives the value that corresponds to the situation at the time when the parameter is needed. This is why the fathers of ALGOL implemented it. In any case, as long as the above statement is not documented somewhere, it is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and therefore should not be included in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasJS_121f.html" title="User:AndreasJS"><span style="color:white;background:blue;"> Andreas </span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndreasJS_db1e.html" title="User talk:AndreasJS"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 00:58, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
