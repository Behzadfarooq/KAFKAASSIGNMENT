<p>I am not an expert on these matters, but my biology book says that most algae are protysts, while this article contradicts this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Really? By "protysts" I assume you mean the term, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protists.html" title="Protists">Protists</a>, a heterogeneous group of eukaryotes and a term used in classifying mostly single-celled organisms. Many protists do have chloroplasts, and therefore would be algae. I'm unclear what you find contradictory in the Wikipedia article. There is a problem in whether these are "plants", but they have been traditionally considered plants, and any contradiction there is due to some editors problem with that term (discussed under <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plants</a>) and not the original concept of Protista. Or perhaps it is the grouping "algae", which is a general category and not used for classification purposes, as the article points out in the first paragraph. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 04:31, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're right, I did mean "protists." I always spell that wrong. According to my biology book, "algae" is the term for plant-like protists, just as "protozoans" is the term for animal-like protists. Plant-like protists include euglenoids (phylum euglonophyta), diatoms (also called golden algae [I think]; phylum bacillariophyta), and dinoflagellates (phylum dinoflagellata). The more traditional algae are red algae (phylum rhodophyta), brown algae (phylum phaeophyta), and green algae (phylum chlorophyta). The last three all have some members that are usually known as seawead.
<dl>
<dd>That book sounds pretty dated as to the taxonomy of these organisms. Or just over-simplifying by applying "common" names. It really once depended on whether you were a botanists or a zoologists (or protozoologist) whether single-celled organisms like <i>Euglena</i> were protozoans or not. Anyway, all that is best cleared up by reading material on more modern systems of classification and realizing that taxonomic classification is just an expression of how we look at things, not some absolute authority on the organization of nature - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 19:33, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Red algae are often/usually/always in seaweed form (the book isn't clear). Their red color allows them to photosynthesize using blue light, which penetrates water deeper. They are used to make agar. Brown algae are complex, always seaweed, and include kelp. They have a brown pigment in addition to chlorophyll. Green algae is a very diverse phylum, containing most of what we usually think of as algae. Many species are also seaweed. Green algae are thought to be the ancestors of the plant kingdom.
<dl>
<dd>All of that is fine and not especially contradictory with modern thought.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>According to my biology teacher, there are some plants that grow underwater and are also types of seaweed. He can sometimes get facts a little off, though, so the validity of this may be questionable. It may be more or less common than he says.
<dl>
<dd>Well all seaweeds grow underwater (sometimes briefly exposed by the tide), so I do not see a problem. There are also many plants (in the narrow sense of true plants, not algae) that grow underwater. But the term "seaweed" is limited to macroalgae that live in the sea. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 19:33, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I know there is a lot of conflict about the classification of organisms, and that may be the problem. If that is the case, there should probably be an inclusion of all the leading classifications.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is the word <i>plant</i>. When the article says that algae are generally considered plants, it's referring to the traditional definition, which is still in popular use. However, many texts on algae specifically exclude them from the plants, meaning the Plantae. Trying to ignore this difference, especially in favor of the older term, is confusing and we should change the wording - at the very least, protists should be <i>mentioned</i>. Also, saying algae are <i>separate</i> from bacteria and protozoa is an obsolete view; they overlap with both (plus there are other photoautotrophic bacteria). I've changed the opening to try and clear this up. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Josh is right, and the "problem" used to be discussed under the article on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plants</a>, but I'm unsure if it is still there. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 19:33, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not all Rhodophyta (red algae) are seaweeds - some grow in freshwater - then they are not red! to be fair there are few. Further the word "type" should be used only to refer to a specific specimen chosen by taxonomists as a basis for describing a species. In theory it is the only specimen known to science which is "correctly" determined. All the others are matters of opinion.<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsborne_7e52.html" title="User:Osborne">Osborne</a> 16:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC).</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/Protista.html" title="Protista">Protista</a> are one vast kingdom which includes a great array of relatively simple plants. It seems this is not yet accepted by all botanists. In my opinion the variety is too vast for all to be lumped together! <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_green_algae.html" title="Blue green algae">Blue green algae</a> are too close to the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and should be together. The <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodophyta.html" title="Rhodophyta">Rhodophyta</a> are quite different and should be separate from the Bacteria and Blue-greens, they show no signs of ever having flagella, this places them in a separate group to the brown and green algae. To unite these along with others (diatoms, Haptophyta, Xanthophyta etc)into one kingdom is quite misleading. <a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsborne_7e52.html" title="User:Osborne">Osborne</a> 11:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html#Protists_and_plants" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">Tree of Life discussion of plants and protists</a> also has a lengthy debate about this question of which kingdom Algae belong in. My recent addition there points out that Wikispecies, ITIS, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (europe.gbif.net) all agree that Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta are within the Kingdom <b>Plantae</b> and not Protista. GBIF puts Phaeophyta in Kingdom Chromista, but both Wikispecies and ITIS put them within Plantae instead. I would like to see wikipedians adopt as a general rule using primarily these three sources for determining taxonomic classifications in the taxoboxes and referring to contrary opinions from journal articles or textbooks only as footnotes or subsections within their articles. My reasoning for these three sources is that they are well-established associations of very large numbers of governmental and private scienctists (and everyone else, too, in the case of wikispecies) from around the world. Is there a way to get that promoted as a general policy for taxoboxes here at Wikipedia? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECape_cod_naturalist_8032.html" title="User:Cape cod naturalist">Peter</a> 03:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The considerable effort and contributions to this article regarding algae and biodiesel production are valuable, but not really appropriate here. I think either a separate article or (first) a section in the article on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel.html" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> is far more appropriate, since the subject is biodiesel production (from whatever), not algae focused. I am also concerned that the many links to outside web sites for biodiesel is starting to get beyond the Wikipedia policy that Wikipedia is not a collection of web links.

<p>Hi Marshman, I was going to leave a message here to ask about starting a link page for "algal cultures available for purchase", when i read this message about biodiesel. I'm not familiar with wikipedias format, to keep web links out of articles, do they have specially dedicated "link" pages, where all the links could be put, and then a single link could be put in the article to that page, or is wikipedia just trying to have as few web links as possible.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not entirely clear on your question, but the first rule to consider is that Wikipedia is not a collection of web links, so the idea to create a web links page may not be a good one. In general, web links should either be part of the references (information used to write the article) or external links to "further reading" material. Links to commercial websites that sell algal cultures would likely be removed, as commercial sites are very much frowned upon unless they provide information in a non-commercial way that can not be obtained elsewhere. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 18:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My interest in posting the biodiesel section was more on the cultivation of algae for biodiesel production, and the current developments towards that end. The biodiesel aspect is trivial, thats just the transesterification of an oil. But the efficient production of the base oil from algae is what i was getting at. The majority of land-based oil crops produce between 50 and 200 gallons of vegetable oil per acre, per year, Palm oil is an exception at 635 gal per acre, which is currently the best land crop. Algae can produce between 5,000 and 20,000 gal per acre, per year, and can remediate waste in the process. Algae is somewhat stand alone and that is why i tried to focus on the algal aspect of biodiesel production.</p>
<p>The title, Algal cultivation for the production of biodiesel might be more appropriate for now.</p>
<p>I didn't think that I had enough information to start a seperate page for biodiesel production from algae, I think there's only about a paragraph right now, but if you include the algal cultivation section, that takes up much more space.</p>
<p>What areas are you interested in moving from the algae page?, just Biodiesel.., or Uses, Cultivation, etc.</p>

<dd>I think a good start would be a separate article on algal culture in general, as that is aquaculture oriented, whereas this article is more taxonomy oriented. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 18:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a very well researched section, but rather long at this stage. It's also still seemingly well short of it's endevoured length, which may be a bit long for an encyclopedia article especially as a section in the algae article - a separate article would probably be the best idea with a condensed version here. For the unfinished parts, moving to the talk page and moving the references to the bottom of the page would be tidier.

<p>Yes. A separate article would be best, with a short résumé under algae. Completing this article is becomming a bigger job than I presumed! - and needs more info' from other areas of the world.

<p>Thanks, I have not yet mastered the way to note references. However, The section:"Chemical analysis...(dry weight)". came from:Irvine, L.M. and Chamberlain, Y.M.1994. <i>Seaweeds of the British Isles.</i> The Natural History Museum, London. and "Maerl is still harvested... organic gardening." is a quote from Blunden <i>et al</i> (1981) in Irvine &amp; Chamberlain, 1994 (p183). The "CaCO3" should show the "3" as a small "3" as - which I can't reproduce here! - Oh yes I can&#160;:- "COэ" . I can correct this but if you can sort out the other refs I will be most grateful. Advice will be welcome.--<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsborne_7e52.html" title="User:Osborne">Osborne</a> 08:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A general practice: If we have read source <b>1</b>, and source <b>2</b> is cited there, and we also need to cite <b>2</b> as it appears in <b>1</b> -- credits must go to <b>1</b> because it's not the original text (it is perhaps already rephrased and repetitive rephrasing may yield unnoticed distortion). Of course, after we also read <b>2</b> and confirm contents, we can do it either way. -- So I believe that Irvine &amp; Chamberlain can be simply referenced instead of listing them in '===Identification==='; Blunden <i>et al.</i> do not need a reference at all because if someone needs that data, it can be found in Irvine &amp; Chamberlain. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaimhe_591e.html" title="User:Saimhe">saimhe</a> 17:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
