<p>I propose to shorten the article considerably. In the present form it has a too defensive character. For my feeling, the references to Perl, Scheme, ML are not really helpful. Some criticisms don't need to be mentioned (operator priority discussion). --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 13:24, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I agree the article needs to be shorter. In many ways it should be longer. But it could certainly be improved. It has that common problem that it has been added to in pieces by many people with new information, and has lost any unity and structure it might have had.</dd>
<dd>My thoughts are
<ul>
<li>Rename "Overview" (which it isn't) as "Notable language features". Make sure everything there <i>is</i> notable, and make sure it makes sense to someone who never saw the language before.</li>
<li>Rework "some vanitas" into "Notable language features" or lose it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmm. Iff the article is shortened, this is a good candidate, too. Note the "iff". In the present state of the article it may expalin some of the shortcomings.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Criticisms should not be based on new insights; new insights don't belong.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Comparisons with other languages may have a place, but are they original research? In any case the comparison with C++ is not factually accurate (e.g. C++ has formatted transput, surely, with printf/scanf) and may not add much to the article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>printf is not part of the language, contrasting to A68.</p>
<ul>
<li>--- This does not change anything. The language together with its standard library is something the user has on start. So this whole set should be considered, if you want to compare. You would also say that <a href="../../../t/c/l/Tcl.html" title="Tcl">Tcl</a> does not provide Object-Oriented features, not even mentioning that it has several libraries that provide it. Please, try <b>not</b> highlighting in comparisons things that are "not supported in the core language" because for a particular language user this does not mean anything; such a user would like to know if he can just do some thing requiring this feature or not. Not only has C++ printf-s derived from C's standard library, but there is also provided <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boost_library.html" title="Boost library">Boost</a>::format with richer facilities. Should you have it in a language, you can say that the feature is available, no matter how. I would be rather interrested with facilities, which MUST be done in the core language and, for example, C++ does not have it and it is hard to emulate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ethouris</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Variants needs to mention the important ALGOL 68C and ALGOL 68R. The first part of that section belongs under notable language features or nowhere. Proceduring is notable, I think, but must be defined.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Proceduring is *the* part of the language where the non-revised language failed, and it was noted. Proceduring, as defined in the in the non-revised language didn't work correctly. But removing proceduring was a really bad cure for that. It is easy to see, that a usable description could have been found, by the simple fact that adding some parentheses and "PROC BOOL:" in the source make the magic work (correctly!).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to see more on history and especially on discussions of the reason for its failure. <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.pdf</a> is a very interesting reference. "[The revised report] resulted in an exemplarily clear, precise and consistent description of anelegant and orthogonal language that was at its appearance already classical but dead.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>An original insight that could be included if someone else published it: why would the commercial world implement a language from academia in the form of a report, which also included a minority report definining a different language? Suicide!</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me comment on the last item: It wasn't suicide. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 21:24, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let us try to make a good article, at least. If nobody complains, I am going to start making the article more concise, trying to use your hints.</p>
<dl>
<dd>New insights? At one time I found this rule as an adjunct to "no original research", i.e. "no original insights". I can't find it now!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The issue with proceduring is that it is not defined before it is discussed. I know what it is, but I don't think anyone who didn't would be left any the wiser. It is quite an interesting and unusual idea, and worthy of discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<p>Concerning Algol68 being an academic language and already dead-at-birth: at Control Data Corporation we've built an almost complete implementation (only 1 or 2 items missing), commercially published around 1978 for use on 6000 and Cyber series mainframes.

<dd>The rectangle is called "window symbol" in the RR, it is used as elem operation symbol, yes (RR10.2.3.9b). The report does not define how the symbols are encoded. A different document (Hansen, Boom: The Report on the Standard Representation for ALGOL 68) tries to clarify how the symbols are represented in ISO646 and EBCDIC. This document discourages the use of most symbols not in the intersection of these symbol sets.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(C.5 Other characters: A portable program should be written entirely in worthy characters, becasue only these characters are available in all implementations). The digraph &lt;- is not allowed in a68 as operator symbol, as in S-plus, e.g. because x &lt; -1 and x &lt;- 1 would easily be confounded. -&gt;, though, could be used. Extensive use of exotic symbols is not typical for programs written in A68. --85.22.19.171 19:26, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have been skimming throught the <a href="http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/Algol68-Report.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/Algol68-Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Draft Final Report</a> you pointed out online.... It seems that there is a whole pile of operators in the Draft Final Report I never even knew about. Check Pages 109... The FR allows .. as well as&#160;:, → in place of "<u>of</u>". Did this "I am guessing that this online version isn't the "Final Final Report". Looks like I have a bit more reading to do. (Ironically a similar -&gt; made it into C/C++)
<dl>
<dd>But it looks as if the semantics were inverse. Personally, I prefer C++ in this respect. You call the document "draft": AFAICS my prionted version of thsi is the final published report, but before revision. I never got in acquaintance with A68 before revision. So I cannot comment mcuh on this, except that I had preferred that proceduring (not as coercion) ahd survived.</dd>

<dd><i>The American Standards Association (ASA, later to become <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSI_d403.html" title="ANSI">ANSI</a>) first published ASCII as a standard in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>.

<dd>Hence Algol68 was straddles both ASCII-1963 and ASCII-1967 standards.</dd>

<dd>I had look into unicode internals for this case. It looks as if the "base ten" symbol was the only machine written symbol of computer age which didn't make it into unicode. This should be changed. But, personally, I don't like unicode enough to feel engaged. It seems that, if anybody wants to make this into unicode, has to be prepared very well. Of course, the representation using two subscripts is sufficient to publish documents containing. But for this, Unicode subscript were superfluous as well. The origin of this symbol seems from British teletype code as variant to the backslash, and it has been used in the German TR440 computer central code ZC1 at position 141. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 20:02, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I used Algol68C on EBCDIC of IBM VM/CMS and ASCII of DEC10. There were no "exotic characters", but fortunately there were upper and lower case, otherwise Algol68 code would have looked worse the COBOL code. Clearly there was no Unicode back in 1968, so did the "exotic characters" only ever exist on paper, or were they sourced from some other pecular computer system? Also, if I recall right, a semicolon was also regarded a exotic to some character sets, hence Algol-W used a comma-dot, instead of a semicolon at the end of statements. (And hence maybe the&#160;: used in todays array slices x[1:3], possibly originated from x[1..3] which appears to be more natural)</p>

<p>On an aside, in fortran a declaration of "REAL REAL REAL" is legal, I am guessing Algol68 was trying to mimic this in its declaration syntax, eg by allowing "<u>real</u> real real;", (which contains spaces in variables, and reuse of "reserved" words/tokens). If this true?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In case of FORTRAN IV, spaces are not significant in any position except in H formats. Position is, though. That spaces in identifiers are allowed, is heritage from Algol60.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And on another aside, why did Algol68 have the IF .. FI, DO .. OD and CASE .. ESAC. But spoil every thing by using CO .. CO, and PR .. PR, no CO .. OC and PR .. RP?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably an oversight. Comments do not contain interesting stuff. But TNEMMOC would look rather strange. NIGEB, too. When I program A68, I don't use IF..FI very often. I prefer the short symbols ( | | ), anyway. But for DO..OD there are no short symbols. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 17:19, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is little known, that the ALGOL68 Reports have been translated into German and Russian, possibly other languages, too. The termini technici like MOID have been translated also in the unrevised report, in case of MOID the German translation was MÖSCH, which is a contraction of MODUS and LÖSCH.

<p>I noticed some laxness in the operator list. In Algol 68 "IS","ISNT" and their shorter forms&#160;:=:&#160;:/=: are not operators but special syntactical symbols like&#160;:= . I am not sure whether correcting this would go to much into technical details. For now I just move the short forms from the implementation column to the original language column, where they belong. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 11:27, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have found an argument, why it must be corrected: The priorities are wrong. These constructs don't have PRIO 4,. Effectively their priority is less than that of any opreator. Maybe putting them in a row with PRIO 0 and a comment is a good solution. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 18:34, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If I remember right&#160;:=: and&#160;:/=: were not part of the standard. BTW I dug the <u>is</u> and <u>isnt</u> <u>op</u>erator <u>pri</u>rities from the Revised Report, so the <u>prio</u> <u>is</u> = 4, <u>isnt</u> = 4; should be OK.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry to disagree. But the is symbol is not an operator, it just loooks like one. The&#160;:=: was present in in unrevised report already. For the negated equal sign, two possibilities are provided in the RR: either the mathematical unequal sign or the digraph from slash and equal sign for operator and identity relation symbol. The not symbol is only used to construct operators. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 18:07, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not a problem. I checked the RR that you put online, and you are right. So, I have effectively moved the&#160;:~=: "syntactic" elements to priority 0. I left the <u>plusto</u>, but removed the other <u>timesto</u> operators as I could not find them in the RR. I wish I had a copy of the Algol68C manual to see if the <u>timesto</u> were implemented there.
<dl>
<dd>I have a copy of the Algol68C manual. If this is not available on the net already, I could perhaps make scans available. But, with no compiler for this implementation, this is not too interesting. Algol68C does not define or allow to define operators with assignation. These are automatically available for all operators where these are applicable. So, Algol68C has timesto and similar. I am not sure that the authors really thought much about the displace-formulas, how they call these, after looking this up. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 15:57, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Do you know the "official" priority of the uniary operators? esp <u>not</u>, as typically (in other languages) its priority is lower then that of arithmetic diadic operators.
<dl>
<dd>In A68, all monadic operators have prio 10. The most likely troublespot is -1^n . Of course, it would be more natural to have all boolean operators at a lower priority than arithmetic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I guess my interest in the article is not to create a reference, but to answer some of the questions on the origins of Algol68 of the kind a learner may ponder, Why this? why that? etc. And keep the reading relatively "light". Kind of a "extra lite Algol68" version of "The Annontated C++ reference manual". So feel to interject if anything I add is too heavy.</dd>

<dd>Algol68 cannot be parsed by LALR parsers because the natural grammar is not LR1. One of the big troublemakers is, that a comma is allowed between declarations; so a variable declaration may follow a mode declaration; so you don't know whether a mode indicant at this place is a defining or applying one before seeing the equals sign. At least you need to know the priority before use, if you want to parse operator precedence in one run. The Algol68C restriction is sufficient for this case. I have written a YACC parser for Algol68 for the full language with this restriction myself. I cannot really claim that this is a faithful parser, because some of the syntactic restrictions are not enforced. They have to be honored in the sematic routines. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 14:52, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>

</dl>
<pre>
<u>op</u> == ( <i>mode...</i>
</pre>
<p>where you don't know yet how to parse the ==. Is this a typed operator declaration for ==, or an untyped declaration for =? This may be misremembered, but something like this annoyed me for a long time. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 16:04, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is not the actual trouble spot, because in the typed op declaration the declared symbol comes after the modes: OP (INT,INT)BOOL == SKIP . IMHO it is allowed to restrict usage of = as defines-symbol not to be adjacent to operator symbols it can combine with.</dd>
<dd>But if you have MODE FOO = STRUCT(...), BAR = ... , you need to 2 tokens look-ahead to see the equal sign, before you can decide that the mode declaration continues; otherwise BAR could start a variable or identity definition. In my lexer this leads to the restriction, that after a boldtag in defining context only one blank is allowed. The comment in my Flex lexer calls this a quirk. A hand-written lexer could avoid this.</dd>
<dd>Note that the keyword MODE is nearly useless, because a parser powerful enough to cope with this is also able to know that FOO = STRUCT ... must be the begin of a mode declaration, anyway. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 16:42, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just curious: The number of atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon 12 is known as Avogadro's number. It is approximately 6.0221415×10↑23 (2002 CODATA value). Does the RR still allow me to define this constant as follows:</p>

<p>⑽, ⒑, ⑩ do exist in unicode... something to do with the British wanting to support 12 pennys in a shilling. But the subscript <sub>10</sub> needs two characters.</p>

<dd>IMHO there are enough reasons to do a formal proposal to unicode.org to include this symbol. It has been included in a German norm (DIN66006 IIRC), it has been discussed in ACM: comm.ACM 7 No 7(424,447), there called "subscript 10". Personally, I don't like Unicode enough to be engaged in this. A nice web page about codes includes it: <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/5tape.html#alcor" class="external text" title="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/5tape.html#alcor" rel="nofollow">ALCOR</a>.

<dd>I kinda agree with you... for example, even without significant support for the official APL character set, the APL developers continued programming in APL using "other characters". After all character sets don't make a language. Beside if we want to add to wiki all the details of the language (including the <sub>10</sub>), then we might as well replace the wiki-page with the Revised Report!! (I am allowed to be harsh as it was my suggestion)
<dl>
<dd>The now realise that the <sub>10</sub> characterm appears in several standards. <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/5tape.html#alcor" class="external text" title="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/5tape.html#alcor" rel="nofollow">ALCOR</a> of [ACM] (became DIN 66006 in Germany), <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#gost10859" class="external text" title="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#gost10859" rel="nofollow">GOST 10859</a> 7 bit Cyrillic &amp; <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#gost10859l" class="external text" title="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#gost10859l" rel="nofollow">Latin</a>.</dd>
<dd>In GOST 10859/Cyrillic there appears to be various characters subsets giving greater text compression:
<ul>
<li>4 bits - numeric data</li>
<li>5 bits - numeric + operators</li>
<li>6 bits - numeric + operators + Cyrillic <a href="../../../a/l/g/ALGOL_68_023b.html#endnote_worthy" title="ALGOL 68">Cyrillic worthy characters</a></li>

<p>So far, I have added a tiny section on the transput, and a tiny bit to the section on operators, and some code for parallel processing. They seem to fit in OK. There is not much mention about bits and bytes and such representations. FR vs RR and Extensions etc</p>
<p>Already we have reached the 32k recommended article size. Is it time for a revision/pruning? What have we missed that is notable? Having said that it looks basically OK to me so far.</p>
<p>One book I read years ago on A68 could have its sections read "horizontally and vertically" out of a grid. This highlights that A68 was designed to be orthogonal. Do U know the Author/Title of this book? Could we structure an article like this?</p>

<p>The book is Lindsay and van der Meulen's <i>Informal Introduction to Algol 68</i>. It would be interesting to structure the article that way, though I'm not sure where one would fit some of the political aspects of the language's history in that structure.</p>
<p>One thing that is definitely missing from the article is a discussion of "triple <b>ref</b> technique" which is possible only because the language allows references to non-heap objects. A Rosetta Stone-style listing of linked list manipulation in ALGOL 68, Pascal, and C might be the way to show the technique's advantages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A discussion of the triple REF technique is needed, indeed. IMHO this hasn't do too much with heap vs. non-heap, as Algol-68 can easily be implemented without LOC at all (just make all allocations on heap). I have prepared some variations on the theme in [<a href="http://vestein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68-queue" class="external autonumber" title="http://vestein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68-queue" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]. The file queuea.a68 is due to Andy Walker (discussion in <a href="news:comp.lang.misc" class="external free" title="news:comp.lang.misc" rel="nofollow">news:comp.lang.misc</a>) except for the complaint in the commentary, of course. queueb.a68 changes the original file by lifting the REF up to mode LIST. queuee.a68 makes the algorithm parallel-safe, hopefully. I like queuef.a68, because it uses operators instead of functions. In queueg.a68 I modified the program to avoid triple REFs. Yes, this is easy: Just wrap one of the levels into a STRUCT. For syntactical reasons, a second field dummy in this STRUCT is needed. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasreiniger_c75e.html" title="User:Glasreiniger">Glasreiniger</a> 13:57, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ack, you're absolutely right. The point is that unlike Pascal, which only allows pointers to records, Algol 68 allows references to things of any mode, including <b>ref ref amode</b> (i.e. variables of type <b>ref amode</b>, in particular those where references to heads of lists or roots of trees are stored), hence the name. My mistake.</dd>

<p>This quote might be a pun on case-stropping where the <i>published</i> form "<u>begin</u> <u>real</u> pi=4*atan(1) <u>end</u>" would be written as <i>case-stropped</i> "<code>BEGIN REAL pi=4*atan(1) END</code>". I remember that case-stropping (changing case for "Syntatic elements", MODEs and OPerators) was a pain on keyboards that had only <i>caps-lock</i> (ansi) and but useful on <i>shift-Lock</i> keyboards (IBM).

<p>Steve talked Dennis into adding void as a type in C. It saved the instruction loading register for return value. Also when Steve got to the lab C types were like PL/1 namely offsets from any base you liked. They changed to A68 types but be the specific reason for this change is now lost. A few other A68isms ended up in C. (Subsequently these A68isms made their way into C++).</p>

Moreover - although the v7 shell is written in <a href="../../../c/_/%28/C_%28programming_language%29.html" title="C (programming language)">C</a> - Bourne took advantage of some <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macro.html" title="Macro">macros</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> to give the C <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_code.html" title="Source code">source code</a> an ALGOL 68 flavor.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would suspect (but I cannot back it up with a quote) that the parallelism in the Bourne shell was a direct result of the PAR clause in Algol68. eg</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell: (sleep 10 ; date ) &amp; ( sleep 20; date) &amp; (sleep 30; date)</li>
<li>Algol68: PAR ( (sleep(10); date ) , ( sleep(20); date) , (sleep(30); date) )</li>
</ul>
<p>However Algol68 didn't get pipes until arriving on Unix, and the pipe behavior is not part of the standard.</p>
<p>Shell and Algol68 are unusual in that both are early examples of concurrency which is mostly absent from other standard languages of the time. (PL/I had/has the TASK keyword)</p>

<p>IMHO you are right in A68 being a dead end. Now we know that it was a mistake to introduce pointers into a HLL. But AFAIK till the advent of Java this has not been corrected in the more successful languages.</p>
<p>Sh is not comparable to a programming language. But the facts, which Neville reports, are correct, at least in the main parts. One exception is the parallelism. The &amp; Operator has been in use in V6 Unix, but not the if - fi bracketing construct, which is due to Bourne, who has been one of the first A68 compiler writers.</p>
