<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old talk</span></h2>
<p>The paragraphs I've just added come from an old source whose copyright has expired. I've attempted to verify everything, modernize spelling, and eliminate anachronisms, but I'm sure I haven't succeeded completely. So please update anything I've missed and expand wherever you feel it's necessary.</p>
<p>I've removed the following paragraph from Archaeology as I can not find verification of it. I suspect that either the monuments are no longer in Algeria, or that the spelling of Arabic "walls" given ("jedars") is no longer common, possibly both. Verifying this bit of text is complicated by the fact that the "department of Oran" no longer exists, but is now Mauritania, Morocco, and Algeria (the former "department of Constantine" is now Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria. If you can find the correct spelling of this word and also find if the monuments mentioned remain within the boundaries of present-day Algeria, then please update and restore it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Jedars (Arabian "walls" or "buildings") are in the department of Oran. The name is given to a number of sepulchral monuments placed on hill-tops. A rectangular or square podium is in each case surmounted by a pyramid. The tombs date from the 5th to the 7th century of the Christian era, and lie in two distinct groups between <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiaret.html" title="Tiaret">Tiaret</a> and Frenda, a distance of 35 miles. Tiaret, an ancient town modernized by the French, can be reached by railway from <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mostaganem.html" title="Mostaganem">Mostaganem</a>. Near Frenda, which has largely preserved its old Berber character, are numerous dolmens and prehistoric rock sculptures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(from Tiaret page)</dd>
<dd>This is correct. The site of the Djedars is close to Frenda which is a town in the Department (wilaya) of Tiaret. Frenda is situated about 50 Km to the south west of Tiaret City. The monuments still exist and can be visited. Post-cards of the tombs also are on sale in the region.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(from Mostaganem page)</dd>
<dd>Actually Tiaret cannot be reached from Mostaganem by train. The train link is not functional anymore. Rather Tiaret can be reached by route (several highways). Tiaret can also be reached from Algiers by plane.</dd>

<p>KQ, I think you're going about this exactly the right way. This isn't to say there's anything wrong with uploading totally unedited stuff from the Unnamable <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a>, but at some point, we've definitely got to update those entries. What's cool is that, as you're demonstrating, it <i>is</i> possible to update them. --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></p>
<p>Thanks. The spellings can generally be figured out; for whatever reason we've tended to change double identical consonants in a word to single ones. And as a sidenote, the preferred spelling of one word is no longer "shat" but "chott." &#160;:-) I'm looking forward to adding countries whose boundaries have <i>not</i> changed in the last 100 years, as I expect them to be much less time-consuming.</p>
<hr />
<p>"the "department of Oran" no longer exists, but is now Mauritania, Morocco, and Algeria (the former "department of Constantine" is now Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria."</p>
<p>This is not correct; in fact, the "department of Oran" corresponds to western Algeria, and "department of Constantine" to eastern Algeria. Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, and Mauritania were never integrated into the French "d√©partement" structure, as Algeria was. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.164.10.115.html" title="User:67.164.10.115">67.164.10.115</a> 06:04, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I know its does not have MUCH to do with Algeria:A while back I was wathcing an Anime series on Cannal Algerie.Because the credits were in Arabic,I could not tell its name (nor an abrevariation).Its protagonist was a 12-13 year old boy,with black hair,wearing green clothes and fighting.On one ocasion of some tournament he fought a guy in a dark cloack,who shot projectils of some kind against him.He had a friend fighter of the same age a boy with white hair.He had a supervisioning teacher "sensei"(not confirmed) who watched his fights. One of the integral points moved around his (I think) sisiter.They were re-united at the end of the series.The series also featured a big guy(probably android),who could shoot from his fingers. The series first ran after and then before an animated footbal series (an Anime as well I think though I can't confirm completely).Could someone tell me WHAT series I watched? New Babylon</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History section</span></h2>
<p>The length of the history section was just about doubled just now. It's only intended to be a brief summary of the main article; bearing this in mind, I suggest that (most of) that paragraph would better be placed in the appropriate <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Algeria_6309.html" title="History of Algeria">History of Algeria</a> series article. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:41, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be specific, I suggest that it might better belong in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_rule_in_Algeria_be52.html" title="French rule in Algeria">French rule in Algeria</a>. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:46, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>the history section is little short of ridiculous, considering the rich history of the nation during the 11th to 16th centuries. i would ofcourse be pleased to add to it, but im hardly a historian and could only offer passing judgements. any historians reading this, please add to the section. thx (sep 30, 05)</p>
<p>I saw that Khoikhoi erased the passage in which I wrote that French rule had officialy and actually suppressed slavery in Algeria, although it were one of the most important fact of french colonisation. Why&#160;? For Khoikhoi, all is black or white (see also the chapter "culture"). Is Wikipedia a way of a mere primary propaganda&#160;? (de K/hotonnec)</p>
<p>The paragraph starting with "The French Army subjected village after village..." and the two after that have extremely weird grammar and it is very difficult to understand what is being presented. I would guess that these are translated poorly from French. I don't know much about Algeria, so I hesitate to try and edit them. Perhaps someone else could clean it up a little? Wclapier 06:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The history section needs a lot of just grammatical help. IT feels like it was translated poorly or written by someone who doesn't speak English very well. I guess this is kind of obvious, but yeah. I tried to fix it up a little, but I am not sure if I can even understand some of the sentences in the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbadbyte_2224.html" title="User:Bigbadbyte">Bigbadbyte</a> 22:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I kind of understand where the reader is coming from, but a lot of ideas have been entered out of time order and other are already mentioned in other paragraphs.

<dd>Okey, I just ouright deleted them. They are out of context and very specific, the ideas been discussed to some degree in history of algeria and other sub articles (e.g under ottoman rule). By the way, they've been translated from the french wikipedia <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alg%C3%A9rie" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alg%C3%A9rie" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>--<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjihed_3250.html" title="User:Djihed">Djihed</a> 22:37, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About King Koceila and Queen Kahena</span></h2>
<p>We work here to make history an not politic. The ¬ß I added concerning the hero√Øc Koceila and Kahena has been related by Ibn Khaldoun the greatest historian (the most objective and rational) of the whole Middle age. He was not ashamed to remind, that before the Islam the ancesters of Berberians were either Chrisian or Jewish and were also good warriors.<br />
So I do not understand why that ¬ß has been censured. Consequently I retablish it.<br /></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What about the violence?</span></h2>
<p>This article reads almost like a tropical paradise. There's almost no mention of the almost 200,000 people who died, why they died, who killed them, and what started it, just a link to the civil war article in the history section. It's also written in such a way that its all an armed group causing problems, and the government is a democratical one. What about the fact that it's an oppresive regime? What about the fact that on their first election in 1990, the other party won, so they canceled the second round to stay in power? What about the widespread belief that many generals from the government are believed to have caused many of the deaths. I modified the paragraph a bit but I think it should be part of the first section, since it's an on going conflict that caused international outrage. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfguy_25ac.html" title="User:Elfguy">Elfguy</a> 18:06, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arab/Berber</span></h2>
<p>I am Algerian myself,i corrected mant times the paragraph DEMOGRAPHICS,it told we were Berbers in origin however that's not what the Algerian government tells,neither Europeans and Middle Eastern Arabs.Middle Eastern Arabs consider us as Arabs,Sudanese Arabs are mostly black people and are not considered as ethnically Arabs to us.Why do some ignorant people always tell "berbers in origin" while i corrected it many times?the Cia webste tells "berbers in origin" and the ud department of state tells differently,contradictory,Wikipedia tells we are of middle eastern ancestry in the article MAGHREB and in Algeria it tells we are berbers,the people won't take this site serious <small>‚Äî<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 84.5.49.45 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.5.49.45_3694.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.5.49.45">contribs</a>) 10:23, 27 December 2005.</small></p>

<dd>I don't understand. Do you want the article to say Algerians are Berber or Arab? I think the best thing is to say that the population is mixed, and that some consider themselves fully Arab, some fully Berber, and some are satisfied that the population is of mainly Berber origins but by now mainly Arab in culture and language (except for in some wholly Berber areas, such as the Kabyle). That also seems to be the view held by most of the sources. Since it is a sensitive subject, politically, I believe WP should mention all these perspectives. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 17:38, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um, I'm Algerian too, and everyone knows Algerian Arabs are largely of Berber descent, just like <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Khaldun_a947.html" title="Ibn Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a> said; in fact, genetic studies have confirmed this obvious point (see <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a>). That said, the current wording does suggest that there's no Arab ancestry at all, which is also ridiculous. I've tried to come up with a better one. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:22, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I want the article tells "Algerians are mostly of Arab ancestry,80%.A large minority of Algerians are Berbers,20%.Many Algerians are of mixed Arab-Berber stocks."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is the official version of the US STATE OF DEPARTEMENT. Arre,i saw you were interested by the Arabic World,esspecially Maghreb,where are you from,what origin?Don't answer if you don't wanna.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I dont want to be only Arab of culture,i know i am ethnically Arab and i am proud of my heritage so i want wikipedia to not contradict itself,sometimes we are Arabs,sometimes we are Berbers,Lord noone will take this site seriously.To the Berbers and the Europeans,we are Arabs and we stole Maghreb in the seventh century,lol i want to be a thief then let me be an Arab please.Seriously,let's be serious,imagine if you told to a Yemeni that he is of Ethiopian ancestry,not an Arab?how would a Danish react if some people forced him to be a slavic?They know they are Germanic,imagine how they can feel if you tell them they are slavic,or latin..it doesn't make sense,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would not be unhappy if i realised i had also Berber blood,but i prefer to be an ARAB because i can't change my identity for some Berbers that wish we were not Arabs,to fight our panarabism...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mustafa Ibn Khaldoun died in 1406...be realistic,what could he know about what it happenned 800 years ago,when Arabs invaded Maghreb?He was himself an Arab from a YEMENI family that immigrated to the Andalucia,the Arabian spanish kingdom...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually you reffer to the article "berber" but it is totally wrong,and it contradicts the other articles of wikipedia,including the french version of "maghreb",that tells "in the past,Middle Eastern Arabs were a minority in Maghreb and are now a majority".i don't know if you are Arab Algerian but i doubt it,I think you're Berber...you tell "everyone knows",but you can't talk representing "everyone",also the official governement of ALgeria tells we are of Arab ancestry,so don't disinform people...and genetic studies according the english version of the article "maghreb" in wikipedia tells most maghrebis are predominantly of MIDDLE EASTERN ancestry,the berber genes are not specific at all.Just compare Berbers with Middle Eastern Arabs,same features,same physical caracteristics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't deny many Arabs mixed with the indigenous BERBER people when they conquered their lands,but their descendants are still Arabs.</dd>

<p>i still believe the WP description is more correct, but that does not mean that you are not ethnically arab. if you say you are, i believe that. also, what matters is of course the cultural conception of ethnicity: racial and genetic origins is important only to racists. however, the US state department says the following on arab/berber ethnicities in algeria, which is basically my belief too:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>almost all Algerians are Berber in origin, not Arab; the minority who identify themselves as Berber live mostly in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of Algiers; the Berbers are also Muslim but identify with their Berber rather than Arab cultural heritage</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>please note that the wikipedia article presently allows for more arab heritage than the US state department, which is fine with me.</dd>
<dd>i am from sweden, but neither arab nor berber. just interested, in the arab world and maghreb in general, but especially in algeria. i hope to be able to visit your (fascinating) country in the future and spend some time there; i've been to tindouf twice before, but then i only met with sahrawis. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 20:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>answer to arre:so u think it is more correct if wiki contradicts itself?understand me,wikipedia is not making sense changing its version in every article.you just cited the description of the CIA world factor book,not the us departement of state version( i wonder why these stupid american politicians contradict themselves).See this page please:"Nearly all Algerians are Muslim, of Arab, Berber, or mixed Arab-Berber stock." <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm</a></dd>

<p>racial is not only important to racist people,this description is avaible in the west,not in every place of the planet,then don't call me a racist.when you were considered as an Arab by everyone,and when many "racist" people from the western world called you a "filthy Arab" since you were a kid,you don't want to become a Berber,excuse me.I was born in France actually and i never saw an Arab calling himself a Berber,neither in FRANCE or in Algeria.To me the ethnicity is importantbut doesn't mean i am a racist,the west consider the people who are proud of their genetics as racist because the west caused genocides on the base of RACISME and NAZISME(pure race etc)but it doesn't mean we are like the westerners.There are many Arabs of mixed anestry in Sudan and Mauritania,they are a mixture blaks-arabs and i consider them as Arabs.About the negroid black sudanese that consider themselves as ARABS but were obviously arabised,i don't dislike them at all if they feel Arab i consider them as Arabs,not by ethnicity so they are not as much close as an arab moroccan or a palestinian but they're still arabs.And also i like being an Arab because of the mention of the Arabs in the Bible and in the Koran.I am happy to be mentionned as the descendant of Abraham.&#160;;)</p>
<p>It is like the ashkenazi jewish people,they hate when you deny they are Hebrews,because many trukish khazarian people converted to JUDAISM in the middle eage,they don't want to become turkish,i can understand them because they were persecuted as HEBREWS or as "the killers of Jesus"</p>
<p>You were in Tindouf,the famous area that Morocco and Algeria claim as their territory.But Tindouf is not Algeria,the real Algeria is the North,not in the desert,tindouf in algeria is like alaska in the usa,or like "nouvelle cal√©donie" in france.I am happy you are interested by Algeria,i saw many European tourists there but still not like in Tunisia or Morocco.If you go to Algeria,u should visit ALGIERS,ANNABA,SKIKDA and CONSTANTINE,all are gorgeous.I have heard Oran was nice too,.There is an important roman antic site near Batna(a berber area but it has nothing to do with Kabylie),it is called TIMGAD and is classified as WORLD HERITAGE. <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/194/" class="external free" title="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/194/" rel="nofollow">http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/194/</a></p>
<p>i read u r interested by the western sahara,i have a question to you,do you think it is good to recognise western sahara as an independant state(as it proclaimed irself)?do you think they should be independant?</p>
<p>Arabs are already enough divided,why would we create a new Arab nation when we are from the same nation,divided throught the centuries?I think Morocco and Algeria should share it because they mess because of this territory,or Morocco should keep it and the conflict will end.But it is only my opinion,in my opinion Algeria Tunisia Morroco and Libya should have united in one unique state for a long time.We are not strong when we are divided and not organised,if we were as the slavic and the germanic,or as the spanish and the british,i could understand why we have so many different states,but we are Arabs and Berbers in every Maghrebi states,we are the same people and don't need to divid.</p>

<dd><b>answer to the above</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>first</b> - i'm NOT saying you're racist. i'm saying that genetic distinctions are only important to racists (and genetic scientists, i guess); i have no idea if that applies to you or not.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>second</b> - berber/arab. we should try to find a consensual solution to this, instead of reverting back and forth. i think the article should make room for your opinion, which is the opinion of many: that algerians are basically arab. but it must also make room for the other opinion, which is shared by even more people: that there is a significant non-arab berber minority, and that much of algeria's arab population descends from arabicized bebers. if you have suggestions for how these two opinions can be made clearer - please. but i do believe the latter opinion is the more widely accepted and scientifically viable, and it should be presented as such; but that of course doesn't mean it should be presented as an absolute truth.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>third</b> - tindouf. i know this is not representative of algeria, and that's why i want to go to the north too. inshallah&#160;:-)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>fourth</b> - western sahara. a free western sahara should be created in accordance with international law, if the sahrawi people so desires; and more than 30 years of rebellion tells me they do. but if they should chose in a free and honest referendum to become part of morocco, that's fine with me. what polisario demands, and what i wholeheartedly support, is that they should be given the democratic choice that is their right according to international law, and which was in the end granted to both moroccans and algerians, by their colonizers, after their respective struggles for freedom. forcible annexation and occupation is a crime, and never acceptable - not by morocco in western sahara, not by israel in palestine, just as it was not by the french in morocco and algeria, or the germans in france. etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>fifth</b> - arab unity. that's fine with me: difficult, but a worthy goal. granting self-determination to the sahrawis (who repeatedly stated they want to participate in such a union after independence) would make maghrebi unity possible, whether they chose independence or morocco. but continued occupation without a political process does not. that has been tried and failed for 30 years now, and neither the problem of western sahara nor the problem of arab unity has come an inch closer to a solution.</li>

<p>Arre,yes it is discussion page and i am sure everyone i interested,there is far enough place dont worry&#160;;)</p>
<p>Arre,exactly i agree with you we have to tell that there are 20% of Berbers,i never denied it and i even wrote it,but trust me most of Berbers admit we are ARABS and not Arabised,that is why we have to tell the opinion of Algerians(Arabs and Berbers),not of people that never went in Algeria such as the western people,when i see how the western medias describe the Algerian society,how their propaganda disinforms their people,i can't think they know anything about our origins... There were Arabised Berbers but they mixed with the other Arabs,and by the way it is not useful to specify some Arabs are Arabised Berbers,it would be a sign of propaganda because they are Arabs for centuries and recognised as Arabs by the ethnically Arab Algerians.As i told you noone will tell Spanish and Italians have some of Arab and Berber genes,it would be ridiculous because they are mostly of European ancestry,what about the Serbians or Greek people that mixed with the Turkish?</p>
<p>About Sahraouis,it has nothing to do with israel in Palestine or France in Algeria.You don't make sense,first they are all Arabs,remember PRUSSIA annexed many German speaking people's territories and it was not seen as a crime,so did Italia when it united in the eighteen century.Sencondly the western Sahara was a part of Morocco before the imperialistic spanish and French governements separated it,so Morocco has the right to restore its sovereignty on its territory.Just like Iraq has the right to restore its sovereignty on kuwait,that was as its part before the imperialistic British separated it.Just like Syria has the right to restore its sovereignty on Lebanon,that was its part before the imperialistic French governement(still them) separated it creating two independant states,making same people kill each other and hating between them.Actually,according to the french history teachers,germany was divided in over 300 states,but it had the right to unite again.France and the other winers(sweden) wanted to make it weak as they divided Arabic world to make it weak.I think (not only me actually,it is the french version) it is the European colonials fault if the western sahara exists and is separed from Morocco,and yet Chirac still continues his imperialism involving his country into Lebanon-Syria affairs while it is his country's fault if there is a conflict.It is also their fault if millions of Africans killed each other because they created strange borders putting 200 different ethnicities in a same country(french teachers themselves tell it is the colonials fault) to serve their agenda:to pillage and steal everything from Africa to bring them in EUROPE(gold,diamands,oil,gas,ant treasures etc) In other words,the imperialistic european governements divided us to serve their agenda(to control,to steal,to dominate US) and we do not need to folow what they dod for us,we rather need to unite AGAIN,Ich A Allah</p>

<li><b>arabs/berbers</b>. what do you want to write instead?</li>
<li><b>western sahara</b>. so you're in favor of libya annexing algeria too? they're all arabs, anyway, right? i think you need to read a book or speak to a real-life sahrawi, if you believe that france and sweden are responsible for western sahara's independence struggle. my final word on the matter is that arabs are humans, and as such their national communities have the right to self-determination within any recognized boundaries; and to democracy and human rights as individuals. that entails not being forcibly annexed by anyone - not by europeans, and not by other arabs.

<p>I wrote it many times but you always change it aparently,it is irritating...</p>
<p>Algeria was never a part of Libya,i tell "never",but if it annexes Algeria i would be happy and would make the party,trust me&#160;;).Have you forgotten i was panarab?Yes i am in favour of this annexion!But lets change this dumb libyan president at least&#160;;)</p>
<p>Arabs have the right of self determination?So what?they can't divid the national territory and make it weak,imagine if every swedish area would ask for its independance,the country would be weak then and the swedish governement wouldn't agree.But as i told Morocco already annexed this territory and i think it should keep it.</p>
<p>you don't seem to have heard me,WESTERN SAHARA is and was a part of morocco before the imperialistic european governements (not sweden,u r mistaken?i mentioned sweden ONLY about THE 30 years war with germany) separated it.Morocco has not to hear what u;n(france + uk + usa=imperialistic nations) have to tell.It is its territory and it annexed it.France would have never let morocco protesting about the annexion of ALSACE LORRAINE from GERMANY in 1918 and 1945.As i told Arab nations suffered of european imperialism so now europeans can't continue to tell them what to do while they created the problems,they should let arabs solve them themselves.</p>
<p>And i know what the sahrauis are,thank you&#160;;),they speak Arabic and we consider them as Arabs</p>

<li>No, Western Sahara was not part of Morocco. That is what the International Court of Justice argued, and what nearly everyone except Morocco itself argues. However, that's a pointless line of reasoning to begin with. Most of the Arab world was part of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, but that gives Turkey no claim to annexing either Palestine or Egypt, as I'm sure you would agree: any nation has the right to <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-determination.html" title="Self-determination">self-determination</a>, i.e. <i>to chose its destiny freely</i>. Western Sahara may well BECOME part of Morocco after a referendum, but to say that it must be annexed militarily, in disregard of the opinions of its inhabitants, is not Pan-Arabism. It's Fascism.</li>
<li>As for <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> was part of of Sweden for hundreds of years, before being occupied by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, and then opting for independence instead of rejoining Sweden when it was granted self-determination in 1917. Sweden did not respond by launching a "blue-and-yellow march" and massacring Finns until they fled <i>en masse</i>. Instead the government chose to accept the democratic choice of the Finns, which I am very happy about today.</li>
<li>Same thing happened with <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> when they decided that they wanted to leave Sweden in 1905; they voted and got their independence. That worked out well, and nowadays we get along just fine.</li>
<li>Today Scandinavia is probably one of the most stable, peaceful and politically integrated parts of the world, despite a thousand-year long history of shifting occupations and never-ending national hostility and wars. A complete political union between the countries is not at all unlikely in the future. I don't think it's a far-fetched conclusion that Scandinavian unity (not to mention prosperity and democracy) has been better served through peaceful cooperation and mutual respect for national aspirations, than by forcible annexations, occupation and state terror. Anyone seriously interested in Arab or Maghrebi unity would do well to consider that.</li>

<p>western sahara was a part of morocco and is recognised as a MOROCCAN TERRITORY by the Arab League (22 countries),as a large part of current algeria was a part of Morocco,including tindouf where you have been to,the international court has nothing to tell to morocco,it should start to judge the criminals of that world instead to tell Arabs what to do...it should also tell Spain to leave the Moroccan territories of CEUTA MELLILA CAANBRY SILANDS etc.And again,even Algeria admits TINDOUF was a part of Morocco because it is the truth,France stole it from Morocco and Morocco renounced it because of the superiority of France.When Algerians kicked france out they freed this territory so they kept it.Most of the Arab world was occupied by the ottoman empire,it was not the ottoman empire to us,it is only an occupation,as Poland was not a part of Germany to the Polish,as Alsace was not a part of Germany to France,as Mandchourie was not a part of Japan to CHINA,you have to make a difference.Serbia was never turkish it was only occupied by the turks,it has nothing to do...telling morocco what to do with its lands is fascism as well. Europeans should tell israel to give palestine back and to stop to occupy arab lands instead to enter into arabs-arabs affairs about morocco and sahara.U.N should apply its own resolutions about israel that refuses to follow the international communauty orders and is never sanctioned since decades,instead to enter in ARABS-ARABS AFFAIRS,i find it logic.Sweden and FINLAND have nothing to do,the sahara was separated by france and spain,so it doesn't count to moroccans,and they're right.Morocco is not an apple pie,the arabic world was divided too many times by the westerners to make it weak:syria,lebanon,jordan,kuwait,iraq etc etc...</p>
<p>the Scandinavians killed over 2,2 millions of Iraqis including a large part of children since 1991,yet you tell scandinavia is a peaceful place...a peaceful place but not a peaceful entity for sure...they ended the wars bteween scandinavian people but apprently they moved far away to kill other people...</p>

<p>80.61.125.94 has rightfully reverted edits of 84.5.58.61 who tried to add this piece of anti-wikipedia information:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Some Algerians are of mixed Arab-Berber stock,80% of the Algerians are Arabs and arrived in the 7th century during the expansion of Islam.20% of Algerians are Berbers,they speak Berber languages and inhabited Algeria before the arrival of Arab tribes.Many historians think Berbers are of Yemeni origin,some historians tell that they imigrated from there into North Africa before the coming of ISLAM in the Arabian peninsula.The exact origins of the Berbers are not proven,some historians think that they are Iberians of European ancestry.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is so much wrong here. Minor mistakes: "<i>stock</i>"? "<i>peninsula.The</i>"? "<i>the Algerians are Arabs and arrived in the 7th century</i>" Well, they must be very, very old!</p>
<p>Bigger errors: 80% Arab? 20% Berber? Just random numbers! No facts whatsoever. Or this: "<i>Some Algerians are of mixed Arab-Berber</i>". How many then? 0% (100% minus 80% and 20% equals 0%)</p>
<p><b>But the most annoying is the damn racism</b>. The strict seperation between Arab and Berber. It is a reflection of the strong racism in Algeria (and Marocco) today. The people in Algeria are mostly of Berber descent which was Arabized during the 7th century. There is nothing wrong with being of Berber descent. Unless you take it as an insult, why hide it?</p>
<p>The story that Berbers came wandering from outside (from Yemen, or from Spain, or from just any place except North-Africa itself) is part of the racist propaganda against Berbers today: "It was never really Berber country, so Berbers cannot demand humane living standards here." It is the official excuse to oppress Berbers, their culture and their Tamazigh language, withholding them from resources.</p>
<p>Saying that "Algerians are childen of Arab tribes" which travelled there during the 7th century is a myth, a physical impossibility, a phantasy. Wandering Arab tribes could have never spread that fast over such a large area. Every few kilometers they would have had to settle down in order to find food, raise generations, and build resources in order to conquer a next plot of land. It would have taken ages! What really happend was that the Berbers already settled in the area easily took over the Arab culture of the mighty Arab soldiers riding their fast horses. Berbers were Arabized. (it is not an insult to being a Berber, and it is not an insult to becoming/being Arab)</p>
<p>Saying that Arab tribes were settling there, leads to absurd conclusions: (1) Berbers lived in hot and dry desert Algeria and did not want/manage to settle near the tempered and green coast, so they left it to the "Arab tribes". (2) Or this: Indonesia is the country with the highest % of muslims. Of Arab descent too? (3) The name 'Berber' came from the Ancient Greeks. (yes, Berbers go back a long time) If the Greeks did not meet them at the rich but supposedly 'empty' Mediterranean coast, then the Greeks for some reason or another must have been very very eager to wander off into the risky and unrewarding desert where they were lucky enough to bump into Berbers and only then gave them their name. Sure, all pure "logic".</p>
<p>But seriously now. Berbers were always there and formed the overwhelming majority. During the 7th century they were Arabized. The difference today between what is called 'Berber' and 'Arab' today is <i>only</i> a difference in culture, language and location. It is not a difference in biological descent. If you would want to look at biological descent in an honoust way, then you see that 90%+ is biological Berber and 10%- is biological Arab. An uninteresting, irrelevant and smelly piece of information, as it is all forced out in the context of (fighting) racism. It is the undemocratic government (the army in Algeria and the monarch in Marocco) that promotes these racist myths, that continually devides these people into Berber and Arab so the people will not join forces together against the undemocratic rulers.</p>
<p>There is no shame in being Berber. There is no shame in being Arab. But there should be shame in spreading racist rubbish. The anonymous user should be blocked for continually trying to add such a piece of unscientific, untrue, racist, and unwikipedian rubbish.</p>

<p>Isnt it racist to force ARABS to be BERBERS?You are forcing me to be of your(if you are berber,i guess you are) ethnicty?WHY that?God leave me alone,be a berber and let me be what i want for as long i dont force you to be an Arab,you are the only one racist...admit it,you re ful of hatred against us just because we are Arabs,is that our fault if arab leaders mistreat berbers?lol you are not a victim,so dont complain,all algerians are victims of arab leaders,arabs are mistrated as well but you don't mention it,u just mention u r a "martyr" lol lol.</p>
<p>Your post is so long,you seem mad at me.Your are making fun of my bad English lol lol,so what?My sayings were still proven by the sources that i posted.You are not proving you're a civilised personinsulting me and calling names,it is not a chat room by the way...WHY WOULD YOU CALL ME A RACIST?So let's force the white europeans to be africans,i doubt they would be happy if anyone would force them to be called BLACK NIGERIANS when they know they are white skinned and of european ancestry,so *** you and don't force me to be what i am not,poor dumbass.I am not of Berber descent,I am Arab and we came from ARABIA (our ancestors&#160;;) ),deal with it.Are you that mad?You are so jealous juste because i have an Arab heritage lo lol lol...Go tell a kabyle we are Arabized Berber he would laugh at you =)) =)) =))</p>
<p>"Saying that "Algerians are childen of Arab tribes" which travelled there during the 7th century is a myth, a physical impossibility, a phantasy. Wandering Arab tribes could have never spread that fast over such a large area."</p>
<p>that is not what the American and Algerian governements tell...</p>
<p>that is not what historians tell,by the way it is not a myth,wikipedia tells most Algerians are of Middle eastern ancestry according to the genetic tests,are you that mad? =)) =)) Why didn't the Arabs arabise the Iranians and the Pakistaneses then?lol lol,only Berbers,why only them?stop dreaming...</p>
<p>you told 10%?10% of Arab blood is largely enough to be an Arab&#160;;) You are jealous and frustrated because we are all proud of being Arabs and are a majority,you're mad lol,you are a minority and try to be a majority?We are the majority so deal with it,and we won't talk TAMAZIGH,we ll talk Arabic for as long as we live&#160;;)</p>
<p>You told it isn't a shame being Berber?No it is not,but it would be a shame to deny my Arabness to become an other man,it would be shame to forget i am an Arab,you are the only one racist forcing me to be a Berber,why do you ever care?What is your problem?We are what we wanna be,if you like being berber,be it and leave us alone GOD YOU ARE SO FUNNY telling i am a racist,i never told anything about the Berber minority,you told many bad things about us,u want to force us to be berbers,would you like me to force u to be ARAB?You dont like when historians tell u r from yemen,so why do u force me to admit your lies about us?So what are you if you are not of middle eastern ancestry?You just look all like Arabs,and by the way u look like middle eastern Arabs physically,it is imposibble to distinct you..onlt your language is different;so by the way what can u tell about the article MAGHREB of wikipedia,it tells ALGERIANS are mostly of middle eastern ancetry so it means even berbers are from middle east?OH maybe they are europeans,because they are blue eyed lol lol,blue eyed scandinavians lol.If they like being scandinavians it is their life,but me i wanna be a semite dark haired and brown eyed&#160;;)</p>
<p>"Though Maghreb culture as well as its people have both African and Middle Eastern roots, most Maghrebis are either Arabic- or Berber-speaking Muslims of predominantly Middle Eastern ancestry, while a few are of predominantly African ancestry, and the corsairs brought in significant amounts of French, Italian, Spanish, and Turkish ancestry in the big coastal cities. " &lt;===== <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maghreb.html" title="Maghreb">maghreb</a></p>
<p>Berbers are from Middle east according wikipedia&#160;;)</p>
<p>AGAIN:Algeria is mostly Arabs and we are proud of coming from ARABIA,it is our country as it is yours,but we are still a majority,if you want us to respect you,respect us and don't force us to be BERBER while we are not.Your hatred against us won't solve anything,you should talk as a civilised person instead to insult me as an immature freak&#160;;)</p>
<p>and let me tell you,believe me or not but i have talked to a chaoui (berbers) 1 month ago telling him we were most of berber descent to see his opinion,he told "but the most are from saoudi arabia" lol lol&#160;:)</p>
<p>Undemocratic maghrebi leaders?I agree,just like french governement and american governement are ruled by nazis undemocratic leaders,their economies are based on killing hundreds of thousands of babies and pillaging the other nations&#160;;)</p>

<dd>Things don't always correspond to language. The actual number of Arabs from Arabia was very small. They managed to spread the usage of Arabic through colonization and setting up cities away from older established towns, not unlike the various Alexandrias set-up by Alexander and the later Greco-Macedonians to keep the empire together. Genetic studies back that the majority of people from North Africa are mostly of Berber stock with variations. There is a large Phoenician genetic trail in Tunisia due to the Carthaginians, but it still amounts to only 1/5 of the population. People claim a lot of ancestries all over the world, but it doesn't really make them true and can't be given credence in an encyclopedia. There are Nigerians who claim to be descended from Muhammad for example, and hey maybe that happened, but it's not very likely. The historical record backs only a small number of Arabs in North Africa who did grow and expand and contribute to the local population, but probably in a way similar to the contribution of the Phoenicians. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 21:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The contribution of Arabs were the most important,it was not only a military occupation as the ROMAN/VANDAL/TURKISH and FRENCH RULES.Many Arabs migrated from Arabia into North Africa.Since i have official sources from the US governement to prove my point,i don't need to argue more...(you can notice in these source the word ARAB is always the first,it probably means that ARAB contribution wasn't as minor as you tell)</p>

<p>I think we don't need to debate about the racial origin of Algerians,as we don't need to tell Algerians are of Berber origin.The correct sentence is "80% of Algerians are Arabs,20% are Berbers",noone cares about their ethnic origin since they consider themselves as Arabs.Being Arab is not necessarilly about ethnicity,Sudanese are Africans,most of them consider themselves as ARABS.Somalis and Djibouti people are AFRICANS and many of them consider themselves as Arabs.Americans don't consider themselves as EUROPEANS al though they are of EUROPEAN ANCESTRY.tape ARABS in wikipedia,it has many meanings,you can be Arab without being ethnically ARAB.</p>
<p>Genetic studies are not considered as a credible source in Algeria or in France,it is considered as racist and SOUNDS nazi.I wonder how anyone can indentify Berber genes,it sounds silly considering that all humans have 99,9% of similar genes.Are you going to tell there are several human races too?bY the way IF WE FOLLOW THE RACE,wikipedia tells MOST MAGHREBIS (Arabs and Berbers) are of Middle Eastern ancestry (tape maghreb) according to some genetic studies,so if we took your logic we wouldn't need to specify "Berber origin",we can trace their origin back writting "MIDDLE EASTERN stock"...</p>
<p>Nigerians who claim that they are descendand of Mohamed are not considered as Arabs by the so called ARABS,plus they are black people while we are semitic people (ethnically speaking)...</p>

<dd>new source: "The ancestors of the Algerian Arab originated in the Arabian Desert. From there, they gradually immigrated into northern Africa. Over the centuries, the Arabs have become somewhat intermingled with the Berbers, and this has influenced their way of life. Nevertheless, the two groups have remained distinct." <a href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=AG&amp;rop3=100226" class="external free" title="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=AG&amp;rop3=100226" rel="nofollow">http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=AG&amp;rop3=100226</a></dd>
