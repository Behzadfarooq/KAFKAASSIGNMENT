<p>Concerning Sentence: <i>Both Under Secretary Welles and Sayre testified that delivering the classifed documents to a foreign power would enable them to break America's most secret codes.[13]</i></p>
<p>1st Citation: Testimony of Francis B. Sayre and Sumner Welles, House Un-American Activities Committee, Washington D.C., 7 December 1948;</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor nobs cites Congressional testimony as source. This testimony turns out to be sealed and private, yet he fails to account for this discrepancy.</li>
<li>Editor nobs provides no known public source where one can find the contents of a transcript</li>
<li>Editor nobs provides no known secondary source that would characterize Sayre's Congressional testimony as such</li>
</ul>
<p>When questioned nobs makes this statement</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Welles, Sumner &amp; Purifeouy testimony is in the HUAC record, 7 December 1948. Both Welles &amp; Sumner testified that the four foot high stack of documents would enable a foreign government to decipher "the most secret codes" (there was no CIA or OSS in 1938; State Department would be using what would be considered "the most secret codes" at that time). Undersecretary Sayre testified,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sayre: ...not only because of the substance of the cables, but because some of them were in the highly confidential codes; ... And for these telegrams to get out at the time they did meant that other governments could crack our codes and that, I think, is indescribably horrible.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Rankin: In other words, if they got the documents, if they were absolutely insignificant from the point of view of international importance, they could crack the codes without trouble.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sayre: The other point is that some of the these cables reveal sources from which information was obtained, sources planted in foreign countries. Now you make a cable of this kind known, you cut off that source of information from another country, and you kill what you have been working on for years.</dd>

<dd>Little info: "After Far and Wide Reed was virtually banned by the establishment publishers and booksellers..."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Reed attributes the some of the words to Sayre (in an unidentified and undated press conference), but explictly states the contents of Sayre's testimony were private and unknown</li>
<li>There is no other known source connecting those words to Sayre</li>
<li>Reed is nevertheless uncited by the editor who falsely attributes it as a source in the Congressional Record, presumably to bolster its dubious credibility and hid its true origins.</li>
<li>Editor nobs refuses to acknowledge mistake, delibrately reinserts false citation information and the above dubious sentence in wiki multiple times without bothering to convince others of its veracity.</li>
</ul>
<p>2nd Citation: Donald H.J. Hermann, Deception and Betrayal: The Tragedy of Alger Hiss, Paper delivered to the Chicago Literary Club, November 14, 2005; " The statute of limitations for espionage of ten years, protected Hiss against the charge of having passed secret material from State Department files to Chambers, of having placed in the hands of agents of the Soviet Union documents which enabled the Soviet Union to break important secret codes used by the United States." - <i>This bit is completely from the author, with no reference or citation to any physical evidence or detective work by others. It is simply stated as fact by the author with no support.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Editor nobs is told that paper says nothing about Sayre and his relation to the above contested sentence. Silence prevails reply</li>
<li>Editor nobs never explains how paper proves that Sayre actually testified to the what the contested sentence implies</li>
<li>Editor nobs characterizes the paper as cutting edge research. Mr Hermann is a lawyer who dedicates his paper to everything but his actual professional expertise. Psychoanalysis, radical quotes on intelligence and cyprotgraphy are not even bolstered in the article by statements from people in the field. There is no evidence of independent research by the author; Hermann simply regurgitates well-known arguments of Hiss detractors with passing references to their orginal authors. There is no bibliography, no formal citations used by Hermman. The majority of the article concerns Alger Hiss's percieved psychological defects that supposedly turned him to the Soviets, in the authors view of course.</li>
<li>Editor nobs' citation again fails to support the statement, though it is at least referring to the correct document this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestion by Complaintent: Editor nobs admit his error and simply move on towards being a constructive contributer again instead of a vandal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let me appologize, I have been distracted by another case &amp; this article has had low priority, especially given the confusing postings by an anonymous editor &amp; unregistered user, who may presumably be the same user. I will cite from a secondary source today, a book that was republished in at least four editions between 1949 and 1965, and I may have immediate access to at least four editions, and will give priority to it today. It's simply a matter of comparing if the so-called disputed language in all editions is intact, or relatively intact. it is a contemporaneous account, by a journbalist who attended hearings. My appologies, by my habits of application of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_method.html" title="Historical method">historical method</a> require such a meticulous approach. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 18:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>To help clarify the blindly obvious, I am indeed User|168.122.236.22. I even manually wrote in timoteo at the bottom for one of my unlogged entries. A saner, rational mind may have recognized this, but let me not dare dream for sanity and honesty in this discussion. As for snark above, it is not my fault that your Sayre "work" reeks of unprofessionalism, false scholarship, and as this battle drags, quite possibly intentional <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_dishonesty.html" title="Intellectual dishonesty">intellectual dishonesty</a>. It has taken you this long to even provide the pages and authors of your supposed "source" that you somehow quoted ("the most secret codes" ha ha) without remembering that info, though Douglass Reed appears to be closer and closer to the truth everyday. I have only complained about your, ahem, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_method.html" title="Historical method">historical method</a> or -should it be spoken truefully, complete lack thereof, nothing more. If you are so ashamed of your "contributions" that you view a simple compilation as a personal attack, then I will be more than happy to remove your sins from this article.

</ul>
<p>Comments and Suggestions? - Timoteo III</p>
<dl>
<dd>In no way can they be considered quotes from the same man; the Commission Report is unanimous language voted upon by a bi-partisan statutory commission mandated by law to publish findings. The direct Moynihan quote is a personal eyewitness account of the commission proceeedings, and spoken unrestrained by the need for compromise language. The above proposal is simply another effort to bury facts and parse old arguements. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 02:27, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yet I fail to see where the quotes differ in actual content rather than, as you say, language. I am not suggesting a partisan slant, I am suggesting a redudancy that fails to add further information. It is silly to reiterate Moynihan once personally and again from committee if he's saying the same thing. If you think the Commission quote is better, then keep that instead. However, the point of the Committee was explicit: to determine whether the secrecy of government agencies was excessive and harmful, and to suggest reform. The mission of the Committee was NOT to determine the guilt of Mr Alger Hiss, it is used as a tangential example, with implict assumptions that he was a spy by Mr Moynihan's analysis. If the committee was never charged with determining the guilt or innocent of Alger Hiss, then no debate has occured. And disregarding numero 3 bullet, what do you think of #1 and #2? - Timoteo III</dd>

Moynihan believes Hiss was a spy and good for him, but the Moynihan and his Committee don't add any additional information; it's a judgment by Moynihan repeated once again for drama, not substance. - Timoteo III</dd>

<dd>My source is of course the actual published report of the Government Secrecy Commssion, as opposed to an imaginary one. You are grossly twisting the context of the sentences to make it "appear" that this is an authoritative judgment by the US Government concerning Alger Hiss's guilt as ALES, when that couldn't be further from the truth. Nothing in the report states that the mission, the purpose, the raison d'etre of the committee was to explore and determine the guilt of Alger Hiss in any capacity, not even tangentially or remotely. This is a sentence buried in an appendix, authored by God knows who (probably Mr M since its his commitee and he already has that bias from his quote). It offers no surprising evidence for Alger = ALES case that isnt available in this wiki already, its drama designed to repeat someone's opinion without much discussion of the more important "why so".--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimoteo_III_67e3.html" title="User:Timoteo III">Timoteo III</a> 06:03, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I expanded this article a little, based on my own knowledge, but by no means do I claim to adopt all of its conclusions as my own. It's been a while since I first read about the case. When I learned about it in the 1980s, I believed categorically that Hiss was guilty and an elitist traitor along the lines of Kim Philby. Back then I was rather more conservative than now, so I approached it from the Chambers/Nixon angles in <i>Witness</i> and <i>Six Crises</i>. While I haven't completely switched sides, these days I'm dubious. Chambers, if not evil, was definitely not stable. The ongoing revelations about Nixon now exceed anything even Hunter S. Thompson might have dreamed up in the Seventies--as far as I'm concerned, nothing emanating from Nixon can enjoy credibility any longer. The evidence from the former USSR archives is at best inconclusive. I am not completely convinced of Hiss's innocence, and I think it's quite possible that he exercised considerably poor, even reckless judgment, but now I think it more likely than not he was railroaded. --bamjd3d</p>

<dd>I'm not sure Nixon or Chambers have anything to do with Hiss's guilt. If Hiss is guitly he could have done it without their help. it may be just another example of Eastern elitists in the media, academia and government caught in lie with thier pants down and steadfastly refuse to admit it (kinda like <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Still More Hiss</span></h2>
<p>As stated above, I'm no apologist for Alger Hiss. If he did in fact betray his country, whatever his motives, that was wrong and he should have been punished for it. There are some lines one doesn't cross, no matter what one believes. However, believing that as I do, at the same time I do not subscribe to the right-wing notion that anybody with even pronounced leftist, anti-capitalist or anti-"system" views is tantamount to a treasonous Communist. When passing judgment on Hiss (and I do think we have the right to do so), one should always bear the context in mind. It was the Thirties, and today it's easy to forget a) the magnitude of the Depression; b) the fact that the era was actually more freewheeling than the relatively uptight (to use a Sixties word) one of the Fifties. Today, we worry about gas going up twenty or thirty cents (when the real price is actually about the same as in 1980), or whether we can afford a second vacation or whatnot. When the unemployment rate goes up from, say 5.6% to 5.8% we get nervous. Back then, perhaps a third of the population was going hungry; unemployment was approaching 25%, more, if you count part-time work and starvation wages, especially in the South. Combine that with the dustbowl and the sheer duration of it--more than 12 years, for as late as 1941 unemployment was over 15%--and it's understandable why well-educated people like Hiss worried about the state of things and were casting about for alternatives. Many, many people back then looked around and concluded that some form of Socialism was the answer. Racism gave the Communists a great opportunity to exploit. In the Fifties, people were being pilloried for what they had done in the Thirties, and that was really unfair, for the climate of the Thirties was entirely different. (Certainly it would have been another thing altogether to become a Communist in the Fifties). There was no Cold War in theThirties--Hitler was the threat then. And the Soviets seemed--seemed--to be conquering unemployment, eliminating barbarous working conditions and poverty, and so forth. Even if you don't believe in the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_state.html" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a>, it goes much too far to say that anyone who talks about those things is a traitor. In sum, I wouldn't blame Hiss for being involved in a Marxist study group, even clandestinely, but if he did in fact pass documents to the Soviets, that would have been crossing the line, and he no longer would have deserved the confidence of the Government. But merely having leftist or utopian views, no matter how divergent from what was politically correct (!), does not make Hiss an evil Northeast establishment stooge. --bamjd3d</p>

<dd>Interesting comments. Fortunately I wasn't around to recall the scandels of 1948 when this story broke and only know of it from second hand information, and having been reading about it now for 37 years, truthfully I can't claim any proficiency or authority on the subject. I am curious, however, to hear the arguement connecting the dots between unemployment problems of the 1930's with foreign policy activities of men like Hiss, Harry Dexter White, et al, during World War II (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Dexter_White_2544.html" title="Harry Dexter White">Harry Dexter White</a>, for example, being in a supreme position of trust, passing stolen templates to counterfeit American dollars in 1948 about the sametime <a href="../../../s/m/e/SMERSH_922b.html" title="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> was burying Hitler's charred corpse under garbage cans doesnt pass the anti-fascist test). This discussion, especially among Hiss defenders, always comes back to ideological grounds. And it seems the judgement of history is, the various Communist entities these people were associated with were not only un-democratic, but anti-democratic; and the arguement that Hiss and others didnt see it that I beleive is pure fantasy. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">Nobs01</a> 18:46, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not the unemployment problems per se. Again, this needs to be put into a larger context. Remember that all of this was taking place in the wake of the First World War <i>and</i> the Russian Revolution, both of which destroyed the late Victorian Western European order and the concomitant faith in classical liberal progress. In the Twenties and Thirties many intellectuals and elites--naively and foolishly, granted--were so disillusioned and pessimistic that they saw Communism as the wave of the future. Beware the historian's fallacy of imputing to them the knowledge of Stalin, the Great Purges and so forth that we have today. The USSR in the Thirties, it seemed to many in the West, was the wave of the future: it had managed to elude the devastating economic crisis of the West, and its economy was growing at a fantastic rate. Of course, this was attributable to the forced industrialization program, the starvation of millions, terror and so on, phenomena that many turned a blind eye towards. But it's not farfetched to say that men like Hiss honestly believed they were somehow working for, in his words, "a better world," although in hindsight we know that to have been a delusion. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamjd3d_e60e.html" title="User:Bamjd3d">bamjd3d</a>

<dd>Cynically put, one could say Hitler, in his eyes, was working for "a better world" too.

Personally I beleive, that if the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> didnt recieve the help of these people (fellow American citizens), it still would be a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> nation; that essentially is what it is today, a Third World Power with <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapons.html" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a>.

<p>I think some people forget an important point, though. People might have joined the Communist movement in the early 1930s out of idealism, but it wouldn't take long to see how evil Communism was, especially from the inside. When the President of the American Communist Party and his family visited Russia, Stalin kept their child as a hostage in Russia when they returned.</p>

<p>A book review on a personal website is <b>not</b> a Soviet Archive, so having a link to it where one would expect a link to something about Soviet Archives is quite misleading. Where does even this review say that some cryptonyms "come from soviet archives" anyway?</p>
<p>The book and the Gorsky report however, as far as I can tell, do not support what you see to be saying, that these cryptonyms' association with Hiss is corroborated by Soviet archives. The only one they seem to support is the one that you mention last and least, "Leonard" - under "failures" in Gorsky, the title thus making its inclusion rather misleading Unless you explain further, this seems to be mostly naughty original research and illogical reasoning. Maybe it is right there, staring me in the face in the sources you've cited, but I cannot find it, I would not mind being called stupid or lazy if you can do the following:</p>
<p>I would like specific sentences from reasonable sources that say what the article says - that "Soviet archives show Alger Hiss’s known cryptonyms were "Lawyer" [3] ("Advocate" or "Advokat") in the mid-1930s and "Ales" in 1945" . I am sure you know a lot more about this stuff than me. However, you don't seem to be explaining it in a way I or perhaps anyone else, can understand, and as far as I can tell, your references do not say what you want them to say. What you have right now appears to be the statement:/ "Alger Hiss’s known cryptonyms were Lawyer (or Advocate) in the mid-1930s and Ales in 1945." appears as a <b>footnote written by Haynes</b> to notes from Soviet Archives. / (which I assumed came from Venona, at least the first does.) --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 22:50, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The archives Volkogonov searched were: the Archive of the Government of the Russian Federation (Roskomarchiv);the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (successor agency to the KGB); the Russian Ministry of Security; the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Russian Center for the for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Modern History (which houses former Central Party and Comintern archives); the Russian Ministry of Defense and Soviet Army Archives (successor agency to the GRU). To claim he took two days to search this is absurd.</p>
<p>What the man did say was this: "Mr. Hiss has never and nowhere been recruited as an agent of the USSR. Not a single document, and a great amount of material has been studied, substantiates the allegation." In conversation with Lowenthal, he further stated that he could not give a 100% guarentee "that something wasn't destroyed . . . if [Hiss] was a spy I believe positively I would have found a reflection in various files." (New York Times, Oct. 29, 1992)</p>
<p>Then several weeks later later, Volkogonov said that he had "not been properly understood," that if such evidence did exist "there's no guarantee that it was not destroyed, that it was not in other channels." (New York Times, Dec. 7, 1992). But he did not retract his orginal statement, and has not since. In fact, in the 13 years since no such document has ever surfaced, neither it might be added has the name of Whittaker Chambers ever been found in the archives, which is not exactly support for your claims.</p>
<p>What evidence suggests Hiss started working for GRU in 1934? You're simply assuming Ales is Hiss and cramming Venona #1822 where it can't fit. GRU was military intelligence; Hiss was never accused of supplying military intelligence, only State Department material. To not note these problems is dishonest. If Weyl coroborates this, then I suggest you quote him to that fact, instead of merely asserting it.</p>
<p>"Some say he precipitated the Western betrayal of Eastern Europe," Excuse me, but you think this washes? Who may I ask are "some"? You couldn't get away with this in freshman english. And how in God's name could Hiss have "precipitated" anything at Yalta? He was junior to about everybody and had no authority on anything. Hiss did indeed oppose the extra UN seats for the USSR, but you better check the number, I believe they were pushing for less than 15. Hiss played no role in the ultimate outcome of this, and was sorely disappointed that the Soviets got the two they did. You make it seem like he played a role in the USSR gaining the two, which is wrong. Again, who are these "some" who keep saying things? What you should do there is point out that Hiss was always, throughout his State Department career, a conservative on international affairs, solely concerned for American interests. Such as, his strong support for Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>You quote Moynihan's assertion that Ales could only be Hiss, but not Lowethal's carefully reasoned argument to the contrary. Why?</p>
<p>Again, if Weyl testified that Hiss was what Chambers said he was, then quote him to the effect, then quote the rebuttal.</p>

<dd><b>Yes, and what are you exactly trying to say?? The cable states that Ales was the head of a small group, as the head of the group HE would produce the material, whether he swiped it himself or not. Hiss was accused of stealing State Department materials, and only that, never military. Ales specialized in Military, and only rarely State. The GRU was not very interested in State. The man who accused Hiss, and was allegedly his one and only courier to the Party, Whittaker Chambers, never once accused Hiss on military materials. Nor did the FBI, nor was it raised it either of the two trials. Now, are you trying to go beyond the facts of the case, and effectively create suppositions that something might've happened that no one has ever mentioned before?! Are we talking Alice in Wonderland here, or what? This of course is the problem in trying to prove a negative, even when the facts presented are countered, the conspiratorial mind always finds another angle, no matter what. That is why, since the days of the Magna Carta, we've evolved to a system where the accused stands innocent until the prosecution can prove the case beyond a shadow of doubt. Hiss was tried for perjury, but efffectively ever since, the charge has been espionage, too bad he never gets the same assumptions afforded any common criminal in the dock,--GrifGrifross 20:11, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</b>

<p>Some of the more obvious problems with the Lowenthal material:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Ales was said in the message to have been active for 11 years, 1935 through the date of the message, 1945; Alger Hiss was accused of spying in the mid-30's and <b>not later than 1938</b>.
<ul>
<li>(1934-1945 fits Hiss)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>How may I ask does this work? No one has ever accused Hiss of being a spy from 1934 to 1945, not even Chambers or Joe McCarthy. I beleive the idea is to report history, not make it up as you go along.</b>
<ul>
<li>Why are we having this discussion if "no one ever accused Hiss of being a spy from 1934 to 1945"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whittaker Chambers knowledge only went up <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>; as stated, this clearly is a deliberate distortion of the evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Perhaps so, but are you now arguing that Hiss continued to be a spy after (if anyone is to believe Chambers) Chambers threatened to his face to expose him, went to the gov't and denounced him. There are not even allegations by anyone that Hiss was a spy through 1945, not even by his worst enemies.</b>
<ul>
<li>As Bentley was told, "no one ever leaves this service".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>"Ales was said to be the leader of a small group of espionage agents; Hiss was accused of having acted alone, aside from his wife as a typist and Chambers as courier.
<ul>
<li>Again, the decrypt reads "small group of relatives"; the "was accused" again is a reference to Chambers, not Venona material</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Fine put in "small group of relatives," but seeing as the entire case against Hiss rests on Chamber's accusations and none other, then it might behoove one to compare Chamber's allegations with the description of Ales, as that is who Hiss is accused of being.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Ales was a GRU (military intelligence) agent who obtained military intelligence, and only rarely provided State Department material; Alger <b>Hiss was accused of obtaining only non-military information and the papers used against him were non-military State Department materials</b> that he allegedly produced on a regular basis.

<p>This page has a ridiculiously hardline conservative bias against Alger Hiss, which seems be the result of a one-man crusade by a certain poster. "Incontrovertible evidence," my ass. The point of Wikipedia is to present the strengths and weakness of BOTH sides of the agrument, and then let the reader decide for himself. Hiding the opposition and relevant counterpoints (see <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/" class="external free" title="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/" rel="nofollow">http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/</a> for examples) is inappropriate.

<dl>
<dd>It should be noted, some of the scholarly discussion groups have now implemented bans against "All Hiss, All the Time", being that the question is settled, yet the two or three defenders keep attempting to parse each new piece of information. Discussion has moved on to who was agent Zamistal; KWANT (QUANTUM) appears to be <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Pontecorvo_661c.html" title="Bruno Pontecorvo">Bruno Pontecorvo</a>, and Leas theory on Fogel-Pers also is being discussed. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 20:30, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify, I was the one who implemented the new format. I believe Upland added some sections afterwords. Anyway, back to your main point. First of all Nobs, this is a page about Alger Hiss and the man entire; naturally it should present evidence of judicial misconduct if it demonstrates the possiblity of a false conviction on perjury. Whether or not Alger was a spy, Nixon bent and in some cases broke the law to wrangle out a conviction. The trial was clearly dirty. Since the perjury charges directly arose from the espionage allegations, innocence in the first suggests innocence in the second. Please do not complain about a disscusion of facts simply because they do not support your predetermined conclusions--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimoteo_III_67e3.html" title="User:Timoteo III">Timoteo III</a> 00:04, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Give me a source page number &amp; citation from a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> document that Richard Nixon, member of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Branch_e232.html" title="Legislative Branch">Legislative Branch</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional.html" title="Constitutional">constitutionally</a> had the power to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosecute.html" title="Prosecute">prosecute</a> anyone, a power reserved solely to the <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_Branch_c8be.html" title="Executive Branch">Executive Branch</a>.

<dd>Now, until you can explain this unconstitutional phenomenon, (including the fact that the Executive Branch at the time itself was controlled by a Party in opposition to the Party that Nixon belonged to), I'll assume the statement is <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>.

<p>Your reading comprehension leaves much to be desired. I missed the part where I said Nixon was the prosecutor instead of Tom Murphy, but who can resist a good <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> in the absense of real rebuttal? Perhaps you believe Nixon had nothing to do with the outcome of the trial? Funny, because Nixon doesn't seem to have gotten that memo.</p>
<p>"We won the Hiss case in the papers"</p>
<p>"I had Hiss convicted before he got to the grand jury....I no longer have the energy, [but we need] a son of a bitch who will work his butt off and do it dishonorably" See also the "Nixon-Hiss Seesaw" at CrimeLibrary</p>
<p>Wow! It's almost like Nixon himself believed he got Alger Hiss convicted! Crazy!</p>
<p>In all honesty Nob, I am going to assume you have no sane objections so we can stop this nonsense now - Timoteo III</p>

<dd>So what's the point? The U.S. Justice Department under President Truman was corrupt? or just plain incompetent? I'm having trouble following this reasoning. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 19:26, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll explain it very slowly for you. Most of the evidence used to convict Hiss came from the work of Nixon and his subcommittee. The role of the prosection is to prosecute when there is evidence of wrongdoing, and that is what Murphy did. Information from the FBI files, the later Watergate scandals, and other sources cast doubt on the actual veracity of evidence that was passed to the prosecution. If the evidence was wrong, then the conviction was wrong and thus the case for Hiss's innocence is bolstered. QED. I am not asking you to agree with the conclusion, but to merely allow a fair representation of the other sides' arguement. I for one think most of the arguments you provide are ridiculious, but I at least allow them to stand to represent the thinking of people like you&#160;:)--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimoteo_III_67e3.html" title="User:Timoteo III">Timoteo III</a> 23:25, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I also want to talk about the spat of recent edits you've been making to the article. I'm concerned that you have missed the entire point of the reformat. Practically every single one of your edits is an attempt to fanatically paint Hiss as an evil pinko spy, which is all well and good IF YOU DO IT IN THE SECTION I SPECIFICALLY OUTLINED FOR YOU. Any discussion of whether or not Hiss was a spy will regress into POV wankery, which is why it needs to be isolated and identified as such in the last two sections. If you want to launch a point againt against Hiss, do it there, where it belongs. The other posters and I have worked hard to keep the Wiki neutral, so please be a constructive editor instead a deunce.--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimoteo_III_67e3.html" title="User:Timoteo III">Timoteo III</a> 23:25, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, truthfully, the trial business &amp; associated press coverage ingterests me very little, as does Nixon's relationship to it also. Personally, my interest in Alger Hiss relates to the period of time he was in government service (and, as published reports now conclude, Soviet service). <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 17:28, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sayre and Cash-for-Documents</span></h2>
<p>A place to discuss the "contributions" from our most prolific poster.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Both Under Secretary Welles and Sayre..." I have not yet read a single book about Hiss that claims the Baltimore Documents/Pumpkin Papers had anything to do with cryptography codes. This is delibrately misleading if it is not outright false to begin with, being completely unsourced.</li>
<li>"cash-for-documents" ==&gt; "cash-for-publication right's" This is goes against the author's wording and the point being made; the high $$$ attached to finding the right "facts." The rewording isnt even true as the author only gained access, the memos were never published and made available to other historians. I may move it to the other section however as misc critisism. - Timoteo III</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Cash-for-documents is false and misleading; no documents were allowed to be removed or photographed from the Archive.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that's flipped flopped. "publication right's" obviously implies Random House would attempt to publish the contents of archives, which is not true as we know. cash-for documents is concise and true to the author, and the context of the wording makes it obvious what happened, IMO. - Timoteo III</p>

<dd>The Welles, Sumner &amp; Purifeouy testimony is in the HUAC record, 7 December 1948. Both Welles &amp; Sumner testified that the four foot high stack of documents would enable a foreign government to decipher "the most secret codes" (there was no CIA or OSS in 1938; State Department would be using what would be considered "the most secret codes" at that time). Undersecretary Sayre testified,</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sayre: ...not only because of the substance of the cables, but because some of them were in the highly confidential codes; ... And for these telegrams to get out at the time they did meant that other governments could crack our codes and that, I think, is indescribably horrible.</dd>

<dd>Sayre: The other point is that some of the these cables reveal sources from which information was obtained, sources planted in foreign countries.

This seems to be from in fact off-the-cuff remarks at an impromtu press conference, and you seem to have arbitarily sliced in some Rankin comments for no apparent reason. Rankin is one of the more infamous figures of HUAC, whom the 'great' Allen Weinstein described as a blatant racist, "who spiked most hearings with Negrophobic, anti-Catholic, and anti-Semitic tirades…." This, along with the other historical inaccuracies I've pointed out, means this bit has got to go.</b> - Timoteo III</dd>

<dd>Nobs, you have gotten the dialogue, the event, the date completetly wrong. You have never proven that Sayre said this and where he did so (<b>you gave an obviously false citation to the HUAC committee instead</b>). Your source, if you ever even had one, must be wrong as well. You have not demonstrated a mainstream source that contains the contents of Sayre's private testimony. I suspect one does not exist. Even the anti-Zionist crackpot directly contradicted most of what you wrote above. If this is the kind of "evidence" you have to marshall against Hiss, you must not even believe in your own side. - Timoteo III</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We are in fact talking about the Pumpkin/Baltimore Papers, correct? First off, please tell me where you found the testimony as I googled both Sayre and his actual wording, and came up with nothing save a Douglas Reed site (which for obvious reasons is a bit untrustworthy - I would prefer something much more mainstream, and not linked to Zionist world conspiracy theorists.) Let us assume though that Sayre and Rankin did say this. The important question would be is it actually true? No authors, and I'm including the Hiss detractors that I know of, ever allege to my knowledge that the Baltimore Documents would be crytography code breakers. We know now that the documents were exaggerated in importance during the trial, and the actual contents were in fact quite mundane trade regulations. So why deliberately imply what is easily disproven with modern day evidence? - Timoteo III</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Sayre, Welles &amp; Purifouy testimony was given 7 December 1948 in a HUAC hearing. What they testify to is, that despite the contents of the messages, the fact that Soviets could intercept a coded version, then had the decoded version, would provide the key to breaking a cipher code.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was actually asking about the source where you yourself found the transcipt (I know what the actual event being transcribed was; it's not helping me find the transcript), since I couldnt' find a copy anywhere online. Is a copy available from a book?</p>
<p>The point is neither Sayre and Welles are experts on cryptography and it would seem that CIA (later), NSA, FBI (who are all nearly uniformly against Hiss) would have further substantiated this idea if it had merit, since they know intelligence and codes better than anybody else. Mr Moniyhan never writes about this&#160;:). I think it would be a sorry state of affairs if any low-level secret document could be stolen and thus break a whole system of encryption. Simple transposition cryptography, the kind used by Caesar, could of course easily be broken if you had the orginal and the encryption. But in this time, machines were used to generate the keys and encrypt the messages. Having one key particular to a document would not work as the same key to another document. Different levels of documents would probably have completely different algorithms on the top as well. And this is all assuming that the Soviets had their own version of the VENONA project to get the encryptions in the first place, which I don't think ever happened. - Timoteo III</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ralph de Toledano and Victor Lasky, <i>Seeds of Treason</i>, Los Angeles, Western Islands, 1965 references Welles, Sayre &amp; Purifouy testimony; also, I believe Weinstein's <i>Perjury</i> does also, and other sources. I appologize I haven't had time to bring more evidence in. As to their "expertise", pardon me for saying so, but criticizing them seems to be just original research speculation, and U.S. government use of ciphers and classified materials in the 1930s really was not very sophisticated, nor does it seem to be even much of a priority or concern, which is a factor that allowed for the wholesale infiltration that took place. Looking back, it easy to impose a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> view of espionage and tradecraft on American practices, which really didn't become a vital concern either among Washington policy makers, legislators, or the public, until after the 1947 passage of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_Act_cf39.html" title="National Security Act">National Security Act</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 17:09, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is not "orginal research" to point out that these people have zero background in intelligence or cyptrography, something that might be important if you're trying to posture them as words of authority on code-breaking. Nixon in his hyperboles made the Pumpkin papers seem akin to the secret to the atomic bomb, and it was only later we found out how pathetically benign the contents were (Thank you Freedom of Information act.) The point is there needs to be some sort historical backup to show that this testimony was in fact believable, because plenty of people attested to things (Nixon) that didn't hold up to the light of day with modern evidence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine</a> is an example of cyptography tech that was widely available to both government and commericial sectors in the early 1920s!

<dd>Au contraire, mon frere. In citing Enigma, I demonstrated that the State Department would have had to been lagging behind encyrption technology that was already decades old by the 1930's. In citing Black Chamber, you demonstrated that you don't read your own links. Black Chamber was a cryptanalytic outfit, meaning that its raison d'etre was to break other countries codes, not fiddle with America's. The founder Herbert Yardly had earlier written the <i>Solution of American Diplomatic Codes</i>, which profoundly impacted American cyprtograpgy and led to many improvements. But this was in 1917, far from where we are concerned. Black Chamber shut down in 1929 (off by two years), primarily because Stiminson did not think it was 'gentlemanly' to read the secrets of neutral nations like Japan. He did not, to my knowledge, decide to roll back the United States own encyrption technology by decades like you seem to suggest. That would be rather insane. Not believing in snooping is far different from not believing in the merits of confidentiality. - Timoteo III</dd>

<dd>Half right and half wrong. Enigma was not shared technology. It was a huge advance by the Germans, nevertheless it was broken by Brits with the help of Polish refugees after the War started (post 1939), again demonstrating the low priority the US put on both Intelligence, intelligence technology, and counterintelligence circa 1938. As to the Black Chamber, yes Wiki says 1929; my off hand memory says 1927. I don't know which is correct.

<dd>Well that's not true at all. The Enigma machine was not a state secret. It was commericially available during the Wiemer republic and was adopted by a number of nations besides Germany. Enigma was a specific variant of electro-mechanical rotor machines, which were independently invented by a number of people, including an American, a Dutchman, a Swede, and of course a German, all around 1917. Enigma is much more famous than either American or British rotor machines simply because it was actually cracked, whereas the Allies' tech was not. The Germans actually added a number of convienence features to Enigma that made the rotor settings much more predictable, hardly an 'advance' in tech. I'm still not sure why you believe Americans were drooling incompetents in cyptography in the 1930s. America has more often than not been on the winning side of the encyrption wars from the 20th century onward. - Timoteo III</dd>

<p>Note: I moved the last sentence comment down to the Gorsky section in the earlier editions, because it had nothing to do with the Sayre debate and was actually a continuation of that Gorsky memo debate. Nobs was being a little lazy in lumping the two issues together, and I wanted to show the memo where it would be useful. No problems stated. Days later, nobs screamed vandalism. I recommend some deep breaths before you start hurling groundless insults at me, good sir. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimoteo_III_67e3.html" title="User:Timoteo III">Timoteo III</a> 03:47, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This quote,

<p>the first sentence might imply it came down to a court verdict. Point duly noted. Fixed sentence. - Timoteo III</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vassiliev</span></h2>
<p>"The Rosenbergs, Theodore Hall and Alger Hiss did spy for the Soviets, and I saw their real names in the documents, their code names, a lot of documents about that. How you judge them is up to you. To me they're heroes."[14]</p>
<p>Let me deconstruct this quote. Vassilev believes Rosenbergs, Theodore Hall and Alger Hiss were spies. He saw documents, and "like, their names, man, their names". And then he tells us how much he loves those wascally spies. La-dee-frickin-da. We already know what Vassilev believes about Hiss. We already know about those documents. This quote is vapid and void of anything informative. And more importantly, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CRITIQUE OF CRITICS. I make these sections for a reason, nobs. - Timoteo III</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the hit job on Weinstein &amp; Vassiliev is obvious <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>, ignoring the balance the two men brought to their investigation. Facts are, as properly cited, Vassiliev is not motivated to smear Hiss, on the contrary, Vassiliev views Hiss as a hero for his service to the Soviet Union. This is an extremely relevent <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> point. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 19:50, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's a non sequitur quote that has nothing to do with anything. Where exactly does the section try to surmise the motives of either Weinstein or Vassiliev? It only illustrates the irrefutable facts that point to the problems in their scholarship. <b>You are laboring under the false impression that merely because the section tries to represent the facts supporting a particular POV, it is somehow POV itself</b>. Under that philosophy, I could remove the VENONA project and pretty much everything in this article beyond the biographical bit. This wiki tries to fairly represent both sides, and I will remind you once again that you have your own section to attack Hiss from. However, this quote is still meaningless. Both Weinstein and Vassiliev are on the same Hiss-Is-A-Spy boat, and are equally biased. Weinstein may think being a Soviet spy is a bad thing and Vassiliev a good thing, but it doesn't change their willingness to see Hiss as a spy either way. I would still recommend you keep editorializing about the authors' actual motives to yourself, as I do. - Timoteo III</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, your losing me. Facts are Vassiliev thinks Hiss, the Rosenbergs, and a few hundred other Americans, are heroes because of what they did to aid the Soviet Union.

<dd>Let me employ a metaphor for how several of your arguments appear to me. You are like a prosecutor in a murder trial who hems and haws about the "smoking gun", and then produces a banana as Exhibit A. I honestly fail to see how the quote supports anything you wrote about. I honestly fail to see how your reply addressed anything I wrote above. <b>Now if I was a cynic, I might think that you don't have any justification for this quote, and it's merely a driveby throw-away line designed to put pathos hatred on Alger Hiss vis-a-vis the references to other notorious Americans through Mr. Vassiliev's words</b>.

<dd>(1) Your idea of "balance" lies in the fact that Weinstein is an American and Vassiliev is a Russian &amp; former Soviet</dd>
<dd>(2) This "balance" does not excuse shoddy scholarship</dd>
<dd>(3) This "balance" does not explain why Weinstein was sued by his own sources, and forced to apologize and pay up</dd>
<dd>(4) This "balance" does not make it okay to use uncheckable sources</dd>
<dd>(5) This "balance" does not mean Vassiliev was any less eager to "prove" Hiss's guilt than the next Hiss detractor (He sounds postively giddy in fact)</dd>
<dd>(6) This "balance" is not one of opposing schools of thought, but the same (Hiss = spy) with arbitrary differences</dd>

He's actually trying to make it sound like the Pumpkins Paper definitely did let the USSR break America's most secret codes, not even using an empty conjecture anymore! Something where a normal person, including Allen Weinstien, would have actually then citated the juicy details, because obviously if you going to turn history on its head it's helpful to have some proof. Hermann must be a God. He does not even bother with <b>fake citations</b> like you, and leaves totally up to us readers to divine what magic elf told him this little story. Actually there are no surprises here. Hermann seems to have mostly rehashed old conservatives arguments for his "research", and probably relied solely on Nixon's hyperboles to determine the significance of the Pumpkin Papers. At least he has the wherewithal to hid the paper in Chicago Literary Society, the logical place for Cold War revisionism.

The answer here would be no. The chain of dialogue is so long that we don't know for certain what the French Intelligence actually believed, and not even hint of what sort of evidence led them to believe it. Furthermore, Bullit is closely associated with the excesses of the anti-Communist movement and the rise of McCarthyism, hardly the font of untainted information. He defamed a great many people (esp. New Dealers) besides Hiss, some of which turned out to be innocent, and yet nevertheless had their lives ruined (quick search reveals one Lattimore). He is noted for personally ruining the career of Welles by doggedly trying to expose his homosexuality. FDR viewed him in such high esteem that he said: "Bill Bullitt, you have defamed the name of a man who toiled for his fellow men, and you can go to hell.' And that's what I tell you to do now."

<p>Mon dieu! Bullitt is not a Frenchman! Bullit is not Edouard Daladier! Bullit is not the French Intelligence Angency! Bullit is a American whose conduct is questionable, and who is a bit of a human turd in FDR's view. You're citing Bullit as if he were the French intelligence agency giving a direct statement about Hiss. That is an American pretending to be a French source.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">digression on Bullitt</span></h3>
<p>Not to get sidetracked into <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moot.html" title="Moot">moot</a> arguements, but this phrase, "human turd in FDR's view", may reveal <b>prejudicial research methods</b>. "Bullitt was not the source of the information". Bullitt was doing his job, as required. An attack on Bullitt hardly seems appropriate here, unless you are suggesting French Intelligence relayed the information to Bullitt, and Bullitt should have kept quiet about it. And let's analyze that further: Daladier, a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_Government_54d1.html" title="Head of Government">Head of Government</a>, was Bullitt's source. A <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_Government_54d1.html" title="Head of Government">Head of Government</a>, at least in most objective observers estimation, is most probably a more authoritve source of information than some lowly head of a bureau, department, or employee in a bureau or department. It may be tempting to pursue a moot line of reasoning like this, to analyze these arguements and objections this anonymous poster puts forward, but I believe I've probably pursued it too far already. Suffice it to say, these lenghty objections <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> are full of this asserted <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> reasoning, and are often not worth the 10 or 20 seconds of time to puruse them, searching for some valid objection. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 20:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am sad to say nods that I am no longer debating you as editor, as I have lost confidence in your ability to fairly address my concerns instead of patent <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> arguments and buzzwords outside your apparent understanding. Rather, I am only commenting for the more level-minded editors who may come in the future. No one is blind to your staunch POV, and your unwillingness to even concede a mistake in citation, which morphed into that Sayre mess. I believe that Alger Hiss may be guilty, but I don't believe in shoddy scholarship that I see in some of your work. I believe there is a case for both sides, and I am more interested in that then fervently pushing a anti-Hiss view with no concern to veracity or fairness. I intentionally divided this article into separate sections for Alger Hiss's innocence or guilt, in the hope that it would provide a forum to voice both sides without endless edit wars. You remain oblivious to the seperation, and continue to write dubious material in the wrong section, with no relevancy, and in some cases, no truth. I will seek mediation or arbitation, though your user page indicates I may have to wait in line.</p>
<p>As to the gibberish above, I have made my point clear, and highlighted the most ludricious charges for emphasis. Eduard never confirms his alleged words. The French Intelligence never confirms Bullit's statement. In fact, absolutely no one does besides Bullit. Bullit was a clear-as-day McCarthyite (<a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/92.1/br_93.html" class="external free" title="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/92.1/br_93.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/92.1/br_93.html</a>), people who I personally don't venerate as heros. And as someone whose Sayre "quotes" appear exclusively online in a anti-ZION world conspiracist rag, do not impugn my research methods without expecting a laugh.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Gorsky Memo</span></h2>
<p>Also, this is a bit much: "This memo incontrovertibly identifies Alger Hiss as a longtime Soviet agent who worked at the U.S. State Department" Is this memo viewable via the internet or some well-known book? I think you should elaborate on what the memo says instead of just saying its incontrovertible evidence, and leaving it as an article of faith. - Timoteo</p>

<dd>The Gorsky memo lists "Alger Hiss, former employee of the State Department", number 3 behind Whittaker Chamber &amp; Col Bukov. This is a <a href="../../../k/i/_/KI_609c.html" title="KI">KI</a> document. It references the "Karl group" which was a <a href="../../../g/r/u/GRU_d449.html" title="GRU">GRU</a> group. According to Dr. Svetlana Chervonnaya, the current head of the Department of Domestic Policy Studies at the Insitute of USA and Canada in the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Soviet Case Officers listed names chronologically; Chambers was listed #1; Col. Bukov, the GRU Case Officer is #2; Alger Hiss is #3. There are 12 names on the list. The list is entitled "Failures in the U.S.A. (1938-48)". "Leonard", the codename for Hiss on the list, is apparently his GRU code name. Also, it should be noted, Hiss worked with the <i>Illegal</i> GRU line, not the Legal GRU Rezidentura. Dr. Eduard Mark explains how the <a href="../../../m/g/b/MGB_b72a.html" title="MGB">MGB</a> code name "Ales" occurred in Venona traffic; "Ales" was not an <a href="../../../m/g/b/MGB_b72a.html" title="MGB">MGB</a> ( or <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a>, as is what is most often used by modern authors) operative. "Ales", as #1822 Venona states, was "working with the military neighbors", i.e. GRU. <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavel_Fitin_b627.html" title="Pavel Fitin">Pavel Fitin</a> had instructed his operatives to find out quickly whatever they could about the upcoming UN Charter Conference. Hence, a breach of security occured, and lines were crossed, that is to say, an MGB operative openly contacted a GRU agent, Alger Hiss. MGB assigned its own code name for Hiss, i.e. Ales, which differs from the code GRU used. That is how Hiss, i.e. "Ales" appears in Venona traffic, because of a one time breach of security by the MGB.

<dd>Yet it never states Alger was a spy; that jump in logic must be supplied by an already biased reader. Many of the people listed in that memo were simply people of interest to Soviet intelligence, some were definitely not spys or communists. You should not act like merely having a codename is proof of guilt. Both Churchill and Roosevelt were given Soviet codenames, but it doesn't make them spies. Also it should be noted that this note arrived into public domain from a failed libel suit against David Lowenthal by Vassilev. Vassilev gave it to Allen Weinstein as a coauthor for Haunted Wood, but Allen CURIOUSLY never included it in his case against Hiss. The obvious reason is that it tramatically undermines the condition that Alger could be ALES, since Gobsky would have known of this. Far from strenghtening the case against Hiss, it practically exonerates him from being ALES.
<dl>
<dd>(1) I assume you are referring to the Gorsky memo (2) Roosevelt and Churchill are not listed in the Gorsky memo (3) title of the Gorsky memo is "Compromised American sources and networks" (4) "sources and networks" are by definition spies (5) again, "ALES" is a MGB (or KGB) code name (6) Hiss didn't work for KGB (7) Hiss worked for "the military neighbors", i.e. GRU (8) MGB (or KGB) and GRU did not share code names (9) there are other instances of MGB (or KGB) refering to GRU sources, and in some instances, MGB (or KGB) assigning its own KGB code name (10) there are several instances of GRU refering to MGB (or KGB) sources, and in some instances, GRU assigning its own GRU code name (11) the assertion, "Gorsky would have known of this" is original research, as is the speculation regarding the current <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archivist_of_the_United_States_bcd7.html" title="Archivist of the United States">Archivist of the United States</a> not referencing the Gorsky memo in <i>Haunted Wood</i> (12) both MGB (or KGB), and GRU practices are admitted to by various past MGB (or KGB) Case Officers, defectors, and retired high level personal (13) MGB (or KGB), and GRU practices are known among Counterintelligence services worldwide, and been published.</dd>

<dd>Also, it should be noted, that Hiss, as an operative for the GRU <i>Illegal</i> network does not occur in <i>Legal</i> recovered GRU decyrptions. Again, because the lines do not cross between the GRU Rezidentura, which sent coded messages routinely to Moscow, and the GRU <i>Illegal</i> apparatus, operating under deep cover, which had no contact with Official Soviet Missions, where encrypted ciphers communications were sent to Moscow. The courier communications are handled by other means. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 20:00, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Volkogonov</span></h4>
<p>In response to this purported evidence "Volkogonov's Letter to John Lowenthal" <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/volk2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/volk2.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> posted at <i>The Alger Hiss Story</i> (and other associated allusions <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>), let me call to your attention the below text from the actual author of the letter, retrieved from a scholarly discussion board. There is another text were this author further qualifies "sister services", which I will be happy to furnish after this material his handled.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In connection with passing of Prof. J. Lowenthal I recall a curious episode that had taken place a decade ago in autumn of 1992. Mr. Lowenthal had sent a letter to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), asking it to confirm that his client, Alger Hiss, had never been "an agent of the NKVD". New Russian authorities were overeager to demonstrate their openness and the FSB routed the letter to the SVR, where it landed on my desk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"After carefull study of every reference to Mr. A.Hiss in the SVR(KGB-NKVD) archives, and querring sister services, I prepared an answer to Mr. J.Lowenthal that in essence stated that Mr. A.Hiss had never had any relationship with the SVR or its predecessors. I am ready to eat my hat if someone proves the contrary. (I am pretty familiar with VENONA literature as well as with _The Haunted Wood_. Judging by the references, the authors unfortunately had no access to the essential files I worked with. I believe new archive custodians simply did not know where and how to look).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"When I showed the draft of reply to my superiors, I was advised to give that information to General D. Volkogonov, who at that time was an advisor to President Yeltsyn. Virtually in a couple of days a report came from the United States that all major newspaper and TV networks reported my disclaimer, attributing it to Gen. D. Volkogonov and referring to him as a man in charge of the Russian intelligence archives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Recently I have obtained a copy of Gen. D. Volkogonov's letter to Mr. J. Lowenthal in which he describes how laboriously he "studied the archives of the Russian intelligence services" in search of materials pertaining to Mr. A. Hiss. One would have to be very naive indeed to assume that either SVR or the GRU would open their files to that defrocked komissar. The truth of the matter is that he was simply and elegantly used to add weight to what the Russians wanted to say on the subject at that time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"I, of course, was amused to watch that development. And I think 88-year old Alger Hiss was also pleased to get that message from Russia.</dd>

<p>And while Mr Ehrman at least had a good chance of actually writing the above link (horrah nobs, you don't have write anything yourself this time), it's still garbage. He doesn't seem to want to quote anything General V said in context or with a substantial length (cough, like my sources did, cough), because that might misled his readers into believing something like, I don't know, the truth.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Alger and ALES</span></h3>
<p>Many of those who believed in Alger Hiss's innocence have maintained that <i><b>ALES could have never been Alger Hiss</b></i>. The late John Lowenthal, a Hiss lawyer and longtime supporter, is one of chief proponents of this view.</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent Robert Lamphere was the official who surmised in a footnote to the <i><b>cable that ALES was "Probably Alger Hiss."</b></i> But Lowenthal challenges much of Lamphere's reasoning by the following:</p>
<p>Ales was said in the message to have been active for 11 years, 1935 through the date of the message, 1945; Alger <i><b>Hiss was accused of spying in the mid-30's and not later than 1938.</b></i></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venona_project.html" title="Venona project">Venona project</a> did not <i><b>begin</b></i> until 1942; the statement, <i><b>Hiss was accused of spying in the mid-30's and not later than 1938</b></i> in no sense <i><b>whatsoever</b></i> can associated with (1) <b>ALES</b>; (2) the <b><a href="../../../v/e/n/Venona_project.html" title="Venona project">Venona project</a></b>. 19:49, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fact that Hiss wasn't accused of spying after 1938 doesn't prove that he wasn't spying after 1938. Did the accusers actively claim that he stopped after 1938? In the 1950s, they were going on what they could prove, and they didn't have access to Venona. 23:19, 26 January 2006. KeithsBrown</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well it's really a question of why there wasn't any physical evidence linking Ales Hiss to the operations of ALES, but rather something totally different. Alger Hiss had a pretty intensive FBI investigation on him right before his trial, and it seems odd that he would be able to supress ALL evidence of his extensive military spying as ALES (much fresher than the other material), which he would be doing presumably while being under scrutiny. Also Whittaker Chambers had disavowed the Commies at this point, so it seems like Alger Hiss as a spy would be already compromised at the time ALES was stealing info from the military. It all ties into how there's more than one kind of espoinage, and that VENONA and the Pumpkin Paper's don't match very well as a coherent work of a single spy, but rather two different ones. Alger Hiss really wasn't a prime canditate for anything ALES would be doing.</dd>

<p>Sweet merciful Jesus! This is insane! nobs, I don't live on the moon, so you gonna have try to parse your argument into something that approaches logical, coherent thought. WORDS...MEAN...THINGS! Even <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>! Let me however jump in a spacesuit and try to set you straight.</p>
<p><i><b>ALES could have never been Alger Hiss</b></i> as a <b>stand alone sentence</b> would be POV, like the thousands of authoritive statements "Hiss was secret spy! Hiss was a traitor! Hiss was the Devil Incarnate!" you love to write in as historical fact. However, and pay attention here, the actual sentence reads: <i>supporters of Hiss</i> believe he could never be a spy ALES. This is an undisputable fact, like saying "Hiss detractors believe he must have been that spy". There is nothing debatable about that sentence, you just have your panties in a bunch because we're not rabidly smearing Hiss in that section.</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venona_project.html" title="Venona project">Venona project</a> did not <i><b>begin</b></i> until 1942; the statement, <i><b>Hiss was accused of spying in the mid-30's and not later than 1938</b></i> in no sense <i><b>whatsoever</b></i> can associated with (1) <b>ALES</b>; (2) the <b><a href="../../../v/e/n/Venona_project.html" title="Venona project">Venona project</a></b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>See, what I see here is a bunch of jibberish that doesn't even come close to winning points for effort, let alone for thought. Dur dur dur, Hiss was accused of spying w/ Chambers during and only during that time frame with the Baltimore documents. ALES was spying all time from 1938 to 1945 (here came the message!) and probably a bit later too. So that not a great fit for your little theory, if there ain't no evidence against Alger Hiss from there. And (1) you say "Well that's about Alger Hiss, not ALES." Very good, sparky, that's the point! ALES's spying doesn't fit very well with the spying accusations leveled against Hiss.</p>
<p>But this is the cream de la creme, the champion contender for Special Olympics medallion: <i><b>cable that ALES was "Probably Alger Hiss."</b></i> How is this POV.

<li>"<b>Hiss was accused of spying in the mid-30's and not later than 1938</b>" may, it appears, relate to "Alger"; however, in no concievable sense whatsoever, (outside of <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>, which, as I understand it, is non-negotiable) can relate to "ALES".</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Analogy</span></h3>
<p>It has been brought to my attention there is a younger readership to this article which may not be familiar with the case. So let me present Mr. Lowenthal's arguement by an analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A banana murdered his wife in 1945.</li>
<li>An orange testified that the banana told him in 1938 that the banana was contemplating killing his wife.</li>
<li>An apple witnessed the banana murder his wife in 1945.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Mr. Lowenthal presents his argument as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The apple cannot be correct because the orange only had knowledge up to 1938." <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 18:06, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Look kids, if you ever find yourself listening to someone going over complex murder scenarios with various fruits, smile and back away slowly. Although this analogy certainly cast Whittaker Chambers in right food group (Baa-Zing! Thank You! I'll be here all night...)</p>
<p>Oh my! But back to the basics, meaning how your analogy (though hee-larious) is also completely wrong. See, the physical evidence and testimony produced against Alger Hiss at his trials all say that if Alger Hiss EVEN WAS guilty, then he was guilty of a very specific type of espoinage, represented by the Baltimore Documents held by Chambers. There was a world of difference between State Department trade regulations and ALES's espoinage, who was a <b>military</b> spy who very seldomed trafficated that State Dept material, but <b>actual military information</b>. The time frame is different, the stolen material is different, and nothing the Chambers apple said about Alger Hiss fitted with what ALES was doing. So the analogy is broken, while completely ignoring most of Lowenthal's other arguments as well. But wait, I should be using the fruits!</p>
<ul>
<li>A sour apple accuses a banana of murdering his wife in the mid 1930's with a knife.</li>
<li>A stodgy lemon finds a covert account of an agent called BANANO.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>BANANO was found to have left his wife alone and went on to murder a couple of fruits in 1945 with a blender.</dd>
<dd>Obviously BANANO is the perfect cover name for someone called banana. No one could guess!!</dd>
<dd>Obviously, open references to banana in covert messages are the best way to keep an identity a secret</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A fruitcake then says "Aha! The lemon confirmed the apple! The apple confirmed the lemon! It all makes perfect sense! Why if I just keep bashing these square pegs into these circular holes..."</li>
<li>Man&#160;:"I am hungry. Mmmm..."</li>
<li>Fruits + Cake: "Nooooooooooooooo!"</li>
</ul>
<p>The man is Lowenthal. The fruits will be missed.--168.122.236.22 22:39, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Analogy 2</span></h3>
<p>Upon review, the critics are correct, we have neglected some of Mr. Lowenthal's other arguements. Let's examine another:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ales was said in the message to have been active for 11 years</b></li>
<li><b>Hiss was accused in his trial only of spying in the mid 1930's</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Continueing the analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>An apple could count to eleven ('45 - '34 = 11);</li>
<li>An orange could <i>only</i> count to four ('38 - '34 = 4)</li>
</ul>
<p>with the conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The apple can not be correct because the orange could only count to four.</li>

<dd>OK. The US was involved in WWII from 1942 to 1945 (it was in all the newspapers). In 1938, therefore, logic would presume (a) the US was not involved in WWII (b) WWII had not yet occurred (c) the US &amp; the Soviet Union were not allies (d) US Defense needs and priorities were at a minimum (e) the axiom "avoid foreign entanglements", as articluated by US President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> 150 years prior, was still operative, further supported by (i) the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality_Act_0045.html" title="Neutrality Act">Neutrality Act</a>, (ii) no <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lend-Lease_1d38.html" title="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> provisions (iii) <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isolationism.html" title="Isolationism">isolationism</a> (iv) <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_First_0e9b.html" title="America First">America First</a> Committee (v) a plethora of other factors. If we ignore the assumption that espionage priorities of Soviet military intelligence probably changed after their country was invaded, then we can revisit the arguement that obtaining keys to encyption codes was probably more valuable than just mere highly secretive trade documents. But again, for there to be any logical consistency to Lowenthals band-aid, we have to make-believe WWII never occurred. Other than that, it's a perfectly valid <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> arguement &amp; deserves representation in the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Alger_Hiss_0733.html" title="Alger Hiss">Alger Hiss</a> namespace, so a younger generation of young Americans can be become committed to the same lies as their forefathers. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 01:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the record shows Hiss had been a GRU operative since the thirties. Chambers testified his group was a GRU group; <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hede_Massing_5990.html" title="Hede Massing">Hede Massing</a> testified her attempts to recruit Hiss &amp; Noel Field failed because they both were already active as GRU agents. It has recently been established Col. Bukov (note not Bykov), Chambers GRU contact was indeed a GRU Case Officer, not OGPU. The point is (a) it does not matter what the contents of the material passed prior to 1938 was, because (i) it still was highly classied (ii) it still was illegal (iii) clear translations provided a key to decypher encryptions (iv) it compromised sources; (b) Lowenthal's rather lame arguement doesn't take into account WWII occurred between Chambers contact with Hiss &amp; the transmission of #1822 Venona NY to Moscow.</dd>
<dd>Not only does Lowenthal not consider the holocaust of 50+ people to make his arguement. Lowenthal deliberately, and deceptively invents an unconscionable fallacy that Chambers testimony and the Venona project both constituted evidence presented in 1948. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 17:33, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, you are obfuscating to avoid addressing the real issues at hand. ALES = Alger Hiss is a cornerstone of most modern arguments against Hiss, and it is the one that most readily falls apart if you bother to examine it in any great detail. Lowenthal's (partial) argument is that the paltry evidence physically linking Alger Hiss to espionage nevertheless points to a very different kind of spying than what ALES was engaged in. The versions of Chamber's testimony and VENONA's information are non-corroborative, and in fact contradictory in those key areas L highlighted. This is not about the trial, or about how many people died in WWII, (or about how crazy some people can be); it is about how ALES doesn't fit with Alger Hiss, despite the attempt of many conservatives to try to have it both ways. And recent evidence has only be crueler to this crackpot theory <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/11579.html#_ednref13" class="external autonumber" title="http://hnn.us/articles/11579.html#_ednref13" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. So either Alger Hiss was some kind of <i>incredible supervillian agent</i>, able to defy the fundamental laws of physics and exist at two separate locations at the same time, or he wasn't ALES and the whole "theory" is crock. Delicious, hilarious, crackpot crock.--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimoteo_III_67e3.html" title="User:Timoteo III">Timoteo III</a> 23:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>David Lowenthal made available through his in History News Network article the substance of a message that Vassiliyev copied in the archive of the former KGB during research for <i>Haunted Wood</i>. The message, sent to Moscow 5 March 1945 by the NKGB rezident in Washington became available during Vassiliyev's suit against John Lowenthal in a British court.

<p>Furthermore, that same message (March 5 1945) rules out Hiss as ALES. For whereas it states that ALES was still in Mexico on March 5, Hiss had returned at least 11 days earlier (February 22), as the Washington station chief, Anatoly Gorsky, who was in daily contact with the State Department, must have known if 'Ales' had been Hiss.

<p>For you lightweights, let's take the most simple of facts:</p>
<p>If there is to be any intellectual honesty in this article, then the fact of the prosecution and conviction of Alger Hiss on the count of perjury can be detailed to eliminate bias i.e. non-fact stated as possible ambiguity and 'considerable controversy'. In addition, this matter is not complete without an accompanying disclosure of the charges for espionage -- why it was not pursued is a significant fact missing from this lame attempt to rewrite history in favor of communism, once again poorly disguised as neutral.</p>
<p>Hiss == perjury == espionage == lies == democrat. Too simple or just too direct and to the point for those guilty who would prefer to see a perpetual dance around? Such is childishness and for them relegation to the sandbox. It appears to a discerning reader that the Wikipedia is that sandbox.</p>
<p>There are many other facts omitted to suit the conclusions of this article, not as neutral, but as liberal bias, excuse me -- I mean, propaganda. Quite frankly, that is what this case was all about -- lies. What history has shown is the methods liars and their sympathizers use: quite clearly depicted in this article for those still learning to spot the vagrants of society.</p>
<p>If someone sits atop editorialization with such an iron fist, then it is time to throw them to the smelter -- is that you, baseball baby?</p>
<p>In case you didn't get the memo, this is America -- dishonesty and subversion have had their day in court and have been convicted of perjury -- only because the statute of limitations on espionage had lapsed. The perjury conviction -- everyone wants to know what someone lied about under oath, it is after all quite relevant to the pursuit of the facts in a case -- Hiss lied about being a spy for the Soviet Union and was convicted of that fact. No appeal has ever reversed that conviction. Simple, but omitted.</p>

  <i>Whittaker Chambers: Man of Courage and Faith</i>
      by Lee Edwards, Ph.D.

<p><br />
Mr. Edwards may well be a qualified expert on this topic.</p>
<p>My expertise lies in disrobing lies, liars, and deception -- as in this case.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dean memoir</span></h2>
<p>It's published. It is challenged. What's the problem? Most of the Venona material is amplified through speculation and shamelessly hyped on this entry. Shall we cut all that as well?--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 16:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ten years</span></h2>
<p>I have moved the following bit over here:</p>
<p>"After ten years of asserting that Alger Hiss was neither a Communist nor a spy,"</p>
<p>I don't doubt that it is based on facts, but it is unclear in which context Chambers is supposed to have asserted that. That should be made clear. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:11, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone deleted all the notes at some point. I have restored them, but the notes and references could use a major overhaul.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 15:38, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Polemics in Alger Hiss article</span></h2>
<p>I have worked hard to take the subjectivity and polemics out of the Whittaker Chambers article, but this article on Alger Hiss is already so long and full of argument, rather than pointing readers to arguments and sticking to facts that I will not touch it. -- <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboudaqn_acf3.html" title="User:Aboudaqn">Aboudaqn</a> 2006.07.27</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Very biased page - Hiss zealots clearly took over.</span></h2>
<p>Needs a longer listing of the extensive evidence against Hiss. For instance, during the months that Hiss claimed "Crosley" rented from him, records show there was no electricity in the apartment "Crosley" supposedly rented. Chamber knew things that could only come from a long association with Hiss, not a brief acquaintance. There's plenty of evidence that Weinstein produces that even his detractors do not dispute.Keith 09:47, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
