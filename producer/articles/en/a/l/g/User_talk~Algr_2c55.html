<dd>Guettarda, recently you posted on my talk page <i>"bringing people here to stack a vote is considered meatpuppetry and is frowned upon."</i> It now appears that Tony the Marine has done precisely that with his post above. This message went out only to people who supported his position on Puerto Rico. Pmsyyz and Sceptre were not invited. As a new user I want to follow Wikipedia's guidelines of behavior, but this is certainly a case where actions speak louder then words. What do you plan to do about Tony the Marine's action? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 09:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do I plan to do? Nothing - he acted correctly, informing involved parties (as should have been done with the mediation). Sceptre was only involved in the mediation attempt (and I would say gave up on it). I don't know how Pmsyyz was involved at all (or who s/he is). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:21, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I just noticed the message you left. I reviewed the relevant pages. I can see the dispute is heated, and I would like to be of assistance. Unfortunately I don't have much knowledge on this issue, so I will not weigh in officially. If you think something I say is useful, feel free to quote me.</p>
<p>I agree that many (possibly most) Puerto Ricans consider themselves a nation, though obviously not a sovereign one. However, I think it would confuse the issue for anyone to claim that the Spanish term "nación" is used differently than the English "nation". They have different connotations, but can be used to refer to the same concept. Puerto Rican nationalists seem to use "nation" as Scottish and Welsh nationalists do. However, in English, to use the term "national" is probably seen as a more political statement, because it tends to imply sovereignty or nationalist feelings. On the other hand, Scotland, Wales, and other entities are widely referred to as nations, even by non-nationalists, so the argument could be made either way. <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhumiya_8fee.html" title="User:Bhumiya">Bhumiya</a>/<a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhumiya_1af5.html" title="User talk:Bhumiya">Talk</a> 21:22, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all welcome to the 'pedia, if there's anything that I can help you with let me know. You may want to read the United Nations Special Commitee on Decolonization press release regarding Puerto Rico's self-determination process <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/gacol3121.doc.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/gacol3121.doc.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Specifically this text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Reiterating that the Puerto Rican people constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation that has its own unequivocal national identity, the Special Committee would call upon...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Therefore, there shouldn't be any problem if 'nation' is used to refer to Puerto Rico or to things related to Puerto Rico such as its anthem or endemic fauna and flora.</p>
<p>I understand your concerns, but the truth is the problem roots on the meaning of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a> (read that article). Nation is not synonymous to sovereign state, even tho it's incorrectly used as such.</p>

<dd>Well, you see, the thing is that while it will indeed mislead people, it will mislead people that do not know the real meaning of 'nation'. By your premise, we can argue the same with all the nouns of the English language. You have to understand that just because words can have different meanings, it doesn't mean we have to exclude them. As long as the word is used appropiately, correctly, and in context, there's no reason to switch it with one that doesn't follow the norm (in this case, 'official'). Evidence has been shown regarding the use of 'nation' and 'national' to refer to topics related to Puerto Rico.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I haven't not read every single post on that discussion, but if you're being attacked at a personal level I suggest that you contact the Mediation (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a>) or Arbitration Commitee (<a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a>). If it's bothering you, just stay cool (see <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_762d.html" title="Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot</a>) and move onto something different.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>What suggestions have you made that include 'nation'? I thought the dispute was about the use of 'national bird' vs. 'official bird'.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/g/User_talk%7EAlgr_2c55.html" title="Edit section: Camera aperture vs. mask/crop">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camera aperture vs. mask/crop</span></h2>
<p>Algr -</p>
<p>As this isn't germane to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Univisium.html" title="Univisium">Univisium</a> discussion, I'll answer your question here.</p>
<p>It really comes down to definition of the words - much like the larger debate on the Univisium page regarding "standard."</p>
<p>Aperture and Crop are are two very different concepts. The camera aperture plate is required, not only as a place to make contact with the film emulsion, but to define the format frame size. Cropping is an artistic choice within an aperture. Many formats require different aperture plates and, within those apertures, are the acceptable (usable) frame and multiple crop choices.</p>
<p>The standard "Academy" frame (which accounts for an optical soundtrack on the side of the film, and therefore does not expose an image across the full width of the frame (but rather offset to the right) - not technically the correct term (Silent Aperture is correct), but universally used and understood) is .866" x .630" (22mm x 16mm). That is the physical <b>camera aperture</b>. From there, the usuable image area is .825" x .602" (20.96mm x 15.29mm). This is the "full frame" (a somewhat overused and incorrect term, but it works here for simplicity) area - within the full camera aperture. Notice that it is nearly 5% smaller than the aperture size. This is NOT a "crop" - it is merely the full usable area, accounting for imperfections in the aperture itself. It is possible that (especially in today's day and age of telecine) one could pull out and utilize the full .866" x .630" exposed area - but they would see the edges of the aperture plate (whic are not rounded, but are not necessarily clean, sharp lines, either). WITHIN the .816" x .612" usuable frame area, are various standard <b>cropping</b> sizes, most commonly:</p>
<p>.825" x .497" for European 1.66:1 (20.96mm x 12.62mm) and .825" x .466" for 1.85:1 (20.96mm x 11.33mm).</p>
<p>These are <b>crops</b> within the standard "Academy" aperture. One <i>could</i> utilize a "hardmask" in the camera, within the aperture to create these aspect ratios, but that is rare. Mostly the full frame is exposed and the aspect ratio is defined either in telecine or in the theatrical projector. Allen Daviau, ASC, however, on <i>Empire of the Sun</i> and, I believe also on <i>E.T., The Extra Terrestrial</i> (although I'm not positive about <i>E.T.</i>) utilized a 1.66:1 hardmatte in the camera for the film, which was intended for 1.85:1. His rationale was to protect the intregrity of the composition just a bit more in the event of a projection error.</p>
<p>Note that the "Academy" aperture does NOT utilize the full area "perf-to-perf" of the 35mm film - but it is NOT a <b>crop</b>.</p>
<p>Likewise, another possible camera aperture is Super 35: .980" x .735" (24.84mm x 18.67mm), which DOES utilize the full usuable negative area "perf-to-perf".</p>
<p>Common viewfinder markings are available for 1.33:1 (TV), 1.78:1, 1.85:1 and 2.40:1. In this case, although 2.40:1 is only exposing a fraction of the frame size (.945" .394" (24mm x 10mm)) it is not actually called a <b>crop</b>, but an <b>extraction</b> because an intermediate process is required to get the 2.40:1 aspect ratio to a print format. So that area of the image isn't technically "cropped" out of the full Super 35 frame (although, technically it kind of is), it is "extracted" from that area and optically (either digitally or optically/photochemically) squeezed into a .825" x .690" size (offset for soundtrack). If this was for television (video) and the actual negative was used (say Super 35 for 1.78:1 TV) then it would be called a <b>"crop"</b>. Theatrically, though, it's an extaction.</p>
<p>Now - in the case of Univisium (Univision) - the cameras are modified not only for 3 perf frame sizes, but with a camera aperture at .945" x .472"(24mm x 12mm). That is the physical camera aperture. The usuable image area is (by estimate, not hard data) .900" x .450" - still a natural 2:1 aspect ratio. This also is, technically, an extracted aspect ratio (unless his projection system comes to fruition) as it must be squeezed into the .825" x .690" anamorphic projection frame. But it is not a <b>crop</b> because it utilizes the full 3-perf camera aperture for the image.</p>
<p>Aperture is different depending on the camera setup. Cropping is something that happens WITHIN the camera aperture. These are important distinctions in the definitions of the terms.</p>
<p>For more reading and understanding of all of the above, I would highly recommend getting a copy of the <i>American Cinematographer Manual</i> which is available through the ASC press ([www.theasc.com])</p>

<p>Your partial reversion has missed many of the subtle points I changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interlace is not merely a technique of <i>transmission</i>, it is also intimately tied to the details of <i>storage</i> and <i>display</i>, hence my use of the general word "representation".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Any video image is transmitted, even if it is just along a short cable, so the word seems general enough. "representation" is okay too, if you want it.<a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a></i></dd>

<ul>
<li>50-60Hz interlacing with one refresh per field does improve flicker, when compared to the option of 25-30Hz progressive with one refresh per frame, which was the only feasible alternative until the 1990s.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>But you are comparing interlace to a pathological system that no one ever advocated. The REAL alternative was 240p 60 hz the way I described how computers did it in the 1970s. (and videogames did until the 1990s) Compared to any _real_ progressive system, interlace has more flicker. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a></i></dd>

That one user got under my skin a bit, but you'll notice he disappeared (or maybe just went to bed) when he had enough fun for the night. He was a new user who had touched only this article (as with a few others recently), so I figured it was safe to throw the "sockpuppet" charge at him (which I would not do lightly) after which he vanished.

<p>Algr, Are you the original author of this resolution chart? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Resolution_chart.svg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Resolution_chart.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Resolution_chart.svg</a></p>
<p>I have some questions about this chart, and the description... "It does not accuratly reflect the screen shape (aspect ratio) of these formats, which is always stretched or squeezed to 4:3 or 16:9. The table assumes an average vertical detail loss of .75x due to interlace. The actual loss is variable due to content, motion, opinion on acceptable levels of flicker, and possible success of deinterlacing. 1920x1080i is not included because all common use of 1080i is filtered to 1440 or less."</p>
<p>I don't understand why interlace artifacts are discussed or factored in to this chart. It would seem to be better to reference this as a separate discussion. The resolution of HDTV is identical for interlaced or progressive scan formats for the same signal type (1920x1080 or 1280x720).</p>
<p>I don't understand the justification for the statement "all common use of 1080i is filtered to 1440 or less". 1080i is defined by SMPTE 274M, and is broadcast in the US using ATSC. Neither of these specifications filter the horizontal resolution to 1440. Only HDV uses anamorphic pixels to record 1440x1080 as 1920x1080. Most of the broadcast 1080i material is shot and edited with full 1920x1080 resolution equipment.</p>
<p>This chart has been placed on many different wikipedia pages, and I am interested in working with the author(s) to improve it.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I created that chart. The reason for the .75x interlace loss is that pixels do not automatically translate into detail. While you can COUNT 1080 lines in 1080i, you can't USE them as you would in 1080p - you must blur out details that would cause one field to become brighter then the other. This blurring always happens before broadcast, (usually in the camera) and can't be undone by a de-interlacer - the detail is removed, not just hidden. This is why VGA is so much sharper then NTSC, even if the NTSC has component inputs. The chart is intended to show how much detail you can actually SEE with these formats.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This isn't true at all. Why would one field become brighter than another, just because there are 2 interlaced fields per frame? Why would blurring reduce brightness? Do you have any references for this idea? Have you ever seen broadcast quality NTSC? It's sharper than VGA... roughly 800 lines of horizontal resolution. Yes... motion of the camera or subject can cause a reduction in detail when the video is shot and displayed with interlacing... but this is a separate subject than the native resolution of the signal format. If the entire capture, storage/transmission and display system are interlaced, motion artifacts are nearly zero (which is what NTSC or 1080i on a CRT are designed to be). I understand that displaying interlaced video on a native-progressive scan monitor will introduce deinterlacing... but that is a separate subject.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for the horizontal resolution, it is not just HDV, but most HD formats that run at 1440. DVCpro is even lower: 1280 x 1080i pixels. Even uncompressed formats reduce pixel count. Attack of the Clones was shot with 1440 horizontal pixels. Newer high end gear can shoot true 1920, but this is only being used in 24p mode. Even when such is available, (Revenge of the Syth) broadcasters have found that they get too many artifacts if they try to broadcast it that way - 19 mbps just isn't enough data. So they are filter any 1080i down to 1440 or less, so that the softer images will look cleaner. Blu Ray and HD-DVD run at higher data rates, so in theory, they could use 1920x1080i, but in practice, all the content that people want to buy disks of is 1080p, and/or film. Hence 1920x1080i is not "in common usage", and isn't included.</dd>
</dl>
<p>HDV and DVCPro are consumer and semi-professional formats. They aren't main-stream professional formats... they are second-tier formats for people who can't afford the real deal. HDTV programs that you watch on TV aren't shot, edited, or broadcast in these formats.</p>
<p>The standard professional high-definition interface is SDI (SMPTE 259M). This interface transfers the high definition video signal uncompressed. The data rate of an uncompressed HDTV (HD-SDI) is 1.485 Gbit/s. 1080i HDTV is broadcast using ATSC.</p>
<p>Star Wars "Attack of the Clones" was shot in 1080p24 with Sony HDW-F900 Cinealta Cameras - which use full 1080 resolution sensors... <a href="http://bssc.sel.sony.com/Professional/docs/brochures/hdwf900_v11122b.pdf" class="external free" title="http://bssc.sel.sony.com/Professional/docs/brochures/hdwf900_v11122b.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://bssc.sel.sony.com/Professional/docs/brochures/hdwf900_v11122b.pdf</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/technical" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/technical" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/technical</a></p>
<p>1080i and 1080p are 1920x1080 signals. There is no such thing as 1440x1080 HDTV... even if the sensor is 1440x1080, or if the signal is down-sampled, or if the display is 1440x1080.</p>
<p>True, HDCAM cameras downsample to 1440x1080... but other cameras and storage systems don't down-sample... and live 1080i broadcasts aren't downsampled.</p>
<p>My concern with the resolution chart is that you are showing that 1080i has a native resolution less than 1920x1080... and it doesn't. Done right, 1080i has 1920x1080 resolution.</p>

Revert. 852 or 768 horizontal are not part of any standard. (non-square pixels)
</pre>
<p>First of all, 852x480 is the resolution of the 480p EDTV standard <b>with square pixels</b>. Just because DVDs use non-square pixels to achieve 852x480 and claim to be 480p, it doesn't change the EDTV standard (See <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto_standard.html" title="De facto standard">de facto standard</a>). As for 768, that is one of the PAL standards (the specifics of which I am not as familiar with, so I may have incorrectly assumed square pixels where they were not, in which case that box can be removed or resized). Finally, I don't see why you would do a hard revert to the older, even more incorrect graphic instead of just downloading and editing the new one. <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclip_4a19.html" title="User:Noclip">Noclip</a> 17:53, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice you have edited the image again to show 480p as having 720x480 resolution. In the interest of not escalating this situation into an edit war I will not change the image. I do, however, strongly urge you to. I am aware of the fallacy in claiming that Google is always right, but the number one result on Google for "480p resolution" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=480p+resolution" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=480p+resolution" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is a CNET page <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-3.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which lists the native resolution of EDTV to be 852x480. The "more info" link lists the resolutions of common TV formats in a table, and notes that 480p is 852x480 <a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5137915-1.html?tag=txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5137915-1.html?tag=txt" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

On the other hand, a search for "480p 852x480" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=480p+852x480" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=480p+852x480" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> produces 149,000 results, with an additional 54,600 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=480p+854x480" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=480p+854x480" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> for "480p 854x480". You are absolutely correct that the 480i standard provides for a 4:3 progressive format of the same dimensions as 480i. But a widescreen version of 480p, sometimes called EDTV, is not mentioned in any standards document I am aware of and is nevertheless significantly more widespread than the 4:3 variant. Because the template is for <i>common</i> TV resolutions and not restricted to only standards 480p's most common resolution should be represented also, but not exclusively. In the interest of a compromise, I would suggest modifying the 720x480 box's label to "NTSC DV/DVD/4:3 480p" and including a separate box labeled "EDTV/480p" at 852x480, with a footnote that while the "ideal" size of 480p is 853x480, 852x480 and 854x480 are most commonly used in order to avoid dealing with odd pixel counts. - <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclip_4a19.html" title="User:Noclip">Noclip</a> 20:35, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't create the current image there, but it is correct in excluding 852x480. The reason for your google hits count is simple: Advertisements for plasma displays are everywhere, but correctly quoted standards from the ATSC are less common. There is a lot of misinformation about this, and I see this as all the more reason to be clear about mistakes that others have made. The point is also moot because manufacturers have abandoned the 852x480 resolution anyway, all plasmas are now at least 1280x720.
<dl>
<dd>Again, it is <b>not Template:TV_Standards</b> (which you are free to create), it is <b>common resolutions</b>. In regard to the manufacturers "abandoning" it, does this mean we should also remove the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_paint.html" title="Lead paint">lead paint</a> article? Manufacturers have abandoned its use, so it must no longer be noteworthy.
<dl>
<dd>An article about paint in common use today certainly should not mention lead paint prominently. 480p is fairly common, but the nonstandard 856x480 variant is only a footnote about plasma displays. All else is misinformation from third or forth party sources. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 01:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can't honestly be implying that widescreen 480p and QSXGA+ are equally common TV resolutions? 852x480 480p was broadcast by a major network (Fox), is used on a multitude of TVs still on the market, and has gained increasing popularity for internet video since Apple began using it on its movie trailers <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.apple.com/trailers" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> site. <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclip_4a19.html" title="User:Noclip">Noclip</a> 14:32, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you click the link I've provided and select any of the HD trailers, then select the 480p button (claimed by Apple as HD, albeit incorrectly), you will get a movie very close in size to 852x480 (Usually smaller, I assume they chop off the black bars from the sides of the scan). While Apple is not a standards making organization, the use of native 852x480 video on the internet (which does not resort to non-square pixels) is rapidly <i>increasing</i> in popularity. You'd be hard pressed to find any use of non-square pixels anywhere near the commercial online video distribution mainstream. My offer for a compromise still stands, and I strongly feel that the template would be of better accuracy were it to represent both the standardized size of 480p, along with the common non-standardized variant. <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclip_4a19.html" title="User:Noclip">Noclip</a> 03:37, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I just posted above, streaming video isn't "TV". It can have any aspect ratio you can dream up, all the bandwidth you can afford, and it is not "broadcast"; each download is a separate dialog between the server and one computer. (The numbers I quoted above for Apple are for videos purchased from iTunes.) <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 05:09, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're side didn't really "win" the poll.

<p>Your claim that Fred Richman's article "demolishes" the statements made in <a href="../../../0/2E/9/0.999....html" title="0.999...">0.999...</a> has qualified you as a crackpot in my view. Richman merely says that if decimal numerals are used to represent a different sort of object from the usual real numbers, then different results follow. I'll be very surprised if Richman expresses agreement with what you're saying, or disagreement with what the article says. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:54, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beware of that redlinked user on the Apollo hoax pages. My guess (based on his subtle-as-a-sledgehammer user ID) is that his sole purpose is disruption. He might stop here, or he might just be testing the waters to see what arguments he can start. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:19, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
