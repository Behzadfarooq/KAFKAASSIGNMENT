<p>My name is Christopher Fontaine. I was born on July 23rd, 1980 in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchorage%2C_Alaska_36ac.html" title="Anchorage, Alaska">Anchorage</a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. I grew up in <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girdwood%2C_Alaska_c301.html" title="Girdwood, Alaska">Girdwood</a> Alaska, a town of approximately 1,500 year round residents. Girdwood was a ski town with an old mining history from the turn of the century. I lived in Girdwood for 14 years before I moved. In Girdwood I learned to downhill and cross country ski. Living in Alaska in a small town I have a love of the out doors and exploring the wilderness and old run down towns and home sites. One friend from Alaska I still talk to even after all these years is Scott. He was the computer geek of a group of three of us who hung out and played together. Scott recently married a woman from Japan in a ceremony in Japan.</p>
<p>In 1994 my family moved to Montana where my father was born and raised. I lived in <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalispell.html" title="Kalispell">Kalispell</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a> for another 10 years. I went to high school in Montana and spent two school years working for the <a href="../../../y/e/a/Yearbook.html" title="Yearbook">Yearbook</a>. I graduated high school in 1998. I graduated from Flathead Valley <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_College_e8f0.html" title="Community College">Community College</a> in 2001 with an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associate%27s_degree.html" title="Associate's degree">Associate of Arts</a> degree. In 2003 I graduated from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana_State_University_-_Billings_6975.html" title="Montana State University - Billings">Montana State University - Billings</a> with a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Science_1c0e.html" title="Bachelor of Science">Bachelor of Science</a> majoring in Liberal Studies and a minor in Communications. A friend I met in my first days of 9th grade in high school is Ed, and we've been friends ever since. When he got married in the summer of 2004, I was one of the groomsman. Another friend of mine is Ryan. Together the three of us have known each other for ten years and we have had plenty of adventures together. We have split somewhat. In 2005 I moved to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casper%2C_Wyoming_2d13.html" title="Casper, Wyoming">Casper</a> <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> to pursue a job working as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductor_%28transportation%29.html" title="Conductor (transportation)">Conductor</a> for <a href="../../../b/n/s/BNSF_Railway_bca0.html" title="BNSF Railway">BNSF Railway</a>. Ed has a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masters_Degree_1bae.html" title="Masters Degree">Masters Degree</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_Engineering_bd15.html" title="Electrical Engineering">Electrical Engineering</a> and it trying to find work with <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> in Nevada. Ryan is currently enlisted in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">Air Force</a> and training in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterey%2C_California_8065.html" title="Monterey, California">Monterey</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> to become a Korean translator. I have moved back to Kalispell Montana and am job hunting because the BNSF job didn't work out. After spending a couple months as a substitute teacher I managed to find employment at National Flood Service, a company that handles Flood claims for insurance companies. I worked 2 months in the Claims department before being hired on permanent and moving into the New Business department writing new policies as an Underwriter. Then 7 days before my probationary 90 day period was over, my supervisor laid me off. Since then I have acquired new employment in the IT department of Glacier Bank working the help desk. Currently I live in Missoula in an efficiency apartment smaller then some motel rooms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="Edit section: Hobbies and Interests">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Hobbies and Interests</b></span></h2>
<p>I have plenty of hobbies of my own. I am an avid reader and have a nice collection of books of my own. I have the entire <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Ryan_%28fictional_character%29_7a36.html" title="Jack Ryan (fictional character)">Jack Ryan</a> series by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Clancy_22e8.html" title="Tom Clancy">Tom Clancy</a>. I also have several <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Grisham_35ce.html" title="John Grisham">John Grisham</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crichton_1cc6.html" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> books. I am a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> book fan and have several of the paperbacks. I like shooting for sport and fun. I own several weapons, my favorite being a recently acquired AR15. All the guns I have are listed below. As previously mentioned, I am an avid downhill skier and frequently get season passes to go skiing. I've been skiing at more then a dozen resorts, these include <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyeska_Resort_4e3f.html" title="Alyeska Resort">Alyeska</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Valley%2C_Idaho_6dc7.html" title="Sun Valley, Idaho">Sun Valley</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vail.html" title="Vail">Vail</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen.html" title="Aspen">Aspen</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steamboat_Springs_1c35.html" title="Steamboat Springs">Steamboat</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Sky_Resort_7ca8.html" title="Big Sky Resort">Big Sky</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistler-Blackcomb_7b71.html" title="Whistler-Blackcomb">Whistler-Blackcomb</a>, and <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squaw_Valley_Ski_Resort_fc78.html" title="Squaw Valley Ski Resort">Squaw Valley</a>. I also enjoy bike riding. Easy dirt trails or normal paved trail riding. I've gone on three 30+ mile bike rides in 2003 and took a 58 mile ride in late summer of 2005.</p>
<p>I am also a bit of a computer nerd. I got my first computer before I was ten years old and I have had 10 computers in total. Most recently I have built two computers for myself. My newest computer is an Acer laptop. I am mostly a self taught individual. I pick up things from friends and altering receiving instructions once. I have no formal training but I can put together a computer and get the operating system installed and have the computer up and running in under a day. I enjoy the work, but with no professional education, work in this field is not really possible.</p>
<p>Since the mid 1980s I have been a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Trek</a> fan. I grew up on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">TOS</a> and quickly graduated to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">TNG</a>. I enjoyed the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Star_Trek%7E_Deep_Space_Nine_9345.html" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">DS9</a> run immensely. I have an interest in the technology, politics, and history of Trek. I first joined Wikipedia for the purpose of keeping its information regarding Trek accurate.</p>
<p>Being a computer nerd and using the internet, I frequent several forums. I typically prowl the Spacebattles<a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_Spacebattles.com_1bad.html" title="User:Alyeska/Spacebattles.com">.com</a> forums.</p>
<p>Since 2001 I have become something of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a> fan. I enjoy the series very much and its replaced Trek as the series that I have a great fascination for. With a friend of mine we run our own Stargate website <a href="http://www.stargate-tech.net" class="external text" title="http://www.stargate-tech.net" rel="nofollow">Stargate Technology Center</a>. Its a technology website on Stargate and we examine the technologies and politics of Stargate. The website is back up. Most of what was originally up has been put back up. Updates all around, the multi-media page is up. Total rewrites on several of the articles to account for new information. Since mid 2006 the website has been taken down. It was costing us money and we simply didn't have the time any more. At some point in the future we will bring it back, but we just don't know when.</p>

<p>When living in Alaska, to go anywhere, one has to travel far, and almost always by plane. The best way to get around most parts of Alaska is by plane, or more correctly <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_plane.html" title="Bush plane">Bush Planes</a>. However, in all my time in Alaska I've flown by Bush Plane only twice. Most of my travel was outside of Alaska. At a very early age my parents started taking me on trips across the country, and even across the world. Because of all this travel I have a love of flying and I particularly enjoy <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airports</a> and exploring them. I learned to ski at a very young age while in <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>. I have been to more then 20 states in the USA as well as two provinces and one territory of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. I have been to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. I've been to some of the extreme sides of the United States. Born and raised in Alaska, vacationed in <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. I've been on both sides and both hemispheres of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Thanks to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Dateline_c306.html" title="International Dateline">International Dateline</a> I landed at <a href="../../../l/a/x/LAX_1656.html" title="LAX">LAX Los Angeles</a> 30 minutes before I took off (took off 6:30 pm, landed 6pm) that very same day in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> Australia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="Edit section: Politics &amp; Religion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Politics &amp; Religion</b></span></h2>
<p>They say that children often copy what their parents believe. Well this isn't quite the case for me. My beliefs have changed over the years. When I grew up, my parents raised me in a fairly neutral religious environment, but they still educated me on it and I naturally believed everything on the issue that they did. By the time I was half way through elementary school my parents started going to a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> church and I came along. At the same time my parents also prized education and they encouraged me to learn more about science. Science camp in the summer, watch science programing on TV (such as the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Channel_ee82.html" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_%28TV_series%29_015d.html" title="Nova (TV series)">Nova</a>), and enter into the science fair. Over the years as I learned more about <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">Biology</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology.html" title="Geology">Geology</a>, I started to reject some of the more absurd parts of Christian history. Eventually I found myself outright disbelieving in any God. By the time I was 16 I was a declared <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheist</a>.</p>
<p>My politics are not entirely similar. I hold similar views to my parents, but I am more conservative. They are both independents who are also somewhat towards the center, but have a strong Democratic/Liberal leaning. I list myself as an Independent moderate with Conservative leanings. On issues of government, foreign policy, diplomacy, and economics I tend have a definite conservative streak. Those who have read this page note that I have a nice gun collection. I firmly believe in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_0bb9.html" title="Second Amendment to the United States Constitution">2nd Amendment</a> and reject <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_control.html" title="Gun control">gun control</a> in most forms. On the other hand, when it comes to social issues I am very liberal. I believe in personal rights. People should be allowed to do as they please so long as it doesn't harm others. I firmly believe in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">1st Amendment</a> when it comes to religion. What this means is I do not want one religion dominating another. I believe in the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_of_church_and_state.html" title="Separation of church and state">separation of church and state</a>. The government should be <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> and religion should be a private affair. I believe that <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> is not something to be considered wrong or abnormal as it is part of nature and I fully support their right to marriage. I believe that all people are entitled to basic <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> and that people may not be punished for crimes until they have seen a day in court and been given <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a>. I also believe in personal responsibility. People are largely responsible for their own actions and should be held accountable. I do not blame others, I blame the people who committed the crime. Blaming the gun maker, blaming the video game maker, and blaming the music that people listen to for crimes committed is a copout. As an Atheist who has an interest in science I have full confidence in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> and I do not believe any religious concept, no matter how dressed up in science it pretends to be, should be taught in science class. Leave religious discussion for religion classes. Science is all that should be taught in science class. I absolutely detest the concept of <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daylight_Savings_c4cd.html" title="Daylight Savings">Daylight Savings</a> and wish it would be outlawed. I can't stand having to change my clocks and disrupt my sleep schedule as such. If the rest of the country wasn't so damned stupid and willing to follow it, I wouldn't be forced to tag along just to avoid confusion. I would oppose and ignore Daylight Savings in an instant if I could do so without making my life living hell. The government has no right legislating my clock. I do not understand why people take drugs. The thought of changing my mental status makes me sick. I prefer the thought of being in control of my mind. I don't need to alter it in any way. As such drugs are a mystery to me. I don't drink alcohol for the purpose of getting a buz and I intend on never getting drunk. I don't smoke and I don't drink Caffeine for a buz either.</p>
<p>I am rather fond of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancruft.html" title="Fancruft">fancruft</a>.</p>

<p><b>This is just a few quotes that I like and elected to share. This will change periodicaly.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>"A democracy is two wolves and a small lamb voting on what to have for dinner. Freedom under a constitutional republic is a well armed lamb contesting the vote." - <b><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“But all too soon the serums and the shocks took their toll, and the dear lad began to share such secrets with me, secrets that are mine alone to know... Bruce. It's true batsy, I know everything. And kind of like the kid who peeks at his Christmas presents I must admit it's sadly anti-climactic. Behind all the stern and bat-o-rangs you're just a little boy in a playsuit crying for mommy and daddy. It'd be funny if it wasn't so pathetic. Oh what the hell I'll laugh anyway. HA HA HA HA HA!” – <b><a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">The Joker</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“That's why you came to me, isn't it, Captain? Because you knew I could do those things that you weren't capable of doing? Well, it worked. And you'll get what you want: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant. And all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal, and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.” – <b><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garak.html" title="Garak">Elim Garak</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Rise and shine Mr. Freeman. Rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until, well, lets just say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the ashes.” – <b><a href="../../../g/-/m/G-Man_%28Half-Life%29_3ac9.html" title="G-Man (Half-Life)">G-Man</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Do you know what the chain of command is? It's the chain I beat you with until you do what I say." - <b><a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayne_Cobb_da6c.html" title="Jayne Cobb">Jayne Cobb</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“I reject your reality and substitute my own!” – <b><a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Savage_76fa.html" title="Adam Savage">Adam Savage</a></b></li>
