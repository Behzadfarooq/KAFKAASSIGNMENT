Panie Halibucie, you should consider helping by expanding this city history or it's importance in Polish history, before adding not contemporary name to an article about Lithuanian District center.

<dd>Then please be informed that, besides having a significant Polish population prior to 1945, the town was also a part of Congress Poland for some time, not to mention a period when it was part of the Kingdom of Poland prior to partitions.

I'll even try to reach a modus vivendi with you, if you wish. In the mean time, as far as I'm concerned you have displayed a vicious and mean spirited attitude towards me and others for some time now, so maybe it's you who needs to <i>stop your personal remarks. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 19:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Perhaps not. One thing I do know for a fact, is I never insulted your parents. You can apologize for that lie and false claim against me. And by now it's obvious that you cannot produce any evidence for the "alleged" death threat that Ghirla supposedly made against you. It is pretty obvious that you are lying or have a very lurid imagination. At least try to keep that penchant of yours to do so on the talk pages, and out of the articles in the future. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 14:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, Dan, you simply suggested they were members of the communist party. This was the insult I asked you to apologize for and this is the insult you never had the guts to withdraw. Moreover, the logical fallacy you presented was that "since my parents were for sure members of the commie party, the facts I present are most likely wrong". A nice logical fallacy, isn't it. Need a link or do you remember it now? Last time I presented the link, you simply ignored it, the previous time I presented it you ignored it as well... Don't really have the time to dig it up. BTW, I was the first to ask you to present some backup for your absurd accusations - so far I'm waiting. Until then allow me to treat your offensive language and tone as simple trolling. You request replies- give them first. You request fair treatment - be fair to others. Request the others to treat you seriously - be serious. As simple as that.</dd>

<dd>And after reading your comment again and again do you still dare to call me a liar? Sorry Dan, my patience is over. From now on I will report every such remark by you to where it belongs. You disrupt wikipedia and waste the time of honest wikipedians on OT chatter and unneeded offences. If that's what you like - fine, but don't expect me to join you in this kind of games any more. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 02:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>LOL, right back. It was you who called me a liar first. And you who has added lots of insulting remarks to your comments towards me. And I have read the link (thank you, for providing it), I found the thread yesterday, and re-read it again and again. Nowhere "did I insult your parents." After <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">user:Molobo</a> and you proceeded to pepper the article on the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_German_Infantry_Division_40ee.html" title="17th German Infantry Division">17th German Infantry Division</a> (kindly re-read its talk pages) with personal opinions and communist propaganda from the <a href="../../../p/e/o/Peoples_Republic_of_Poland_1d7e.html" title="Peoples Republic of Poland">PRL</a>, my reponse to you was on your talk page, August 16, 2006, under <i>Communism in Poland</i>. I did not insult your parents. BTW, you are welcome to simply state no, none of my family members belonged to the <a href="../../../p/z/p/PZPR_4491.html" title="PZPR">PZPR</a>, if that's the case. And even if they were, why would that be insulting anyway? And in my remarks I clearly stated, that in the event that my suspicions were incorrect, you had my apologies. And the death threat from Ghirlandajo? Where is it? You make wild and false claims, and then threaten "to report every such remark". Did he make a death threat or not? I'm more than ready and willing to reach an agreement with you, and apologize for all of my sins. Just show us the death threat. A death threat, BTW, is a rather serious legal matter. Imagining them is a rather serious medical matter. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 14:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
