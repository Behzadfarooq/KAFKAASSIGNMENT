<dd>--Mark666 here. Last one got shut down. So whats this one then? I'm confused. Anyways, it seems odd that just when people started to speak out "Magically" yet again the whole thing disappears! The blame at the site gets placed on former members. Gee, no cover up there. Has nothing to do with members having their way and just covering up peoples comments about the site. Since you guys couldn't edit it out anymore you decided to just get it deleted then act like , as people would say "OMG TEH BANNED TROLLZORZ DELETED IT". Right.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This site and its people are more fishy then politics. For future refrence im going to copy this post of mine just in case it gets edited by those bad banned members too. Wink Wink.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I asked an admin for a copy of the page, so he gave me a copy attached to my private profile. Notice where this page is linked, my user page. And enough with the fucking idiotic comments. Your not welcome here AssassinX. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 20:41, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>---Mark666 here again. Um I am not Assassin X. And why after my first message did you keep mentioning his name when "Tanizaki" spoke? Way to go you just banned someone who also isn't Assassin X. I think you are a little paranoid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you assume anyone who attacks SD.net is some previously banned member? I thought people we're allowed having opinions of the site? So far it seems that now even you want to block people that don't like the site.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In a chat with a known SD.net troll, AssasinX, he claimed responsibility for the post you made. Thats where the confussion came from. Anyway, I do not automaticaly assume anyone who attacks SD.net to be a previously banned member. However, all three VFDs were started by members banned from SD.net, all who trolled the forums and had what they considered a vendetta to settle. I have no problem with people having opinions on the site and I am not blocking that. What I am blocking is direct editing by members banned from SD.net on this article of mine. Rev Prez, Tanizaki, AssasinX, or anyone else banned from SD.net is not allowed to edit my article here. If they truly care to further the article, they may post serious suggestions in the discussion thread here so that their ideas may be discussed and potentialy added to the article. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 09:03, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FYI Mark666. I deleted your post because you placed it in the rules section, and I consider that a no-no. I decided to replace your post before I read your little beef and I am glad you removed it. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 09:09, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>YOU ARE NOT WELCOME. LEAVE NOW GOD DAMN IT. IS THAT TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND? You're a fucking troll and EVERYONE knows it. You don't care about Wikepedia or star wars, you started the VFD purely for the purpose of getting back at SD.net. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 00:34, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-(Markk666 again) Well even though I may not like SD.NET I am not Assassin X. And I am pretty pissed now that think he can go around saying things and messing up other people. I don't even go into chat rooms, I find them to be just full of over hormonal teens. I do have a MSN Message program, if he is using a chat on there I would like his name so I can ask what the heck his problem is trying to get others in trouble. Of course I never have even used the program.</p>
<p>And by the way it's nice to see that you don't just assume everyone that may not like the site may be a banned member. I will edit my statement about you in the other Wikipedia article then. Oh yeah as for the rules thing that was my bad, I didn't realize I posted there until you just mentioned it, so sorry.</p>
<p>(Mark666) I'm adding a line just so you know this idiot isn't me.</p>

<p>A few ideas I have for improving the article would be adding things like</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal to noise ratio (talking about how clean the board is in regards to spam)</li>
<li>How unused accounts are periodicly deleted. This makes the total member count look more realistic as to how many people actually participate.</li>
<li>The fee for registering with a free email account.</li>
<li>Punishment (publishing email address, VI, WTPF, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to talk about how SDN is a special forum, different from many others.</p>
<p>Additionaly, more about the main site is certainly in order, but I am not yet certain about what it should be. As to why I don't just edit this into the article myself, I do not know how to word it yet, but still want to toss out ideas. Destructionator 04:51, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thats a good list of ideas to explore. Its a good place to start on trying to expand the article. I'm going to have to start thinking about ways to write up some of those sections. Though lifting the rules/punishments from the forum FAQ would be simple enough for that section. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 05:14, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd love to. I was hoping to see other people work on this while I was gone. Seems no one bothered to do anything. Now that I have more reliable internet access, I can participate.

<p>RN, his name is Rev Prez. A fairly notable troll from SD.net, but an even bigger troll when he showed up at SB.com and after having been banned permanently managed to return more then half a dozen times. Anyway, if he is truly interesting in improving the article he may post ideas in here, but he is not welcome to directly edit the article. And can you link me to the section of rules pertaining user space and editing rules for them? <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 05:22, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well several times now Wiki admins have decided to delete the image without first warning me. Worse, these admins have decided to edit the article itself to remove the link. YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO DO THIS. So you've deleted the image, you don't have permission to edit the article to remove the link.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have no justification to delete the picture. This isn't an issue of fair use. I have permission of the owner and creator of the image itself to post it. So stop deleting the picture. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 17:42, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'll have to re-upload it under either "No rights reserved, auther releases all rights" or "Copyrighted, free to use for any purpose" instead of under fair use, since you have permission. Then you can inline it again. --<a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVagodin_fa52.html" title="User:Vagodin"><span style="color:green">Vagodin</span></a> <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVagodin_2c34.html" title="User talk:Vagodin"><sup><span style="color:green">Talk</span></sup></a> 02:30, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I never uploaded it in the first place. I don't know how to upload the pictures or tag them. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 05:05, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I went ahead and uploaded it for you. --<a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVagodin_fa52.html" title="User:Vagodin"><span style="color:green">Vagodin</span></a> <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVagodin_2c34.html" title="User talk:Vagodin"><sup><span style="color:green">Talk</span></sup></a> 07:01, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 18:33, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like how you tell Wikipedia admins what the hell they can and cannot do, using ALL CAPS to show how FURIOUS you are. Maybe I should head over to SD.net and tell Wong what he is allowed to do with the site. I'll try using all caps when I do. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanizaki_5a31.html" title="User:Tanizaki">User:Tanizaki</a></p>
<p>This is my page, not theirs. Their rules largely do NOT apply here. BTW, you continue this and your going to get banned just like before. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 04:47, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
