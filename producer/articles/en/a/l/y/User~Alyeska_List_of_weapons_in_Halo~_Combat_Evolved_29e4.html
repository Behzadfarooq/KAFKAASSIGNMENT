<p><b>NOTE</b>: The following descriptions of <i>Halo</i>'s weapons pertain specifically to gameplay; i.e., how and when the weapons are to be used. For a more general discussion, see <a href="../../../u/n/s/UNSC_%28Halo%29_6799.html" title="UNSC (Halo)">UNSC</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_%28Halo%29_49f3.html" title="The Covenant (Halo)">The Covenant</a>.</p>
<p>All usable weapons in <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> belong to either the Covenant or the UNSC (humans). The player can only carry two weapons at a time, in addition to up to eight grenades (four fragmentation grenades and four plasma grenades).</p>
<p>Covenant weapons are better suited for downing shields, and typically fire faster than their human-constructed counterparts. With the exception of the needler, they do not require ammunition or reloading; instead, each weapon comes with its own <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_%28electricity%29.html" title="Battery (electricity)">battery</a>. Once this battery is depleted, the weapon must be discarded. Covenant weapons can also overheat if fired too often, after which they must be given time to cool down before they can be used again.</p>
<p>Human weapons, on the other hand, require both ammunition and constant reloading. They are better suited against unshielded opponents and do not overheat.</p>
<p>The influence of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a> series is seen in the weapons of both sides - in both games the human weapons are mostly identical, save for one addition - the Sniper Rifle. However, there is more variety on the side of the Covenant, including the transferring of some weapons, such as the flechette launcher and fusion pistol, from the human to Covenant inventories. Weapon influences can be seen from the 1995-1996 TV series Space:Above and Beyond and the 1986 movie <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliens.html" title="Aliens">Aliens</a>.</p>

<p>The military technology of the humans in the <i>Halo</i> universe appears to be largely unchanged from that of modern-day reality. Human weapons are still primarily based upon ballistics and explosions from chemical reactions. Of course, one has to take into reason the power of these firearms, for they are formidable and effective against an advanced alien race and, though they have less impact on shields and don't have a "battery", they are still (for reasons of balance) stronger than a plasma weapon on unshielded foes. It is also notable that the makers were largely influenced by the types of weapons of a previous Bungie Studios game, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a>, while basing their design on the general characteristics of today's weapons. Though it may seem odd to think that humans would still be using the same basic weapon technology a half-millennia into the future, consider that all of the technology in the <i>Halo</i> universe is roughly equivalent to today's. The advances made in the game's universe seem to be largely improvements on the devices of today, which is actually not that strange, considering historical precedent. Five hundred years ago, the main weapons were guns and cannons, which are really just primitive rifles and MAC guns. The choice to give humans familiar technology was a deliberate act on the part of Bungie.</p>

<p><b>Advantages:</b> The pistol's accuracy, zoom feature, and high damage per hit make it ideal for eliminating Covenant Grunts and Jackals. The pistol is also extremely effective against Hunters, fascinatingly killing them with one shot to their exposed (orange) flesh. Employed against the Flood, it is useful for eliminating carriers (the large, exploding variant). Despite this, many players consider using the pistol against the Flood to be a waste of ammunition; though it kills them quickly, its rate of fire is not fast enough to combat groups of any size. The M6D has a 2x zoom that makes it a subordinate sniper rifle. The pistol can kill an unshielded opponent with a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headshot.html" title="Headshot">headshot</a>, although this may not be possible from far away due to its lack of accuracy compared to the sniper rifle. Case in point, the player can easily kill an elite by first bringing its shields down with a plasma weapon, then shooting it once or twice in the head with the pistol. Although the pistol is technically automatic, firing by holding down the fire button diminishes the accuracy greatly. The Pistol along with the Sniper Rifle is considered by some to be the best weapon in the game.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> The pistol performs poorly against Covenant shields; taking on Elites with this weapon only is ineffective. However, the pistol can easily kill an Elite whose shield has been taken down. The pistol can take out Elites quickly, but a headshot is necessary. Obviously, the pistol will barely scratch Covenant tanks and other fully armored vehicles, making it necessary to carry a heavier arm. The pistol is also less powerful against shielded players in multiplayer than the Sniper Rifle, which will cripple shields in one shot.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> Many consider the pistol to be the best multiplayer weapon due to its flexibility. The pistol works well at medium and long ranges, and in the hands of a skilled player can be effective even when the target is close. Three shots can yield a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frag_%28video_gaming%29.html" title="Frag (video gaming)">frag</a> in a multiplayer game – two to disable the shield, and one headshot to kill, although the three-shot-kill (TSK) is rare when playing against competent opponents. It is known that some players can easily defeat a foe who is armed with a rocket launcher simply by doing multiple head shots.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> All Covenant, Combat and Carrier Flood</p>
<p><b>Controversy:</b> Some consider <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a></i> to be inferior to its predecessor, <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>. That is because the core gameplay of the game changed remarkably due to the omission (for reasons of balanced gameplay in <i>Halo 2</i>) of one of the most powerful and effectively deadly weapons in the game - the M6D pistol. This pistol was a highly effective weapon in just about every possible situation in which players might find themselves. Whether it be close confrontation, long range sniping, or midrange combat - savvy veterans of <i>Halo:Combat Evolved</i> are extremely lethal while wielding M6D pistols. This was seen by some players as bad as well, since the pistol was used so regularly it disallowed for variety on many maps. However, this entire thought process is largely irrelevent. The M6D was stupidly made more accurate and more powerful then the MA5B. In reality the M6D is woefuly underpowered and has much less accuracy then the MA5B. The M6D was correctly downgraded for Halo 2. Furthermore, the M6D should never have been portrayed as it was in the first place. The fact that people complained about the removal of the M6D just goes to show they are whiney little brats, fucking idiots. The "new" M6C pistol in <i>Halo 2</i>, however, has a more specialized role with the advent of "dual-wielding", and does minimal damage to shielded foes unless they are hit in the head, in which case it causes moderate damage.</p>

<p>The M6D is a non-standard issue sidearm for the UNSC. Designed as a special issue weapon largely used by special forces. It has an integrated 2x scope making it a highly accurate weapon in CQB situations in the right hands. The M6D only has moderate firepower and requires multiple headshots to kill Elites with relatively weak shields. Against even Grunts the M6D requires multiple shots to kill where the MA5B or BR55 would have killed the Grunt in a single hit. The M6D is a specialzed upgrade of the M6C.</p>

<p><b>Advantages:</b> When fired in short bursts to increase accuracy, the assault rifle is effective at killing unshielded opponents, and is especially useful for killing large groups of weak enemies. This includes Covenant grunts and all variety of Flood. The assault rifle is also effective for destroying Banshees, Ghosts, and other Covenant vehicles. As an added bonus, the gun gives the player an at-a-glance ammo count on its digital readout, as well as an arrow pointing toward the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_giant.html" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Threshold (which acts as a kind of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass.html" title="Compass">compass</a>).</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Like the pistol, the assault rifle performs poorly against shields. Unlike the pistol, the assault rifle is inaccurate, preventing it from being effective against both Jackals and Elites. In addition, the assault rifle's high rate of fire necessitates frequent reloading. The combination of inaccuracy and lack of a scope lead to difficulties in accurately hitting targets at long range.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> Since players in <i>Halo</i> multiplayer normally spawn with shields, the assault rifle's effectiveness is limited. It is often used only because more specialized weapons are unavailable. However, when combined with the plasma pistol (which can destroy shields quickly), the assault rifle can be a powerful short and medium range option.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> Grunts, Jackals (only when shield is down), Flood, and mounted weapons as <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppressive_fire.html" title="Suppressive fire">suppressive fire</a>. It can also be extremely effective against Elites if used when their shields are down. After hitting an Elite with a plasma pistol charge, one well placed shot in the front of the cranium will take them out. On the Easy or Normal skill levels, cutting loose with the Assault Rifle at close range will cut through an elite's shield in seconds.</p>

<p>The MA5B is the primary weapon of the UNSC. It is a powerful assault rifle firing the 7.62x51mm round. With a magazine capacity of 60 rounds and being a bullpup weapon, the MA5B has proven to be highly effective. Designed with a telescoping stock to allow for greater ergnomics. The MA5B has an integrated scope allowing for accurately placed shots up to long range. With good firepower levels and a high rate of fire the MA5B can defeat shielded Elites in short order.</p>
<p><b>Influences:</b> The MA5B Assault Rifle was inspired by the "MA–75B Battle Rifle (with integral 40mm Grenade Launcher)" from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a> series. In fact, before Bungie reengineered the game for the Xbox, it was fitted with a grenade launcher. The MA5B Assault Rifle design seems to be taken from the M-590 7.62mm assault rifle of the USMC from 1995-1996 TV series Space:Above and Beyond.</p>

<p><b>Advantages:</b> Since the shotgun fires 15 spreading pellets per shot, the combined force of each relatively weak pellet does a significant amount of damage. This weapon can be devastating at short range. Its high damage potential makes it effective against any Covenant unit (even the Hunter, if shot in its exposed back), but only if the player can get close enough to render the gun effective. The shotgun can also be used, though not necessarily effectively, against all manner of vehicles, and many players consider it the ideal weapon with which to destroy Banshees which happen to be within the shotgun's effective range. In addition, this weapon is extremely effective against all forms of Flood at short and medium ranges. The shotgun also reloads in a different manner than the rest of the weapons in <i>Halo</i>. Each round is put into the shotgun, one-by-one, so reloading all twelve shells at one time may take a while. However, the player may interrupt the reloading process at any time and fire with however many rounds are currently loaded into the weapon. Another popular way of firing the shotgun involves inserting a shell, firing, and then inserting another shell, etc. While this takes slightly longer, it has the advantage of always having eleven shells chambered.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Although many skilled players are able to hit a target at almost any distance using this weapon, the shotgun's greatest limiting factor is its range, making it useless in any wide-open terrains. Ammunition for this weapon is also sometimes difficult to come by in single-player.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> The shotgun's effectiveness in multiplayer games varies depending on the terrain; indoors and in tight spaces, it is considered by many players to be the weapon <i>par excellence</i>. Many players carry the shotgun and a long range weapon, such as the pistol, thus making for a more flexible arsenal. Continuous firing by using the magazine and loading one shell then firing does not affect the rate of fire significantly, prompting a few players to employ a tactic dubbed "shotgun sniping" as suppressive fire across medium-sized maps. On the Internet, many games are shotguns only, with most of these battles being set in the map "Battle Creek."</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> All Enemies and Vehicles</p>

<p>The M90 is the ultimate heavy hitter in close combat situations for the UNSC. Originaly a civilan weapon, the UNSC wanted a weapon with heavy firepower and high magazine capacity. No 8 gauge shotguns existed which were semi-automatic or external box magazine fed. The UNSC opted for a civilan shotgun and designated it the M90. Being a tube magazine pump feed the M90 has a very long barrel making it an exceptionaly accurate shotgun in relation to other shotguns. The heavy firepower of an 8 gauge shotgun combined with flechete rounds makes the M90 an extremely lethal weapon. Against unarmored targets death is ensured. Armor provides only moderate protection against the needle like projectiles. The M90 has proven highly effective against shields, especialy Elite shields. It has proven less effective against Brutes. Slugs are prefered for killing Brutes.</p>
<p><b>Influence:</b> The <i>mechanical</i> design of the M90 shotgun is loosely based on the South African Neostead shotgun which features dual six-round top-loaded magazines. Its pump mechanism operates in a forward-back motion, due to its rear-load configuration (rather than normal back-forward motion). The weapon features two integral tube magazines with a total capacity of twelve rounds (6+6+1) and ambidextrous bottom ejecting shells. It is chambered for standard 8-Gauge 2.75-inch cartridges. The <i>aesthetic</i> design is a composite of multiple pump-action designs.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">S2AM Sniper Rifle</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> The sniper rifle is designed to be used at medium to long ranges, and is equipped with a scope and night vision for precisely this purpose. With its 2x and 10x zooms and ability to penetrate Covenant shields, the sniper rifle is useful against distant Elites. A headshot against any Covenant infantry except a Zealot (Gold) Elite or Hunter results in an instant kill; Hunters fall from one shot to their unarmored torso or neck. When playing in the highest difficulty, Legendary, this is only true for Minor (blue) Elites; the Majors (red) will take two shots to the head, and the Zealots will take three. Also when night vision function is turned on (activated by pressing the flashlight button) one can see an invisible Elite very easily(note that in normal, easy, and heroic difficulties, the sniper rifle can kill pretty much an enemy in two shots as long as they hit the enemy [this doesn't include the Hunters' armor and the Jackals' energy shield]. When playing online, some players use the sniper rifle to great effect when <i>camping.</i> For example, someone will crouch inside a confined hallway, and fire without the use of the scope from close range, resulting in an instant kill.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> The sniper rifle is almost impossible to aim at short range, due to the sticky-aim being removed when the scope is disabled and the paltry 4-shot magazine. It also has a steeper learning curve than most weapons, taking significant practice to master. Like any weapon, there is a need to <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leading_targets.html" title="Leading targets">lead targets</a> if they are affected by internet <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lag.html" title="Lag">lag</a>, and it is hard to use at short range because its aim is so precise. Ammunition for this weapon is also quite rare. It is highly ineffective against all forms of Flood and against Sentinels. The only way that the sniper rifle can be effective against the flood is if you fire at thier arms, which will fall off leaving them harmless. The bullets leave a strong visible trail that can reveal the shooter's position to others. Though the cartridges would fit an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-materiel_rifle.html" title="Anti-materiel rifle">anti-materiel rifle</a>, the rifle performs poorly even against Ghosts, unless the pilot is shot, or the half-orb energy cell, (commonly mistaken for a "gas tank") on the left side of the ghost is shot. It also has a pretty short melee range.</p>
<p><b>Influence:</b> The sniper rifle appears to heavily inspired by (if not directly copied from) the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South African</a> <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechem_NTW_20_mm_Anti-materiel_rifle_0e10.html" title="Mechem NTW 20 mm Anti-materiel rifle">NTW-20 anti-material rifle</a>. This weapon is chambered for both the 20mm x 83.5 round and the 14.5mm x 114 cartridge. Many of the features present in the <i>Halo</i>-version are included in the real weapon's makeup, including the muzzle brake, the recoil-dampening piston, and the general look of the receiver. The NTW-20, however, is a bolt-action weapon that feeds from a three-round side-mounted detachable box magazine.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> Sniping, both moving and from a fixed location (<a href="../../../c/a/m/Camping_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Camping (computer gaming)">camping</a>), is very popular in <i>Halo</i> multiplayer. Uses for the sniper rifle include base defense, teleport denial, and picking off enemy players in Warthogs and Scorpion tanks. Network <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lag.html" title="Lag">lag</a> is a serious problem for this weapon, as even a small error makes the difference between a hit and a miss. When using the Sniper rifle, an enemy can sneak up from behind and melee the shooter's back for an instant kill, simply because the motion tracker is not shown when zoomed in. (Note that motion trackers are only disabled when zoomed in <i>Halo 2</i>. In the original it is prudent to glance at your motion tracker often when zoomed in.) A useful tactic, called "injection" or "no-scoping," involves using the sniper rifle at close range to quickly incapacitate an opponent. Although very effective, this requires a large amount of practice. If a successful melee snipe is performed, a follow up melee attack will finish the foe.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> All Covenant</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Rocket Launcher</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> The rocket launcher spreads huge amount of damage over a large area. It is capable of taking out entire groups of targets at any range, and kills all the riders of nearly any vehicle (with the exception of the Scorpion tank) with one direct hit. The rocket launcher automatically pierces through overshields with direct hits. It is very useful for killing Hunters, which are often the most difficult enemies to kill.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Several things counterbalance the rocket launcher's sheer power. Firstly, it fires and reloads slowly. Secondly, ammunition is often unavailable, and the player can carry only 8 extra rockets at once. Thirdly, the rocket launcher can damage its own user if used at short ranges. Fourthly, the odds of managing to strike a Sentinel with this weapon are extremely low. Finally, at long range the rocket travels slowly enough to be dodged, and trying to hit moving vehicles from long range will require very precise timing and predictable driving by the opponent (precisely timed shots are not required in <i>Halo 2</i> because of the addition of the ability for the rockets to lock onto vehicles).</p>
<p><b>Influences:</b> The M19 SSM was inspired by the SPNKr rocket launcher from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a> series. The launcher itself is also nicknamed the SPNKr (pronounced "spanker")due to the labeling on the rear of the barrels and rectangular ammunition cases.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> Acquiring the rocket launcher in a multiplayer game may prove difficult, since it rarely appears in the spawn area. However, once acquired, this weapon can become very effective for all the reasons mentioned above - it can take out a large group of enemies in one shot, and can easily eliminate vehicles. Additionally, the pinpoint accuracy of the sniper rifle makes it very effective when combined with the rocket launcher (the former being more accurate than the latter). Since head-on collisions with the rocket are hard to obtain, it is prudent to aim at the ground in front of the enemy or the wall to their side. Though the shot may miss, the <a href="../../../s/p/l/Splash_damage.html" title="Splash damage">concussion</a> will kill the opponent.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> All Enemies and Vehicles</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Flamethrower</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> The Flamethrower can kill an enemy very quickly if used in close proximity, and the enemy continues to burn after they are hit with the flamethrower, sometimes causing them to die even if they run away. It is also stingy when using up fuel units, so protracted blasts of flame are sustainable on one fuel container. Finally, there is no need for accuracy when using the Flamethrower; merely pointing it in the enemy's direction will kill them in seconds.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Several things counterbalance the Flamethrower's high damage rate. Firstly, it reloads slowly, and is subject to overheating. Secondly, ammunition is often unavailable. Thirdly, the Flamethrower can damage its own user if one walks into the trail of flame left behind by the weapon. This lets the enemy run away while stopping the user from giving chase. If used at a distance, the Flamethrower takes longer to kill an enemy, and might not even damage them. Finally, the Flamethrower is very rare and there are only one or two of them per map, making them difficult to obtain.</p>
<p><b>Influences:</b> The Defoliant Projector Flamethrower was inspired by a similar flamethrower from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a> series. The shark-like decal on it is borrowed from the game as well. In <i>Marathon</i>, however, it is featured on the rocket launcher.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> Using the Flamethrower in small spaces or in groups of enemies works best, and the trail of flame blinds snipers by producing a temporary <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokescreen.html" title="Smokescreen">smokescreen</a>. It is especially effective if used to retreat by running backwards away from an enemy to leave a trail of flame, deterring would-be pursuers from giving chase to a wall of fire. This weapon can also take out groups of people in vehicles, provided they are close and moving relatively slowly. Effective uses include infiltrating an enemy base and defending the flag in CTF. It is also a very good ambush weapon, as it does a lot of damage in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>The UNSC-issued standard fragmentation grenade functions in a manner very similar to contemporary <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_grenades.html" title="Hand grenades">hand grenades</a>. Though fragmentation grenades lack shrapnel, their concussion is powerful against both shielded and unshielded enemies. Only four may be carried at a time. An "infinite grenades" option is available in multiplayer on a single Xbox, as well as in all multiplayer <i>Halo</i> PC games.</p>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> This grenade can be bounced around corners and travels farther than the <i>Plasma grenade</i>. It is also harder to see and has a shorter fuse, therefore making it harder to avoid and more useful for killing enemies on foot.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Unlike the <i>Plasma grenade</i>, this grenade doesn't stick to objects, making it harder to hit vehicles. Since it is harder to see, running over one by accident can happen more easily than with a luminescent plasma grenade.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Tactics:</b> A multipurpose weapon, the fragmentation grenade can be used in corridors to flush out occupants. If lobbed under a vehicle, the explosion will either kill or severely injure the occupants. If timed correctly, grenades can be planted in the path of an oncoming vehicle. Most drivers will not be able to react quickly enough, and will most likely be caught in the blast.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> All Covenant, Flood, Vehicles</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_List_of_weapons_in_Halo%7E_Combat_Evolved_29e4.html" title="Edit section: Covenant weapons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Covenant weapons</span></h2>
<p>The weaponry of the Covenant is mostly energy based, in contrast to the human ballistic armaments. The mode of operation of many of the weapons is unknown, but most tend to rely on highly charged, slow-moving plasma bursts for damage. Most Covenant weapons do not take ammunition, rather, they rely on batteries, unable to be recharged. As a result, these weapons have to be discarded when the battery wears out. A notable exception to the battery is the Needler, which instead uses small crystalline splinter projectiles. On average, Covenant weapons cause great damage to shields and significantly less to unshielded organisms; this is to balance the human arsenal, which causes less damage to shields but more to flesh.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Plasma pistol</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> Capable of quickly firing low-powered shots, or of firing a single high-powered blast which tracks its target to some degree. This blast is capable of immediately dissipating Spartans', Elites', and Jackals' shields. It holds five rounds to 1% battery, and 10 overcharges to 100% battery. It will also instantly destroy an unshielded Sentinel with one Overcharge shot. An overcharged shot will also usually knock down or kill a flood combat form, buying the player time to switch to a more effective weapon. The Overcharged shot can kill a Grunt Jackel and more on low difficulties. The low-powered shots, however, can be fired faster than those of the Plasma Rifle.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Overheats when fired rapidly for extended periods, and overcharge uses 11 percent of the charge. Also, the rounds are low-powered and the charged shot is not fully homing and dissipates at long distances. Battery can not be recharged.</p>
<p><b>Influences:</b> The Plasma pistol was inspired by the human "Zeus-class fusion pistol" from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a> series.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> The only saving grace with the Plasma pistol is the overcharge shot, which brings down shields instantly. It is useful to bring down the enemy's shields with an overcharge for a quick pistol headshot or melee kill. Also, it will bring down the driver of a vehicle's shields down with a single overcharge shot, leaving them extremely vulnerable. Its low powered shots have the longest range of non sniping/heavy weapons. However, their low speed makes them easy to avoid.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> Grunts, Jackals, Elites (Disabling Shields), and Sentinels</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Plasma rifle</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> Rapid fire gun which takes longer to overheat than the plasma pistol. The plasma rifle has a much smaller radius of fire than the assault rifle. The plasma hinders the target's movement, making them easier for allies to take out. Like other plasma weapons, it can be used to disable an Elite's shield, after which the player can kill it with a headshot from the pistol.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Its accuracy degrades severely as it heats up. Overheats with four seconds of sustained fire. Manual fire is more accurate but slower than automatic fire. Battery can not be recharged.</p>
<p><b>Influences:</b> The Plasma rifle was probably inspired by the generic "alien weapon" from the <i>Marathon</i> series, due to the fact that both possess rapid fire and are inaccurate at long ranges.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> A more or less ignored weapon in large maps, due to its low power and accuracy, the Plasma rifle shows the most efficiency in small/medium spaces or when close to a target. However, it is often preferred over the assault rifle, due to higher accuracy and the capacity to momentarily immobilize an opponent when used as suppressive fire. Covenant weapons deplete shields better than human weapons, and as such the plasma rifle can be used in conjunction with a human weapon to quickly deplete an opponent's shields and then destroy his or her health.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> All Covenant, Sentinels, Flood spores (infection type).</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Needler</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> This weapon fires tracking needles that embed themselves in the flesh of a target. Rate of fire increases with continuous fire, up to 20 rounds in 2 seconds (one complete clip). If a large number of needles (7 or higher) accumulate in the target, an explosion will occur, causing small splash damage. Needles can penetrate the energy shields of Elites/Sentinels/Spartans (and the Master Chief), but not the hand-held shields of Jackals and Hunters.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Needles are slow, and are not effective against vehicles. The needles also take time to hit/explode on the target, leaving the target time to move in and cause some of the explosion to damage the shooter. It is nearly impossible to hit invisible Elites with the Needler, as they do not home to camouflaged targets. While shooting Flood with it may be effective, they can often come close enough to damage the player with the splash damage from the explosion, due to Flood forms' speed.</p>
<p><b>Influence:</b> The needler was inspired by the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flechette.html" title="Flechette">Flechette</a> gun from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)"><i>Marathon</i></a> series.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> The needler is an all-purpose weapon, particularly useful for annoying opponents with heavy weapons, since the needles discharge before the opponent can home in on the target. Also, the fact that the needles home onto target make it a good weapon when riding shotgun on the Warthog, as the Warthog's motion makes aiming difficult. However, the opponent can dodge these needles by hiding behind cover, so this weapon is best used in large open areas. The Needler is also highly effective against long-range or hard-to-see enemies; merely point in the general direction of your opponent, and the needles will home in on the target.</p>
<p><b>Effective Against:</b> Elites, Grunts, Sentinels, small groups of tightly packed Flood.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Fuel rod gun</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Advantages: (PC/Mac Multiplayer Only)</b> This weapon is powerful, fast-firing, and can shoot over obstacles due to the arching trajectory of its projectiles. It is the Covenant version of the rocket launcher, but with faster firing and no reloading. It can be used to bombard enemies from afar or high up and spread damage across a wider area. Although a Fuel Rod round travels at a speed only slightly faster than a rocket, its faster rate of fire can send smaller vehicles flying. This weapon is also preferable to a rocket launcher when firing at fast moving ground-vehicles such as the warthog. Going head to head with the Rocket Launcher, this weapon is more effective when on flat terrain or at the bottom of a hill - the opponent can simply dodge rockets, but Fuel Rod shots in quick succession will provide a kill with no need to get to higher ground.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> The battery is the same one as used by the Plasma pistol/rifle, so it runs out of power fairly quickly, and is subject to overheating. It may also hurt or kill the user if fired at close range. Its accuracy is much like the plasma rifle's, very accurate at cool temperatures but very inaccurate as heat reaches maximum. There are also very few per map (in a map like "Blood Gulch" for example there is only one). The huge green projectiles leave a faint green trail which can give away your position, and it obstructs your visibility when carrying it due to its size. Finally, it takes two to three direct hits, as opposed to one with the Rocket Launcher, to kill an opponent.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> The ultimately annoying weapon, this can wipe out whole groups of enemies with a few shots and can bombard enemy bases from far away. If used in closed spaces it is devastating, and can be used as a substitute for the Rocket Launcher if in a advantageous position. A player with this weapon can become an unstoppable juggernaut with good cover/backup. Good for CTF and Slayer.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Plasma grenade</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The plasma grenade is the covenant's standard, blue-glowing, grenade. Four can be carried at a time (in addition to four fragmentation grenades). Sticking the grenade onto a target will result in an instant kill after it explodes, while it does severe damage to and sometimes instantly destroys vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> The most unique feature about this grenade is that it has the ability to stick itself to its target, while bouncing off of surroundings. In other words, the grenade sticks to vehicles and targets, damaging or destroying them, and doing splash damage to everything nearby. This makes the plasma grenade ideal for destroying vehicles such as Banshees, or enemies like the Sentinel, which are difficult to destroy with a Frag grenade. However, it will not stick to walls, trees or the handheld shields wielded by Jackals and Hunters.</p>
<p>Sticking a grenade onto a target in campaign mode will stun the target for a few moments, allowing the player time to retreat, and it is impossible to remove the grenade once it has locked on.</p>
<p>Often, if the player confronts a group of grunts and elites, they should try to stick the plasma grenade onto a grunt, as they tend to run towards elites and other covenant screaming, "get it off!"</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Although the grenade can stick to opponents, its same mechanism allows it to stick to friendly forces as well. This means that the grenade can and will stick to Marines, and it is possible, though difficult, to stick oneself with the grenade (even by accident). In addition, this grenade, when activated, glows a light blue, making it far easier to see than the human grenade. The plasma grenade has a longer fuse (3 seconds), making it easier to avoid. It also does not bounce. After it hits steady ground, it remains there, unless an explosion moves the grenade.</p>
<p>Some enemies, especially high-level elites, will do a kamikaze if the grenade is stuck to them, charging at the player, screaming in rage. If they get close enough before the grenade detonates or the player kills them, the grenade will often kill the player. Also, it is imprudent to throw this grenade at any form of the Flood, due to their tendency to charge the player. If thrown on the nose of a Banshee, the pilot will disarm the grenade by ramming the Banshee's nose into the ground.</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer Role:</b> The plasma grenade can destroy the occupant of just about any vehicle, close proximity provided. A useful tactic is to distract the vehicle's driver and stick the vehicle with a plasma grenade before getting run over, killing the occupant. This even works on Banshees and Scorpions, instantly killing or seriously injuring the pilot (the grenade must be planted near the cockpit of a tank such as the Wraith or Scorpion for any substantial damage to shielding). Unlike campaign mode, however, most opponents in multiplayer will rush when "stickied" in the hopes of bringing their attacker down with them. Because of its long fuse, however it is possible to abandon a vehicle before it detonates, though getting clear enough of the explosion to avoid severe damage is usually down to luck.</p>
