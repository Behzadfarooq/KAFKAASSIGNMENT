<p>Alyeska:</p>
<p>Greetings! Thanks for your note and for pointing this out. This count varies according to who you connect with, what has been observed (and not) in the TNG movies, and on production diagrams of the ship from the powers that be. OK: I've made editions that I thought were correct. Let's recap:</p>
<p>Original version - 5 launchers total, comprised of: 1 forward (quantum torpedo) launcher, ventral saucer (near Captain's Yacht) 2 forward launchers, ventral engineering hull (near navigational deflector) 2 aft launchers, ventral engineering hull (on aft hull undercut)</p>
<p>Refitted version - 10 launchers total, comprised of above launchers and: 1 forward launcher, dorsal saucer (near deck 3/4) 2 aft launchers, dorsal saucer (near aft docking port) 1 aft launcher, dorsal engineering hull (above shuttlebay) 1 aft launcher, ventral engineering hull (below shuttlebay)</p>
<p>Not all of these are observed firing but are either noted on production diagrams or can be observed on the ship if you look closely. I previously included the quantum torpedo launcher with all of them and then totalled badly ... oops! So, I've changed the page to reflect the above noted count. Let me know if you've any questions. Thanks again!</p>
<p>User:E Pluribus Anthony</p>
<hr />
<p>Alyeska:</p>
<p>Hi there; thanks for your reply and clarifications. Actually, I think you and I are on the same page but use different terminology:</p>
<dl>
<dd>2 launchers in twin configuration near the upper shuttlebay and docking facility SAME AS 2 aft launchers, dorsal saucer (near aft docking port).</dd>
<dd>1 launcher just above the lower shuttlebay SAME AS 1 aft launcher, dorsal engineering hull (above shuttlebay).</dd>
<dd>1 launcher just forward and below the main bridge and surounding deck area SAME AS 1 forward launcher, dorsal saucer (near deck 3/4).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I did not note the forward launcher on production diagrams near the transporter emitters on the saucer dorsal, since this is not observed (or at leas clearly) when closely inspecting the Nemesis DVD.</p>
<p>I believe the only divergence of opinion you and I really have concerns only one launcher: the aft (ventral) launcher on the structure underneath the lower shuttlebay. 'Refit' diagrams indicate the launcher is there and I believe it can be observed on close inspection of the movie: refer to scenes in the DVD when (1) the Enterprise-E arrives at Kolarus III near the beginning, and (2) one of the final scenes when the ship is in spacedock being repaired.</p>
<p>As well, be careful about referencing or characterising edits which are as valid as yours as 'screwing' with them; who are you again?</p>
<p>If you think differently, feel free to indicate. Thanks again for your review.</p>
<p>Anthony</p>
<hr />
<p>Alyeska:</p>
<p>Hi there! Thanks for your reply. The aft launcher of note, if indeed it is one!, is likely smaller because it is single and largely within the frame/structure of the ship. I would think it similar to the forward dorsal launcher on deck 3/4. The aperture, though, need only be at least 0.8 m in size, the approximate width of a torpedo (and allowing for some clearance), and this definitely appears to be the case. However, that aperture can just as easily be some sorta purge vent or pleasure shaft.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Also, mere reliance on production drawings can be dubious; however, the arrows on the diagram do point to the location of the aft torpedo we are debating about (though the launcher is far less apparent in Nemesis). I would imagine that the quality and authority of the diagrams is somewhat questionable since they are not full-up schematics and since these do not fully agree with film evidence (which alone should be canon). Of course there are discrepancies between these things but, ultimately, the content we include in Wikipedia should be based on authoritative sources or empirical knowledge.</p>
<p>Believe me: I find it nonsensical that such a ship has a heavy aft torpedo complement, unless each of those weapons (a possibility) have lower capacities than the forward tubes. It makes one wonder, though, why 'Starfleet' (in this case, Eaves and company) would design or refit a ship with such an unbalanced weaponry arrangement.</p>
<p>To preclude an edit war, since we can both be right or wrong, I propose we enter this into a public forum or consult other (online) sources to resolve this issue. I'll keep the weapon counts as you've edited them but will change them again if needed.</p>
<p>Anthony</p>
<hr />
<p>Hmmm; your reasoning is very selective. One of the forward dorsal launchers on the refit diagrams (near the transporter emitters, very upfront) cannot be observed on the actual ship and we concur it is not there. As well, one of the newer forward launchers on deck 3/4 (forward) is not large at all, as its aperture alone is present ... and is likely similar to the aft launcher under the shuttlebay or even over it. Of course all of these appear different since they are located on different surfaces for which the details cannot be resolved clearly enough.</p>
<p>By the way, which pages agree on this basic consensus? We are supposed to cite contributions and, particularly, if they are challenged. I will do the same shortly.</p>
<p>I will await other contributions before making any other commentary or editions. Thanks!</p>
<p>Anthony</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for the info and references. Unfortunately, there are no references that you cite that prove or discount the rear launcher I contend is there. My contention is that--if the rear launcher exists--it is similar in structure to the forward launcher near the bridge. It is not as apparent as the forward launcher, but that doesn't discount its existence and nothing discussed yet has changed my perspective on this. I'm also unsure the rear launcher that may exist is smaller than the forward launcher near the bridge. Remember: only the aperture needs to appear, with considerable machinery in the deck structure forward.</p>
<p>Trust me, I'm inclined to give the Sovereign a more balanced weapon layout and omit it outright, but have not yet been convinced--given that damned diagram and the appearance of the port in the movie--that it doesn't exist. I'll see what others contribute before making any more judgements.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>Anthony</p>
<hr />
<p>Since you have not conclusively convinced me regarding the rear torpedo launcher in question and given the preponderance of canon information, I have edited the torpedo count as indicated as a compromise. Unless you can convince or demonstrate reasonably that this is not the case, further attempts to revert the count will be corrected to the current version.</p>

<p>Please understand where I am coming from. I am a long-time Star Trek fan as well. If you check the edit histories of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Sternbach_95e0.html" title="Rick Sternbach">Rick Sternbach</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_D._Moore_9761.html" title="Ronald D.

However I don't think we should be including content here which is filled with guesswork, and stuff from non-canon sources that is very likely to be inaccurate. BTW You can't say all the data you are entering on these specification lists is accurate, when it is clear from your own talk page that you are negotiating stats with other people.

<p>I tend to agree that after a single recreation an article should not be given protected deletion. I miss-read the delete log and thought that it had bgeen deleted for recreation multiple times (it apparently was undelted and redeleted to export some of the content). However, I can't think of another use for this article title besides writing about this website which (apparently) isn't notable. I think whether it should have been protected like this is a toss up. The amount of sockupuppetry in the VfD suggests that there will be more such attempts to recreate the article in any case. Also, the "proper channels" you cite (for future use) wouldn't be simply rewriting the article at its current location since it could be speedied at any time anyways. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue">This link is</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> 21:26, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Being a moderator on the forum does not necessarily mean you own the copyright on the website's logo.

<p>The idea with the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> thing is that when you add information to Wikipedia, if there is a chance that someone is going to dispute it, you list your source(s). That way someone else can come along, read your sources and go "Okay I get where they got that." Does that make sense? A few years from now, even if none of us are still currently around on Wikipedia, other people can come to the pages we have edited and see where we got our information.</p>
<p>That is why your stats are a problem. You can't just say "these are correct", you have to explicitly point to your sources. Does that make any sense? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 23:03, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anything derived from visuals can be verified through screen shots and examinations of the physical models. Methods might be disputed, but some very clear pieces of information do come from the counting method which any rational person with moderate education is going to agree with. Some people do indeed disagree with such information, but these people are invariably poorly educated on the subject matter and have a poor understanding of the methods being used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps a Wiki page dedicated to detail how screenshot methodology works would be a good start. Any material sourced via this method can link to this Wiki page to explain methodology and give ametuers a much better understanding. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 23:17, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But the sources have to be linked on the page. The sources for information on the Galaxy class page are meant to be on the Galaxy class page. The sources for information on the Akira class page are meant to be on the Akira class page. That is <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html#When_to_cite_sources" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">policy</a>. We can't just redirect to another generic page and explain in abstract where the information is sourced. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 23:23, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So create another page for each ship. Screenshots with clearly labeled aspects of what is being posted as factual in the article itself. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 23:25, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are known variations in ship classes. The Sovereign herself recieved some changes between Insurrection and Nemesis. Rather then say all ships are identical, known differences can be identified. The Nebula page already had information diferientiating the normal Nebula style from the Phoenix subtype. I am generaly correct on these issues, but if someone can point out information I missed, I am more then willing to admit mistake and support fixing the article. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 01:56, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And once again you fail to grasp the very simple meaning of the Original Research rule. The visuals are primary source material because they are derived straight from canon. Anything to do with visuals quite simply can not violate the original research rule. If you stretch visuals to be a violation of the rule, then the entire article itself is a rules violation because dialogue is also original research. You are taking the original Research rule out of context, and then cherry picking its enforcement. Furthermore, you incorrectly site the original research rule against the TMs themselves. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 20:46, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry but it is you who doesn't grasp the OR rule. Yes, screenshots are primary sources. But the analysis is not. You keep talking as if no-one is going to disagree with your analysis, that your analysis is purely factual. But I've listed one example where I disagree, E. Pluribus Anthony disagreed with your analysis of the Sovereign class, etc etc. The idea with the original research rule, the verifiability rule and so on is that information here is backed up. That someone can read the information here and understand where it came from. There is a difference between saying Picard is bald based on a screenshot, from saying that indistinct squares or dark marks on the badly lit surface of something that is blurred as it flashes past the camera is a torpedo launcher. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 21:31, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simply claiming that people will disagree is a copout. Your drawing an imaginary line on the issue. Either Visuals are in or they are out. Which means that the likes of images of the ships and basic descriptions go along with weapon systems. Your making issues of certain things and drawing a broad brush to paint the entire issue. Phaser arrays are infinitely easier to count then torpedo launchers, and other items in the Specifications come straight from dialogue, which you removed anyway. Your not actualy trying to solve anything here. And once and for all, I already pointed out where it specifical states that sources from non-reputable pieces. It said NOTHING about analysis of reputable primary sources. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 01:38, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If phaser arrays are so easy to count then how did you miss the two on the Nebula class that I've pointed to repeatedly?

<dd>There are three different models of the Nebula that were created by Paramount. The Phoenix, the Sutherland, and then for Generations they created the Faragut model.

<dd>It appears that they did infact canabalize/alter the previous model for the purpose of making the new one. The phaser counts never changed on the models, though on the Faragut the lighting was absolutely terrible and difficult to spot two phasers making for the confussion between a 5 or 7 count. I got swayed on the 5 phaser count issue at one point, but your rather "pleasent" response to me in the Nebula thread highlighted the issue of the terrible lighting spotting the 6th and 7th phasers. However, the Sutherland and future updates did have a different pod, one which does have an observed torpedo launcher whereas the Phoenix does not. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 02:06, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About the merged starship pages. Firstly please don't accuse me of doing things that I have not done. I only restored the redirects that you reverted and pointed the template back to the merged pages. In the six months since I merged the pages, a large number of edits have been made by many people to those merged pages. The redirected pages haven't been touched in that same time. So the versions you restored recently are out of date. And please don't complain that I didn't seek other people's opinion, when you never felt the need before you performed your reverts. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 18:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alyeska. I see from above that you have already had problems with this image in the past...</p>
<p>Basically, any image which is being used under fair use can't be used on user pages - only in "main space" articles. So if this is a copyrighted image for which fair usage is cited, you can't use it on your user page. I'm sorry if that's not what you were hoping to hear.</p>
<p>You mention that you weren't notified, but if you had added the image to your watchlist you would have seen that it was tagged in January as an orphaned fair use image. However, even if that had been the case, you still wouldn't be able to use it on your user page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the deletion can't be reversed, as once images on Wikipedia are deleted, they're gone. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 17:35, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, when images are speedy deletable, there's no need to notify people. That's the whole point of the speedy deletion process. If people tag and source images correctly, use images correctly and add images they care about to their watchlists, there won't be any problems. If you disagree with the speedy deletion process, you may wish to take this up at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 17:45, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please stop taking it out on me if you disagree with the workings of the image deletion process. Part of the process is to remove links to the image - that's what I did. Again, if you disagree with the process, take it up at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>. Please stop getting angry at me, when I've done nothing wrong. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 17:57, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, if people were notified before images could be speedy deleted, the backlogs would never be cleared and even more server space would be clogged up. Again, add images which are important to you to your watch list - that way you <b>will</b> be notified when they are tagged as due for deletion. By using an image tagged as fair use on your user page, you've violated policy, so I'm not sure why you're continuing to berate me. You can continue to complain about my actions on my user page if you like, but I really don't think that I have anything more to add from my side since I wish to remain civil and will not allow you to provoke me any further with your unfounded complaints. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 18:15, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that I've cooled off, are the changes made to the page enough of a compromise? After reading about inclusion of media information in firearms pages, yes, I was wrong. A media section has been added. The wallpaper you chose is not free domain. Beretta has released it for individual use. The picture I have posted had much the same options and view angle. Also, it has the added benefit of being free use (I have released all rights). Ajaka</p>

<p>Actually, it has NOT been discussed (or at least not by me). The Daedalus itself may have been referred to as a 'Battlecruiser' by Mckay in mid-conversation, but in fact it is officially called a 'Deep Space Carrier'. If you watch season 9 episode, 'Off the Grid', you can clearly see its designation along with its registry number PB3865, on the background monitor in the conference room aboard the Odyssey. The Odyssey is the same class of ship as the Daedalus, and therefore it stands to reason that BOTH are 'Deep Space Carriers', not 'Battlecruisers'. -Seastallion</p>
<p>If this has been discussed, then please direct me to where, so that I may review all sides of the discussion for myself. I'm a long time Stargate fan, and a regular in the Gateworld sci. &amp; tech forum, where this has also been discussed at length. Even the Gateworld Omnipedia (which has close access to the creators of Stargate) specifically states that these ships are called Deep Space Carriers. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeastallion_7b9c.html" title="User:Seastallion">Seastallion</a> 19:25, 21 August 2006 (UTC)Seastallion 15:25 21 Aug. 2006</p>
<p>Okay. I've looked at the discussion on it, and it was NOT at all resolved. The very last comment on the matter was that the designation of 'Deep Space Carrier' SHOULD at the very least be included in the article. Did you even see that? Or are you simply going to ignore it? I am in complete agreement with that person. It should NOT be ignored, yet you deleted my edit in which I tried to compromise with you. I will suggest to you again that we change it to include both designations, because their is sufficient evidence from the show to support it. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it isn't so. The FACTS of the show support the designation, and therefore it is deserving of inclusion. Also, YOU are not the only long time fan of the show. I think it is very cool that you helped run a website about Stargate, but that alone does not make you the final authority on all things stargate. ANYONE can run a website and say anything they want, but that doesn't make it so. For you to ignore a detail as I've suggested above is not professional (if that is what we're attempting). I suggest once more; we should change the designation to the BC-304, as Battlcruiser / Deep Space Carrier. This is fair, and if need be than we can add a note about it. It is not right that a vital detail be ignored as specifically seen on the show. It is not a matter of speculation, it is a matter of what is on the show. Therefore, it should be included. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeastallion_7b9c.html" title="User:Seastallion">Seastallion</a> 03:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That the current designation of the Odyssey (and indeed ALL Daedalus class ships), is currently 'in question' is NOT a Point of View. It is a fact. I am not the only one who with the 'view' that the Odyssey's designation is 'Deep Space Carrier'. Just as YOU are not the only one who ignores it in favor of 'Battlecruiser'. It is VERY much in dispute. Also the fact that you have it designated specifically as a Battlecruiser in the BOLD title section of the article, is also VERY much a violation of 'Point of View'. MY motives are to be 'accurate', which is why I at least agreed to comprimise with you, but apparently even THAT is not enough. I was content to simply allow a small note in the main article, rather than push a major change. Wikipedia does NOT belong to you. It is SUPPOSED to be a collabrative effort. Which means, that the TV show's reference to the Odyssey as being a 'Deep Space Carrier' (which IS factual) ought not to bother you. I have to wonder about YOUR motivation in consistently ignoring this fact. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeastallion_7b9c.html" title="User:Seastallion">Seastallion</a> 21:17, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alyeska, I did NOT miss when Landry (on multiple occasions) called it a 304, but it's not a 304 class, it's Daedalus class as stated by senate in "The Ties That Bind", calling it a 304 class ship is wrong. It's the hull numbering or whatever you call it but it's class name is <i>Daedalus</i></p>

<p>I didn't mean that exactly, what I meant is that you should not go and change every mention of the word <i>Daedalus class</i> to being <i>304 class</i>, the way I can put it simply is that it's a <i>Daedalus</i> class ship and it's <i>make</i> for the lack of a better term to explain it is <i>304</i>. I know those aren't official terms but it's the best way I can put it.</p>

<p><b>INVOLVING JIMBO</b></p>
<p><br />
I'd like to add some additional recommendations for people who'd like to appeal such cases directly to me (Jimbo).</p>
<p>First, it's very important that you write me a minimum of six pages of text explaining and defending the version that you prefer. The more tedious details, the better. I'm specifically keenly interested in the names of obscure rivers in <s>Germany</s> <s>Poland</s> Prussia. Also, be sure to write to me about the shape of Bigfoot's head. I really am the person to make a decision about that.</p>
<p>Second, everyone knows that I make it a routine practice to force articles to read exactly the way that you like. I also ban longtime users and sysops whenever I feel like, just based on the say-so of people just like you. So be sure to ask for that.</p>
<p>Third, better yet, don't ask for it, demand it. Threaten to leave if I don't comply within 24 hours. That always works.</p>
<p>Fourth, if you happen to know that I'm personally politically sympathetic to your point of view, feel free to call your opponents names. For example, since I'm generally sympathetic to Israel, feel free to call anyone who has written anything critical of Israel a "Nazi." I'll get so excited that I'll probably ban them. Heck, I might even write new code in the software to only let you and people you approve edit the pages!</p>
<p>And finally, if for some insane reason I don't act on your wise proposals, tell everyone that you know that Wikipedia is all a scam to make money. It's a tool of capitalist oppression. It's a liberal playground with no standards. It's based on the principles of communism. It's collectivist. It's individualist. It's useless. It's the most important thing in the world, except for me screwing it up. That'll show old Jimbo who he's messing with!</p>

<p>There is no excuse for personal attacks on other users. You need to stop making them unless you want to get blocked from editing. I'm referring to your recent post on Calton's page; posting relevant Wikipedia policy for your information, as Calton does, is an appropriate action, it's not "hiding behind policy". Please study those policies instead of lashing out at the person pointing them out.</p>
<p>I would also be interested to understand the logic of why you choose to have an attack on the project on your userpage, at the same time as you spend time here. It doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>I've removed the attack against <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">User:AlistairMcMillan</a> from your userpage. Don't put anything like that on any of your pages again. Please edit civilly in the future altogether, even if you feel riled by other editors or indeed by the project itself. Count to ten or something, and please remember that everything you post on Wikipedia stays on Wikipedia, available through page histories. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Telling the truth is not a personal attack. Furthermore, you are not welcome to edit my personal page. What I have posted about Allister is very much the truth.

<dd>You need to stop telling experienced users that intervening against your policy violations is not their business, because it is. As a Wikipedia administrator, I <i>am</i> involved with any policy violations I see on the site. So are other experienced users: Calton, for instance, knows more about policy than many admins, and obviously a whole lot more than you do. Since you ignored my civil request to not restore the personal attack on your userpage, I have removed it again and, this time, protected the page from editing except by administrators. Please let me know when you're ready to keep your userpage reasonably civil (it's far from polite as it is, either, but not restoring the attack against Alistair is the only thing I'm insisting on at this point in time). I won't take the trouble to post links for you about the userpage policies you're violating, since Calton already has, and you don't seem to have bothered to click on them. Please read his links, they contain all you need to know about the amount of control you have of your userpages.

<dd>Nooo, she didn't—how did you get that from that? Zoe made it clear that you don't control who <i>posts</i> on your talkpage. You do control what <i>stays</i> on it. This issue is much debated,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> but there's current strong consensus on the administrator's noticeboard that you can remove anything you want from your talkpage, at least provided you're not a mere anonymous vandal. It's <i>rude</i> to remove people's comments without responding, but it's up to you if you want to be that rude. It's quite inappropriate to try to force other users to keep keep something on their pages, or to force them to archive. (The History is an archive in itself.) Please see "User space harassment" in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a>, and several threads recently on the noticeboard, e. g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=84458571#Continuous_talk_page_blanking" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=84458571#Continuous_talk_page_blanking" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=84458571#User_removes_my_comments_from_his_talk_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=84458571#User_removes_my_comments_from_his_talk_page" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Templates about not removing warnings, and block threats, are for anonymous vandals, not for cases like this. Avoid unhealthy fascination with <i>other</i> users' talkpages, and just refer people to this post of mine if they say you can't remove stuff from yours. Alyeska, I understand that you may have been told the opposite, even by admins, but this is the real thing, as you'll see if you check out my <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">admin noticeboard</a> links. Wikipedia policy <i>is</i> very confusing and sometimes seemingly self-contradictory for new users, and to make it worse individual admins aren't always caught up in the most debated areas (it's pretty much impossible to be always caught up about all of policy), because policy evolves organically: it's what we actually do, by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>, it's not commandments handed down from above. The policy pages are constantly edited to reflect practice.

<dd>Your opinion of my behavior may very well be well grounded. However, your final statements I find most interesting. In effect I am doing the opposite. I am trying to prevent other people from altering my personal pages. These are not Wiki pages, these are user pages. Fancruft doesn't come into play with these. And I do not take kindly to be accused of modifying others user pages. I have never done that nor will I. What I did is revert your blanking if our discussion on your talk page. As told to me by multiple Administrators, a user is not allowed to blank their own talk page. If you check the BF2 ranks MFD page you will even find an administrator threatening me with a block because the Admin wrongly assumed I was threatening to revert edits in my talk page. So kindly knock off the threats. As to my behavior, I consider it justified seeing as certain individuals have seen fit to make personal attacks against my interests on Wikipedia. Calton went so far as to create a hit list to have every one of my user pages deleted regardless of circumstances. I take personal attacks rather <i>personaly</i>. My behavior is my own decision and I don't take such overt criticisms kindly. If you check my edit history you will note that I do not troll Wikipedia and that I make a point of trying to better it. I just have zero confidence in Wikipedia and have a poor opinion of Wikipedia policy seeing how it has been selectively used against my interests in the past. I consider my lack of confidence in Wikipedia policy well founded and I find it further insulting that people question this without researching the history behind it. I am not questioning your presence on Wikipedia, and I am wondering why you are questioning mine. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 23:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>However, I wish to point something out, and I hope you take it in the spirit that it is intended. You cannot win this fight. Calton is a snark, but he's a snark who <i>very simply never</i> does anything outside of policy. I don't like the way he acts sometimes but the man is a relentlessly dedicated contributor and editor with a philosophy that (excluding user pages) pretty much matches my own. The more you get into a contest of wills with him, the more emotional you will become over it and eventually you <i>will</i> say something that is clearly offensive and get banned.</p>
<p>I don't want that. You shouldn't either. As frustrating as Wikipedia is, it can also be very rewarding. My personal interests are in mainline Christianity, in the game Neverwinter Nights, in the Chinese Communist party that murdered my parents, and in Scientology which I despise. I <b>never</b> let myself edit, vote for deletion, or even interact with those pages, because I know <i>the potential is there for me to become emotionally involved</i>, and that leads to some admin who's having a bad day going upside your head with a banhammer. I never edit what I am intensely interested in -- I try to find new interests.</p>
<p>I implore you to let this drop. Copy it to your hard drive, and work on it off Wikipedia. There are others here who would be happy to do that with you. Don't get worked up over it because unfortunately the policy about user pages is so vague that people have been hardbanned over them. There is more here if you find it. Either way it goes, good luck. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 00:34, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're welcome, just kidding. Anyway, excuse me for NOT wanting to start an edit war. Plus I thought you said you didn't check that page because of things like that.</p>
<p>You know, this is really the last message one wants to read when they wake up as the first thing.</p>
