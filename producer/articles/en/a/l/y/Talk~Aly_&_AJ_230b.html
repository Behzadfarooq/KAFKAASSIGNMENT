<p>There are currently six pictures on this page. Even the thumbnailed versions are a little large.

<dd>You are absolutley correct. I have added that many photos because I have had a very difficult time selceting which ones to keep. I think that keeping Image:Aly&amp;AJ1WEST.jpg and Image:Aly&amp;AJ1WEST.jpg is a very good idea. I definetley am going to remove the CD album cover and small press-release Ice Princess premier photo, as it is of a bad quality. I will make sure to ask Aly and AJ (yes, I know them) for their opinions later. For now I am going to keep the following: Image:Aly&amp;AJ1WEST.jpg, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikimage_1.jpg_4ef5.html" title="Image:Wikimage 1.jpg">Image:Wikimage_1.jpg</a>, and a small (I mean a real thumbnail, in comparrison to my current "thumbnails") version of Image:Aly and aj 20.jpg. --<a href="../../../v/m/a/User%7EVmatikov_1c5b.html" title="User:Vmatikov">Vmatikov</a></dd>

<p>Are these sections really necessary? "Similar artists" is a very vague term, and any given artist could be influenced by hundreds of sources, many of which do not merit Wikipedia articles.

<dd>Which interview are we talking about? The article references at least two. If you are talking about the interview where they proclaim their disbelief in evolution, I think it is very much relevant. They obviously believe it is relevant enough to proclaim unto the world and in any case, the article doesn't exist solely as marketing. I know this is not what you are even remotely implying, Rosepuff, I just think it is very relevant. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 14:30, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also think the information should stay. It was their choice to bring it up in a public manner. Also, it's at least partially related to the other things mentioned in that paragraph - their mother belonging to a Christian music group, the fact that they are home schooled. If it doesn't seem like it flows properly in the article, that can be changed over time as people add more information and context about Aly &amp; AJ, but the raw info, including their quotes, should definitely stay, in my opinion. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent-A_cc03.html" title="User:Serpent-A">Serpent-A</a> 19:14, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I should really point out that both Alyson and Amanda use Code Names when they are credited for their musical works, and I believe in code names. While this ain't no Metal Gear Solid "thing", the fact that Alyson and AJ uses "code names" or "pseudonyms" warrant the article to use their code names to credit them. Therefore, personally, and from my point-of-view, we should be addressing the Michalka sisters by their "code names", even though this ain't no military. I had to make a minor edit because using code names in this article (unless it's a single person) makes the article look more uniform IMO. Therefore, I appreciate if Alyson is code-named ALY and Amanda is code-named AJ, much like the record label. Thanks. — <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">Mark Kim</a> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">Reply/Start Talk</a>) 05:06, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright, let's settle this so we don't have a revert war. I see four distinct schools of thought on how to handle this evolution business. The two expressed their disbelief in the:</p>
<ol>
<li>process of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html#Science" title="Theory">theory</a> of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a></li>
<li>process of what they consider to be the 'theory' of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a></li>
<li>(this sentence should be removed because it does not belong in a brief overview encyclopedic biography)</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 4 is my preference. Is this really one of the most important things about these two? Is it even the most important thing from the <i>Blender</i> interview? To me, including it at all seems to be a POV attempt to ridicule Aly &amp; AJ, Christians, or both. (I am neither a Christian nor an Aly &amp; AJ fan, in case you were wondering.)</p>
<p>My second choice would be option 2, including the link I just added to what a <i>scientific</i> theory is. It's a shame scientifically illiterate people abuse the word theory, with regard to evolution, to make evolution seem less believable; but again, those people are usually scientifically illiterate. The fact is, as the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a> article explains, evolution fits exactly the definition of a scientific theory.</p>
<p>I don't understand the reversion to "process". Theory is the much more commonly understood term, and it makes more sense in the context of the sentence (to me). If you can show me verifiable sources that science has made a sea change to favor <i>process</i> over <i>theory</i>, fine, but I doubt that is the case. The function of theories in science is long established and important; I would be disappointed if the community changed its terminology for PR reasons.</p>
<p>As for option 3, the scare quotes are clearly a POV attempt to make it look like anyone who disbelieves evolution must be stupid, and that people who use the word theory to describe evolution are incorrect and are using it disparagingly. I trust I've discussed both points at length.</p>

<li>As you may know, I'm the one who changed it too <b>Option 3</b>, and that's not what I meant at all. I myself do not believe in the theory of evolution (nor see how anyone really can, once they've studied it), and I was merely trying to find an acceptable medium between the two arguements. I personally do not think that people who disregard evolution are stupid, on the contrary, I think they probably understand the theory better then most. I personally am glad that you reverted it, as I think that it, according to their beliefs, is the best option for the artice. I just wanted to clerify why I changed it the way I did, and to apologize for misleading anyone.

<p>Why are Aly and AJ classified and Christian artists? They don't make Christian music, with the exception of some of the religious songs on their Christmas album and one other song that has "God" appearing once in the lyrics.

<dd>As a matter of fact Acalamari, I suppose we are. I have compromised this arguement to include teen pop and Christian pop together on the page several weeks ago, but it seems you are leaning towards the popular opinion and are changing your mind. Aly &amp; AJ are, in fact, a teen pop and Christian pop duo. They received major promotion from Disney as a result of Alyson Michalka's involvement in the show <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_of_the_Future_bdcc.html" title="Phil of the Future">Phil of the Future</a>. After seeing they had reasonable success with <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Disney_49ba.html" title="Radio Disney">Radio Disney</a>, they decided to release singles to mainstream Top 40 radio and to Christian radio, where they released "Never Far Behind", which in turn peaked at #1 on the Christian R&amp;R this past year. They just recently released their second Christian radio only single, which is "Shine". Aly &amp; AJ have been featured in many popular Christian music magazines such as Christian Music Planet, Contemporary Christian Music, Christian Music Today, and others, in all of which they classified themselves as Christian pop singers, and also stating that they do not only make Christian pop, but also record secualar music for those outside of the Christian market. As well as being in magazines, they are also part of numerous Christian artist databases at popular Christian websites, the most significant being www.Jesusfreakhideout.com. And, most recently, they were nominated for Contemporary Inspirational Artist of the Year at the 2006 <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Music_Awards_e82d.html" title="American Music Awards">American Music Awards</a>. Contemporary Inspirational Artist of the Year is the same thing as Christian Artist of the Year, but the AMAs decided to change the name because some protested the use of the word Christian.

<dl>
<dd>Aly &amp; AJ had the amazing potential to present themselves as the Christian alternative to pop stars such as Hilary Duff among many others. Unfortunately, these sisters did not take this opportunity, but rather found themselves simply among the typical Radio Disney fare. Of course if this is what they were shooting for, then they have more than succeeded in their efforts.</dd>

<dd>That's correct Switchfo0t813, I did say that you were right in putting Christian Pop/Teen together, but I've changed my mind since then because I did some research. Also, if you read your Talk Page, you'll see that I "took the comment" back due to your personal attack. For your information, Aly &amp; AJ are pop, not Christian Pop. Aly &amp; AJ themselves are Christians, but their music is fairly religious-neutral. All because someone is religious doesn't mean that their music is. Alanis Morissette is a Buddhist, and a rocker. Does that make her a Buddhist-Rocker? No! She's a rocker; in fact, she's a Female Rocker. Avril Lavigne is Roman Catholic, and is a Punk-Rocker. Is she a Roman Catholic-Punk-Rocker? No! She is a Female Punk-Rocker. Lindsay Lohan is also Roman Catholic, but she's not a "Roman Catholic-Musician." This also applies to Aly &amp; AJ, who are Christians, but not "Christian-Musicians." They would only qualify as Christian-Musicians if they sang about their religion in their songs, which; of course, they don't. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 21:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I checked out that website, and Lauren Sommerford (the reviewer) is still listed as one of the current staff members. Obviously the review is only her opinion, that's what all reviews are. However, the review was posted there. If I didn't know <i>anything</i> about Aly &amp; AJ and went to jesusfreakhideout.com to see if their new record was a Christian one, I would find out that it was not. I'm sorry, but you still haven't provided us with consistent, confirming evidence that they should be labeled as a Christian act, and not just two musicians who happen to be Christians. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a> 23:53, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Enough Is Enough.</b> Switchfo0t813, you keep adding "Christian Pop" to their genre even though you are the only one here who thinks they are a Christian band. Even the website you purport to work for does not think they are a Christian band. I cannot find mention of them being a Christian band on their myspace page or their main website. You are deliberately adding false information to a band's page that contains people who are still alive; the way I see it, that's grounds for libel. They are certainly <b>musicians who are christians</b>, but they are not a <b>Christian band.</b> --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a> 22:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To start off, if you need proof that I work for www.jesusfreakhideout.com, please discuss that with me on my talk page. Secondly, you are correct in saying they do not list Christian pop as a genre on their MySpace page, nor on the home page on their official website. However, on their official message boards, one of their managers posted in a FAQ thread that they ARE a Christian group, but do not make music ONLY for Christians, because doing that would limit their audience, obviously, by a vast amount. You also fail to acknowledge the fact that they were nominated for Christian Artist of the Year at the 2006 American Music Awards, which I posted somewhere above. If the entire American Music Industry has come to conclude they should be nominated for such an award as that, they are obviously a Christian group, otherwise they would've been nominated for Pop Album of the Year. <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitchfo0t813_2031.html" title="User:Switchfo0t813">Switchfo0t813</a> 23:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Previously we settled on a compromise that we would include BOTH Christian pop and Teen pop, but someone decided to start removing Christian pop, although that is what part of their genre is.

<dd>Sorry, I changed it back to "Teen Pop" twice. I thought it was an error and didn't realize this was an issue. They don't make music that mentions Jesus or God except for one song, which wasn't even released on their main album. Disney made a deal with a Christian record label so their music could be released Christian radio stations, and they speak openly about their religious views unlike other Disney Channel stars, but their music is mainstream.<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukie010_2f9f.html" title="User:Dukie010">Dukie010</a> 05:15, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't need proof you work for them. I could not possibly care less about that. Their FAQ on their message board says they are Christians, not a Christian band. They were not nominated for Christian Artist of the Year, they were nominated for Favorite Contempary Inspirational Artist of the Year. Your claim that that means "Christian artist" is unsourced. They are not <i>obviously</i> a Christian group. The compromise asked for above would entail that we list Aly &amp; AJ under the genre they identify with; as of right now, that is <b>not</b> as a Christian band. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a> 03:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I have recognized this nomination in the past. However, I have not seen any verification of Switchfo0t813's claims that this award was formerly known as "Christian Artist of the Year." If all we are going by is the AMA nomination, then we need to change the genres of both Kirk Franklin and Casting Crowns to "Inspirational pop," as they were both nominated for the same award as Aly &amp; AJ. Luckily, however, on Wikipedia we don't pigeonhole bands into genres based only on what the AMA nominates them for. Lastly, a quick google search for "aly aj 'inspirational pop'" turns up but a paltry <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=aly+aj+%22inspirational+pop%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=aly+aj+%22inspirational+pop%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">3 hits</a>, while "aly aj 'teen pop'" turns up a whopping <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=aly+aj+%22teen+pop%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=aly+aj+%22teen+pop%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">16,000 hits</a>.

<dd>Common sense tells MOST people that Contemporary "Inspirational" means Christian. It was only changed recently. One year it was known as Christian Artist and the following year they all of a sudden changed the award name, most likely because saying "Christian" is offensive to people. Another fact is that <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casting_Crowns_42be.html" title="Casting Crowns">Casting Crowns</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Franklin_e3da.html" title="Kirk Franklin">Kirk Franklin</a> are WELL KNOWN Christian artists, which is why they were nominated in this category.

<dd>In response to the question addressed to me by Alan.ca: No, that is not what I am saying. For instance, the page for the band <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool_%28band%29.html" title="Tool (band)">Tool</a> has them classified as both alternative metal and progressive rock. This is fine with me, as those are the two genres with which the band identify.

<dd>Yes, I do. From the Christian music website <a href="http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com" rel="nofollow">"Jesus Freak Hideout"</a>, we have the following quote:
<dl>
<dd><b>Aly &amp; AJ had the amazing potential to present themselves as the Christian alternative to pop stars such as Hilary Duff among many others. Unfortunately, these sisters did not take this opportunity, but rather found themselves simply among the typical Radio Disney fare.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The same website lists their genre as "power pop," not "inspirational pop" as Switchfo0t813 claims the genre should be. Of course, we have to ignore the review for their other record on that same website, as it was written by someone who I strongly suspect to be Switchfo0t813 and therefore qualifies as original research.</dd>

The genre is Teen Pop per numerous sites. If you can find a verifiable source that says it's a different genre, then include it along with Teen pop and source it.

Switchfoot, you seem to be ignoring the mediation, but at the same time are still in favor of the unsourced genre. I've been wrong on Wikipedia many times and realized a different thing should be added, it's perfectly fine. No one is going to care or shove it in your face.

I just added a section on their page about Christian music, and how they do not want to be directly labeled as Christian artists. Sorry for the misunderstanding. <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitchfo0t813_2031.html" title="User:Switchfo0t813">Switchfo0t813</a> 19:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't <i>teen pop</i> more illustrative of their true genre?

<dd>Thank you. Yes, teen pop, for the time being, does seem to illustrate their genre the best the more that I think about it.

<dd>Ok, they have a Christmas album, and they only have 2 other Christian songs. But, they are teen pop singers. NOT christian music. Every artist has christian music once in a whle.

<p>I think the controversy section should be put up because they have been in a lot of controversy lately.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your messages when you leave messages. Anyway, how reliable is this source that you gave? Tommy2 or whatever it was doesn't sound like a decent source to me. Exactly what is going on with this "Aly &amp; AJ Clothing Incident" anyway? <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 16:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tommy2.net is a reliable source, its a teen news site. He posted critisim about their attire because he got alots of emails from concerned fans who thought they were heading down the wrong road due to the photos from the Ed Hardy event. You can find the photos at Aly-and-Aj source. I'm actually quite concerned about them. You can even email tommy if you want too. tommy2@tommy2.net.</dd>
<dd>-Cena(I'm not a memeber of wiki yet)
<dl>
<dd>A teen news site is not really a reliable source. All because this Tommy person says his news is real doesn't mean it really is. If, however, you could find more sources about this event besides Tommy2 (i.e. to cross-reference it), then we might be able to work the section into the article better (this isn't anything against you, it's just that when we get information about a controversial incident, it's best to find more than one source). Otherwise, it's likely the section will keep getting removed. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 17:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Why isn't it a reliable source? He never tells gossip. People sent concerned emails to him about the issue and thats why he posted that. -Cena</p>
<dl>
<dd>He may not post gossip, but what about the people who send him E-mails? They could be sending him things that aren't true. As I said, you want to put a controversy section in, so you should provide at least two sources. One source isn't enough. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 17:04, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just leave it, I found out that Tommy has some kind of a grudge on Aly &amp; Aj. Their attire is no different than it ever was, I looked through pics over the span of a year. I bought into what he was saying but people such as the editor of Christianity today told me not to buy into it. -Cena</p>
