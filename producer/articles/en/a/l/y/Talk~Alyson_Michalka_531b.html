<p>I don't know why it's relevant anyway, but her height on here (and IMDb) is wrong. They list her as 5' 8", but in February 2006, Aly said she was 5' 6" and AJ said she was 5' 5". Considering Aly is 17 years old and 75%-80% of girls are <i>done</i> growing by age 16 (and even more by age 17), I very much doubt she's going to be taller than this.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephe1987_e945.html" title="User:Stephe1987">Stephe1987</a> 01:20, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just took the height off. We know she is 5' 6", but some people (ignorantly) think she's 5' 8" just because IMDb says so. And their information is gotten by users, so it's wrong much of the time anyway, especially when it comes to heights. I could not believe that someone put Freddie Highmore at 5' 6" last July (and it still does list him as 5' 6"), when he is clearly less than 5', maybe 5' even, but no taller. And since height is not encyclopedic anyway (unless Aly is abnormally tall or short), it shouldn't be on there anyway. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephe1987_e945.html" title="User:Stephe1987">Stephe1987</a> 20:58, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw clauses indicating she was German added and removed a few times. Why was that? Does anyone have any source for or against that? If not I’m going to throw it back in on the German last name theory.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Based on records I have access to, her mother's last name is Begley and her paternal grandmother's was Martin. Based on matches for the last name Michalka, I presume their grandfather could have been anything along the lines of German/Austrian/Polish/Jewish (and the rest of their ancestry, as I implied, is Anglo-American). Don't know which. But there are no reliable sources that detail their heritage anywhere online, as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 08:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmmm…would the previous Germanic claims at least hold for that ¼ and would that justify the notation? Also, just out of curiosity, where did you find the other names?<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchrandit_2cad.html" title="User:Schrandit">Schrandit</a> 19:11, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ancestry.com has CAlifornia birth records - that's for her mother's maiden name, Begley (they list mother's maiden name). I found a Mark Michalka born in the 1950s who I presume is her father (it's such a rare name, so) - that's where I got "Martin". Do we have any reputable sources that mention German ancestry? All I could find are various trivia sites which copy each other, us, or the fan-submitted IMDB and are not reliable. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 19:47, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMDB is not a reliable source, nor, last time I checked, were any of the other sites that mention her background. As for "Jewish", you had REALLY better check out the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> and discover the wonder of Jewishness being an ethnicity (in fact, our article on "Jew" even includes the category "ethnic groups"). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 07:36, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Explain why each half of a duo who are not notable separate from each other should have separate articles when evrything that's in this individual articles is already in the article for the duo. There should not be three separate articles with the same information in them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that there is similar information in each article, but Alyson Michalka and Amanda Michalka are both notable picture, and in the future, their articles will differ. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 23:56, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand what "both notable picture" means. The simple fact is that as of <i>now</i> the two are not notable as individuals. They are only notable as members of the duo and the information in the individual articles is all but identical to the information in the duo article. If at some point in future they have solo careers or are in any other way notable as individuals, then fine, write separate articles. But separate articles for each girl to list the same discography, filmography and background information is pointless. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Heh, heh, I actually meant "both notable people." I do agree though that both articles need expansion. I don't think changing them both to redirects is the answer. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 01:02, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Expand them with what, exactly? What information is there that is pertinent to one and not the other? We are not talking about <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Bono_ac17.html" title="Sonny Bono">Sonny</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donny_Osmond_7b51.html" title="Donny Osmond">Donny</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Osmond_5f50.html" title="Marie Osmond">Marie</a> here. Look at the articles. All three talk about where they were born, all three talk about how they moved to Seattle with their parents, all three have filmographies and discographies. They do not have solo careers or independent ventures. The likelihood that someone will be looking for information about them as individuals as opposed to as a duo is extremely low.

<dd>Oh it does not either. A personal attack would be "only a moron would think these two deserve their own pages." Suggesting that your desire to keep the separate pages is based in personal fandom of the subjects doesn't come close to being a personal attack. That's absurd. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not keeping the articles "only because I like them." Yes, I do like Aly &amp; AJ, but that's not the only reason why I want to keep both the articles. Both pages have been in existence for well over a year, which I find weird that you choose now as the time to have both the pages turned into redirects. How about we do this then: let's remove the "dual filmography" section in <a href="../../../a/l/y/Aly_%26_AJ_0e76.html" title="Aly &amp; AJ">Aly &amp; AJ</a> and incorporate them into both the articles about the Michalka sisters. The personal filmographies of Alyson Michalka and Amanda Michalka do vary, so we can focus editing there. If it's possible we can also find some information about each of the girls. If we do these two things, we should be able to get differences between all three articles. Anyway, the Amanda Michalka page is different from the Alyson Michalka page, but yes, both do need some work. I don't believe that turning each page into a redirect is the solution here. We also mustn't limit the improvements to us though; we should allow other users to suggest things too, we're not talking about editing a section here: we talking about removing the encyclopedic content of both articles. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 04:04, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alyson <i>did</i> have a solo role on <i>Phil of the Future</i>; isn't that notable? <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 04:09, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed with Otto. The pages are very similar, and we could always just have an "AJ" and "Aly" section for each until their careers diverge significantly. <a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimbardo_Cookie_Experiment_a902.html" title="User:Zimbardo Cookie Experiment">Zimbardo Cookie Experiment</a> 06:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two girls have been the subject of many news articles, a few of which are listed in the sources on the duo's page. They have a gold record. They have been the stars of (mostly direct-to-TV) films. I think as a unit, they're certainly notable under the entertainment category of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Still think one page will suffice. <a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimbardo_Cookie_Experiment_a902.html" title="User:Zimbardo Cookie Experiment">Zimbardo Cookie Experiment</a> 15:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the <i>duo</i> passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> but the girls individually do not. However, given that I have been falsely accused of vandalism for <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a> redirecting the two pages and given that I really don't care enough about this issue to put up with that level of aggravation, I am withdrawing from the discussion following this posting. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Otto4711, you didn't vandalize at all; I never said you did. All I said in my summaries was that you didn't discuss the change on the talk pages first. I was always taught that major changes should be discussed first. If you thought that I called you a vandal, I'm sorry. You are not a vandal. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 16:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
