<p>I've looked at the entire section on "Alyx's Fate" and it seems to contain a bit too much speculation. Also, the assumption seems to be that PC Gamer made it thoroughly impossible for Alyx to die. It only said that Alyx would be in Episode 2. It never said that she wouldn't die 3/4th of the way through it. I think Valve would try to re-establish the Episode 1 connection with her anyway, before reaching a point where she is in extreme danger. Basically, I would like for this debate to remain as neutral as possible. I for one really think that Alyx will die, and moreover, that the G-man will kill her...and therefore I think it best for someone else to try to clean it up. Try to use all the info, including the Leipzig stuff and the GamesRadar article given as a reference in the Episode 2 article.--72.70.53.87 22:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No? Why? Fair enough it has nothing to do with the character itself, but it's still a modification that exists and was widely downloaded.

<dd>No amount of weapons fire used in-game against it does anything. Sub-machine guns, assault rifles, frag grenades etc, so it stands.

<p>Alyx really can survive a lot of injury, considering the fact that she's wearing blue jeans and a sweatshirt. I'm not sure Freeman could survive the same amount in the HEV suit.

<dd>Hell, you seem to be having some fun, while the only one that make good questions is CABAL. And DynSkeet answered it already - it's a game, so stop asking so much questions; also, they probably won't be answered here. Also, Chardrc, they AREN'T wearing labcoats. I hate the fact that a lot of people don't seem to understand it. There ARE civilians wearing white sweaters in the game; search them in the Model Viewer or replay the game, if you like to. And c'mon, the zombies also don't even seem to be wearing "labcoats"! That's clearly a sweater! Anyway, sorry for this off-topic answer about the zombies, and stop making questions. Would you really be happier knowing all those answers?</dd>

<dd>Well (I hope to God this doesn't sound racist) she IS darker than most of the Resistance citizens. And what about her mother, eh? We only ever see B&amp;W's of Azian. God, this is getting into genetics now. bv<a href="../../../a/k/-/User%7EAK-17_79c6.html" title="User:AK-17">AK-17</a> 12:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>In Episode One however, she has become somewhat more vulnerable compared to her appearance in Half-Life 2, and can easily die if the player does not keep her from being damaged continuously (as can happen when dealing with Antlion spawn areas, for example).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you sure about that? Have you tested in several time, or just posted something after it happened once? Every other person commenting on Alyx's vulnerability has said how hard it is to have her killed, especially in comparison to HL2. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Edwards_e91c.html" title="User:Tom Edwards">Tom Edwards</a> 15:02, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She seems relatively vulnerable to me (though able to take a fair bit of punishment). I never got her killed in <i>HL2</i>, but I managed quite a few times in <i>HL2:E1</i>, especially where zombies were involved. I didn't actually realise she could die in <i>HL2</i>! Regarding the quote above, it does sound fair to me, though I'd much prefer if this could be confirmed somehow.

<dd>I found exactly the opposite. She would die very quickly to Combine soldiers with shotguns in HL2, but could be surrounded by antlions in Ep1 while I sorted out the Antlion spawn areas the origianl editor talked about to no ill effect. At one point in HL2 I made a map with the sole intent of spawning enough baddies to kill her, but I don't think I ever managed it before my patience wore out. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Edwards_e91c.html" title="User:Tom Edwards">Tom Edwards</a> 15:53, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to clarify, I'm the one who added that paragraph about how she can die in EP1. I'm pretty sure she can, considering it's happened twice now in my playthroughs. If there are further queries as to its validity, I can provide some forum threads where lots of people note how she can die in EP1. Never saw her die in the original HL2 though, but she definately can die in EP1. It seems to be difficult for some people to reproduce however, not sure why that is. She may be more vulnerable to certain types of damage than others.</dd>

<dd>I should also make mention that the first time she died, I was in that large parking area and was having a trouble finding all the cars to cover the antlion spawn holes. Was taking far too long to search, leaving Alyx all by herself and not assisting in her defence. No wonder she died.&#160;:)--PanicAttack 10:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont recall it ever being stated that Azian died during Black Mesa. I was under the impression that she had died long ago. Is the above message speculation? -- <a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsi_edit_6b78.html" title="User:Psi edit">Psi edit</a> 17:34, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Apparently Gordon is supposed to remember her - Eli mentions this when you look at the photo, then he comments that Alyx and the photo are all that he has left of her or something. There's no evidence though that she was a scientist. And I didn't really see the resemblance with the VA, I'll have to look in Raising the Bar again but I never made that connection.

<dd>Also, Dr. Breen mentions to Alyx that she "has [her] mother's eyes", implying that Breen knew Azian at Black Mesa before the resonance cascade. However, it's not mentioned that Azian is a scientist, and I don't recall ever hearing that she was. I'm pretty sure she was just lived in the facility with Alyx as Eli's family. The HL2 Prima stategy guide might have more information on her. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 02:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed there's no mention about the EMP device Alyx uses to hack the Combine equipment. Can somebody write something refering to it? Remember that it is an important device in Half-Life 2, since that device it's the way Alyx opens the paths of Nova Prospekt to you and saves her father Eli.</p>
