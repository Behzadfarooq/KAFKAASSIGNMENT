<p>I never have done a straw poll before, so correct me if I am doing this wrong.</p>
<p>I don't know if I should modify the page, but i removed this:</p>
<p>===Include facts only (ie no allegations/accusations or non substantiated material)=== ====Support==== #-- ====Oppose==== #--</p>
<p>This question is worded in such a way, that of course everyone will agree with it. Everyone wants facts, this sections needs to be worded differently.</p>
<p>In addition, I made some minor title changes, and I moved the article from <a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAllegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_strawpolls_b609.html" title="Talk:Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America/strawpolls">Talk:Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America/strawpolls</a> to Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America/strawpolls is that correct?</p>
<p>I added my alternative: "American political violence as per <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html#Article_structures_which_can_imply_a_view" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Article_structures_which_can_imply_a_view</a>."</p>
<p>When we decide on the final outline in four days, I will invite those who voted on my graph to vote again, or I will transpose what already voted on. (I am going to call it voting).

<dd>Actually, I meant to start voting as soon as one wants too and give the voring 4 days to a week but that's not all that important. As for the one you took out, it goes to the heart of one of the problems, namely the fact that allegations are part of the equation right now and imho they shouldn't be. thank you for the move to the new location btw, it does fit better and gives the strawpolls their own talk page.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 00:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Obviously anyone who opposes the inclusion of the SOA doesn't speak english well enough to know what "sponsorship" means. The SOA is a training ground where techniques of torture and policing by "informal" militias are taught to people who are: a) trained by the U.S.A, b) armed by the U.S.A.; c) Often *paid* by the U.S.A.; d) Aided and abetted in their activities through access to U.S. logistical and intelligence support, and e) Often aided in the support of their regimes through direct economic and military support.
<dl>
<dd>That's sponsorship. Cry how you like, zerofaults/kalsemar, but it's a simple fact that the SOA is demonstrable proof that the U.S. *sponsors* terrorism.<a href="../../../2/1/1/User%7E211.72.233.6.html" title="User:211.72.233.6">211.72.233.6</a> 13:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your opinion however no WP:RS source is stating that, also the article isnt about sponsorship is it? read the title its about state terrorism, that means acts of state terrorism by the United States, so even proving sponsorship it still would not fall under the title. As I stated, since they are not government employee'sn officials, soldiers, or under contract of receiving pay from, acting on behalf of the US government, there is obviously no acts of terrorism being commited by the US, and no sources stating so. Please be mroe civil. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know User:Zer0faults, for claiming that you don't play the definition game, I find your comments here rather confusing. Look at User:Zer0faults edits, User:Zer0faults is attempting to define the article so narrowly that nothing is including in the article. "State terrorism" only means "state terrorism" by US staff (and even if US staff does it, User:Zer0faults can fall back on selective use of wikipedia policy to keep the information out). Proxy acts of terrorism, are not to be included in the article, nevermind that the soldiers are: a) trained by the U.S.A, b) armed by the U.S.A.; c) Often *paid* by the U.S.A.; d) Aided and abetted in their activities through access to U.S. logistical and intelligence support, and e) Often aided in the support of their regimes through direct economic and military support. So User:Zer0faults, do you admit that the US has done a through e? You stated "Stating the US trains terrorists at the SOA is actually false, because they are not terrorists till some time after they leave the SOA." So even though the staff are trained with torture manuals and how to terrorize the population by US staff, the US is not culpable (guilty) at all? Please clarify your incredibly narrow definition of terrorism (which you have not provided one source for). If your other messages are any guide, please also insult me with such statments as: "Your inability to understand anything is quite amazing...You seemed to have jumped in the middle of something you do not understand the points of...I am starting to wonder if you are paying attention...why does WP:OR seem to evade you and Travb..." I guess when you run out of proof you can instead insult people. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 02:47, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did you even read the "terror manual" the copy of one sent to South America? It actually has things crossed out explaining that they should not do certain things. But I dont reall yhave to go into this because you still have yet to provide sources. As I keep telling you, you can write paragraph after paragraph but sources are the only way things are getting into this article.</dd>
<dd>If you dont like the article title change it, I didnt name. Dont complain to be that you want to add things that dont fall under the title. There was no allegations of proxy acts of terrorism either, your person definitions here are irrelevant, when you learn that your opinion = nothing, and source = everything you will get farther. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 10:05, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, acutally I did read the original. The reason that it was crossed out, was before it was going to go public, someone crossed out sections. I can do something which you seem unable to do: provide sources too. "your person definitions here are irrelevant" like quoting the dictionary definition of words? I thought this was <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> but this is exactly what you do down below. Your wikipolicy goes both ways User:Zer0faults. "was no allegations of proxy acts of terrorism either" Careful about broad generalations User:Zer0faults, because they come back to haunt you, especially when you never admit you are wrong or mistaken. This stament is as absurd as when Sea quoted a document, and in the next sentence you demanded the exact same thing which he had just provided.</dd>
<dd>User Sea: The amount of money Bolivia normally receives is small; <b>much of it is used to train Bolivian military officers in the United States.</b></dd>
<dd>User:Zer0faults: That specifically says the US gives Bolivia money, then Bolivia then spends to train soldiers in the US. That is not the US taxpayer funding the SOA.</dd>
<dd>Huh? User Sea just provided a source which says: the US gives Bolivia money AND Bolivia then spends to train soldiers in the US. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 11:29, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Correct, however that does not however state US tax payer money is being used to train those soldiers. Again are you stating that the US funds the North Korean Nuclear Weapons project as well? We have given economic aid to North Korea and they spent that money on Nuclear weapons possibly. Further trainnig in the US does not mean training at SoA. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:14, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As with Nicaragua above, I disagree. These 'studies' are paid for by the US Government and these 'students' are trained by the US military. They are thus US agents. Anyway, it doens't matter what I think. There is no shortage of notable sources expressing the opinion that this is a case of US state terrorism (for example <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,,583254,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,,583254,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). If you have sources expressing a contary opinion, those can also be presented in the article.

<dl>
<dd>It very much does matter as we are tryibg to build a concensus lol. Also they are not US agents, and you cannot prove they are, which is the problem with all SOA related material, there is no proof these people worked for the US, just that they trained in a US facility. Hence not US terrorism, I think you need to look up info about straw polls cause if people are gonig to take unilateral action then I can withdraw my votes and go back to deleting. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 17:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, a suggestion on a straw poll is not 'unilateral action'! Second, Wikipedia isn't interested in 'proof' of anything. 'Proof' is OR. Wikipedia is based on notable opinion and citations. If the Guardian and others say something is US terrorism, then that opinion is notable and has a case for inclusion. Wikipedia is not a court of law. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 17:56, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gaurdian is not saying the US commited those acts, just that it trained the people who went on to do it.

<dd>By that logic Bin Ladin isn't a terrorist because he didn't personally commit any acts of terrorism. He just trained the guys who did. That may be your opinion. Others may have a different opinion. The US is not a person and cannot 'bodily' commit acts of terrorism. However, if the US state trains a supports others who do, then that is US state terrorism.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 18:00, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ever heard of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plausible_deniability.html" title="Plausible deniability">Plausible deniability</a>? The US uses <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plausible_deniability.html" title="Plausible deniability">Plausible deniability</a> all the time, so those who desperatly cling onto the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_civil_religion.html" title="American civil religion">American civil religion</a> can argue on wikipedia talk pages and elsewhere that America is never really responsible for terrorism.

<dd>User:Zer0faults, please provide sources for you allegations. You consistently criticize the research of others, <b>but in a month of arguing, you have not provided one source for your opinion</b>. "SOA are not US soldiers or government officials or people acting on behalf of the US or employed by the US etc." Really? Says who? Where is your source User:Zer0faults, it goes both ways: if you are going to demand that others document and source their POV, the least you can do is document and source your own POV. You have been marginally effective at quoting wikipedia policy, but I have yet to see any of your research and sourcing skills on this wikipage.

<dd>You seemed to have jumped in the middle of something you do not understand the points of. Osama bin Laden has admitted to picking out the 9/11 hijackers for the purpose of 9/11, now if you can prove the US sent these people to commit crimes then your all set, but the Guardian does not argue the US did that either. Just that they trained them in bad things, which isnt an act of state terrorism. Also if you read the page on the SOA or the Guardian article it says they are not US employees, please do research before attempting to argue with me simply to argue. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:27, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Noone is arguing its not a terrorist training ground, my point is I have yet to see a article stating that the people who come out of SOA are acting on the behalf of the US government. They can train them all day, however they are not acting on their behalf so its not US terrorism. Instead of ranting here and arguing with me because I oppose you, why dont you produce such a source instead of that Guardian page that simply says its a training camp, not stating the US is commiting acts of terrorism. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:22, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not considered terrorism itself, it is however against the law. However it very specifically states that <b>a person is guilty only if he provides instruction or training that he knows that a person receiving that training intends to use those skills for or in connection with the commision of act of terrorism, or for assisting the commission of others in an act of terrorism.</b> However there is no proof that I have seen that states the US knew these people would go commit terrorist acts, feel free however to present some, and then to further present a source stating its illegal under UK law, since its synthesizing evidence to take two seperate sources and connect them to make your point. And thats UK law not US or international law. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"Noone is arguing its not a terrorist training ground" Great, so the US trains terrorists. I am glad that we have this established. So we can state that the SOA is a terrorist training ground in the article. I am glad that we now have your permission, as User:Seabhcan wrote "You seem to have an exaggerated sense of your own importance."<br />
But wait, this contradicts what you wrote before: "Just that they trained them in bad things, which isnt an act of state terrorism." So which is it Zer0? Are you arguing that the <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOA_be5a.html" title="SOA">SOA</a> is a "terrorist training ground" or not? Is "bad things" really terrorism? Should we change the title of the article to Allegations of bad things by United States of America?<br />
In addition, we have already established that the Guardian is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> correct?<br />
Talking about souces, I am interested what source you base this sentence on: "SOA are not US soldiers or government officials or people acting on behalf of the US or employed by the US etc." Can you cite your source? We have cited plenty of sources, and in one month, you have provided absolutly none, your opinion is well known on these pages, but your ability to back up your claims is seriously lacking. Instead, you play the definition game, you play the wikipedia policy game, you repeatedly threaten others, you refuse to apologize for insulting other wikiusers, you criticize other's sources, etc. Hardly conductive to consensus. Everything is supposed sourced on wikipedia, and thus far, you have provided zero sources for your opinion.<br />
"You are asking for me to prove something never happened. Hmm lets see I can account for the location of every US official that day, or simply see if you have a source for your claims, which you have yet to produce on the other talk page." Isn't that <b>exactly</b> what you are doing? We have consistently provided sources, and you say "wait" this source really doesn't say that, it says this. And if that fails, and we give you a source which specifically says terrorism, you either (a) ignore the source, or (b) you fall back on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I have already shown your interpretation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is completely different from what <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> says. When I have pointed this out, you repeatedly ignore this.</p>
<p>"You keep asking for sources, yet you are making the accusations without sources. So what do you keep asking me for sources of for the past month?" Wait, I thought the Guardian was a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> now you are saying that the Guardian isn't a source? Or is this some broad generalization which has no basis in fact?</p>
<p>So where are you getting your sources Zer0?:</p>
<p>"SOA are not US soldiers or government officials or people acting on behalf of the US or employed by the US etc."</p>

<dd>And you asked me if I knew english. Training people in terrorist tactics is not an act of state terrorism, as it doesnt involve actually terrorizing anyone. Next point, you have not given a single source that states that SOA members were employed by, under the orders of, financially supported by, under contract of, or direct members of the United States. Asking me to produce a source that states a negative is a logical fallacy. When you produce a source that says they were government employee's I will attempt to find one that says otherwise, however producing a source that refutes a claim that only you make will be quite hard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes the guardian is a WP:RS source, however the guardian does not state the US commited acts of terrorism, just that it trained these people in bad things, not really acts of terrorism specifically. Further your constant attacks on me show you have no sources to support your claims, your constant asking for sources to prove claims that are never made false is even more illogical. Again I ask you actually read your sources, we can go back to this game if you like. In the articles in the page you still have yet to answer who is making the accusations that the US is guilty of state terrorism, what exactly they said and what their position is. Of course you cannot answer this because your only proof is a headline, noone actually says the US is guilt yof state terrorism in the articles themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just a last point so you realize something. I can create a terrorist manual, but that does not mean I am guilty of state terrorism. Your bin Laden example fell on its face because bin Laden states he sends those people to do XYZ. If you can produce sources state that the SOA actually sends those people back to South America to be terrorists that would be something else, but even then they are still not members of the US, so they are not under orders by the US. The 9/11 hijackers as stated by bin Laden during the zacharias trial were al-Qeada members and hence under his direct orders. Again please read before you comment, and please read your sources before you start claiming something. They acticle you presented said the Nicaraguan people were responcible for terrorist attacks, it did not says they were working for the US. Your second source states that they were funded by the US, however their acts were not under orders by the US. Your attempts to meld these two sources is WP:OR, O no, there goes those policies again. Instead of complaining about them being pointed out to you, maybe you should actually read them. Last point, don't ever attack me like this on a straw poll page again, I have a right to my opinion, too bad there is no concensus here =/. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 08:49, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You asked for a source for the claim that the US taxpayer funds SOA terrorism: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/09/news/bolivia.php" class="external text" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/09/news/bolivia.php" rel="nofollow">(Int.

The amount of money Bolivia normally receives is small; <b>much of it is used to train Bolivian military officers in the United States</b>. But the cut holds the potential to anger the powerful Bolivian military establishment, which has been responsible for a long history of coups."</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>That specifically says the US gives Bolivia money, then Bolivia then spends to train soldiers in the US. That is not the US taxpayer funding the SOA. Also coups are not terrorism. The US gives aid to many countries are you saying then the US is funding anything they do with that aid? So the US giving economic aid to North Korea is the US funding a nuclear weapons program in North Korea?

<dd>You should read a little about the realities of aid. Most aid is 'tied aid' meaning it is given for a specific purpose and cannot be spent on something else. A famous example is the "bushes Legs" 'food aid' to Russia in the 1990's. The US gave 'aid to Russia on condition it be spent only on buying US chicken which couldn't be sold in the US due to food safety laws. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 09:40, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its funny because instead of this long threaded ranting discussion all you had to do is produce the single source I am sure you have from Time magazine, New York Times, CNN etc that says the US commited acts of terrorism through the SOA. Not that the SOA commited terrorism, not that the US gave their countries economic aid. Simply that the US commited acts of terrorism through the SOA. Then I can change my post to go up there, instead all htese sources that dont actually say the US commited terrorism. Please read WP:OR, we cannot argue around the idea, you have to provide a source that says they commited acts of terrorism, it has to say that, the person saying that in the medium they are saying it has to meet WP:V and WP:RS. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 09:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is your opinion only that training terrorist is not an act of terrorism in itself. As I pointed out above, under UK law training terrorists is legally defined as being terrorism in and of itself. This is probably the case with US law too, however, I'm not an expert. So, can you provide an academic reference which disagrees with UK law? Can you provide one which says training terrorists is not an act of terrorism? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 12:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Stop asking me to disprove things you make up off the top of your head, provide a source backing what you are saying before asking anyone to disprove it.</dd>
<dd>Wouldnt that require a source arguing that training of SOA soldiers is an act of terrorism in itself then? I havent seen a source stating that either. Further laws enacted after the closing of the SOA are obviously not applicable as laws are not retroactive. So to even argue that point you would have to show someone arguing that the SOA still chruned out terrorists as you call them after the law was passed. From looking at the list of people SOA Alumni that is, you will be hard pressed to find someone arguing that, then again of the 60,000 alumni 20 have gone home to do bad deeds and people still argue its the schools fault, imagine if we looked at my old high school and out of 60,000 calculated how many gone on to commit crime then argued that the school trains people how to commit crimes. Again, please present sources or we are just clogging up this page.</dd>
<dd>You keep asking me to prove negatives, the better question since you are the one asserting it is illegal to train terrorists and asserting that terrorists were trained at SOA, then you need to prove that its illegal, actually that its an act of terrorism in and of itself, under UK law to train South American soldiers, if those soldiers later returned to their countries and commited acts of terrorism. So your single source would have to be arguing your point that under UK Law the US commited an act of terrorism by training these soldiers who later went on to commit acts of terrorism. I would like to see this, and please make sure it follows WP:RS and WP:V. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
