<p>I just think it's interesting how many revisions this has gone through ... here's the original 1911 "Gutenberg" <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a> article that I pasted here originally, that has had the so-called "Islamic bias" removed. I do know it needed editing, revising, expanding, and to be "brought up to the times." Just something interesting to think about.</p>
<p>ALLAH, the Arabic name used by Moslems of all nationalities for the one true God. It is compounded of al, the definite article, and ilah, meaning a god. The same word is found in Hebrew and Aramaic as well as in ancient Arabic (Sabaean). The meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful; cf. Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 82, and the Oxford Hebrew and English Lexicon, pp. 61 ff.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2002</span></h2>
<p>A previous version of the "Allah" article included the following: "Allah" was also the proper name for the pre-Islamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic Arabic tribes. The name and has no femminine or plural forms. Allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods, such as the goddesses al-Lat? and Man'at?</p>
<p>Anybody know why was this removed?</p>
<p>It seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. It appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man (Robert Mory) in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Well, insofar as 'Allah' doubles as the name 'God' in Arabic we're up against the problem solved in English by capitalization, capital G for the monotheistic god of the Jews and Christians (who prefers that we NOT use his first name) versus the gods with a small G. "Allah" was undoubtedly used about all SORTS of deities, and that's where the Moon-deity argument falls down. And watch out about publishing the female-trinity bit -- isn't that what got Salman Rushdie in trouble? --Michael Tinkler.</p>
<p>I authored the paragraph about the moon-god theory. I read about this in "Islam" <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415211654/o/qid=/sr=8-1/ref=sr_aps_b_1_1/202-6258986-6219044" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415211654/o/qid=/sr=8-1/ref=sr_aps_b_1_1/202-6258986-6219044" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> by Jamal J. Elias, a Muslim author. The book is an intorduction to Islam from the POV of a liberal Muslim scholar. As Elias is Associate Professor of Religion at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and he writes on this theory as if it were fact, it seems there is more to this picture than the "poor" work of one scholar. Therefore, I have restored the paragrah, with a note on it's contoversy.</p>
<p>I also authored the bit about Yahweh that was taken out. Critism accepeted, it belongs in its own article. So i have put it in <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahweh.html" title="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>. - Asa</p>
<p>It does seem true that Allah was the name of a moon god - and that Mohammed's father had allah as part of his name. But the name does have a feminine form - al Lat. It is not clear the connection of the moon god to the Muslim god.</p>
<p>Ok, first of all: Allah <b>does</b> simply mean "the god", rather equivalent to our capitalized "God". Hence, any major god (like this moon god, apparently) would have very likely been called "God". I did some [admittely Internet-based] research on this topic just now, and clarified a few things in the actual text. Let me know how it reads now.</p>
<p>Here's a question. Wikipedia is an <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a>, not a dictionary, so its articles should be about topics, not words per se. So is the "Allah" article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the Islamic concept of God? My initial thought would be yes.</p>
<p>But Arabic-speaking Christians would use the word to refer to the Christian God. Does that complicate the issue? Maybe. But one might argue that the wikipedia is in English (this one at least), and in English the word "Allah" is generally used to refer to God specifically with reference to Islam. Right? So the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be under "Allah". Does this make sense? Anyone disagree?</p>
<p>Another question - Do Muslims take Allah to be the personal name for God or just the Arabic language word meaning God. This could be tricky since by way of comparison some Christians take Yahweh to be the personal name of God while others see it as just another description "I am what I am" (If there is only one of a class, i.e. one God, why would he need a personal name?)</p>
<p>Well. In the listing I have that is based on Hadith (the teaching tradition of Islam), <i>Allah</i> is listed as the first name among the 99 names. The names read more like titles "the Compassionate, the Merciful, etc.", but the tradition is that they are names. I'll add the list as an entry. --MichaelTinkler</p>
<p>Actually we already have a page under [[ninety-nine names of Allah|ninety-nine names of Allah.</p>
<p>Regarding: discussion of the Islamic concept of God</p>
<p>I personally think the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be listed under <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, not Allah. Under Allah should be listed, basically, what is there right now--what the word is used for, its origins, and other basic things about it. If you're worried about it becoming to "dictionary"-ish, see the top of this page for the entirety of an Allah article from a 1911 <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a>--it is, I would say, less detailed than our article currently is. I think there's nothing to worry about in that respect.</p>
<p>Regarding: is Allah the name of God or just a word meaning God?</p>
<p>What's the difference? It's not an <i>attribute</i>, like the rest of the 99 are (the compassionate, and so forth). Do Christians/Jews consider the capitalized "God" to be the name of God or just a word meaning God? It's usually considered to be both, much, I think, the way that "God" is in English.</p>
<p>Again, something to think about is that Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews <b>do</b> use the word Allah to refer to God ... it's not specifically Islamic.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Jews do not consider God the name of God. In their religion one does not pronounce the name of God YHWH. Many Christians may have forgotten it and confusingly most Bible translations use LORD in small capital letters as the translation. Certainly it is an important distinction - look at the emphasis mystery religions put on names of gods.</p>
<p>And if you look at the list of the 99 names you'll see that lots of them end up as personal names in Arabic, much as the Protestant Puritans used names like "Mercy" or "Chastity." --MichaelTinkler</p>
<p>I will try to bring an answer to the problem from Turkish point of view. I am not sure about other Muslim nations but Turkish people usually (although there are no definite rules for that) use the word Allah as the special name of God. We use a different and genuinely Turkish word (tanri) to specify other gods (as ancient Egyptian gods, Celtic gods etc.). As to the gods of other monotheistic religions, I think there is some confusion for that and people may use both Allah and tanri. On the other hand, from Islamic point of view, other than being simply Al Ilah (the God) in Arabic language, Allah is indeed the special name of God and it is the most precious name for it is not a descriptive name like other <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninety-nine_names_of_Allah_11d9.html" title="Ninety-nine names of Allah">Ninety-nine names of Allah</a>, but the name of God's own presence. This is a difficult concept to define. The name Allah is accepted to comprise the meanings of all other names of the God, as well. All the names including Allah are referred to as "asma ul husna" (beautiful names) and Allah is regarded as greatest of these names. <a href="../../../e/r/d/User%7EErdemTuzun_882d.html" title="User:ErdemTuzun">ErdemTuzun</a></p>
<p>ErdemTuzun: thanks, you managed to say that a lot better than I could have. It is indeed more than simply Al Ilah to Muslims--the greatest of the names of God, as you said. Conversely, it is true that Arabic-speaking Christians use the term Allah to speak of God.</p>
<p>Do you think that the most recent revision says this aptly enough? Perhaps an extra sentence somewhere stating that Allah <i>does</i> have special significance to Muslims, more than simply meaning "the God", as it is used by others. Hm. I'll contemplate it. --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2003</span></h2>
<p>One important issue that has to do with the "is Allah just Arabic for God" question is that I've heard certain personages claiming something along the lines of "The Muslims are heathens - they don't worship God, they worship Allah!" (This is typically the sort of person who believes he can get to heaven by defrauding people on TV while wearing a bad haircut.) Obviously this is nonsense - perhaps we should so clarify. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">montréalais</a></p>
<p>I strongly want to remove the Carleton S. Coon source from this topic, as it contradicts every other source I have found. It appears to be the consensus among historians that Allah was considered the God who made everything, and idols and moon gods and lesser gods were added to him as partners. I can find nothing in Islamic or Arab history that ever suggests that there was anything above Allah, and the Quran, the best kept piece of the time, points to the fact that the Pagans of the time didnt put any idols above Allah. Leaving this source here introduces a controversy over the origins of the term when there really isn't any.</p>
<p>I agree with the above. Keeping the moon-god lies in there only furthers ignorance about al-Islaam among people such as Lt. Gen. William "Jerry" Boykin.</p>
<p>Anyone have a source for the claim that Allah was the name of God in the Aramaic language? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaGrind_c114.html" title="User:ThaGrind">ThaGrind</a> 02:51, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are many ways of representing other writing systems in English. The spellings in English for Aramaic are different depending on which author. About "claim that Allah was the name of God in the Aramaic language", see <i>Prayers of the Cosmos</i> by Neil Douglas-Klotz. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-06-061995-3</a>, p. 7. There are several ancient words for God in the Middle East that are <i>cognates.</i><a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">Kim é‡‘</a></p>
<p>"Alaha" (or however you want to write the Aramaic in Roman letters) means "the Oneness." That is not a <b>proper</b> name, but a characterization, a description that points to God. St. Thomas Aquinas knew and wrote a long time ago, in agreement with Islamic scholars, that humans cannot comprehend God. So we make do with partial understandings and partial descriptions. There is only one God. Arabs speak of him their word. Syriac speakers speak of him with their word. English speaking Christians speak of him with their word. They hear other people speaking other words and conclude they believe in other Gods. That is like one person saying that he was born on Terra and the other person calling him an alien. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">Kim é‡‘</a> 15:10, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed it will cause controversy to categorize Allah as "a god" as user Gabbe has done. To put Allah (or Elohim or Wakan Tanka...) on a level with Narcissus, Aphrodite, Jove, Wotan... strikes me as extremely insensitive and offensive as well as being incorrect from a taxonomic point of view. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金</a> 16:56, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It sounds like you are saying, "If somebody wants to know about Allah, do not read the <i>Torah</i> and do not read the <i>New Testament</i>, read only the <i>Koran." Do you assume that an article entitled "Allah" is actually an article that should be titled: "How the believers in Islam conceptualize God?" It would be one thing to have an article on a star called "Sol," and another thing to have an article on "How the ancient Egyptians conceptualized the sun." <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金</a> 15:30, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>I agree. Allah is not part of <i>Christianity</i> or <i>Judaism</i> or the <i>Bible</i>. It may be part of <i>names that some Christians or Jews call God</i>, but not part of Christianity or Judaism itself. And Allah is definitely not part of the Bible.

<dd>Really? Does it not follow logically from what you have said that God (Deus, Alaha, or whatever you want to call him) is not a part of '"Christianity" or "Judaism" or the "Bible"'?

<p>I can understand your point of view, both. But I think it is ignorant, to think that Christianity has only to do with iso-8859-1 languages or Judaism with iso-8859-8. There are millions of Arabic speaking Jews and Christians, who are familiar with the name "Allah", which is obviously not your case. Allah (الله) is in every Arabic Bible, Old and New Testament. If you don't believe me, go and check for yourself, for example here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/ibs/bibles/arabic/PDF/NT/MATTHEW.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.gospelcom.net/ibs/bibles/arabic/PDF/NT/MATTHEW.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gospelcom.net/ibs/bibles/arabic/PDF/NT/MATTHEW.pdf</a></p>
<p>if you cannot read arabic, just look for الله or use an OCR.</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<p>IF the (Arabic OR Aramaic) Bible speak of Allah, THEN <a href="../../../b/i/b/Category%7EBible_5460.html" title="Category:Bible">Category:Bible</a> is right EVEN IF not yet existing.</p>
<p>IF Arabic (Christians AND Jews) are concerned with Him, THEN (Category:Christianity AND <a href="../../../j/u/d/Category%7EJudaism_d490.html" title="Category:Judaism">Category:Judaism</a>) are right, too.</p>
<p>ELSE the Bible and Christianity are only concerned with English Christians AND Judaism only with Hebrew Jews, which is NOT TRUE.</p>
<p>If you have lived for a while in an Arabic speaking land like I did, and met some arabic Christians and Jews who also speak with love of Allah, you would surely have another point of view, like other millions of Christians and Jews do. Don't they count? Or do you think they are "just Arabs"?</p>
<p>The article is not dealing with Muslims, but with Allah, which is a main part of the lives of millions of Christians and Jews, not only billions of Muslims, which name is printed in millions of Bibles, not only in billions of Quran. I hope you can follow me now.</p>
<p>Muhammad 21:44, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I asked a teacher once about the hatred among religions. He said, "There is only one mountain peak. We are all trying to get to the same mountain peak. I pick my route and you pick your route. Why should you be angry if I call it Mt. McKinley and you call it Denali? Why should I be angry if you go by the south route and I go by the east route? The important thing is that we each get to the summit." So I think it is better to help people understand that even if they read Zhu Xi in Chinese and he looks at "that which was before the beginning of creation, the highest, the most ultimate, most infinite, most unknowable, the ultimate source of truth, of what is , of what will be..." and calls it the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiji.html" title="Taiji">Taiji</a> (Great Ultimate) or the Dao (Way), he has looked at the creation and has perceived and characterized some aspects of its creator. It may not be the most complete characterization, but it is not as though he is talking about some <b>other</b> creator. If we are starving, somebody throws a bag of gold coins through the window, several of us catch a glimpse of the benefactor, and one says he had dark skin, another says he wore a red stocking hat, and a third says he wore tall black boots, would it be the best thing for us to all fight about whose description is the true description? Would it not be better to make a composite description and then find and thank our benefactor? I think Muhammad and I will look for the benefactor. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金</a> 02:16, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kim, you'd forget for a moment this discussion was about the <i>category</i> only. It has snowballed a bit, hasn't it? The point remains the same that this article deals mainly with the way Muslims relate to the Creator. Addition of Allah to other categories will cloud the categorisation process and lead to confusion. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 16:18, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article needed to <b>state</b> that it is "mainly about the way Muslims relate to the Creator." I fixed that, although I think the whole article now needs to be tidied up a bit so that the specifically Islamic parts and the non-Islamic Allah parts can be kept apart a bit better. Once that part is clear, then what categories really apply will also be clear. I am not <b>primarily</b> interested in the categories, but in heading off people like the Reverend Graham who teach that Allah is a false god (or whatever, precisely, he said). <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金</a> 17:57, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>While it's true that Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians may use <i>Allah</i> to refer to God, in <b>English</b> the word <i>Allah</i> refers exclusively to God as conceived by Islam, and so putting this article in Category:Judaism or Category:Christianity doesn't make sense. Note that this is the English wikipedia, and we have an article on <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> <b>not</b> because it is a word used in Arabic, but because it is a word used in <i>English</i>. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 19:37, Jun 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversion</span></h2>
<p>Let's not have an edit or reversion war.</p>
<p>Someone has reverted the changes I made to accomodate JFW's point above. I do not care which way the article is handled, only that it is clear and is not a source of error. I accept the idea that most people who come to the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a> to understand what the <b>word</b> Allah means will know it only from the mass media, and so will want to know more about the word as it is used in the materials they have already been influenced by. So from that standpoint it makes sense to say, "This is what believers in Islam understand by the word "Allah." But there is a very serious problem here since ignorant people have asserted that followers of Islam believe in a false god. Those people need to understand that no matter how badly a Christian, a Jew, and a follower of Islam may individually misunderstand Alaha/Eloim/Allah, they are all having imperfect perceptions/conceptualizations of the same God. If we take the other alternative, then the article becomes an article on God, or maybe on the various monotheistic ways of conceiving of God. If we do that we have to write a book. Even a list and a brief definition of the religion and what it believes about God would be very long. (We would have to include Zhu Xi's idea of the Taiji, Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi's idea of the Dao, at least two kinds of Catholicism, a very large number of Protestant denominations, several sub-divions of the Jewish faith, one ancient Egyptian conception of God...)</p>
<p>When I edited the article I did not write it so that it implied that Islam has a "patent" on Allah. I think the article, as I left it, said very clearly that because Islam gives a "monopoly" to the term "Allah," and because there is thus a unique relationship between that term and that one religion, the article would concentrate on the Islamic teachings in regard to Allah. And the article also said in the first paragraph that other religions, among them Judaism and Christianity, use the same word or cognate forms of the same word to refer to the same supreme being. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 03:17, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kim, this article has had "Judaism" categories added and removed a large number of times. It has been removed now. If it gets added again, I will take this to arbitration, because this is a policy matter more than anything else. -- JFW</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let us see whether we can reason together. If we cannot, then adding a third person to the mix will not improve matters. If that person appears to agree with JFW, then Mohammad or somebody else may feel that the mediator is taking sides. Personally, I do not care whether the article on Allah is placed under the category of Judaism or not. -- Kim</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia articles are named in the way that most closely approaches common use of a word or name. That's why <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fitzgerald_Kennedy_dfea.html" title="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">John Fitzgerald Kennedy</a> redirects to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>.-- JFW</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe "Allah" should be redirected to "Monotheisms", and "Monotheisms" should have a fan-out to religions rooted in <i>Old Testament</i> sources, and then Islam should have a fan-out to various topics including "The Islamic conception of God/Allah." One of the problems with articles named according to "the way that most closely approaches common use of a word or name" is that a single word can have multiple definitions depending on who is speaking. The title of an article on "Witch" is problematical because one group will want a description of the evil creatures that exist only to cast evil spells on innocent people, a second group will want witches described from a Wiccan perspective, and a third group will want "witch" explained as a word that refers to no actual thing but is used to demonize innocent people. -- Kim</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this article had been titled "The Islamic Conception of Allah", then we would not be having so much trouble listening to each other's words. -- Kim</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the same token, someone who wants to learn about <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> will peruse the article so named, while if he wants to learn about the Muslim monotheistic deity, he will read <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>. I'm pleased to hear that Muslims, Jews and Christians agree that they are relating to the same Supreme Being, but NOT A SINGLE JEW will <i>state outright that he believes in Allah</i>! He will profess belief in <i>Hashem]]</i> ("the name"), <i>the Ribbono shel Olam</i> ("Master of the World"), <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> ("The Holy One, Blessed is He") etc etc BUT NEVER ALLAH. It is completely ridiculous to maintain that this article still belongs in a category of Judaism. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 09:21, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why don't you ask an Arabic-speaking Jew? Muhammad 10:52, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So there are no Jews who live in Arabic-speaking areas and have discussions with people who believe in Islam? Whenever one says something with "all" in it, an enormous burden of proof is assumed. I cannot put myself in the position of speaking for a single Jew, much less all Jews, but it would seem to me that if someone asked somebody like Thomas Merton, "Do you believe in Allah?" then he would say, "Probably not with the exact understanding of who He is that you do, but nobody has exactly the same conception of the One as anybody else anyway. I follow Jesus. Jesus called Him Alaha. You follow Mohammed, who called him Allah. I think we believe in the same One, whatever word we use to name Him."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Probably because there is no Arabic-speaking Jew editing the Article? Muhammad 10:52, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Probably each of us wants to privilege his or her own language. I think that if a Christian Syriac speaker went to a Christian church in an English-speaking area and gave a sermon entitled, "Jesus, Christianity, and the True Love of Alaha " he might cause severe and growing turmoil in the hearts of the congregation every time he mentioned "that alien god" Alaha. IZAK's position seems to hinge on the idea that the referent for the word "Allah" is not "the highest, the most ultimate..." but "the conception of God that is held by followers of Islam." Otherwise he would be saying that God "has NOTHING to do with that section [Israel and Zionism] from the point of view of Jews and Judaism," which I have to believe is something that he would never say. -- Kim</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, what I tried to do with my (now reverted) edit was to get clear on the differences between "word and object," so that we would not be attacking each other needlessly. Contrary to what JFW and IZAK seem to believe, it is not my purpose to advocate inclusion of those links. Nor is it my purpose to advocate that they be excluded. To me, but not to whoever reverted my revised text, it makes sense to make it clear when the discussion pertains to the One and when the discussion pertains to the words and definitions that are used in discussions of that One in the several traditions that use the word "Allah." <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 16:22, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Al-Lat was a pre-Islamic idol; but the word is etymologically from al+ilaah+at (as shown by the Safaitic inscriptions' spelling hn'lt, han- being the normal definite article in Safaitic), and thus is related etymologically (though certainly not synchronically). - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 01:25, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i just want to add (im not sure this is the right location in the discussion but ..) that it seems that Allah is simply an arabic word used by arab person with any religion , its probably comes from the arabic root "A' Lu Ha" , which derives A'Aliha (gods) AL-LLAAh (alah"this article") ELAHII (related to ILAH(ilah is a god , any god))) , so probably Allah stands for "THE GOD" i.e. when talking in a context that doesnt speak about multiple gods, i belive this includes Judism Christiany and islam and probably some other religions that have only one god. --uwe</p>

<p>I added one sentence. I hope doing so will produce no flames and no reversion. I also have a question about one sentence. I do not understand it clearly because of its use of the word "universal" (the link to the article on "Universal" is fruitless): <b>'Unlike the word "God", the name "Allah" is <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal.html" title="Universal">universal</a>, used by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> world-wide, regardless of their language, as well as Arabic-speaking Christians, Jews, and others.'</b> Which of the following sentences fit the meaning of the quoted sentence?</p>
<ul>
<li>If one is a human being, one uses only "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is a human being, one uses "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is a Muslim, one uses only "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is a Muslim, one uses "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is an Arabic-speaking Christian, one uses only "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is an Arabic-speaking Christian, one uses "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is an Arabic-speaking Jew, one uses only "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>If one is an Arabic-speaking Jew, one uses "Allah" as a name for the One.</li>
<li>(Anything that I missed? What <b>was</b> the author actually trying to say?)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to my understanding, a better formulation would be: 'The name "Allah" alone is used by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> world-wide, regardless of their language, as a proper noun that names "the one God". Several terms for the one God, including "Allah," may be used interchangably by people not of the Islamic faith such as Arabic-speaking Christians and Arabic-speaking Jews,' Please, anonymous contributor, explain what is wrong with this way of saying it. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 22:10, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a problem with the sentence: "The Aramaic word for God is alôh-ô (Syriac dialect), which is <b>etymologically identical with</b> the Arabic and Hebrew;" I believe that this sentence is clearly wrong. Two things that have <b>identical</b> origins will be two identical things. The Hamitic divide into East Semitic, North West Semitic (Phoenician, Punic Aramaic, Hebrew, Modern Hebrew, etc.) and South West Semitic (Arabic, Ethiopic, Amharici). If that analysis is correct Aramaic and Hebrew evolved out of one earlier language, and Arabic evolved out of a second early source and then the two earlier sources evolved out of some still earlier language. A similar, but weaker, proposition would be that the several words for God are cognates. That would be like saying that "deus", "deva," "deitiy", and "divus" are cognates. Unless somebody argues persuasively for the sentence currently in use, I will change it again. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a></p>

<p>I'm not sure I agree with your analysis of the meaning of "etymologically identical"; I would see any two words with the same origin as etymologically identical, eg (my favorite example) "pork" and "farrow" in English, both from PIE *pork- via two different paths.

<dd>Allah is universally used because of the importance of Qur'anic recitation (and consequently Arabic terminology) in Muslim cultures. This does not mean that it cannot be translated, only that it usually isn't, since everyone shares a common Arabic vocabulary. From a Muslim POV I do have a problem with Allah remaining unquestioned as the Arabic 'name of God' because languages are by definition worldly and created. Concepts like 'the divine' are obviously transcendant of language; in this sense, the divine cannot have a name. This is very much what classical Muslim theologians meant when they said that God could only be known by his 99 names or attributes. This problem is avoided by simply admitting that 'allah' is the Arabic translation of title 'the god/God' and not a name at all (which also explains why Arab Jews and Christians use it - since it's not a name, it obviously cannot conflict with the use of Yahweh or Jesus, which Judaism and Christianity do consider to be proper names). The fact is that unless mention is made of the al+ilah etymology, it will seem that all the translations of the Qur'an done from a non-Muslim POV are incorrect (since they almost all translate 'Allah' as 'God'). Plus, it is not at all clear from linguistic evidence that the goddess Allat and Allah are completely unrelated. The only way to maintain neutrality is to mention all POVs and make it clear that traditional Muslims hold one view, dissenting Muslims and non-Muslims another. So I am restoring the al+ilah = Allah (the deity) etymology in a way which I hope restores NPOV and will keep everyone somewhat happy, or at least equally unhappy.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeshanhasan_c16c.html" title="User:Zeeshanhasan">Zeeshanhasan</a> 23:39, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like your edit, Zeeshan - but why do you say that only non-Muslim linguists give the al-ilah etymology? I've never heard that this etymology contradicts Islam in any way, and it doesn't contradict the fact that right now (synchronically) the word has no feminine, even if at some point in the pre-Islamic past it did. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 10:25, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Also from an anti-Islamic site, oddly enough: "The name occurs as Hallah in the Safa inscriptions five centuries before Islam and also in a pre-Islamic Christian Arabic inscription found in umm-al-Jimal, Syria, and ascribed to the sixth century."<a href="http://www.bible.ca/islam/library/islam-quotes-hitti.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bible.ca/islam/library/islam-quotes-hitti.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
