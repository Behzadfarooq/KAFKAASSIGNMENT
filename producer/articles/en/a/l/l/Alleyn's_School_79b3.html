<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleyn%27s_School_79b3.html" title="Edit section: Edward Alleyn">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Edward Alleyn</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Alleyn_a98e.html" title="Edward Alleyn">Edward Alleyn</a> was a prosperous <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> actor and proprietor of taverns, bear-pits and owned three brothels, whose <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rose_%28theatre%29_a86d.html" title="The Rose (theatre)">Rose</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_Playhouse_b7c7.html" title="Fortune Playhouse">Fortune</a> theatres rivalled <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_Theatre_071a.html" title="Globe Theatre">Globe</a>. In 1619 he established his "College of God's Gift" (the gift of love) with twelve students. Alleyn's School is a direct descendant of Edward Alleyn's original foundation and was established as a boys' school in 1882. It still exists as part of a foundation alongside <a href="../../../d/u/l/Dulwich_College_2018.html" title="Dulwich College">Dulwich College</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Allen%27s_Girls%27_School_6eba.html" title="James Allen's Girls' School">JAGS</a> - it split with Dulwich College after the "Dulwich College Act" of 1857, with the upper school of the original foundation moving to a new site further south and the lower school staying put, becoming an independent boys school in 1882 and later also moving to its own site.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Saddlers_eb88.html" title="Worshipful Company of Saddlers">Worshipful Company of Saddlers</a> in the City became a generous sponsor of scholarships and new buildings after establishing a link with the school in 1970. Some of the original school buildings date from Alleyn's independence in 1882, but the School has followed a programme of continuous development since the 1970s.</p>
<p>The original school is now the foundation chapel and the offices for the Dulwich Estate, which belongs to the foundation schools. Alleyn's became a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public school</a> with the election of the Headmaster to the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headmasters%27_Conference_af9d.html" title="Headmasters' Conference">Headmasters' Conference</a> (HMC) in 1919. It was a Direct Grant School from 1958 until the abolition of that status in 1975. The Governors then opted for outright <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_school.html" title="Independent school">independence</a> and co-education.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleyn%27s_School_79b3.html" title="Edit section: The College of God's Gift">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The College of God's Gift</span></h3>
<p>For the original College of God's Gift, 24 students had to be chosen from the four parishes with which Edward Alleyn had been connected. Saint Giles, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberwell.html" title="Camberwell">Camberwell</a> (in which Dulwich was situated), Saint Saviour, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwark.html" title="Southwark">Southwark</a> (where the Bear Pit stood on Bankside), Saint Botolph, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopsgate.html" title="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a> (where Alleyn was born), and Saint Giles, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cripplegate.html" title="Cripplegate">Cripplegate</a> (home to the Fortune Theatre). The Master and Warden were also chosen, with the criteria being that they had to be unmarried and with the surname <i>Alleyn</i>. However, the rule that the Master and Warden had to be unmarried was not strictly adhered to.</p>
<p>Because the Masters and Wardens had to have the surname Alleyn, this limited the applicants mainly to family of Edward Alleyn. First, Thomas Alleyn, a cousin of Edward took the post of Master in 1629, followed by Mathias Alleyn in 1631. His son, John, succeeded as Master in 1669.</p>
<p>It was not easy for the Foundation to run smoothly. The four parishes, as beneficiaries, were always claiming "rights" from the Foundation estates. Separately, the Masters generally seemed very unsuitable people to have in control of the College. A notable exception to this was James Allen who eventually formed <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Allen%27s_Girls%27_School_6eba.html" title="James Allen's Girls' School">James Allen's Girls' School</a> (which was at the time for poor boys and girls in Dulwich, however subsequently has become exclusively a girl's school by an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Parliament_f749.html" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> in 1841.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleyn%27s_School_79b3.html" title="Edit section: The Second World War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Second World War</span></h3>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, many pupils at Alleyn's were <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuated.html" title="Evacuated">evacuated</a> to the countryside, however some wished to stay in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, and for this reason the South London Emergency Secondary School (SLESS) was set up and housed in Alleyn's buildings from March 1940 to March 1945. This was not undertaken only to give the boys who wished to remain in London a proper education, but in conjunction with the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_County_Council_f90c.html" title="London County Council">London County Council</a> Education Department, to offer a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammar_school.html" title="Grammar school">grammar school</a> education to others whose schools were evacuated but did not themselves wish to leave London. SLESS kept Alleyn's buildings alive.</p>
<p>On the roll were 240 boys from seventeen local schools (114 from Alleyn's) and eleven masters from six schools. The Acting Headmaster (taking over from C. R. Allison) was C. Hack, and the Second Master (who subsequently became headmaster) was C. F. Tyson.</p>
<p>The school was divided into houses as before. Games were played, <a href="../../../f/i/v/Fives.html" title="Fives">fives</a> was taught to newcomers and holidays were filled with "Holiday Clubs". The fields were used for sport, however some became unusable due as the old elm trees were felled by the blast. Underground shelters were dug between the running track and Woodwarde Road for use by local residents. The shelters for the pupils were in the basement (now home to the Maths Department), and lessons were frequently undertaken here due to enemy air activity.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> housed their barrage balloon crews in the local brick and concrete buildings at the bottom of the school fields. The huge balloons would constantly overshadow the school's main building, and, at times, settled on the School's roof.</p>
<p>All staff had to undertake fire watching at nights and at the weekends. In 1942 the General Schools Certificate (GSE) was undertaken whilst the lights were failing and bombs dropping. Despite this, fourteen received <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matriculation.html" title="Matriculation">Matriculation</a> and five the Certificate.</p>

The new library building was opened in 2002</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since 1970, Alleyn's has had continuous development, both in physical buildings but also in the facilities it offers. A new lower-school building was built in 1975, followed by the swimming pool/gym complex. In 1983 the new Sports Hall was created, which is now a prominent feature of the school. In 1990 (completed in 1992) the new Music School and Junior School were added.</p>
<p>The Junior School was subsequently opened to 200 boys and girls aged from 4 to 11, and is successful for preparing entry into the Senior School (and other, external schools) in a supportive atmosphere tailored to the children's needs, participating in a great range of activities through a structured timetable.</p>
<p>The Great Hall was refurbished in 2000 and in 2002 the new library was opened. A new theatre complex is planned for late 2008, with construction starting in the summer of 2007.</p>
<p>The facilities that are offered at the school have increased in par with the buildings. The addition of the Lower School meant that the students in the lowest two years (7 and 8) could be educated semi-separately from the rest of the school, providing a sheltered environment. The new swimming pool block and sports hall have increased the facilities for the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">physical education</a> activities run at the school, as have the music school and expanded library for musical activities and a general work area respectively.</p>

<p><i>Scriblerus</i> is the official school <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazine</a>, which provides a summary to the previous year in the form of reports on sport, clubs and societies, academic results and field trips throughout the year. A large section of the magazine is devoted to the activities by the CCF and DofE activities.</p>
<p><i>Scriblerus</i> is published in early July, in conjunction with the end of the Trinity term. It is free of charge, as it is considered promotional material by the Senior Management Team.</p>

<p>The <i>Lower School Magazine</i> is edited by the Deputy Headmistress of the Lower School and features content written by the lower school pupils, much like <i>Scriblerus</i>. It is naturally focused on the youngest two years which form the lower school, and is aimed at the pupils rather than parents (arguably, unlike <i>Scriblerus</i>).</p>

<p><i>Blue</i> is the termly magazine produced by Tyson's House to raise money for charity. This charity is determined by Tyson House, and tends to reflect the long term association that Tyson's have with certain charities. Tyson's House delegates the editing of the magazine to a year 13 student each year. Last issue <i>Blue</i> raised over £300 for the school charity. Blue was set up in 1999 by Mrs Thompson (Housemistress of Tyson's).</p>

<p>As of September 2006, the termly fee (payable three times annually) is £3827. This fee is reviewed every year by the school's governors, and in recent years has increased 21%. The fees are reduced if the child's parent is a <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">teacher</a> at the school, however the child must still pass all entrance requirements. Teachers with children actively send them to Alleyn's, and would possibly only be able to do so with this fee reduction.</p>

<p>Originally the house colours were not allowed to be any shade of blue, since this was the colour designated for Oxford and Cambridge and it were thought 'inappropriate' to have blue as a House colour as that was associated in one's mind with the two universities.</p>
<p>In 1921 when two new houses were created (due to their increasing role in the school but also to allow for knock-out sports and inter-house competitions), Henderson (the headmaster) had no qualms about the use of university colours, hence allowing them to use dark blue (Oxford) and light blue (Cambridge).</p>
<p>The colours denote the house-colour, which appears on the school tie for middle-school pupils and on the "house shirts" which are used during inter-house sports competitions. Until 1984 the colour was also found on the school cap (for boys). House badges were introduced in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.</p>
<p>Pupils with relatives who are either currently attending or have previously been pupils are allocated to the same house as those family members.</p>
<p>When house names are quoted on paper the apostrophe is almost always not included (e.g. Cribbs not Cribb's). Some believe this is because the house names are now disassociated with the original housemasters, so an apostrophe is not necessary.</p>
<p>Alleyns Lower School does not use the house system, but rather competes for ones class in 'inter-form competitions'. Pupils are then allocated a house at random (unless relatives are in or have been in the school in which case they are allocated to that house) in year 9, the beginning of the Middle School.</p>

<li>Alleyn's is considered to be one the best co-educational school in the country by the Good Schools Guide.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After the separation from Dulwich College, Alleyn's was initially not allowed to play <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a>. Upon the split the two schools played a rugby match to determine which school would have the right to play the game. When Dulwich College won they confirmed their right to play rugby, whilst Alleyn's would play <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">association football</a>. Alleyn's did make tentative moves towards introducing rugby football very briefly in the late 1970s when the then chaplain (a keen rugby player) set up a team and began organising matches. There was little interest, however, and the attempt did not survive the chaplain's retirement.</li>
