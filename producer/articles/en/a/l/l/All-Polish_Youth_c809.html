<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Polish_Youth_c809.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The earliest roots of -Polish Youth reach back to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, but the present incarnation was created on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2.html" title="December 2">December 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, and has been affiliated with the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Polish_Families_66bc.html" title="League of Polish Families">League of Polish Families</a>, as its <i>de facto</i> youth wing, since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>The organisation, properly the Academic Union "All-Polish Youth" (<i>Związek Akademicki "Młodzież Wszechpolska"</i>), was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> as an ideological youth organisation with a strong nationalist sentiment, and was the largest student organisation in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Polish_Republic_1372.html" title="Second Polish Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>. The Founding Convention of the All-Polish youth took place in March of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Dmowski_af6f.html" title="Roman Dmowski">Roman Dmowski</a> being selected honorary chairman.</p>
<p>The term "All-Polish" is intended to represent a desire to unify all Polish lands, and accentuate national ties and the equality of all people of Polish origin regardless of their wealth or social status. In the inter-war period, members of the organisation participated actively in academic life, and became the heads of many student organisations, defending the autonomy of universities against centralising forces in the government and campaigning for lower tuition fees.</p>
<p>They also favoured economically boycotting the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, and limiting their access to higher education (<a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerus_clausus.html" title="Numerus clausus">numerus clausus</a>). Members of the organisation forced the universities to institute the so-called 'classroom ghettos', where Jewish students would be seated separately from in lecture halls, even though during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> the group rejected <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> policy towards the Jews, and aided them when possible. During the war, the All-Polish Youth fought with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armia_Krajowa_a186.html" title="Armia Krajowa">Home Army</a> and the National Armed Forces. The organisation, secretly recreated in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>/<a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, was again destroyed by the new communist régime.</p>
<p>The modern incarnation of the All-Polish Youth was founded in <a href="../../../p/o/z/Pozna%C5%84.html" title="Poznań">Poznań</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, on the initiative of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Giertych_e083.html" title="Roman Giertych">Roman Giertych</a>, the current leader of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Polish_Families_66bc.html" title="League of Polish Families">League of Polish Families</a> (LPR). Continuing the tradition of its precursors, the organisation maintains its aim of raising youth with their ideology, and operates across all of Poland, working with high-school and university students.</p>
<p>The membership of the organisation is approximately 3,000 people. It is widely regarded as the youth wing of the LPR, and it is supported by that party. This support was particularly evident during the 2005 parliamentary elections, when the leader of the LPR recalled some candidates from the party list in order to replace them with younger people belonging to the All-Polish Youth.</p>

<p>The organisation states that its goal is to raise its members with the spirit of catholic and patriotic values. Although its members may be engaged in politics, they do not do so in the name of the organisation, which has no formal political goals.</p>
<p>To realise its aims, the group organises, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>educational camps, which include:
<ul>
<li>lectures on historical and socio-political topics</li>
<li>meetings with pre-war activists and other invited guests</li>
<li>sporting vents</li>
<li>concerts</li>
<li>visits to national landmarks</li>
<li>Catholic masses and pilgrimages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>historical and literary contests for youth</li>
<li>the <i>I Love Poland</i> social campaign - a project run by the organisation to promote so-called 'modern patriotism', aimed chiefly at young people.</li>
<li>an information campaign encouraging entrepreneurship in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Pomeranian_Voivodship_3468.html" title="West Pomeranian Voivodship">West Pomeranian Voivodship</a>.</li>
<li>celebrations of national holidays and other important anniversaries.</li>
<li>gathering donations for poor children and Poles in the countries of the former Soviet Union</li>
<li>an <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">anti-abortion</a> <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotline.html" title="Hotline">hotline</a> which seeks information about underground abortion activities.</li>
<li>the <i>Stop <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">Pornography</a></i> campaign, which aims to end the display of pornographic material in public forums.</li>
<li>free continuing education for children from impoverished families</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Polish_Youth_c809.html" title="Edit section: Criticisms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>The All-Polish Youth is accused of promoting <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>. Opponents emphasise that the organization's activists have used political violence on multiple occasions. For example, during the Equality Parade in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> on June 11, 2005, members were widely suspected to have thrown rocks, bottles and other projectiles at the marchers (although none of the people arrested were members). According to an independent report, two people were taken to hospital to treat injuries. It remains unclear whether these actions were encouraged or initiated by the group's leaders or its political patrons.</p>
<p>Examples of violent and aggressive acts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, May 11, 2002 - several thousand proponents of Polish integration with the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> participate in the Schuman Parade through Warsaw, which consisted mostly of school-age children. Along the parade route, groups of All-Polish Youth members, as well as other like-minded organisations, launched aggressive counter-demonstrations, shouting slogans such as "Paedophiles and pederasts are Euro-enthusiasts", "Great Catholic Poland" and "Poland is for Poles." An EU flag was burned.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, March 8, 2003 - a group of members disrupted an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Women%27s_Day_1e3d.html" title="International Women's Day">International Women's Day</a> demonstration with aggressive behaviour. They shouted slogans that insulted women and sexual minorities, and pelted the demonstrators with snow and ice. Nobody was injured.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopot.html" title="Sopot">Sopot</a>, April 26, 2003 - around 20 supporters of the All-Polish Youth and the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Polish_Families_66bc.html" title="League of Polish Families">League of Polish Families</a> disrupted a pro-EU demonstration, attempting to launch an unauthorised counter-demonstration of their own.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, May 1, 2003 - a gay and lesbian parade was disrupted by members shouting slogans which some considered to be offensive to the marchers.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/W%C5%82adys%C5%82awowo.html" title="Władysławowo">Władysławowo</a>, June 21, 2003. The organisation and the LPR launched aggressive demonstrations against the arrival in Poland of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> ship Langenort, operated by <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_on_Waves_ea80.html" title="Women on Waves">Women on Waves</a>, a group which provides abortions in international waters to women from countries where it is not legal. On June 21, the Dutch women were pelted with various projectiles, and several days later the right-wing activists had a violent confrontation with the Polish border patrol. During the several-day action, an LPR member of parliament, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Str%C4%85k_594e.html" title="Robert Strąk">Robert Strąk</a>, spoke out in the media repeatedly in favour of the demonstrations.</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/l/s/Olsztyn.html" title="Olsztyn">Olsztyn</a>, July 12, 2003 - a group of members of the All-Polish Youth assaulted 21-year-old Ewelina Salita, a sympathiser of the National Polish Renaissance; the incident being part of a wider political war between these two groups. Salita, a former member of the organisation, had been attacked a year earlier. According to the victim's testimony, she had acid poured on her by the secretary of the local wing of the All-Polish Youth, Łukasz Czarnecki. She was diagnosed with first-degree chemical burns on her face, neck and left eye. The attack was supposedly organised by Krzysztof Fedorowicz, the local organisation leader. The victim had been receiving death threats from a cellular phone belonging to Grzegorz Sielatycki, a leader of the organisation in the Gdańsk region, who was a city councillor and worked in the offices of a local LPR politician.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>, December 15, 2003 - a gathering under the banner "I'm gay, I'm a lesbian, let's meet" at the University of Gdański, attended by gay rights activists and the Government Commissioner for Equal Rights, was disrupted by members of the All-Polish Youth, led by Grzegorz Siematycki, carrying a sign saying 'Faggotry prohibited'. The incident ended with police intervention. Similar events occurred in other cities, with organisation members disrupting pro-gay events "in the company of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi-Skinheads_517f.html" title="Nazi-Skinheads">skinheads</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazis_f17f.html" title="Neo-Nazis">neo-Nazis</a>" (according to an organiser), and describing a sudden change of venue in another event as a 'Jewish trick.' In <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a> they carried a poster reading "Homosexuality is a sin; it can be cured."</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, March 7, 2004 - during an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Women%27s_Day_1e3d.html" title="International Women's Day">International Women's Day</a> demonstration, equal rights demonstrators were attacked by a group of Youth members, who threw stones, ice and tomatoes at the demonstrators. They shouted slogans, including "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camps.html" title="Concentration camps">Concentration camps</a> for lesbians, <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a> for faggots." There were several beatings, and one of the women was injured shielding her child in a stroller from the projectiles, before the police intervened. Skinheads with <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> insignia were seen with the All-Polish Youth.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>, May 8, 2004 - a gay rights march in central Kraków was attacked by members and sympathisers of the All-Polish Youth and the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Polish_Families_66bc.html" title="League of Polish Families">League of Polish Families</a>, who shouted offensive slogans and began throwing rocks, eggs and bottles at the marchers (as well as attacking them on their way home after the parade had dispersed). Police used force, and over 20 people were arrested. One policeman was injured when acid was poured on him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public statements by the group, when referring to their ideological opponents, are dominated by aggressive language. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuals</a> are referred to as "faggots", "perverts" and "degenerates" — language which is not used by other opponents of homosexuality. Such language is evident not just in spontaneous media interviews, but also on All-Polish Youth websites.</p>
<p>A counter-organisation whose stated aim was to marginalise the All-Polish Youth in public debate was founded on September 22, 2005.</p>
