<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dr Ganser and ST911.org</span></h2>
<p>I have again removed the misleading association of Dr. Ganser's 1999-2003 work with his membership of ST911.org in 2006. USER:Torturous Devastating Cudgel added this line and his stated reason was to associate Dr. Ganser "with a group of well know crackpots". This is POV pushing in its clearest form. ST911.org can have no possible association with Dr. Ganser's work as the organisation did not exist at the time. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 10:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am confused, is he a member of the organization now? If so I do not see the problem, its like not calling George Bush as President Bush when you talk about anythnig that happened before the election ... If he is a member, I am sure he is a proud member, I am not sure what the problem is. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 11:59, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its irrelivant to the research. And if someone wrote "Famous alcoholic President George Bush...", don't tell me that wouldn't be biased and POV pushing. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 13:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except alcoholic isnt a position, nor something I am sure he is proud of. Are you comparing his membership to this group with a disease? hardly a fair comparison. If Ganser is a member, proudly not forceably, then I do not see the problem. Again when speaking about George Bush, notice how you said President, even though the alcoholism was in the past before the presidency ... you kind of proved the point. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:24, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why are you editing the article in a clear situation of an edit conflict while its protected anyway? This clearly isnt a typo or error, he is a member, its an editing conflict over if it should or should not mentioned, please place the information back in the article while the article is protected. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:28, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a clear error, and clearly biased POV pushing as admitted by the editor.

<dl>
<dd>Oh, come on. The editor who added it himself says he did it to discredit Ganser. Given that, and the fact that there is no relationship and no possible relationship between ST911.org and this research, How can it be anything but biased POV pushing? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 13:49, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What exactly is the POV being pushed if he is a proud member of that organization? You make it seems like he should shamed by the organizations he joins. So please, what is this POV of stating the organizations that he willingly joined and remains a member of.

<dl>
<dd>Its not end of story, you are actually arguing against something you know is true. Your own words prove that he should be addressed by his prominent position. Your exact words were "Famous alcoholic President George Bush..." However he wasnt an alcoholic when he was president, so you should have been saying "famous alcoholic George Bush" if you really believed what you are arguing. This will be noted and when the protection is removed his position will be readded. Please refrain from using admin tools to solve content disputes you are involved with in the future. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct but your insinuated negative is alcoholism, which equates it to Scholars for 9/11 Truth, however you still noted him as president, whereas president, therefore even in your attempt to prove past events should not be noted, you still noted him according to the way the article should, by his prominent position.</dd>

<dd>The insinuated negative is in bold, note you still called him persident though it was before the alcoholism. So you are in fact still noting him by his most prominent position regardless of the timeline. As I said before if you felt the prominent position should not be noted as the membership to a group, in this case alcholics, was before the position, it would simply read "Famous alcoholic George Bush" --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you suggesting that an ETH researcher is less prominant than being a member of ST911.org? ETH is one of the most important universities in the world.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 14:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ETH is noted in both if you did not notice. It also just says he is "of" not that he is a research for. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:34, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>His is and was a researcher for ETH. ETH awarded him a PhD for this research. There is no connection to ST911.org <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 14:36, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just to point out further your edit summary was incorrect, this information is not misleading and is quite factually verifiable. You seem to have a negative view of this oraganization as you equate it with alcoholism. However the doctor is quite happy with his membership, or at least he hasnt given it up as its voluntary, we should not exclude it simpyl because an admin has negative ideas associated with it. Noone said there was a connection, ST911.org connects to him as he is a prominent member of the organization, hence it should be noted. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The point isn't what you or I think. This article isn't about Ganser's life and isn't a list of his memberships. The article mentions research on a topic. There is absolutely zero connection between that research and this organisation. It was admittedly added to put a POV. It needs to be removed. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 14:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This person is not famous for having a PhD from ETH. He has an article, albeit stub, for his participation in Scholars for 9/11 Truth, hence it should be the thing we note, not a PhD from ETH. His article does not even mention ETH. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:46, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is Ganser mentioned in this article? Because he is an ST911 member, or because of his research for ETH on Nato and Gladio? ETH does mention his work, for example, <a href="http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/e/articles/sciencelife/NatoGeheimarmee.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/e/articles/sciencelife/NatoGeheimarmee.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 14:52, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He is not notable for that, if you wikilinked his name and followed it, it would mention 9/11 scholars and nothing else, while this should be expanded, it should be noted that simply his PhD from ETH would not warrant him an article here, so the reason he is notable should be mentioned, as its obviously important. Again I ask you put aside your negative feelings of this group and simply allow him to be noted by a group he willingfully joined and was able to get an article on Wikipedia because of his membership to. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:01, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It is ludricous to suggest that he is notable because of ST911.org membership. It is also irrelivant. He is mentioned here because of his research for ETH and nothing more. ST911.org has no connection to that research. (Also, I don't have 'negative feelings' for ST911.org. I have written articles for them myself. But they have absolutely no connection to this research.) <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 15:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How is it ludacris to state that when he only has an article because of his affiliation with them and is only noted prior to this event in the article related to them? If I put it up for AfD I am sure that noone is going to state prominent ETH researcher as a reason to keep. The edit history shows he only has a article because of them and so he is notable because of them, at least by Wikipedia standards. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because os his ETH research, however that doesnt mean we limit who he is to just that, his prominent role now is his 9/11 Truth membership as noted here on Wikipedia. He is notable because of it, your failure to see this is beyond my belief. I give up, you are gonig to do whatever you want, and abuse your admin tools to do it, this is not becoming a waste of my time, because even though you symantically do use this system as proven above and then totally ignored when confronted with it, you will still fight to keep mention of this organization off this page because of your personal opinion of it. When the page is unprotected I will simply add it back as you have given no reason for its removal. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your reason given was because TDC was pushing POV, you failed to prove that, I am done arguing in circles with you. I have proven that you yourself use this method to reffer to people, which you again ignore as I laid out above, and that his position in 9/11 Scholars is why he even has an article here. However you ignore these points and I am tired of restating myself to have you keep saying the same thing, as such I have decided to no longer discuss this with you until the time in which one of stops saying the same thing.

<blockquote>
<p>Administrators should be cautious about editing protected pages and do so in accordance with consensus and any specific guidelines on the subject. In most cases, administrators should first raise the issue on the relevant talk page, unless a case of obvious trolling and/or revert warring, or blatantly unsuitable content. In the following specific cases, an exception is made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">protected</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../v/p/r/Template%7EVprotected_5459.html" title="Template:Vprotected">vprotected</a>}} template</li>
<li>Adding a link to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccuracy_dispute_97fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute">Wikipedia:accuracy dispute</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_dispute_c299.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV dispute">Wikipedia:NPOV dispute</a>, or a similar disclaimer about the current state of an article.</li>
<li>Reverting to an old version of the page from a week or so before the controversy started <i>if</i> there is a clear point before the controversy.</li>
<li>Reverting to a favored version, as described above.</li>
<li>Correcting spelling mistakes or typos.</li>
</ul>
Special caution is needed in editing permanently and semi-permanently protected pages. In nearly all cases, administrators should not make substantial changes to pages protected for legal reasons, excepting cases of obvious trolling and/or vandalism. Because of their visibility and importance, most MediaWiki namespace pages should be approached with extreme caution and only by those who adequately understand the consequences of their changes. Edits can be made to already protected pages via {{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">Editprotected</a>|reason}} requests.</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you should post to AN/I asking for input on this (no offense to anyone else on this talk page or that will wander along that HAS contributed; none of us are non-biased enough on either side to judge).

I stumbled upon this page. I must say I was surprised (as in 'what a coincidence') to see Ganser's name because I am in the middle of his book on Gladio "nato's secret armies". That is how I knew him. Not his school. I had no idea about that. I wanted to see the entire list of the scholars. But the list only had about 20 or so. Why only those were chosen to be listed? So why not list them all?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">OK, so the name itself</span></h2>
<p>Let's try this a completely different way, as everything else is getting us nowhere for days. I say we don't even DISCUSS unprotecting until we get a "Final" name as that's such a big to do. Once we agree on a name (I'm saying lets gun for at least 70%+ concensus, so no one can complain legitimately after), we go back to unprotecting talk. I *do* feel that the "series" of articles have value and merit, but we should come up with a standard name for the lot of them. Xyz in abc country. The others get hardly any action, and we're the 'lead' article arguably, so lets do this right, and then the whole thing can be moved into the whole Terrorism line of articles/category. How about each person just reply with what <b>YOU</b> think should be the best name format. Don't give us a doctoral essay--give us a naming structure, like Badminton and the United States or something, so we know where each of us stands, and what each of us <b>wants</b>. PLEASE don't start a threaded debate, we've had a million and they go nowhere now. Let's just hear your ideas for a new naming scheme--right to the point, what do you want? Then we can find a middle ground. I'll lead off. Feel free to change your <s>vote</s> idea after, if you like someone else's more. If your name idea implies a change in tone/content of the article, that's fine--don't tell us here, let us just know the name, not what it means to you yet. Lets just work on a name, then we can see what we have from that. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 02:06, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Upon re-reading the suggestions, I notice that Kalsemar may be switching to another proposal. I agree with Kalsemar and Travb that "allegations" is unencycl. In the interest of reaching agreement, if Kalsemar switches I don't want to be the sole holdout for this suggestion, and I'll switch to Political Violence by the United States, along the lines proposed by Travb. I think "US", as opposed to "American", because in this context "American" is not the precise term for designating the political entity known as the US gov't. We would have to disambiguate wars authorized by Congress, which could also be understood as political violence.--<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 22:01, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</span></h3>
<p>Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C. However, this would be an example of a new synthesis of published material serving to advance a position, and as such it would constitute original research. "A and B, therefore C" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published this argument in relation to the topic of the article.</p>

<p>Smith says that Jones committed plagiarism in Jones's <i>Flower-Arranging: The Real Story</i> by copying references from another book. Jones denies this, saying he is guilty only of good scholarly practice because he gave citations for the references he had learned about in the other book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, so good. Now comes the new synthesis of published material:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources is false, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> as well as Harvard's student writing manual, both of which require citation of the source actually consulted. Neither manual calls violations of this rule on citing original sources "plagiarism." Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This entire paragraph is original research, because it is the editor's own synthesis of published material serving to advance his definition and opinion of plagiarism and whether Jones committed it. The editor is citing good sources about best practice (<i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> and Harvard's student writing manual). In an article about plagiarism, some of the points he makes might be acceptable, so long as he provided links or citations to the sources.</p>
<p>But in an article about Jones, the paragraph is putting forward the editor's opinion that, given a certain definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. Regardless of the fact that his opinion appears to be supported, other things being equal, by the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i>, it remains the editor's opinion.</p>
<p>For this paragraph to be acceptable in the article about Jones, the editor would have to find a reliable source <b>who had commented on the Smith and Jones dispute</b> and who had himself made the point that: "If Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources is false, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i>..." and so on. That is, <b>that precise argument, or combination of material, must have been published by a reliable source <i>in the context of the topic the article is about</i></b>.</p>

<dd>I am not here to do research for all the people who want an entire article based on allegations. I was told numerous times by the last editor arguing he can find lots of historians, however he never provided one. Again if the only person is Alarcon then this article still will be heading back to AfD. Extraordinary claims need numerous sources, if you want to argue that the US commited terrorism in Cuba then provide more then 2 people stating it, historians would be best instead of Chomsky and a person who works for the other government, the government that only has one voice because it only has one political party is quite dubious. And my apologies I misread when you stated <b>"You'll also find his responses to allegations that Cuba is a "terrorist state", "</b> Though I have never actually heard the US call Cuba that, though I completely believe they would.

<dd>Sorry but <i>I don't want to argue that "the US commited terrorism"</i>. It has already been argued, notably so. Government allegations to the UN and other organs are notable. You completely misunderstand the way wikipedia works if you think otherwise and your requests for Afd, without taking 10 seconds of your time to discover that these allegations are widespread, notable, and worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia is counter-productive. All articles of this nature are <i>articles based on allegations</i>. See <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_5243.html" title="Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba">Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba</a> for example. That's the way it works.</dd>
<dd>Among the numerous allegations in question here is Cuba's lawsuit against the U.S. declaring that for over 40 years, "terrorism has been permanently used by the U.S. as an instrument of its foreign policy against Cuba,".<a href="http://www.cpa.org.au/garchve2/990cuba.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cpa.org.au/garchve2/990cuba.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>,<a href="http://www.workers.org/ww/1999/cuba0916.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.workers.org/ww/1999/cuba0916.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Such allegations are the basis of this page. There should be no argument here on your part. And no more calls to delete this article. Please move on to allow this page to be unprotected as per policy, and allow editors to insert notable "accusations of state terrorism".--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 16:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have oddly enoguh been told by editors that I have too firm a grasp of how Wikipedia works. I never said there was no proof, I simply said repeatedly, and still do, that this article has no sources. I do not mind sources and as I told you, extraordinary claims need numerous sources, if you can provide those more power to you. My personal belief, which does not bare on my ability to actuall yprove it, is that Cuba is a poor helpless victim of the US bullying, but I don't have sources and neither does this article, not ones I would consider credible enough at least. So if you can provide sources that stand up to WP:RS and WP:V which asks if the source is reliable and verifiable then that is fine and more power to you. However if all you have is Castro and his workers or his political party then that is something different since he controls all of that directly. In reality showing Castro, Alarcon and his party all saying something is providing one source. Just to follow up, I call for deletion because there was no sources supporting the information, sources were provided showing that events happened not that anyone called them terrorism. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:51, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry again, but all my sources provided so far stand up to WP:RS and WP:V concerning "allegations of state terrorism". You really do not appear to understand how this works. The <i>allegations</i> are verifiable and come from reliable sources. Whether the actual claims themselves can be verified by us in some imaginary court is <i>not the point</i>. Some personal notion you have about Castro is <i>not the point</i>. Whether you find the allegations credible is <i>not the point</i>. <b>We report notable views</b>. I believe this has been stressed to you before by other editors.

<p>User:Zer0faults, can you please relax a bit? I urge you to read more about how wikipedia works and how to deal with controversial subjects. It is clear that you completely misunderstand the way wikipedia works.</p>
<p>Could we agree that it really is counter-productive when one wikiuser tells other wikiusers to calm down and belittles other users, telling them that they misunderstand wikipeida, and encouraging them to read wikipedia policy?</p>
<p>Especially when some would say that this user selectively interprets wikipolicy and actively ignores wikipolicy which does not support their own view? BTW, you have now threatened to report me at least three times to admins. You quote wikipolicy repeatedly, but when I call you on your narrow interpretation of wikipolicy and back you into a corner, you either threaten me, demand to move the discussion somewhere else, or ignore my points.</p>
<p>The last threat was because of a posting here which I decided to abort and erase, which showed how you readily accept certain sources on pages which support your views (for example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>), but you refuse to have these same sources here. Some would say this is hypocricy. Why is the Guardian met <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> etc. on War_on_Terrorism/Rewrite you monitor but not this one? Why is referencing the NYT on the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Cope2.html" title="Cope2">Cope2</a> page okay, but not on this page?</p>
<p>Further, is it okay to say whatever you want to anyone, in violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> as long as you state it as "Some would say"? This seems to be your policy, which I have repeatedly used.</p>
<p>You continue to say "focus on the article, not the editor", yet you are constantly talking down to other wikiusers about reading policy, telling other editors "You completely misunderstand the way wikipedia works" and telling them to calm down.</p>
<p>If you are going to use wikipedia policy as a weapon, selectively ignoring policy which doesn't support your POV, don't be surprised if other users turn your own weapon against you.</p>

<dd>Just so you understand, The Guardian meets WP:RS, however taking an article that does not even contain the word terrorism and stating that its proof that the US has been accused of terrorism, especially when the article says unlawful combat, is basically lying about the source.

<p>Morton devonshire got the article unprotected. Wow. What next? What should we, as a group do? Any suggestions? Is there anything we can do to avoid the article being protected again?

<dd>Zerofaults is correct here. Now that the page is unlocked, everything that doesn't directly refer to "allegations of state terrorism" should be removed, including the present Cuba material.

<dd>Extraordinary claims need numerous citiations, further there are 3 things being accused there and the other do not contain accusations against the US of terrorism. One states the person is a terrorist, and a CIA agent, not that the US supported his terrorist acts or told him to do them. The other states that the US took in 2 terrorists, however it also states they were not found guilty of terrorism just accused of it by Cuba and when they were released from prison it was on immigration charges, not terrorism charges. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:00, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't suggesting the CIA agent was acting independently of the U.S. Government. If your POV is that he wasn't involved in terrorism, that's fine.

<dl>
<dd>There in lies the confusion, this article is about US terrorism and allegations of it. There is no allegation of this being a case of US terrorism, its a case of a US citizen being a terrorist. As noted in my example, if the police are sent out to write tickets and instead beat a black man, that does not mean that they were sent out to beat black men. HE acted independantly of the US government and the source does not say he was acting on behalf of the government. The problem is not that the events did not happen, its that the source does not prove the allegation exists, which is the problem with most of the article, the source prove something happened, just not the existence of an allegation of US terrorism. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, this conversation diverged, but I appreciate everyone holding back from large scale deletions in this article, and attempting to work towards consensus. I encourage everyone to voice their opinion here: Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America/strawpolls. I am disappointed that some wikiusers encouraged the straw poll's creation, and yet have not voiced their opinion. Thus far only three people have taken the time to voice their opinion on the straw poll.

<p>In the interest of avoiding edit wars, I propose that all significant additions or deletions first be proposed on the talk page for a few days so others have a chance to comment and deliberate. This is the practice on some other controversial articles.--<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 18:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Your own source says the manual was not US policy ... Do you read the stuff you present. <b>"Administration officials were reported to have stated privately that the manual had been written by an "overzealous" independent low-level employee under contract to the CIA."</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also your selective quoting above is horrible, here is the complete quote:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent news reports, based largely on interviews with Contra leaders, have indicated the manual was produced by the CIA to <i>limit atrocities committed by the guerrillas</i>. <b>Minetta said if that is accurate, the CIA did not tell the committees of violent acts by the rebels and all they did was professionalize the terror.</b><br />
The manual, which surfaced in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, is titled "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare." It largely discusses non-violent ways for rebels to win support from civilians they encounter.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Emphasis added on what you choose to quote. Oddly you left out the preceding and following statement ... Please be more careful next time as it does not look good when these events unfold.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just to point out the sources accuse the CIA of working independantly from the US in any accusations as well. So maybe you should start a "allegations of terrorism by the CIA" article, since that would be a better fit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is another good quote:</dd>
<dd><b>"Casey, who is recovering at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, defended the manual in a 1984 letter to members of Congress. He said its purpose was to make the rebels <i>persuasive in face to face communication</i> and that its stress was <i>on education, avoiding combat when necessary.</i>"</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Am I missing something, the article posted on livejournal about the SOA, does not even mention Cuba ... The FFF.org article is an op-ed on a non notable publication with unknown editorial standards and is not an expert on the field ... While the SOA seems to be widely held and can be used in other areas possibly, it does not even mention Cuba and hence cannot be used to support that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More goodies, the article from livejournal specifically states <b>"the teaching of torture at the SOA never received official approval from either the executive or legislative branches."</b> therefore its again, not the US commiting the acts, the article does not even state it is, just that they were not nice for teaching others how to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Last point the article on the SOA cuts off prematurely, and it never says the US sponsored or commited terrorism, just that they taught people how to torture and kill. While the title is nice, the text does not support an allegation of terrorism, as none is made in the text. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:37, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You didnt actually produce anyone calling it terrorism, you did quite the opposite, further you stated "<b>Minetta said if that is accurate"</b> as someone calling it terrorism, however the statement is clearly conditional. This is why I am happy I looked over your source and why you fail to argue differently.</dd>
<dd>"Atrocities Committed by School of the Americas Alumni" This is a legal arguement being made that the people who died may be able to bring a case under certain circumstances against the United States, however the article is incomplete and so it cannot be used as a realistic source, its also on Livejournal which makes its origins dubious. The article doesnt conclude nor does the author state that the US did commit terrorism or accuses them of such, just makes a legal arguement on how the people in foreign countries can seek a court case. The article also specifically states that these acts were not commited by the US or by others acting on behalf of the US, just that the US taught them bad things and may be held responcible for it. The School of Americas Alumni are not US citizens, they are foreign nationals, their terrorist acts are not acts by the US.</dd>
<dd>The CIA murder manual quote does not accuse the US either, it specifically states its unclear if they were even following the manual "To the <b>extent (unclear)</b> to which the manual's advice was applied" That means terrorism occured, but its unclear if anyone was even following the manual, furthermore the actions by those people are not US terrorism and the US was not involved and as pointed out in other articles you provided, the manual does not mention killing anyone and as pointed out by the quote above, was specifically made to stop violence. So who is making the accusations in that quote? Stating terrorism took place is obvious, but the quote is not stating its by the US.</dd>
<dd>The FFF article again fails WP:RS and WP:V and is possibly written by a non expert as their standing is not given. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 17:08, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tactics to employ if you're in a logical debate and logic has not sided with you (for any number of reasons), and you are nevertheless unwilling to change your argument or opinion.
<dl>
<dd>Number 7: Play the definition game. This one is also very popular... "death" doesn't really mean death, it really means "separation from God's grace", didn't you know that? "Kill" doesn't mean kill, it really means "murder", as any fool knows. This tactic is so popular with biblical believers because of the ample protection that is offered from the confusion resulting from having the bible translated into (and from) a jangle of languages, so that every culture comes away with a different interpretation of God's absolute word. Few people know ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, and modern English. Combine this with poetry, parable, and prophecy, and you can pretty much make up whatever you like. How can you lose?</dd>

<dd>Correct me if I am wrong but it seems your source primary language is English, so are you now arguing that killed = terrorized? since you are accusing me of muddying definitions, does this mean unlawful combat = terrorism, war crime = terrorism, illegal act = terrorism? Well sorry but then you need to change the article, terrorism = terrorism and if your sources arent calling it terrorism, then its not terrorism. The worst part is, when you goto source this what are you planning to write? AuthorX of the Washington Post called it terrorism? or do you really plan to state that the people in the article did it, even though they never used that word? We do not change peoples comments to mean what we want them to mean here, please read up on citing and quoting etc.</dd>

<dd>I plan on quoting articles, and using sources which I found, a skill, I might add, which you have not shown in an entire month on this page. You have yet to provide any source for your POV, your only proficent at quoting wikipedia policy and, when needed, twisting wikipedia policy to support your POV, when I point out this contridiction, such as <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, you threaten an <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>, you demand the comments be moved, etc. The livejournal links are my own, I cut and pasted these articles so that the entire article can be read by everyone. So please stop accusing me of selectively choosing what to quote and what not to quote, when, first: this is your <b>entire</b> strategy: selectively ignoring passages which don't fit your own POV, second: you have yet to provide any sources which back up your POV, and third, you are reading my livejournal article, which I provided, so that others could make up their own mind. You <b>are</b> arguing the defintion, repeatedly, terror doesn't really mean terrorism, it means something else. And when this fails, you fall back on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Nevermind that in other articles you quote the same sources, nevermind that I effectively destroyed your <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> argument with Chomsky. You will keep repeating the same thing, over and over again, in the hopes that if you say it enough, people will believe it. I provide three articles which clearly state that the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_Operations_in_Guerrilla_Warfare_003b.html" title="Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare">Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare</a> is terrorism, and I quote the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_Operations_in_Guerrilla_Warfare_003b.html" title="Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare">Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare</a> manual itself. But the manual doesn't really say "terrorism" it says something else. You selectively choose which facts to ignore and which to emphasize.</dd>
<dd>The "Nicaragua insurgency" was a client army of the US, read the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_v_Nicaragua_ac8e.html" title="US v Nicaragua">US v Nicaragua</a> when US funding went down, the "Nicaragua insurgency" went down, the court found a definate link. READ THE CASE. So, you argue, quite disingenously, that since our client army did the terrorism, the US is not responsible. This is the same weak argument that you use in arguing that the SOA should not be included (with no sources of course) here: Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls#SOA_and_SOA_Watch.

The article on the page itself specifically states <b>"The United States of America, by producing in 1983 a manual entitled 'Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas' ("Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare")[4], and disseminating it to Contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law; <i>but [the Court] did not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been committed were imputable to the United States of America as acts of the United States of America.</i> "</b> How many times does that have to be gone over. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By that logic Bin Ladin isn't a terrorist because he didn't personally commit any acts of terrorism. He just trained the guys who did. That may be your opinion. Others may have a different opinion. The US is not a person and cannot 'bodily' commit acts of terrorism. However, if the US state trains a supports others who do, then that is US state terrorism.Self-Described Seabhcán

Your accusations are becoming more and more confused. "Please produce the originals so they can be read in a non copyvio medium before we even go any further." I already have. Do you have access to lexisnexis research? Most people don't. If you do, you are welcome to read these sources at your leisure.

<dd>Your argumenents Failed <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, your argument failed <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, now, I have produced the articles verbatum and now you throw out copyright, twisting <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> yet again. The (modified) saying goes: Some people will change his views to fit the facts; Some will change the facts to fit his views. You are modifying the facts to change the views. There is no way we will ever reach consensus, because you continue to change the rules to fit your POV. I jump over one bar, and then you raise the bar higher, and say, okay: "you now have to jump over this bar". I am really glad we had this conversation, because it is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primae_facia.html" title="Primae facia">Primae facia</a> evidence of your tactics, along with the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> argument and the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> argument.</dd>

<dd>I really don't understand your tactics at this point. Failing to destroy my arguments with wikipedia policy, failing to add any sources which support your own POV, what are you doing? Are you attempting to get me angry and spout off, so that you have more evidence in your continued threatened <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>? This is the only thing that I can figure out: because your arguments have become more illogical and irrational the more we talk.</dd>
<dd>"Nicaragua insurgency is a client" Read the court case, it is not my job to provide every line and paragaph verbatium here, so that you can simply flip them away at your leisure, and twist their meaning to the point of absurdity. I still await <b>one referenced source</b> to anything you say. You have provided none.</dd>
<dd>Oh another theat, this is the best one of all: "I think maybe bordering on <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> I will ask an admin however about linkspam" When rational debate, when facts are up against you, what have you done repeatedly?: Threatened to contact an admin.

I still await the explanation about how cutting and pasting articles on other pages outside of wikipedia violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Will you ignore this too?</dd>
<dd>"...and (Chomsky) will be removed when the page is unprotected" Based on what? Please remember <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a>, and please follow the guidelines of wikipedia, even those guidelines which do not support your own <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. It doesn't seem fair that you constantly preach wikipedia guidelines to others, yet you either don't follow them yourself, or ignore them when they are inconvenient.</dd>
<dd>I am glad we are making progress though:
<ol>
<li>The Guardian is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> I quote: "The Guardian meets WP:RS", and</li>
<li>The US trains terrorists at the SOA, I quote you: ""Noone is arguing (the SOA) not a terrorist training ground".[Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls#Oppose_19|1]</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Of course, no sources were provided for your declaration, becuase you have yet to provide one source, for any of your opinions. But we wikipedians now have the "green light" from User:Zer0faults, to allow the Guardian into the article, and to write that the US trains terrorists at the SOA. Thanks User:Zer0faults.</dd>
<dd>All we have to base you conclusions on is your opinion. I have stated before, if you want to win an edit war, outsource someone. It is clear that your tactic of selectively quoting wikipedia policy has started to catch up to you. I have repeatedly illustrated how you selectively quote wikipedia policy. Whereas myself and other wikipedians have provided dozens of sources, and you have not provided none. As Sea said: "You seem to have an exaggerated sense of your own importance." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and as an encyclopedia all of their sources must be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiable</a> "SOA are not US soldiers or government officials or people acting on behalf of the US or employed by the US etc." Can you cite your source?</dd>
<dd>And what has all this anti-consensus behavior gotten you? The page is protected, all of the sourced material is still on the page, despite your repeated attempts to delete them, we are building a strong consensus despite you. Tom and the person who put the AfD are comprimising what should stay in the article, and your position to delete everything is becoming more and more isolated.</dd>
<dd>I welcome your help in building this page together. But please provide sources for your opinion, and please stop misquoting wikipedia policy.</dd>
<dd>"Thats all very interesting, however I am still waiting for your sources, the court ruling specifically stated they were not acting under the guide of the US, just that the US was interferring in their countries issues by supporting financially the guerrilas" Lets stay focused here, we are talking about the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_Operations_in_Guerrilla_Warfare_003b.html" title="Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare">Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare</a> manual. If you would like to start a new section about <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_v_Nicaragua_ac8e.html" title="US v Nicaragua">US v Nicaragua</a>, I welcome it. I have read portions of the only book on this court case, and I am willing to provide sources: that is the stark difference between myself and you. I have also read more of the complex case, which I could provide sources for too, whereas you repeatedly, for over a month, provided none. The fact remains that several sources have provided meet or exceed this wikipedia policy hoop that you put up: "Everything...needs sources calling it terrorism, almost none of the items actually have a source calling it terrorism or accusing it even of terrorism." But when I met, even exceeded this bar, you raised the bar even higher. Typical tactic. It may work on non-encyclopedic web blogs, but this is wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Well Zero, I have grown weary of the <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> threats.

<dd>Your inability to understand anything is quite amazing. Quoting Chomsky is not OR, however applying Chomskys quote to all unlawful combat cases when he was reffering to specific one is OR. Further using Chomsky as a WP:RS source when he is not a journalist nor a legal degree holding person, or expert on the legal field is against policy. Please read this previous statement repeatedly, you keep attempting to twist what I said, or your comprehension is not cutting it.</dd>

<dd>Stating the US trains terrorists at the SOA is actually false, because they are not terrorists till some time after they leave the SOA. I am not sure why you keep getting things like this confused, not all Yale graduates are president, though many have gone on to become, Yale does not train people to become president though they go on to become. Of the 60,000+ people trained at the SOA, how many have become terrorists? Again keep asking me to provide source to counter claims only you are making is just silly, you are not important enough to have someone specifically counter your claims in the mass media. However you still have yet to provide a source accusing the US of terrorism in the case of Nicaragua, I know the headline says ... Can you please tell me who in that article, now that I have asked 3 times is stating the US commited terrorism and their exact quote as well as their position and rank? You can write paragraph after paragraph but I will just keep posting this question as it illustrates my point exactly. What a shame I dont see that SOA thing ever reaching a concensus. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 08:57, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a>. I guess when you run out of proof you can instead insult people. However this comment has been noted. Thank you for answering my question. "Quoting Chomsky is not OR." Okay. I agree. "applying Chomskys quote to all unlawful combat cases when he was reffering to specific one is OR." I see. I understand (I think what you are saying). I dropped the dictionary defintion of "unlawful combat" = terrorism a long time ago, because this would make my work OR. I apologize for not making this clear. So, if we were to have the Chomsky quote, only in the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua_v_US_21ca.html" title="Nicaragua v US">Nicaragua v US</a> decision, and only refering to the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua_v_US_21ca.html" title="Nicaragua v US">Nicaragua v US</a> decision, this would not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> correct? This is all I want to do, confine the Chomsky quote to the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua_v_US_21ca.html" title="Nicaragua v US">Nicaragua v US</a> decision. I have dropped the dictionary definition thing sometime ago, I apologize for not making this clear, because you were right in this respect, and I was wrong. So, can we agree that confining the Chomsky quote to the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua_v_US_21ca.html" title="Nicaragua v US">Nicaragua v US</a> decision would not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? If so, we can then move on to the Chomsky quote not being <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, a tougher hurdle, which I may not be able to jump.</dd>
<dd>Please keep in mind, as I have done several times, and which you have never done on this wikipage, I was willing to comprimise and take out Chomsky completly, if the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua_v_US_21ca.html" title="Nicaragua v US">Nicaragua v US</a> stayed in. ...And please don't attempt to take the moral high ground in wikipedia policy, responding that you are "only trying to follow wikipedia policy" because your past actions have clearly shown that this is not the case.</dd>
<dd>In regards to sources. "I'll show you mine if you show me yours." Your mode of operation has been thus: You demand a source for every word in the article, which is wonderful. When a person provides a source, which I did here, in this section, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_Operations_in_Guerrilla_Warfare_003b.html" title="Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare">Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare</a>, you confuse the argument:
<dl>
<dd>1) playing the defintion game: x source really doesn't really say this or that.</dd>
<dd>2) Or you state that source x isn't really an authority.</dd>
<dd>3) Or failing the first two that the source doesn't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Before patting yourself on the back for your cleverness, your tacts are a very, very common tactic on wikipedia and web blogs in general. I see these tired tactics all the time. The idea is too make sure that nothing <b>ever</b> gets in the article. As your posts here have repeatedly alluded to, and your posts on the AfD have explicity stated: you want to delete this entire page. There is no bar high enough which wikipedians can jump to satisfy your standards. "Some people will change his views to fit the facts; Some will change the facts to fit his views." So please excuse my incredible skeptism in your sincerity in asking for sources. I have grown very weary of your repeated games, especially when your behavior has been so anti-consensus and hypocritical. Your opinion should be taken as fact, with no sources whatsoever, but when others attempt to build an encyclopedia, providing sources, you play the hurdle game.</dd>
<dd>Zero wrote: <i>"Can you please tell me who in that article, now that I have asked 3 times is stating the US commited terrorism and their exact quote as well as their position and rank?"</i> You can ask your question until you are blue in the face (nice attempt to turn the table on me--you are learning). I will simply respond with, please source this statment, and other statments you have made on this talk page: "SOA are not US soldiers or government officials or people acting on behalf of the US or employed by the US etc." We can fill this talk page with these two questions, and keep tally of how many times we have each asked those questions. But there is a stark difference between myself and yourself. I have actually provided sources for my opinion. In one month, you have provided not one. I am meeting <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, backing up my claims. You are not.</dd>
<dd>"What a shame I dont see that SOA thing ever reaching a concensus." Amen to that. "Some people will change his views to fit the facts; Some will change the facts to fit his views." As I wrote somewhere before, some wikiusers on this page admitting that the US committed a terorist act is like a Chrisitan admitting that Christ was not divine. It will never, ever, ever, happen. See <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_civil_religion.html" title="American civil religion">American civil religion</a>.</dd>
<dd>So lets focus on Chomsky, and ignore your banal hurdle game for every other source, We will come away either:
<ol>
<li>agreeing to disagree, or</li>
<li>I will concede that I am wrong...</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>But one thing is for certain: you will never comprimise, concede, apologize, or admit you are wrong. This is your acheles heel, which I predict will be your downfall on this page, because your behavior is arguably against everything that wikipedia policy is supposed to be. That is what frustrates me so much when wikiusers use wikipedia policy to cause division: wikipedia policy intention, everyone of those rules, is intented to help build an encyclopedia with consensus and comprimise, not division.

I do not care if it goes into the article, as long as its sourced, as long as someone is actually making the allegation, please again read WP:OR on synthesizing sources and WP:RS. Chomsky fails WP:RS because he is being used for a legal opinion and is not an expert on the field or a lawyer.

<p>I think part of the reason the Cuba section comes off as original research is the length. Would you consider cutting it down to 3 or 4 sentences -- paraphrasing the allegations.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cuba</span></h2>
<p>OK I've drafted my Cuba section - sorry to preempt by removing Northwoods but I don't believe that it constitutes "allegations of state terrorism" ie. no one has alleged that these very vague and unformed theories by imaginative government figures actually became "state terrorism". Some may not like the rewrite, it may seem wordy and long but its actually a huge reduction of the never ending allegations trotted out by the Cubans everytime a government figure has opened his mouth in the last 40 years. These allegations play a huge part in Cuban life and should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>I've laid it out as an example of how I believe the information on this page should be presented, ie."Cuban government officials have accused the United States Government of being an accomplice and protector of terrorism against Cuba ... blah blah blah." citation..citation..citation. What do these allegations centre around? blah blah blah, citation..citation..citation.

Just need some sources that meet WP:RS specifically stating the US engaged in terrorism, specifically that they engaged in terrorism. I see I am the only hold out so as long as it meets the normal requirement for being included I will hop on the bandwagon.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Heated debate</span></h2>
<p>I've had a look at the straw poll page and have seen that it has deteriorated into unneccessary antagonisms. I urge editors to take these points aboard...</p>
<ul>
<li>This page is called <i>Allegations of State Terrorism by the United States</i></li>
<li>Therefore this page should carry notable cases of <i>Allegations of State Terrorism by the United States</i></li>
<li>This includes allegations by; governments, notable figures, international bodies and campaign groups. But not blogs, unnotable theorists etc. We should all know by now what source is notable and what isn't. Chomsky, for instance, is notable. There can be no argument here. (Though his works should not swamp the page)</li>
<li>All the allegations must refer specifically to "State Terrorism" in name, and the key sources must contain that inference. Supplementary exposition sources that expand on the detail of the accusation should be allowed a little leeway. But the central thesis must refer directly to the term "State terrorism".</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what we think terrorism is, or what we think State terrorism is. We don't need to define these terms. The notable source defines the terms. If Prince Charles believes on record that the US commits "state terrorism" because the government of Fiji bans eggs, then that notable story goes on the page with an explanation. If Chomsky believes on record that the US commited "state terrorism" in Latin American for some reason, that goes on the page. If Starbucks believe in a citation that the US commits state terrorism, the story goes on the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's that simple. There should be no need for quarrels if everyone accepts that premise. We don't need to go into the claims themselves - and whether they are legitimate or not. We just need to report notable claims. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 12:14, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is a great compromise, any source that does not specifically state the US commited an act of "State Terrorism" should not be used.

<dd>Mnn, I'd agree there. It seems to me that we have on one side well-meaning editors wanting to work with the spirit of the article's intent, and another group who wish that the article's intent of covered topics is explicitly declared (and are currently using the article name for this). Hence a rename could be very effective to defuse the situation. However be careful to avoid overly weak titles akin to <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> or ones that allow no clear definition to procede with. 'Incivility' and 'improper' sound like effective descriptions to use, but you would then need a means to define these in an international sense. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 04:51, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is *precisely* the reason why there was no consensus on the above.

<p>Again, a false conclusion that was in no way supported by the results of the straw poll. "Terrorism" need not be initiated or directly propagated by the State in order for it to be supported and encouraged (specifically: Indian wars, Jim Crow-era lynchings, etc), and so once again this artificially limits the scope of the entry to the detriment of its veracity and accuracy.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 07:52, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Again, nonsense; as my comments reflect, it's *not* that simple, and Zleitzen's assertions are merely a disingenuous attempt to divert our attention from that fact, to distract us from the whole reason the page exists in the first place. The main trouble here is that the page suffers from multiple parties pushing their junta's particular definition of terrorism and no one is willing to put in the time and effort to enunciate what those differences are. In order for there to be any meaningful progress on this page, those competing visions should be clearly stated and all subsequent entries make reference to how completely the introduced facts reflect each distinct definition. In other words, the only way to make headway here is to guarantee that the page reflects the competing definitions and those influence the competing interpretations of United States Government involvement. Arguing that such legwork is the provenance of other pages is simply intellectual laziness. If those pages don't provide us with the tools we need to make this one work, then it is our responsibility to the topic at hand to create the tools that will allow for a proper treatment of this issue.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 07:52, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We cannot match events with the definitions and call them terrorism. The article used as a source must specifically state the US engaged in terrorism, so the definitions are irrelevant.

<dd>I suggest the page be written along these lines:
<dl>
<dd>"State-sponsored terrorism is a phrase that was initially introduced by the U.S. government to elucidate the often unseen operations of government-sponsored military and espionage units, even when those units are not part of the regular military or only very distantly and loosely related to the government in question. In response, many critics of the U.S. government have adopted the phrase to describe U.S. activities, charging that many actions sponsored by the U.S. government are no different in principle or practice than the actions which are commonly denounced by the United States government as "terrorist acts". The topic is a very heated issue, first and foremost because there is no commonly accepted definition of terrorist acts. Competing definitions of terrorism are rooted in political and social difference, and consequently where many people deny that an indicated act is "terrorist" in nature, others insist that the act in question qualifies wholesale."<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 11:07, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Broadly speaking, these competing definitions can be broken down into three basic approaches: the definition of terrorism as a legal term, the definition of terrorism as a military tactic, and the definition of terrorism as a religious or moral failure. Because the qualification of any given act as "terrorist" may differ markedly depending on the basis of its definition, criticism of the inclusion of U.S.sponsored acts and initiated events will make reference to these three basic approaches."<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 11:07, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
