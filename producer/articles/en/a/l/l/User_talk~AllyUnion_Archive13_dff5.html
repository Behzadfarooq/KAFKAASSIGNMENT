<p>Had a lot of privat work in the last days. I dont think that the bot is making nonesence. Perhaps the en-rules are different from the rules in other languages. Ok lets check it. A nother Problem might be that the warnfiles running on the wiki a 1 week old and a lot of this have changed in the last days. ok thats a thing to check .. and i think hat <b>SOMETIMES</b> the Wiki send not the <b>LAST</b> version of the page. So i would be pse if the status is set back. I will only make 100 Edits a day. Save the logging for every day and will everyone can call me. User Flacus / Flabot</p>

<p>Hi there! Sorry to bother you with yet another bot request, but I gave some more thought to the matter of putting 'historical' on all Wikipedia namespace pages. Clearly that isn't going to work. However, something that would benefit from automation is <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. I'm presently archiving it by hand roughly each week, but it would be very useful if a bot were to go over the list of disputes weekly, and move to the /archive page any of them that haven't been edited for, say, two weeks. This will prevent the RFC list from getting overly long. Ditto for the user conduct disputes - anything left alone for two weeks might not be fully resolved, but is unlikely to get more useful input. I'm not sure how tricky this is bot-wise, but your feedback would be appreciated. Yours, <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:49, May 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, yeah, this would of course require community vote. I hope you don't mind me asking you first, at least that way I find out if it's technically feasible, and if you already think it's a dumb idea there's no sense putting it to the community :) Other than that, yes, the idea was to get the link from the RFC page (they all start with (linebreak) (asterisk) ), and get that page's edit history. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 21:46, May 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Okay, that didn't yield much discussion, but Xiong thinks it's a good idea (but prefers a timeout of 30 days after creation, rather than 14 days after last edit).

<p>Thanks for intervening, AllyUnion, I'm working on my questions. If you have time, would I be able to send them to you as I go for you to check out? It's hard to estimate how hard/easy other people will find your own questions. Is there any rules regarding questions?

<dd>AllyUnion, thanks for picking up the contest. I don't think I'll be writing any questions; I've done it twice now and it takes a lot of my time. I don't know exactly, but I'd guess I spend between 30 minutes and an hour on each question. Besides, every editor has their own style of questions, and it's better to have some variation.</dd>

<p>I just spent several hours disambiguating Knopf, Alfred A. Knopf (person), Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and Knopf Publishing Group but now I have decidedd (after seeing how the links originated) that I really need to have Alfred A. Knopf be the page for the publishing company. I would like to MOVE [[Knopf Publishing Group there but I need to have <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_A._Knopf_b092.html" title="Alfred A. Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</a> deleted first. I deleted the text I added and nothing no links there. Can you delete that page for me?

<dd><a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> says "There are a few, limited, cases where admins can delete Wikipedia pages "on sight". Non-admins can ask for an admin to delete such a page, either by listing it on speedy deletions, or by adding either a {{delete}} or {{deletebecause|Reason}} header." One reason for a speedy is "7. Any page which is requested for deletion by the original author, provided the author reasonably explains that it was created by mistake, and the page was edited only by its author." Since it was MY page and MY edit history, I think this qualified for a speedy deletion but I wanted to do it tonight before I went to bed and didn't want to wait to see if someone would see it on the list. Oh well. I appreciate your suggestion but at this point I am just going to bed and will leave it as it is. Thanks for responding.</dd>

By the way, the reason I think in this case the main page should be the company is that it is an active publisher and about 90% of the links are intended for the publisher, not Mr. Knopf who has been dead 20 years. It is just a matter of trying to keep redirects and mis-linking to a miniumum.</p>

<p>Greetings! Just wanted to let you know that I have unblocked <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlaBot_747f.html" title="User:FlaBot">User:FlaBot</a> and blocked <a href="../../../f/i/a/User%7EFIaBot_ff63.html" title="User:FIaBot">User:FIaBot</a> (capital I instead of lowercase l) indefinitely as a malicious impersonator. It appears the doppelganger was active immediately before the true bot was deactivated and is responsible for several of the interwiki removals and nonsensical interwiki edits. Don't know about the other reported problems -- I checked a good sample of the original's edits and found nothing fishy -- but as it seems the user has returned from other commitments I'll leave that to others' discretion.

<p>Can the VfDbot be extended to remove the {{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Policy consensus}} transclusion when the page is moved from the main section to the /Old listing? The policy concensus section is a dynamic page with the latest discussions, not an archive of the policies which were being discussed at the time of the VfD page. It really doesn't fit with the archival process we're using for the rest of the VfD discussions. I have been removing them by hand but it occurred to me that this might be an automatable task. (I also remove the comment about &lt;!-- New votes to the bottom, please. --&gt;) Any thoughts?

<p>When you get to the actual <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">closing process</a>, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated. So many of the decisions require multiple steps. But I may not be the right person to ask. I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions. I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of "simple" decisions. I'll give it some thought, though.</p>
<p>Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread? If so, what parameters would have to be fed in? How complex would it be to initiate the bot? Would it be a different bot for "keep" decisions vs "delete" decisions?</p>
<p>The essential steps for a "keep" decision are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})</li>
<li>Remove the VfD header from the page (which <i>usually</i> follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together</li>
<li>Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion. I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple "keep" decision might be automatable with a single parameter. "Keep as merge", "transwiki", etc. would still require extra steps.</p>
<p>The essential steps for a "delete" decision are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order</li>
<li>Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)</li>
<li>Sometimes, check "what links here" and move or delete all those links</li>
<li>Delete the page</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure I see how to automate that process. There are too many variables. I'll keep chewing on it, though. Thanks again. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a></p>

<p>Hi there! We discussed an RFC archiving bot earlier, and people on the Village Pump think it's a good idea. If you could spare the time, your help would be much appreciated. Scotty or not ;)</p>
<p>Looking over RFC, here's something that I think would work...</p>
<p>RFC has six major sections (=name=), being</p>
<ol>
<li>top</li>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>Article title disputes (not archived anywhere, but could be added to the below if desired)</li>
<li>Article content disputes (archived in /Article content disputes archive)</li>
<li>Comment about individual users (archived in /User conduct disputes archive)</li>
<li>Choice of username (not archived afaik, but could be added to the above if desired)</li>
<li>General convention and policy issues (archived in /convention disputes)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two should be ignored. #3 and #4 start with a bit of a header, then have entries that go like this: "(linebreak) * (optional whitespace) link to page description". So you could plausibly search for the (linebreak)* tag. The description may contain additional linebreaks at times. The section ends with (linebreak) =</p>
<p>All of these are links to existing pages; the relevant discussion is on the talk page. Thus a bit of checking needs to be done to see if the link goes to <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page.html" title="Page">page</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/m/Template.html" title="Template">template</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category.html" title="Category">category</a>, or already goes to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk.html" title="Talk">talk</a>, template talk etc. The relevant date for seeing if the discussion has died down would be the last edit of said talk page.</p>
<p>Section #5 works similarly, except that 'descriptions' never contain linebreaks, and that any line not starting with a * is part of the description, and that /Example user and /Example admin should be ignored. In these cases, the links are to new pages specifically made for RFC, so both the date of the main page and of its talk page should be checked.</p>
<p>Section #6 is a mess since everybody comments right there on the page, and thus should be ignored by the bot.</p>
<p>Finally, section #7 works similar to section #5.</p>
<p>HTH!

<p>Hello. You probably don't know me, but your reputation as a botmaker extends across the 'Pedia! So, anyway, I have been doing the bot-assisted transwikis to Wiktionary daily now for a while. (See the log on <a href="../../../t/l/_/WP%7ETL_c6c3.html" title="WP:TL">WP:TL</a>). Well, I'm no computer science person; the bot was actually created by Kevin Rector, who seems to have left the project recently. Well, what I really want as well is a similar bot so I can do transwikis to all the other projects, especially WikiSource, which has a huge backlog and some of those have been hanging around for months (see Category:Move to Wikisource, etc.). There's also a bug or two that could be worked out. I'm sorry I don't really know how much work making a bot like this entails, and it sure looks like you have a lot of bot work! Please contact me if you'd be willing to do it, or if you know anyone else that could. And thank you. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 20:16, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course. I wasn't going to bother with details unless you were actually interested. I can email you the bot, if you want. Can you extract the source from that? There aren't actually any <i>serious</i> problems, and the main thing I wanted was to be able to use it for the other sister projects. The problems are things like when there are quotes in the name it doesn't work, so I have to manually move the page first. And if a redirected template is used, like using a lowercase w in {{<a href="../../../m/o/v/Template%7EMove_to_Wiktionary_f1c0.html" title="Template:Move to Wiktionary">Move to Wiktionary</a>}}, the name shows up twice. Also, there are a few more steps that, I think, could be automated. So, again, if you are interested, I'll email it to you, but that's the best I can do without Kevin, hope it'll do. Thanks. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 04:39, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'd like to invite SandBot to the Template: namespace. Actually, I thought it was active there but apparently it is not. For some reason the sandbox template spaces are defined as places where one can experiment without losing what is being tested. Can SandBot be modified to leave these three alone until 12 hours after the last change? I think that would be a reasonable period for people to test even multiple-template effects; and they can revert to restore where they were before their nap.

<p>Hello, AllyUnion! I've noticed that you are running <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikifun_2ab9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikifun">Wikipedia:Wikifun</a> right now, and wanted to get your input regarding Wikipedia:Mind Benders. I've recently taken over the responsibilities of Mind Benders, and I've introduced the pre-round and all most of the competition rules. Any comments, suggestions, etc.? How would you recomment that I announce the pre-round? Do the rules for the general competition (round one is almost done, stored in my computer) look good? Thanks!

<p>Good afternoon, AllyUnion. There's recently been some discussion about ways to simplify the VfD closing process. I know I have some pride-of-authorship issues and may not be as perfectly impartial as I'd like.

<p>Hello! I've noticed your interest in creating logos, barnstars, or your past artistic ability! Thus, I just wanted to let you know that the pre-round, an artistic competition, is now open at Wikipedia:Mind Benders (Shortcut: WP:MIND)! The competition is open to everyone and is seeking a logo/trophy, similar to Barnstars, to be placed on every winner's page. We urge you to help us out and submit an entry! Afterwards, the normal rounds, each consisting of ten or more fun, logical, brain-stimulating questions will open. Why don't you give it a try when it opens! Look forward to seeing your contribution. Thanks, <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> 21:47, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if I didn't make myself clear. The page was created and then several questions were posted, but the page fell into "disrepair" after a lack of questions. The old maintainer, Multima, has given me the position, and my goal is to turn it into a competition similar to (and as popular as!) WikiFun. I was just wondering on your opinion of the general rules- so far, the rules I've proposed say the first three correct entries get the points (which will be assigned based on difficulty). In addition, I was also seeking feedback for the amount of time one round should last, based on your experience with WikiFun. Finally, any comments, suggestions, or help to make Mind Benders a good competition? Though I don't exactly have high expectations, I'm putting my full effort into it right now. Thanks a lot. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> 22:24, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>P.S. The pre-round is only an art competition that will now be related to normal competition.</p>

<p>Your bot seems to be the only thing making any updates to <a href="../../../n/a/c/WP%7ENAC_86a1.html" title="WP:NAC">WP:NAC</a>, as the rest of the content there is languishing. I'm wondering if it might not be more appropriate to merge that page with <a href="../../../g/o/i/Wikipedia%7EGoings-on_f70f.html" title="Wikipedia:Goings-on">Wikipedia:Goings-on</a>, which is no longer being used much for advertising discussions, but does serve as a place to collect all the various collaboration and feature stuff that's currently happening. The daily VfD pages seem like a logical thing to add there.

<dd>I went ahead and did the merge, since Hydnjo (who seems to have been the main person supporting the NAC page) agreed that it was okay. So you can change the bot to start updating the Goings-on page now instead. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:37, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of days ago I reverted a couple of edits by User:Adr1ann at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> where the user (who appears to be brand new) kept posting a link to a commercial/semi-porn site. I believe this user is the same one who repeatedly tried to post this same link as an anon. earlier in the week. I made the mistake of putting a request on Adr1ann's talk page for her(?) to stop posting the link. And now she(?) is putting gibberish on my <a href="../../../2/3/s/User_talk%7E23skidoo.html" title="User talk:23skidoo">talk page</a> (it's right at the top - you can't miss it). I'm not quite sure what to do at this point. It's basically just an annoyance and I don't believe it's serious enough for a vandalism complaint unless the user starts deleting stuff or being abusive (maybe she is - Wikipedia seems to be the only English-language word in her latest missive). So an admin question - is there a place where I can make mention of this other than on Vandalism in Progress? I checked the FAQ but couldn't really find a category for "reporting annoying users".
