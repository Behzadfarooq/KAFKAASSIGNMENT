<p>I've tagged this article as making questionable claim to notability. As one editor stated, the group currently claims a membership of <i>less than 0.03%</i> of Canada's Jewish population. It doesn't have CJC recognition, very little media recognition, 260 <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=%22Alliance+of+Concerned+Jewish+Canadians%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=%22Alliance+of+Concerned+Jewish+Canadians%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" rel="nofollow">google hits</a>.

<p>Looking through the history of this article, as well as the relevant history of the several articles that link to it, it increasingly seems to me that the group's primary notability is in the apparent tenacity of its membership's pursuit of recognition by <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">using Wikipedia as a platform for pontification</a>. There are thousands of other groups, even <i>synagogues</i>, with astronomically more political clout than this group has, several dozen of which are in Canada. I previously characterized the group quite accurately in the article as "miniscule", which was probably overly generous of me. Not everyone bothers to do the math, and the removal of this clarification can easily result in the eggregiously mistaken impression that this group is more noteworthy than it actually is. As a result of the repeated removal, and mildly rude insinuation that the information is "inappropriate", the POV that the group really <i>is</i> notable is enshrined as fact. This is a direct violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>.

<li>Just a note, the word "minuscule" is inherently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">pov</a> which is why I removed it. I totally understand, and agree with, what you're saying Tomer, but despite the article being NN (in our opinion), it still needs to conform to Wiki policies while it's still here. -- <b><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChabuk_81ec.html" title="User:Chabuk">Chabuk</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChabuk_849e.html" title="User talk:Chabuk">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chabuk_38b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chabuk">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 00:32, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Miniscule" is no more POV than "small". The group represents an insignificant/miniscule/small (in terms that are increasingly, but unjustifiably, generous) portion of the Canadian Jewish community. That's not POV, it's a statement of simple fact. POV would be if I'd also made the [correct, in my view] assertion in the article, that the group is actually <i>irrelevant</i>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 00:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I'm not saying that the article itself is NN, rather that the <i>group</i> is, or at least insufficiently noteworthy to warrant an independent article. That's the crux of my view, in fact...that the <i>most</i> notable thing about the group (which CJCurrie in one of hir edsums describes as "cultural"--quite a stretch for a group that is clearly <i>solely</i> political in nature) is the article's existence! When a Wikipedia article is more noteworthy than the subject it covers, as is the case here, the situation needs serious review. The only way this group can possibly warrant inclusion in WP, at present, is as part of a larger discussion about fringe Jewish groups--a crucial element of which is an in-depth analysis of just how far outside the mainstream of the Jewish community they are. The best way to do this is by analyzing and scrutinizing of their expressed views and comparing those to the "mainstream", but that discourse, inasmuch as it can avoid <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, needs to take place within context--something an independent article cannot accomplish. At this juncture, the group's only claim to notability is that the CJC refuses to grant them membership. That's only a claim to notability, however, which appears to be deliberately being misrepresented as notability itself. Analogously [if somewhat extreme], if ח"ו I were to go completely bonkers tomorrow and start claiming to be the queen of Transylvania, that would make me bonkers, ב"ה it wouldn't make me the queen of Transylvania. Unless the ACJC starts sponsoring hizbullah bombings of Israeli embassies, or takes up arms against the border patrol, or בס"ד moves to and declares independence for the northern half of Novaya Zemlya, they're less notable than my nephew's PTA. Meanwhile, Wikipedia is being [ab]used as a promotional vehicle for the group, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, since its membership consists of excellent wikilawyers and masters of subterfuge, adept at gaming the system. This is painfully obvious in the aforementioned AfD for this article.

<dd>That would be somewhat less disagreeable, but the group is already mentioned in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Canada_2364.html" title="History of the Jews in Canada">History of the Jews in Canada</a>, however, and the lack of mention of other groups of phenominally greater influence continues to make the ACJC appear far more important than it actually is. Making an entire section devoted to the ACJC would only exascerbate this imbalance. A far better place to cover the group, IMHO, would be in an article about Canadian Jewish politics (which should not be confused with political propensities of Canadian Jews), whither this entire article could be transposed, and expanded upon slightly, as I outlined above, covering the differences between the ACJC's views and those of groups that have significantly larger followings. The fact that this article exists, btw, and that articles on larger and more influential groups, holding to all sorts of viewpoints, especially those simplistically regarded as "right wing", is <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">one of the greatest flaws of Wikipedia</a>. Alright. Edit conflict. Chabuk, most of the above regards your suggestion. CJCurrie, your "Perhaps..." idea is one I could support much more wholeheartedly if you dropped the "also" from it.&#160;:-) The "also", IMHO, should precede the idea that an article should/could be simultaneously created to cover right-wing Jewish activism in Canada, both of which would be subpages of at least one of the two article ideas I mentioned above [in this post].

<p>I have already indicated that I believe the information in the ACJC article should be retained on Wikipedia in one form or another. Now, I will indicate why I believe this particular article should be <b>kept</b>.</p>
<p>Note: These comments are not made in a spirit of hostility toward any other contributor. Debate is welcome, and encouraged.</p>
<p>1. Wikipedia is founded on the principle that minority voices should receive fair representation. The ACJC are a small group in terms of membership, and it is safe to say that they do not represent a majority viewpoint in the Canadian Jewish community. Notwithstanding this, they are actively engaged in debates of concern to the community, and their views have been cited in major community publications (<a href="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=10734" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=10734" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=9660" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=9660" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). The group is not insignificant, and the publicity they have received outside of Wikipedia makes them sufficiently notable for inclusion.</p>
<p>2. The ACJC's relationship with the broader Canadian Jewish community is a matter of significance in and of itself. The Canadian Jewish Congress's recent rejection of the ACJC's application, and the ACJC's appeal, have drawn attention to conflicting interpretations of the CJC's mandate. ACJC spokesperson Michael Mandel argues that his group has a prima facie right to affiliate with the CJC, and has stated that the CJC cannot claim to speak for Canada's Jewish community if it excludes the ACJC viewpoint. The CJC took a different position when it first rejected their application (see: <i>Montreal Gazette</i>, 29 October 2006, A2 or <i>Edmonton Journal</i>, 29 October 2006, A11), although it may reconsider when it considers the appeal. The result of this debate could have serious repercussions for other groups wishing to affiliate with the CJC in the future.</p>
<p>3. Wikipedia already has articles on organizations comparible to the ACJC, such as the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Voice_for_Peace_1d5c.html" title="Jewish Voice for Peace">Jewish Voice for Peace</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_Against_the_Occupation_c7fa.html" title="Jews Against the Occupation">Jews Against the Occupation</a>. From the other side, we also have articles on the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Defense_Organization_75bb.html" title="Jewish Defense Organization">Jewish Defense Organization</a> (a JDL spinoff) and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Task_Force_e173.html" title="Jewish Task Force">Jewish Task Force</a>, a Kahanist organization whose leader is barred from entering Israel. I cannot imagine that these groups are numerically large, or command strong community support, but this hasn't stopped us from preparing fairly detailed articles on them. (One could also mention the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Motorcyclists_Alliance_4652.html" title="Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance">Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance</a>, which may be larger than the ACJC but can hardly be described as more notable.) Precendent, in other words, favours inclusion.</p>

<li>I'm sorry, but at the most basic level, when the organization admits to having just over 100 members, and all they seem to do is write the odd press release, there is no claim to notability. They don't claim to be, nor are they, the largest (or only) Jewish organization which espouses the values which it does, and keeping them simply to hear the "minority voice" is, in my opinion, exactly the opposite of what an encyclopedia is. -- <b><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChabuk_81ec.html" title="User:Chabuk">Chabuk</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChabuk_849e.html" title="User talk:Chabuk">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chabuk_38b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chabuk">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 03:28, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its existence has nothing to do with the policy. I agree that a *prominent* reference to the ACJC on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Canada_2364.html" title="History of the Jews in Canada">History of the Jews in Canada</a> would be inappropriate, but a passing reference seems fine (of course, this has nothing to do with the present discussion). <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 01:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see any reason to delete this, Wikipedia has a number of articles on groups that are smaller and less significant. It seems well sourced and since the group has been mentioned in the mainstream media I think it's valid to have an article. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHashomer_a313.html" title="User:Hashomer">Hashomer</a> 04:00, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All of this jibberjabber about deletion is a strawman, made first by CJCurrie, and now propped up by you. My protest against the article has nothing to do with a drive to delete it. My interest is in trying to stimulate the writing of articles on the many Canadian Jewish groups, political and cultural, that are of far greater relevance to the Canadian Jewish community as well as to the world at large. Were my interest otherwise, I would never have brought up <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>. I would suggest that the two of you could be much more constructive by researching and writing about groups with whom you don't happen to agree, rather than writing longwinded <strike>arguments</strike>comments about why this article shouldn't be deleted...especially in light of the fact that <i>noöne</i> involved in this discussion is arguing in favor of deletion.

<p>If no one is arguing in favor of deletion then the tag is inappropriate and should be replaced with something that doesn't say "If notability cannot be established, the article is more likely to be considered for deletion, as per Wikipedia:Guide to deletion." The argument that there should be more articles on the Jewish community that's fine but it doesn't have much to do with the notability of this article. Since no one is arguing for deletion I will remove the tag, particularly as the "non-notability" question has apparently already been dealt with in an earlier vote on deletion. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHashomer_a313.html" title="User:Hashomer">Hashomer</a> 02:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
