<p>The <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Parliamentary_Party_95a5.html" title="Irish Parliamentary Party">Irish Parliamentary Party</a> (IPP) was long disrupted by internal dissensions originating from O'Brien's conciliatory initiation of the 1902 Land Conference which lead to agreement on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wyndham_786d.html" title="George Wyndham">Wyndham</a>Land Purchase Act of 1903 as well as his alliance with <a href="../../../d/2E/d/D.D._Sheehan_0692.html" title="D.D. Sheehan">D.D. Sheehan</a>'s <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Land_and_Labour_Association_dc6a.html" title="Irish Land and Labour Association">Irish Land and Labour Association</a>. Since 1904 O'Brien had been alienated out of the IPP. The country now called for reunion of the split party ranks. In November 1907 O'Brien's proposals for his and other Independent’s return to the Party were accepted.</p>
<p>With <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_%28Ireland%29_Act_1898_a82b.html" title="Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898">Irish Local Government</a>, the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Land_Question_52cb.html" title="Irish Land Question">land question</a> and the housing of agricultural labourers settled, O'Brien was convinced that to achieve the final hurdle of Home Rule, the success of the approach he used to win the Land Act, the "doctrine of conciliation" together with "conference plus business", must also be applied to win All-Ireland self-government.</p>

<p>O'Brien had always been gravely disturbed by the Irish Parliamentary Party's involvement with what he called the worst calamity to befall the country -- "that sinister sectarian secret society", the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Order_of_Hibernians_4ced.html" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a> (AOH), also known as <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molly_Maguires_6ffc.html" title="Molly Maguires">Molly Maguires</a> , or <i>the Mollies</i> . AOH members were Catholic nationalists of a <a href="../../../r/i/b/Ribbonism.html" title="Ribbonism">Ribbon</a> tradition.

Devlin was already known as "the real <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Secretary_of_Ireland_c2e6.html" title="Chief Secretary of Ireland">Chief Secretary of Ireland</a>".

<p>As prelude to O’Brien’s formation of the AFIL, the Irish Party leader <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Redmond_0663.html" title="John Redmond">John Redmond</a> called an UIL Convention at the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mansion_House%2C_Dublin_bad9.html" title="The Mansion House, Dublin">Mansion House</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, in February 1909, to win support for a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> bill curtailing funding of tenant land purchase under the <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._Birrell_5627.html" title="A. Birrell">Birrell</a> Land Act (1909). Redmond who chaired the meeting claimed it would burden the British Treasury and local ratepayers excessively. Over 3000 delegates attended. O’Brien, who was to speak rejecting the Bill was shouted down by various groups of 400 militant "<a href="../../../m/o/l/Molly_Maguires_6ffc.html" title="Molly Maguires">Mollies</a>", their presence preorganised by Devlin's AOH organisation. Armed with batons, they attacked O’Brien’s followers, to prevent him or any "<a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">Cork</a> accent" getting near the platform.</p>

<p>Regarding himself as having been driven from the party by Hibernian hooligans, O’Brien’s subsequent move was to officially launch his new movement, the "All-for-Ireland League", its embryonic origins - the Land Conference of 1902, at a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork</a> public meeting on 12 April 1910, where its rules and constitution were formulated and endorced, announcing its manifesto and political policies to be</p>

<p>The <i>Cork Free Press</i>, published by O'Brien, appeared for the first time in June as the League’s official organ. In the second <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1910_%28December%29_e602.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1910 (December)">1910 general elections</a> in December O'Brien's candidates were earmarked for rejection by the Hibernians, but Cork vindicated his policies by returning eight AFIL MPs for what was to be O'Brien's new political party. It included <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Healy_5558.html" title="Timothy Healy">Tim Healy</a> who joined in a 1911 by-election. In other counties contested by AFIL candidates, O'Brien's hostility to the AOH was counter-productive in mobilising the Catholic clergy, with one or two exceptions, behind the official IPP candidates. O'Brien wrote despondently "We have to deal with a confederacy of the priests of this country to strangle the AFIL and to strike down its standard-bearers".</p>

<p>The AFIL party was convinced that the success of an Irish Parliament must depend upon it being won with the consent rather than by the compulsion of the Protestant minority. It sought to associate itself with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Griffith_2f63.html" title="Arthur Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a>'s moderate <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> movement. In a 1911 letter to the Prime Minister <a href="../../../h/2E/h/H.H._Asquith_ee01.html" title="H.H. Asquith">H.H. Asquith</a>, the party specifically proposed that Dominion Home Rule would be the wisest and safest of all settlements to the Irish question. After the introduction of a new Home Rule Bill by Asquith in April 1912 , they declared whole-hearted support of the Bill, subject to three amendments:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, safeguards providing against the apprehensions (however imaginary) of Ulster;</li>
<li>second, the completion of the abolition of landlordism by the use of Imperial credit;</li>
<li>third, the empowering of the Irish Parliament to raise, as well as to spend, its revenue.</li>

<p>During the three readings of the Bill in 1913 and 1914, O’Brien and his AIL colleagues were adamant that there should be no limit to the concessions offered to Ulster to have it participate in an All-Ireland parliament. "Any price for a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Ireland_da23.html" title="United Ireland">United Ireland</a>, but <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_Ireland_6ee0.html" title="Partition of Ireland">partition</a> never".

Sheehan in the London <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a></i> simultaneously published a list of concessions they ascertained as acceptable to Ulster, enabling its participation in a <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> parliament. The proposals in brief were:</p>
<p>1. That the representatves of Ulster should have an exercisable veto right over Irish legislation;<br />
2. Ulster should have sixty representatives in the Irish House of Commons, out of a total of 164;<br />
3. All representatives of the Irish Civil Service should be by competitive examination;<br />
4. North-East Ulster should have its own appointment of court judges, district magistrates, inspectors of education.</p>
<p>Instead, the uncompromising IPP/AOH stand taken by the Dillon-Devlin alliance killed All-Ireland Home Rule, by aiming to force Ulster’s acquiescence; "no Orange vetoes, no concessions, Ulster must follow", Ulster's Unionist leader <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Edward_Carson_1b1d.html" title="Sir Edward Carson">Sir Edward Carson</a>, proclaiming "Ulster can never be coerced, Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right", demanding from Redmond that he "listen to the Cork members". The spectre of civil war loomed when <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Volunteers_46c8.html" title="Ulster Volunteers">Ulster Volunteers</a> bought arms from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Germany_3d8d.html" title="Imperial Germany">Imperial Germany</a>, Redmond's <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Volunteers_5b85.html" title="Irish Volunteers">Irish Volunteers</a> following suit.</p>
<p>In May 1914, the AFIL resolutely resisted in Parliament the violation of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Ireland_da23.html" title="United Ireland">Ireland's national unity</a> and as a final protest before history, abstained in June 1914 from voting on the final Third <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Rule_Act_1914_5d12.html" title="Home Rule Act 1914">Home Rule Act</a>, which had been amended to provide for the temporary exclusion of six Ulster counties.</p>

<p>The outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> in August saw the Act placed on the statute books in September, but suspended for the duration of the war. O’Brien and his party rallied in support of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_I_762a.html" title="Allies of World War I">Allied cause</a> of a Europe free from oppression supporting Britain's war effort, as did the IPP in unison with most sections of Irish society. O’Brien perceived it as an opportunity for all Irishmen, Protestant and Catholic alike to unite and serve together in the long term interest of attaining independent Irish self-government. The initial recruiting response to the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_%28Irish%29_Division_e52c.html" title="16th (Irish) Division">16th (Irish) Division</a> and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Munster_Fusiliers_2982.html" title="Royal Munster Fusiliers">Royal Munster Fusiliers</a> was considerable.</p>
<p>By 1915 with stalemate on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_%28World_War_I%29_c3a0.html" title="Western Front (World War I)">Western Front</a> and the losses of the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_%28Irish%29_Division_9169.html" title="10th (Irish) Division">10th (Irish) Division</a> in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Dardanelles</a> at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landing_at_Cape_Helles_4155.html#V_Beach" title="Landing at Cape Helles">Cape Helles</a>, enthusiasm began to wane. O’Brien had warned a decade earlier of the resurgence of revolutionary nationalism evolving out of the sectarian basis of national action, subsequently erupting in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Rising_cc3a.html" title="Easter Rising">1916 Rebellion</a>. This was to have serious ramifications for Ireland's subsequent history.</p>
<p><a name="Irish_Convention" id="Irish_Convention"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-for-Ireland_League_3743.html" title="Edit section: Irish Convention">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Irish Convention</span></h2>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Rising_cc3a.html" title="Easter Rising">Easter Rising</a> the Government attempted in July 1916 to have Redmond and Carson agree on immediately introducing Home Rule, which failed. The Prime Minister <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_George_55bd.html" title="Lloyd George">Lloyd George</a> proposed therefore in June 1917 that an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Convention_9720.html" title="Irish Convention">Irish Convention</a>, composed of representative Irishmen from all party’s, should assemble to deliberate upon the best means of governing their country.</p>
<p>The AFIL Party were asked to nominate representatives to the Convention. In reply O’Brien stated four essential conditions of success: 1) a Conference of ten or a dozen persons known to intend peace; 2) a prompt agreement, making every conceivable concession to Ulster, with the one reservation that partition in any shape or form was inadmissible and unthinkable; 3) the immediate submission of the agreement to a Referendum of the Irish people (never before consulted on a definite proposal); 4) if any minority still uttered threats of an Ulster rebellion, the Government to declare once and for all the claims of reason and justice and the incorrigibility of Ulster.</p>
<p>The panel of names submitted by O’Brien to the Cabinet at its request was: the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Protestant Primate, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, two prominent <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Unionist_Party_8258.html" title="Ulster Unionist Party">northern Unionists</a>, two prominent <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Unionist_Party_3a5a.html" title="Irish Unionist Party">southern Unionists</a>, two members of the IPP and two <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> representatives. Instead of setting up a Conference of this character, which it was subsequently clear would not have separated without coming to agreement, O’Brien’s proposal was set aside. None of those he proposed were invited. Lloyd George appealed to O’Brien to attend, but under the circumstances he declined. Instead the Irish Convention was composed of nine-tenths representatives drawn from already elected representatives who had previously voted for the Home Rule partition settlement. The only positive outcome of the Convention was the acceptance of Dominion Home Rule by a minority.</p>

<p>When Britain moved to introduce Home Rule in April 1918 as proposed by the Convention, it unwisely did so, due to the Allied armies collapse on the Western Front, in conjunction with conscrition for Ireland, which resulted in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription_Crisis_of_1918_a7e9.html" title="Conscription Crisis of 1918">Irish "conscription crisis"</a>. At its height the AFIL withdrew from <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster.html" title="Westminster">Westminster</a> making a final damning <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Irish_Anti-Conscription_Crisis" class="extiw" title="s:Irish_Anti-Conscription_Crisis">anti-conscription speech</a>, joining forces with the Irish Party, Sinn Féin and Labour in mass protest demonstrations in Dublin. The conscription crisis caused an unprecedendent rise in popularity for Sinn Féin, killing all interest in Home Rule and constitutional nationalism.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1918, as a consequence of both the Irish Party and Britain failing to introduce Home Rule, and seeing that its constitutional political concepts for attaining independent All-Ireland self-government were being displaced by the path of militant physical-force, the AFIL MPs recognised the futility of contesting the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_%28UK%29_general_election%2C_1918_5119.html" title="Irish (UK) general election, 1918">December election</a>. The party members issued a manifesto supporting <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Griffith_2f63.html" title="Arthur Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a>'s moderate Sinn Féin movement, putting its seats at the disposal of its candidates, all of whom were returned unopposed.</p>
<p><a name="Resum.C3.A9" id="Resum.C3.A9"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-for-Ireland_League_3743.html" title="Edit section: Resumé">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Resumé</span></h2>
<p>The AFIL in its short life succeeded in exposing the incapacity of the Irish Parliamentary party to accommodate the fears and integrate the interests of the Protestant and unionist community into the process of an All-Ireland parliamentary settlement. The League succeeded in binding a small group of dissident independent nationalists from 1909 onwards into a dedicated party who fought untiringly for a non-sectarian solution to the "Irish question", thereby keeping alive a broader concept of nationalism and denying the party of John Redmond a universality of representation to which it thought itself entitled.</p>
<p>Just as all sides failed in maintaining an undivided Ireland, so too was the fate of the All-for-Ireland League. Supreme in Cork, its candidates in other constituencies in the 1910 election, Mid-Tipperary, East Kerry, East and West Limerick, South Wexford, West Mayo and Armagh, showed that a considerable percentage of the electorate, the <i>Cork Free Press</i> gave the total Redmonite vote in the country as 92,709, and the Independent Nationalist's vote, largely supporting the principles of the League, as 39,729 (30,46%), despite active Church opposition.</p>
<p>Its success lay in establishing an alternative course, basically that advocated by O’Brien, of a conscious effort to win unionist consent to participation in an independent and united Ireland, however long and apparently hopeless this effort might appear. The League's principles and aspirations reflect in the "Peace Pledge" of the 1998 erected <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_of_Ireland_Peace_Park_83a5.html" title="Island of Ireland Peace Park">Island of Ireland Peace Park</a>.</p>
