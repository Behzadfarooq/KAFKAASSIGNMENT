<p>Wikipedia isn't about our personal convictions: It's about what can be verified with reliable sources. The Wikipedia "hoax" tag is used to flag suspected non-notable hoaxes for verification or deletion. If reliable sources could be found to show that the existence of Chemmani mass graves was out of the question, the subject would still be notable: It has received sustained international attention. In that case, I would expect Wikipedia to have an article explaining how the question first arose, and how it was disposed of.</p>
<p>The current article is based on information that can be cross-referenced between the BBC, the U.S. Department of State and the government of Sri Lanka. I tried to keep it minimal, with the idea of expanding it, hopefully with consensus.</p>
<p>Here are a few directions that I think would help to address concerns on each side:</p>
<p><b>1. The use of the term "mass graves"</b></p>
<p>How many bodies constitutes a "mass grave"? The government of Sri Lanka uses the words "Chemmani mass graves", but has also stated that "there are no such graves as originally alleged". Rajapakse and his co-defendents alleged hundreds of bodies, but only fifteen were found. Nevertheless, the government continued to use the word "mass graves" in discussing the case, in particular in connection with the military personnel who were arrested. (Same links as above: <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200004/20000404Australia_condems_LTTE.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200004/20000404Australia_condems_LTTE.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010418editorialreview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010418editorialreview.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010406editorialreview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010406editorialreview.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/SecurityReport/sr200001/20000105Ponnambalam_dead.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/SecurityReport/sr200001/20000105Ponnambalam_dead.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. ) That said, some web sites talk about "mass graves" as if Rajapakse's allegations were proven, or even go further, alleging that large numbers of people who disappeared in Sri Lanka are buried in Chemmani. I think it would be helpful to address how "mass graves" in the context of Chemmani is used by different people to mean different things.</p>
<p><b>2. Forensic evidence</b></p>
<p>The article could use more information about the identity of the 15 bodies that were found, as well as evidence about when and how they died. I would also like to see more information about the people who have been charged in connection with these deaths, and the nature of the evidence that implicates them.</p>
<p><b>3. Conduct of the investigation</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State initially praised the Government of Sri Lanka for applying the rule of law to its own forces ("There was no attempt, as in the past, to use the ER to cover up security force misdeeds." <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), but subsequently cited criticisms about the "slowness" of the investigation. <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8241.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8241.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> A more recent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC story</a> quotes a Colombo magistrate saying that the investigation has been subjected to "unacceptable" delays. I think the article could benefit from exploring both the findings of the investigation and its conduct.</p>

<li><b>short reply</b>;</li>
</ul>
<p>first, I think the wording of the article should be changed..Its not the government who declared this does not exist..It was the experts.see, <b>Local and foreign experts investigating into the alleged mass graves at Chemmani in Jaffna have reached a unanimous decision that there are no such graves as originally alleged by the convicted prisoner Somaratne Rajapakse and others convicted of the Krishanthy Kumaraswamy rape and murder case</b> .This should be highlighted in the article..If you disagree, please provide other reports made by the forensic experts. second,the word "mass graves" ,was used by everyone when the allegation came to being..But now, people know its a fake..some people thought earth is the centre of the universe and everything rotate around it..BUT now we know its not true. Does Wikipedia need an article says "Earth is the centre of the world"&#160;?? And add arguments for it(taken from ancient people) and against it&#160;?? this is simply ridiculous ,isnt it&#160;?? Its the same here. years of investigations found only 15 body parts&#160;?? So, this isnt a mass grave at all..Also,we never know how did they die in the first place..LTTE ruled these areas for many years till late 1995, and they could also ,had a hand on these murdered people. thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 03:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Iwazaki, I added a summary at the top of the article to try to make it clearer that the original allegation of "mass graves" was much broader than what the subsequent investigation uncovered. I also added detail on the foreign observers, who are mentioned in several of the references, and included some more of the forensic findings. I would be glad to continue working on this article. I'm afraid, though, that it may not be possible to please everybody. Some people want to push the original allegations that hundreds of the disappeared are buried at Chemmani. Other people want to overlook the 15 bodies that were exhumed and the 7 people who were charged with their deaths and call the whole affair a fraud. Neither of these points of view seem to be supported by reliable sources. I think the current state of the article, however, is getting close to a neutral and thorough coverage of what reliable sources have reported. Do you have any further suggestions to improve the article in this regard? -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 16:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact is no one has proven mass graves ever existed in Chenmmani. On the contrary, international experts agree no such graves even existed. Having a article on Wikipedia about something that is proven as fake is completely against policy. Either the article should be renamed to something like "allegations of mass graves at chemmani" or deleted all together.</dd>
<dd>About the use of the {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}} tag, it states
<dl>
<dd><i>A hoax is an attempt to trick an audience into believing that something false is real. Since Wikipedia is an "encyclopedia anyone can edit", it is sometimes abused to perpetrate a hoax.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If the article remains under the current name, it will certainly be "an attempt to trick an audience into believing that something false is real" since the existence of any "mass graves" hasn't ever been proved.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia isn't a gossip column, plain and simple. Why do you think organizations like Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch have failed to mention it in their annual reports for a long time? They publish pages and pages of reports on Human Rights activities in Sri Lanka but simply don't mention Chemmani. Why? Because they accept that no such graves ever existed. They did get on the band wagon like all other media in the late 1990s when the allegations surfaced, but after the excavations they realized there was no truth behind the allegations.</dd>
<dd>And if it was as notable as you claim, why has there been virtually no media coverage of the incident since around 2001? I feel like I'm repeating myself but, because they accept that no such graves ever existed.--<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 16:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have moved the article from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemmani_mass_graves.html" title="Chemmani mass graves">Chemmani mass graves</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemmani_mass_graves_investigation.html" title="Chemmani mass graves investigation">Chemmani mass graves investigation</a>. A redirect exists so that people searching on the so-called "Chemmani mass graves" can read up on what was alleged and what was actually found. By having an article on this subject, Wikipedia is fulfilling its encyclopedic purpose by presenting a notable topic with a neutral point of view based on reliable sources. Without this article, people who heard about the allegations of mass graves at Chemmani and searched Google would probably only be able to read the Tamilnet accounts. I'm sure that's not what you have in mind. I would encourage you to try patrolling <a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESuspected_hoax_articles_dc2a.html" title="Category:Suspected hoax articles">Category: Suspected hoax articles</a> so can see what the {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}} tag is used for.

<dd>How about a section on reactions from International Human Righst agencise, local HR agencies, Tamil polical parties, Tamil diaspora all these are important paort of this phenomenon called Chemmani mass graves. Also what about the reality of 400 peope who really did dissapear during that time in jaffna, the hopes of the relatives to find those bodies in the so called mass graves why shouldnt a neutral article bring all those aspects into discussion&#160;? <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> 21:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Raveen, if you can find information from human rights agencies which is not already in the article, please do include it into the article -- particularly if the information can be sourced directly from the human rights agency. I'm not sure how to fit information from the Tamil political side into the article. I have seen a number of articles from those quarters that seem to imply, without independent corroboration, that the graves at Chemmani contain the bodies of the people who disappeared. I'm not sure what to do with that. That said, I think the article still fails to fully recognize the criticism that the investigation has received for unexplained delays ("Critics contrasted the prompt investigation of the Durraipa stadium graves with the slow investigation of the Chemmani mass graves." <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/sa/704.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/sa/704.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) and the failure, some seven years later, to either acquit the suspects or bring them to justice. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 06:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi shunpiker,I ll highly admire your effort here, spending your precious time trying to make this article more neutral..BUT I must tell you this, you dont really need to do that here..Wikipedia doesn't need an article saying "earth is the centre of the universe" ,so why do we need an article for "chemmani mass graves" ,when the whole thing did not exist at all&#160;!! Also, I have noticed that every time you mention about the investigation, you have used the word "Government appointed"..You are giving an impression that investigation team is not neutral..I think this is kinda insult to those forensic experts, as it was them not the government declared there is nothing in chemmani...Only 15 body parts were founded and out of them only 10 had any signs of assaults..There is no point bringing earlier accusations made by the human rights groups..Its ridiculous..Just like bringing facts from early primitive people to prove the earth is flat or centre of the universe..As snowolf has correctly pointed out. we now obviously know chemmani mass graves do not exist..Why would we waste our time arguing for this&#160;?? About the unexpected delay , investigations were carried out in jaffna and I dont think I have tell you that there is a war going on there.And this was expected to take some time to finish due to the difficulties of guaranteeing safety of the expert team..</dd>
</dl>
<p>BUT still, by 1999 forensic experts were able to go and search the whole area..And as a result, we know that 15 bodies were founded..Then comes the legal process..As A SL and a person who studied law, Let me tell you that the legal process in SL in complex and cases drags forever..So there is no point accusing GOSL for delaying this..if anything praise the GOSl for sending all the forensic experts to Jafnna and carrying out investigation(with our tax money ,of course) for years just to appease international and local media....</p>
<p>finally, some editors using this to prove the existence of "state terrorism in SriLanka" ..SO they declare GOSL did this hence this is a part of state terrorism..Could you please tell me your thoughts regarding this too&#160;??--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 09:37, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Iwazaki,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think this article is a good use for my time. It has taken quite a bit of it to get a sense of how the Chemmani case came about and where it stands, but the next person who wants to read up on the subject will not need so much time, and as long as the article maintains its present course, they will also have a fair and mostly comprehensive presentation of the facts at their disposal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree when you say this article isn't necessary. 15 people are dead, 7 people were arrested, and whether their suspicions are ultimately justified or not, some people believe that the circumstances are connected with the disappearances of hundreds of more people. All of this centers on the Chemmani case, and so I think it is important that people who want to know the facts about this case have a place to find them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You make a good point about the investigation being delayed by the fighting in Jaffna. That is mentioned in a U.S. State Department report ("The case was pending at year's end, but fighting near Jaffna displaced key witnesses and delayed proceedings."<a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/sa/704.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/sa/704.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), and should be incorporated into the article. Another cause for delay is the difficulty in identifying the remains. ("The remaining unidentified bodies underwent DNA testing for identification purposes. The Attorney General's office has indicated that it was not satisfied with the inconclusive initial results and reportedly was searching for funds to provide for a more detailed test." <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18315.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18315.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and "CID pointed out that DNA test results on the remains of the deceased are also due from India." <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.) This should also be woven into the narrative.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, there are also criticisms which are unrelated to fighting or identification of the dead, and should receive attention: "The Government was slow to move on the case; however, due to international pressure the process again was put in motion early in the year." <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> "Critics contrasted the prompt investigation of the Durraipa stadium graves with the slow investigation of the Chemmani mass graves." <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8241.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8241.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Or the "magistrate who said that it is 'unacceptable' that an inquiry takes so long". <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't intend to cast any aspersions on the investigators when I specify that they are with the government. I think it's important to be as precise as possible about who the actors are, and in this case I was echoing the U.S. State department's description of "a team of Government investigators". <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> Where possible, I have tried to identify non-governmental actors: For example, the excavation witnesses from Amnesty International.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the forensic results, there are more details to weave into the article. Though the cause of death was not determined for some of the bodies, "physical assault and murder could not be ruled out" <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/442.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. I would also like to see if I can find more information about the results of the DNA test that were "due from India" in 2006. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/01/060104_chemmani_ag.shtml" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I get the impression that the Chemmani case has been an important one for the National Human Rights Commission (HRC), and it has been singled out for both praise and blame for its role in the investigation. This could be worth including in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am unsure how to relate the allegations of what happened in Chemmani to state terrorism. State terrorism, as I understand it, is state-directed violence against civilians. In this case you have, on the one hand, government actors on trial for the murder of civilians. On the other hand, they are being prosecuted by the state, which is an argument against government complicity in the crimes that they have been charged with.</dd>

<dd>there are several factual errors in the above reply! let me address them first..</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There are no WP:RS regarding chemmani ..because incident simply did not happen&#160;!!</li>
<li>No one is censoring anything... Why on earth people should censor something which did not exist&#160;!!</li>
<li>GOSL did a full investigation and the so called mass graves did not come out!!</li>
<li>there was a full scale investigations for over 2 years&#160;!!! yes&#160;!! 2 years spending lots of our tax money to please some shouting tamil diaspora!! and it was a total waste&#160;!!</li>
<li>If I write a book saying, there are mass sinhalese graves in jaffna, can i create an article and have my book as a source&#160;?? Internet is a free world and people can create what ever they want.BUT wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and giving correct info to the readers should be the priority..Its hilarious to ask readers to figure it out while deceiving them to believe in what you write.</li>
<li>please provide reports of the forensic experts, please provide the report of the GOSL investigation..NOT fairy tales written by PRO-Tamil sites</li>
</ul>
<p>finally, desire to fool wikipedian community it quite obvious here..Giving sources far from being <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>..pathetic and disgusting.thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 04:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whether there were mass graves at Chemmani or not, it seems from a quick google search that the subject has received sustained attention not only from Tamil groups, but also from the Sri Lankan press <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/990620/news2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/990620/news2.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> and the Sri Lankan government <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca199912/20001221gravesinchemmani.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca199912/20001221gravesinchemmani.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. Because of this, it appears to me to be a notable, if contentious subject, and therefore not a good candidate for the "hoax" tag, which is generally a prelude to deletion. Iwazaki, correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like your intent is not to nominate the article for deletion, but to suggest that the subject of mass graves at Chemmani is war time propaganda. I wholeheartedly agree that this article is one-sided and needs a balanced telling and better sourcing.

<dd>They incident did receive a lot of attention in the late 1990s when their existence was initially alleged, but it was soon proven to be false. For that reason the tile itself, "Chemmani mass graves", is inherently wrong because there were nothing as such.</dd>
<dd>For example, some people have alleged the Bush Administration was complicit in 9/11 and those claims have got attention in some media. But, just because of that we don't create a article titled Involvement of the Bush Administration in 9/11. Similarly just one convicted soldier alleged the existence of graves in Chemmani, and it was picked up by people who wanted to discredit the military. It would be wrong because that never happened, and creating articles like this would needlessly dilute the encyclopedic value of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 03:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Snowolf, I rewrote the article based on what I think are pretty uncontroversial sources. Let me know what you think and I'm glad to continue working on this -- although my main interest is the correct use of the "hoax" tag, and not the Sri Lankan Civil War (though I'm getting an education in the latter thanks to the former). It seems to me that the official Sri Lankan position is that Rajapakse's allegations are misleading, at least as far as the scope of what happened. That said, the government arrested a number of people in connection with this case who as far as I can tell are still facing charges. And government press releases use the phrase "Chemmani mass graves" <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200004/20000404Australia_condems_LTTE.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200004/20000404Australia_condems_LTTE.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010418editorialreview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010418editorialreview.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010406editorialreview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010406editorialreview.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/SecurityReport/sr200001/20000105Ponnambalam_dead.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/SecurityReport/sr200001/20000105Ponnambalam_dead.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. So I think it would be inaccurate to write this off as a "hoax", or as "proven false" without being precise about just what is fraudulent or discredited. I would welcome renaming this article to "Chemmani mass graves investigation" or "Chemmani mass graves allegations" or something of the like if that is generally agreeable. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 04:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Shunpiker, since it was me who tagged this as a <b>HOAX</b>,its my duty to clarify my position here..first let me start with by these words.."<b>Chemmani mass grave is a hoax</b>". there is not a question about it..With 4 years of investigation, only a dozen of bodies came out from that grave..And we don't even know whether these people were killed by the Army or not.Please bear in mind, most parts of jaffna was under the LTTE rule till 1995 and the founded skeleton and human body parts could easily belong to that era too..</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As snowolf has correctly pointed out, why would we need an article for something which did not occur&#160;?? If chemmani mass grave a true thing, I would make no objections..But since it just an allegation by a convicted Army personal, probably made to take away the attention away from him, why do we have to use wikipedia for this&#160;??? you have sated several Local newspapers also used the word "Mass graves" ..Yes you are right..When the allegations came out, we were shocked&#160;!! News papers and TV media gave a huge publicity and continuously used the word "mass graves" ,I as a university student made protest to the GOSL regarding this..It took a while to realised that we were all fooled by some..LTTE supporters used this to tarnish the government(they still do despite no proofs)and thats why you can still see , tons of internet sites having articles related to this..BUT not a single mention of the actual event is stated at those sites..Now after the proper investigation we all know that, this event is a <b>certain Hoax</b>.. <b>There were absolutely no mass graves in chemmani!</b>.. its just like the The 'Surgeon's Photo'<a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/lochness.html" class="external text" title="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/lochness.html" rel="nofollow">nessie</a>.People believed it(made to) but finally turned out to be a <b>HOAX</b>!! Since article was made after the investigations, why do we have to go back to the hoax again&#160;?? thanks --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 10:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>first please read the definition of "mass graves" and take your time to compare what you write with what already exist in the link given here by Mr sebestian..Remember you just <b>cant</b> add things like "chemmani" as it is obviously not a mass grave, since ONLY 15 body part were founded and ONLY couple of them had any indication of torture&#160;!! There may be mass graves in SL..But frankly I dont know how it is going to help our country in this case..Instead ,it will going to further damage our countries image, which is already in a terrible situation..Why do we need to spend our valuable time to destroy our countries image&#160;?? Why cant we form project such as "History of SriLanka" ,"Greatest SriLankan" and so on ,to show the good part of our country..In 3 rd century we had the worlds 2 tallest building&#160;!! We have temples bigger and taller than Pyramids ,and foreigners dont even know that&#160;!! We have oldest "brahmi script" and one of the oldest existing inscriptions of the wrold,and no one knows them&#160;!! <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus_steel.html" title="Damascus steel">Damascus_steel</a> was a SL invention ,but somehow Indians taking credit for it ,because <b>we are stuck in disputed templates and articles</b> created by you and other tamils...There are so many things Sinhalese(And others) made to the world and sadly no one knows them ..Instead of appealing our heritage and achievements, you are defaming our country with totally irrelevant and unnecessary articles/templates/tables..You can go ahead and create the "mass grave project" ,even though it will serve no good for our country,hence I prefer to stay away from it..BUT I will definitely keep an aye on it ,and wont allow to add defamatory info to it. thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 03:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, Iwazaki you should understand that this is wikipedia and thus it should serve as a information page. Your argunment "I dont know how it is going to help our country in this case" is pointless to me because Wiki is not here to "help" any country... It is just like any book you come here to get information. Also I do not appericiate your attack on not only raveen but also on a race (tamils) as you imply that tamils use wiki to put down Sri Lanka... With that being said I love Raveens' idea and I can contribut if needed. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchdogb_a098.html" title="User:Watchdogb">Watchdogb</a> 03:13, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>U didnt read all of my post ,did you&#160;?? As a free encyclopedia,wikipedia has given us the opportunity promote our country..yes, I used the word promote ,because our articles in wikipedia is read and referred by thousands of people around the world..By doing that we are also promoting or expanding wikipedia too..So its a mutual relationship..I don't think I have to reply to your other nonsenses,do i Watchdog<b>B</b>?..I would like to finish this short reply by saying that ,I would keep an eye(or two) on that project and certainly won't allow to add non-existence mass graves such as chemmani into it.Also ,I will make sure that the definition of a mass grave is strictly applicable to every incident in the project.thanks --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 09:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to reiterate my point of view. Yes Sri Lanka that I was born was a great country, people that I knew and interacted were the best. My first language was Sinhalese not Tamil because everybody around us spoke Sinhalese. But that is besides the point today we have this pointless war that I think has been dragged on for more than 20 years for no reason other than involved people’s lack of vision, lack of cranial capacity, total lack empathy for common people’s requirements, manifest racism and war profiteering when most of the elite’s children are abroad living in safety.</dd>

<dd>But all of us are driven by certain things, what drives me is Human Rights violations weather it is Sri lanka, India or Lesotho. If not for Sri Lanka, I will be writing about Human rights in Sudan. Because that’s what I am. If Iwazaki is interested in Great things Sri Lanka then he should write about it. As far I am concerned Chemmani was a mass grave because it did contain 15 bodies and the government stopped the investigation citing neutral sources but that was secondary information. I want to see the primary source that says the neutral people said that there is no pint in looking. Where is it&#160;? Asking the Sri Lankan government to investigate itself is like asking a thief to give the judge incriminating evidence when there is neither a carrot or stick attached to his behavior.

Why did you only blame Chandrika's government&#160;?? How about condemning the Jaffna residents who did not die so they couldn't end up at chemmani&#160;?? How about blaming LTTE for not killing enough people and burying them at chemmani&#160;?? Or how about blaming all the Srilankan who did not end up at the chemmani mass grave&#160;?? GO ahead with your project,As I said before "<b>I will make sure that the definition of a mass grave is strictly applicable to every incident in the project</b>" And I ask you,kindly, <b>not to make terrible blunders ,such as adding non existence mas graves in to the project</b>.Look forward to see all the mass graves articles. thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 13:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What ever said and done Chandrika was the only human being in this conflict of demons and devils. All what I can write is because she took responsibility for her governments actions. Fighting the LTTE is one thing, no one will ever question that. But fighting a civilian population is completely another sick dimension and all fair human beings will fight it. She was a rare Sri Lankan with a basic human trait of taking responsibility for barbaric actions that even most Sri Lankan Wikipedians don’t have decency to take responsibility for. This article was a pathetic propaganda piece when you started putting the hoax tag and fighting it. Now it is a descent article. That’s’ the strength of the Wikipedia process. This will go on even after you and I dead.

<p>Does this article qualify for category:mass graves&#160;? I think it does. It contained 15 bodies. Anyone with opinions&#160;?<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> 18:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that only 2 people were identified as those who died during 95/96 means it cannot be categorized as a mass grave. For all we know the others could have been buried in a family grave a hundred years ago or be part of a mass suicide cult. Unless it is definitely identified that they were killed and buried here together, it cannot be categorized as a mass grave. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 18:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the whole argument is whether this is mass garve or not, not that 2 people were of the 548 dissapeared were buried and therest 13 were unidentified. It has nothing to do with whether it is a mass graveor not. From the definition of mass grave is <i>A mass grave is a grave containing multiple unidentified human corpses. There is no strict definition of the minimum number of bodies required to constitute a mass grave. The term is generally used when a significant number of bodies have been buried. A mass grave may hold the bodies of a dozen, hundreds, or even thousands of people.</i> it is from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_grave.html" title="Mass grave">mass grave</a>. It appears that 15 corpses were buried in the same place not even the government dosent argue it. Who cares whether it has 2 people who went missing. It is simply a grave of more than 1 person. So it is a mass grave. No conotations made about it <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> 22:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye, the UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, <i>has defined "mass graves" as locations where <b>three</b> or more victims of extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions were buried, not having died in combat or armed confrontations</i>..Sorry raveen ,even the UN,who care so much about human rights and mass graves and even willing to consider 3 as mass,don't think 2 is mass&#160;!!

<dd>Good you have a nice citation. Can you get me the link please&#160;? anyway I think the question is not 2 were identified and the rest were not identified. Not identified does not mean anything they could or could have been part of the 548 but that is besides the point. This is simply a mass grave because 15 bodies were found and probably like Snowolfd4 says the rest(i.e 13) may have been killed by the LTTE and buried there but not bury themselves in a suicide pact!!. Hence it is a mass grave of more than 3 people. Further what about the mass graves of Tsunami victims&#160;? 100's were buried across Sri Lanka in mass graves. You mean to say they are not mass graves? That's why the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_grave.html" title="Mass grave">mass grave</a> article does not assume that mass grave means something negative like the UN. Wikipedia definition is broader. It classfies it as a burial custom. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> 13:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I did and by that defintition too this is a mass grave because read what the article says <i>In December, a government team of investigators reported that 10 of the remains, including one skeleton that was bound and blindfolded, showed evidence of assault and murder.

<p>making articles dedicating to assaulted<b>2</b> people buried in grave&#160;??? perhaps they use common sense in defining the word <b>mass</b>..Or they may go by the UN ,which says more than <b>3</b> is mass..Unless you come with any new points ,I am not going to bother replying here..I still hope, you will create real mass grave articles not the dubious ones in the future..good luck --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 02:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This appears to be a game of semantics. No one disputes that more than two people were buried in this grave; the question appears to arise from <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> they were placed in the grave. I have reviewed the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8241.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8241.htm" rel="nofollow">United States Department of State's 2001 statement</a> on Sri Lanka, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exhumations in 1999 in the presence of international observers and forensic experts yielded 15 skeletons. Two of the victims provisionally were identified as young men who had disappeared in 1996. In late 1999, the Government submitted its forensic report to a magistrate in Jaffna; <i>the report stated that <b>10 of the remains</b>, including a skeleton that was bound and blindfolded, showed signs of physical assault that led to their deaths</i>. The cause of death was not determined for the remaining bodies; however, the report stated that physical assault leading to death could not be ruled out in these cases. By year's end, 13 of the bodies had not been identified. Rajapakse and others named a total of 20 security personnel, including former policemen, as responsible for the killings. The remaining unidentified bodies were undergoing DNA testing for identification purposes at year's end. At year's end, the case still was pending, but continued disturbances on the Jaffna Peninsula have displaced key witnesses and delayed proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Opinion</b>: The United States government has no compunction about calling this a mass grave. Neither should we. Whether or not all the bodies arrived in the grave at the same time, all them did arrive in the same grave under circumstances of considerable physical duress. Though it did not contain as many corpses as alleged by Rajapakse, it is unquestionably a mass grave.</p>
<p>Further, I went looking for the quote Iwazaki provided regarding the UN's definition of "mass grave". Interestingly, the full quote reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>There is no legal definition of mass graves.</b> Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye, the UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, has defined "mass graves" as locations where three or more victims of extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions were buried, not having died in combat or armed confrontations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone wishes to add a section to the article disputing the findings of the international investigators, they should certainly feel free to add a well-cited and verifiable paragraph free of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_words_3d79.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel words">weasel words</a>.</p>

<dd>I knew what I was quoting..If I merely go with the thing, there is no clear definition for mass grave ,then the whole thing will become arbitrary and disputed..If there is no clear definition, then we have to use our common sense here..Its all about numbers and the cause of death..Since only <b>2</b> of them were identified as the disappeared, common sense would say(since no clear definition for Mass graves)this is not a mass grave..Even if we go by the dictionary meaning of <b>mass</b> , two is not considered a mass..Mass is simply large number of people&#160;!! furthermore, this article is written in way that gives the impression the ARMY did all these massacres..This could well be false..LTTE ruled Jaffna till 1995 and these murdered people could well be their victims!! couple with the fact,allegations it self were made to take away the attention from the rapists, we can safely conclude this is not a mass grave..I will revert raveens last edits, since it does not make any sense at all!! if anything, 60,000 people died in the war and how can we say these bodies could belong to anyone!!--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 00:49, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, it's all about the numbers and the cause of death. Do you contest that there were more than two bodies in this grave? Do you contend that only two of those bodies showed any signs of physical abuse?</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><b>10 of the remains</b>, including a skeleton that was bound and blindfolded, showed signs of physical assault that led to their deaths<i>.</i></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>If a serial killer were to kill victims one by one, over the course of several years, and deposit their bodies in a single location, that single location would rightly be defined as a mass grave. Likewise, a grave containing 15 bodies, at least ten of which showed signs of physical abuse that led to that death, could be considered a mass grave. You can rewrite the article to help shed doubt on the <i>perpetrators</i> of the killing, but it is disingenuous to suggest that a grave containing the abused bodies of at least 10 people is not in any way a mass grave.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I've provided my opinion. If you don't want to accept it, well, there's always a more formal mediation process. Good luck. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnuppy_2866.html" title="User:Snuppy">Snuppy</a> 03:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All things considered, the fact is since just two of the bodies have been conclusively identified, no one has been able to provide proof that the bodies were buried here at the same time or by the same person/s.
