<dd>Hi Brian, the discussion prior to the article creation was with respect to the title "Tourism apartheid in Cuba" or "Tourist apartheid in Cuba" -- see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa#Rationale_for_splitting_Tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_into_its_own_article" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa#Rationale_for_splitting_Tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_into_its_own_article" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. It was you, in my opinion, that arbitrarily picked a new title and imposed it without discussion, not myself. So far, it is just you who feel that it should be called "Allegations of Cuban apartheid" - it was not agreed to by Jayjg (who didn't comment at all), Homey (who seemed to support the new article and didn't comment on the name), myself (who suggested the name "Tourism apartheid in Cuba), and Zleitzen (who makes him opinion clear above.)</dd>
<dd>It is important to say what type of apartheid it is in the title since normally one assumes apartheid has to do with race, when in fact, in the case of Cuba, it is related to tourist vs. non-tourist divide. Also the whole article is oriented around the term "tourist apartheid" -- you'll notice this if you read through the article. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 19:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That seems reasonable. Nevertheless, Leifern expressed a concern, which I share, that the use of the term apartheid is watered down to the point of meaninglessness, and moreover, the use of "apartheid" to describe situations like the Cuban one is so controversial that it should not be approached lightly. I would agree to a title along the lines of "Allegations of tourism apartheid in Cuba" or "Alleged tourism apartheid in Cuba". <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 19:50, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, whatever the title is, it needs to be neutral. Just stating that Cuba practices apartheid is not neutral, one can only allege it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:02, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The above is an empty statement. Do all scientific entries need now to be prefixed with the term "Theory of "? But I understand this is part of a meta-argument thus I'll let it go. Hopefully, eventually, impartial individuals will come in and fix it. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 20:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh -- feel like I'm back on the debate team. More than 90% of scientific theories in Wikipedia don't have that prefix. Those that do, tend to use those names, in part for the purposes of disambiguation, since the main term of those listed above are already in common usage for a different concept or set of concepts -- see: <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">relativity</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything.html" title="Everything">everything</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computation.html" title="Computation">computation</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mind</a>, descriptions, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forms.html" title="Forms">forms</a>. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 20:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll try and explain. It's to do with the economy of Cuba. Cuba needed to exploit tourism after the Soviet collapse - and thus consciously created a dual economy based on the peso and the dollar. This created a rapid economic divide where those in the lucrative service industry, dealing in dollars were able to jump way ahead of industrial and agricultural workers who could only buy in pesos. Anyone who knows Cuba during this period would acknowledge the difference between the impoverished peso stores and the well-stocked dollar stores. Where this article may need work is the changes since 2004 when the dollar was removed from circulation. The "apartheid" or two tier situation after the special period was acknowledged by Cubans, tourists, the Cuban government and socialists from around the world as a unique phenomenon due to economic circumstances inadvertantly clashing with Cuba's command economy.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 02:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, there is a two-tier economy. But anybody - Cuban or foreign - who has money can shop in the "dollar stores". In fact most of the people shopping in most of the dollar stores are Cubans.

<dd>The term apartheid in this case is indeed strong. But it isn't an invention of wikipedia, it's there in the sources provided. One thing that concerns me is that this was a major concern at the turn of the milleneum - when the tourist boom really took hold. A lot of the talk on this has died down now abroad, perhaps as a result of economic growth, So is this still relevant? --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 02:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition, regarding your comments, the "defenders of privilege" as you put it, are in this case the Cuban authorities. Creating a climate for increased international private investment by advertising the benefits of Cuba's control over the economy and workforce. Castro himself has commented on this as a necessity, whilst simultaneously enshrining the permanence of the Marxist-Leninist constitution in 2002.

<p>Much of what is referred to as "tourist apartheid" is actually a wealth apartheid - those with money can get things that those without money can't. Whilst that goes against Cuba's socialist principles, what country does that not apply to&#160;? And, in fact, isn't that really what capitalism is all about&#160;? In particular, I am still waiting for some one to show me a Cuban restaurant that refuses entry to a Cuban with money. Similarly, I am sure that most Britons could not go to the finest restaurants in London - but few (apart from the most left-wing) scream about the injustice. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 00:52, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone removed the NPOV tag without attempting to deal with the problem. I have restored. The article does not attempt to put the Cuban government position, and instead is content to parrot US government propaganda. It does not distinguish between those restrictions which are based solely on nationality and those (such as access to the best restaurants) which are merely based on wealth. Probably it also should compare the situation in other Caribbean tourist destinations.</p>

<dd>In your view they have failed; but NPOV simply consists of reproducing what reliable sources have to say about a matter. The article on Apartheid in South Africa is not filled with defenses of the practice from the (then) South African government. You've mentioned only 3 "U.S. government sources" out of 30 that are used in the article, and none of the 3 you mentioned are quoted. You also claim that the term was widely-used in English before Cubans started using it; what is your evidence for that claim? As for support for the claim that it was originated in Cuba, why don't you read the sources provided? It came from a paper presented by Dr. María Dolores Espino at the Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy. In addition, if you don't have any sources that contradict the views presented here, then by definition the article represents the mainstream view, which is exactly what NPOV demands - find sources contradicting this if you can. Finally, regarding "conspiracy theories", you objected to the article because you claimed it was "Quoting the US government as a source" and then stated "I wonder how many others are US government funded." The latter, of course, is conspiracy thinking, and again, the article does not quote the US government at all. As you still have not brought any evidence that this article fails NPOV, and apparently have not even read much of it, I'm removing the tag again. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:29, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have added a couple of responses from Fidel Castro on the issue to represent an opposing view of sorts. but the policies of explicate exclusion from certain amenities were certainly tangible, Beardo, as Castro himself acknowledged. Castro also stated that the policies would stand for as long as they were necessary. Have these policies changed significantly following the removal of the dollar and the easing of economic conditions? Resulting in the more relaxed situation you have observed presently? Such positive subtle changes in Cuba usually go unreported in the mainstream Western media for obvious reasons. When I quizzed a few recent visitors to Cuba they generally downplayed the issue as well which would concur with your analysis. It is just a case of finding a way to express that using sources and staying within policy.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 10:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whilst doing some maintenence work on the references here, I spotted two references used for uses of term by "others". The first was published online on the far right website "front page magazine", attributed to Agustin Blazquez. Now I don't believe Blazquez is in any way a suitable source for an article. He is an extremist campaigner, <a href="http://www.haciendapub.com/blazquez.html" class="external text" title="http://www.haciendapub.com/blazquez.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> written by Blazquez and referring to a universally discredited claim of Cuba's links to "bioterrorism" pretty much typifies his output. I also don't know if his entirely spurious assessments of racial divisions in Cuba inform this article (they are found in the reference section rather than the main body of the article). Here is the wording.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the humanitarian Glover has never raised his voice on behalf of the Cuban people's human rights, the existence of the shameful tourist apartheid, the disproportionate majority of black Cubans in Castro's dungeons or the absence of black Cubans in key government positions." Blazquez, Agustin. Hollywood's Cuban Connection, The Washington Dispatch, February 4, 2003.</p>

<dd>I need more convincing that a redirect is not the obvious move here, I'm afraid, as a number of people have already stated. It was my understanding that this information was to be part of the tourism in Cuba page when such a page had been satisfactorily expanded. Humus sapiens's point about an "Allegations of apartheid" series should have <i>no impact</i> on the Cuban range of articles, and I am concerned that this article about Cuba is being directed by <i>unrelated disputes over the term "apartheid"</i> on another page. Jayjg's point that the article is not about tourism is not the case, <i>every</i> issue discussed in the article is related in someway to tourism and the tourist boom. Further issues concerning the two tier economy, which are far more complicated and go way deeper than anything presented on this page, should be discussed in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Cuba_8510.html" title="Economy of Cuba">Economy of Cuba</a> and elsewhere - which they are. All studies and writings referring to "apartheid" in Cuba relate explicately to tourism apartheid with the exception of "medical apartheid" which is already covered in the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healthcare_in_Cuba_4b7f.html" title="Healthcare in Cuba">Healthcare in Cuba</a>, and can be added to the tourism page. If people want an article about potential divisions in Cuban society due to the dollar/convertible pesos issue, and about Cuban government practices in relation to its own population, then we'll need to put the kettle on, sit down and have a long discussion about Cuban politics and the economy 1991-2004 using extensive sources, which I have to hand and can make available.

Again Humus is referring to a series of articles. Well over at this end we also have a series of articles - we think that two of them should be merged - and I'm putting a considerable amount of work into ensuring that happens. Again, if people are disputing the use of the term apartheid on one article relating to one country, that shouldn't have a negative impact for readers and editors in a completely different area.

<dd>Perhaps your <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentral_discussions_Apartheid_f3f7.html" title="Wikipedia:Central discussions/Apartheid">Wikipedia:Central discussions/Apartheid</a> page was not known to the regular editors of Cuban articles, as it was not known that a discussion of tourism in Cuba had become part of an unrelated wider series. I'm concerned with the framing in the terms of "absolving this case". The issues concerning tourism in Cuba shouldn't be reduced to a case, which must take into account a number of unrelated articles, concerning different countries and entirely different issues. For readers and editors alike, it needs to stand on its own merits, and be worked on with that in mind. The Cuba section on the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_South_Africa_fdba.html" title="Apartheid outside South Africa">Apartheid outside South Africa</a> article should now link to the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> page. <i>Not</i> to do so would be to set an unusual precedent here. And such a precedent will be contested vehemently and repeatedly by Cuban related editors as POV, as it has been above by a number of users already, until the situation is resolved. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 09:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for reframing, let's keep in mind that we are not talking about tourism here. What we are dealing with are policies of a totalitarian Stalinist state that tramples the human rights and freedoms of its own citizens. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 11:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excuse me? No. We <i>are</i> talking about tourism, issues that are comparable with neighbours, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/jamaica/" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/jamaica/" rel="nofollow">Jamaica</a> and the <a href="http://www.latinamericabureau.org/?lid=1975" class="external text" title="http://www.latinamericabureau.org/?lid=1975" rel="nofollow">Dominican republic</a> etc (lets not even mention Haiti). All of which have particular caveats to protect the rights and interests of tourists. That they are not castigated for similar policies by the media speaks volumes about how skewered this issue is. If we want to start talking about accompanying articles concerned with other nations, why don't we begin with <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Jamaica_f3c3.html" title="Economy of Jamaica">Economy of Jamaica</a> and <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_the_Dominican_Republic_4667.html" title="Economy of the Dominican Republic">Economy of the Dominican Republic</a>. Your "totalitarian Stalinist state" analogy is a hopelessly POV interjection here and will only raise the concerns of neutral, informed editors. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 15:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, we're talking about allegations of discriminatory practices, which is what all the "apartheid" articles are about. This has little to do with tourism <i>per se</i>, and everything to do with government policies. No other Caribbean countries have practices that resemble this in any way, and, more importantly, have been <i>described by reliable sources</i> in that way. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:58, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I've said elsewhere, we should have an article called Apartheid, which would be about apartheid in South Africa, and an article called Allegations of apartheid, which would be about the various ways in which the term is used loosely. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't agree at all Jayjg. As you know, every source and point on this page relates to tourism. And government policies concerning tourism. The two tier economy which you may be inferring isn't explored in this page, and is a far more complicated issue (one which still surrounds the issue of tourism). The merge is logical <i>and</i> will help subdue the various ongoing POV issues that surround this page. It was mentioned and agreed to on its creation, as I understood it - only the lack of information on the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> page halted this. Now we have context on that page, which refers explicitly to this page, the merge should be an inevitability. If that causes problems for this "apartheid" series, then so be it. But now our article has found its parents, it should be allowed to go back home. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 18:33, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we have a fundamental disagreement here. Considering the article originally came out of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_South_Africa_fdba.html" title="Apartheid outside South Africa">Apartheid outside South Africa</a>, that's where it would belong, if it weren't so large. It's not a stub, it is arguably relevant to two different topics, so it really can't be merged. Feel free to create a summary of this material in the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> article, as has been done in the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_South_Africa_fdba.html" title="Apartheid outside South Africa">Apartheid outside South Africa</a> article, and link to this main article. As a bonus, that will mean the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> article isn't over-balanced any more; currently it is. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps its worth waiting for the flux surrounding the "apartheid" business to dim before we re-enter a discussion about what should happen to this aticle. Personally, I'll give it a couple of weeks or so. I'm just concerned that the information in this article is getting dragged into unrelated disputes and precedents. When in actuality it should stand as part of the Cuban series of articles, with all the individual POV issues explored and explained on their own merits and in their own context. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 03:56, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
