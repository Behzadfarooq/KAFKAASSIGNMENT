<p>I don't think that AMG ratings, no matter how professional they are, should be included in the infobox for albums.

<dd>"I believe that these ratings may give a bias toward (or against) some albums (none in particular)." Um, how cryptic.&#160;:) What exactly to you is evidence of this bias? That some albums get higher ratings than others? Would you prefer a ratings system where every album gets the same rating? That would be completely bias-free. The fact of the matter is, ALL reviews have some bias. The thing that makes AMG so great is that their ratings reflect more of a "critical consensus" than just some guy randomly choosing ratings: accepted classics of the genre get 5 stars, near-classics 4.5, solid albums get 4, and so on down the line. Sometimes ratings even change to reflect changes in the consensus: <a href="../../../o/a/s/Oasis_%28band%29.html" title="Oasis (band)">Oasis</a> has had their first two albums bumped up to 5 stars from 4.5. (Very few original albums get 5 stars immediately upon release.) After years and years of having EVERY original album <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> ever did at 5 stars, AMG finally took down <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Let_It_Be_%28album%29_09e4.html" title="Let It Be (album)">Let It Be</a></i> to 4.5...not because of one man's bias, but because that album's critical stature has dwindled over the years. Bottom line: AMG is not perfect, but nothing is, and it comes as close as you possibly can. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes">StarryEyes</a> 05:47, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>I think it's useful to point out what AllMusic says about its ratings system, [<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE57F1EDC4BAA7720F6BD1D65EA9B47C628FE70CFBE3B126F63FDFB187C910866F871C2B1CFF0B676AB7BA8E02CA45A099FCBEF5CF9DC6C3C389D9FDB&amp;sql=32:amg/info_pages/a_faq_content.html|found" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE57F1EDC4BAA7720F6BD1D65EA9B47C628FE70CFBE3B126F63FDFB187C910866F871C2B1CFF0B676AB7BA8E02CA45A099FCBEF5CF9DC6C3C389D9FDB&amp;sql=32:amg/info_pages/a_faq_content.html|found" rel="nofollow">here</a>]</p>
<dl>
<dd>How does your ratings system work?</dd>
<dd>Our experts use a 1 to 5 star system (5 is the highest rating). It is important to note that we rate albums only within the scope of an artist’s own work -- we only compare a release to other releases by the same artist. We won't compare a Britney Spears album to the latest release by Incubus. When looking at an artist's discography, you may see a check mark next to the star rating of a release. That represents the AMG Pick for the release most representative of that artist's entire body of work. On specific release pages you may also see smaller checks next to two or three tracks on a recording. Those are AMG Song Picks. These are the songs on a recording that our experts feel are most representative of the entire release.</dd>
<dd>For classical albums, two ratings are provided: one for performance/musical quality, and one for sound quality. These are applied on a more universal scale than the non-classical ratings, because a classical album is rarely the work of a single artist or group, and so cannot usually be evaluated within the scope of a single artist’s discography.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay, if that were true, then logically all artsts would have at least one five star album (the pinnacle of their work) and the rest would go down from there. Needless to say, this isn't the case. Maybe genres more so, but the artists are not rated in their own little vacuum. --72.81.54.100 01:25, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thus, I feel that AllMusic star ratings should not be used on album pages <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcuin_9f7f.html" title="User:Alcuin">Alcuin</a> 16:57, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All ratings are qualified and limited. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 05:58, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with those who think they should be removed. I've been adding to GWAR-related pages lately, and although I'm biased because I'm a big fan, AMG's coverage of the band is total shit. Their "experts" state in the bio that the name is an acronym, something denied by the band itself. Regarding their ratings being a critical consensus type of deal, It may true for more popular bands, but for GWAR they rate This Toilet Earth, Ragnarok, and Beyond Hell as being worse than We Kill Everything which is largely considered the band's worst album by fans. In summary, i'm saying for bands that don't have much mainstream exposure AMG shouldn't be linked. for Hendrix or Beatles fine because there are generally links to other site's reviews. With a band like GWAR the only links are to AMG because of its scope despite its low quality when dealing with cult bands <a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOderus_023f.html" title="User:Oderus">Oderus</a> 00:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC) Oderus</p>
<p>Personally, I believe AMG ratings are rather worthless. I don't know if anyone has noticed, but they routinely change reviews and ratings to fit popular opinion. Ratings from a site or publication like this aren't worth much. 67.116.253.238 02:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree to the Original (quite old) point made in this "ratings" section, and to the most recent ones. Although I have agreed to most of the ratings I've seen, I think they are bias and they are the opion of somebody that is not the wiki reader themselves, and I don't think they should be included in album infoboxes. Its up to people individually what they think of an album. <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/User:Ben." class="external text" title="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/User:Ben." rel="nofollow">Ben</a> 02:33 25th February 2007 (UTC)</li>

What about how they rate some albums without a review. Who gives these ratings? Also, there are some written reviews that differ somewhat in tone from the numerical rating. (i.e., a glowing review but a mediocre rating.)</p>

Also, a common error in the listings is albums that were released before 1983 being listed with CD releases at the time of the albums original release. User:THollan</p>

<dd>Whoa, chill, mate. The AMG has some errors. Some several thousand, perhaps. But for that matter, Wikipedia has some errors...and, yes, some several thousand, perhaps. That doesn't mean it isn't a valuable source of information. You just have to view things critically (no pun intended), and realize that, like Wikipedia, information beyond bare facts on relatively obscure artists is never going to be perfect. Although one thing you have to keep in mind is that sometimes US and UK versions of albums differ, so perhaps the track was on the US version of the album. Furthermore, sometimes albums never get release in the US, so an American debut might be a UK <i><b>sophomore</b></i> effort. Unlike Wikipedia, however, it is a site made exclusively by Americans, so US-centric points of view are to be expected! And, of course, vocabulary too. I think you need to relax a little. I mean, I don't have the inclination to hurt myself with a pen every time I see a British website prattle on about "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> Football". It still takes a minute to register: "oh, they mean THAT kind of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>...not '<a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>' as in <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a></i>". I'm sure you're "taking the piss", as you British say, when you talk about how the rest of the world hates America and you hate us even more because of a website...at least to a degree, I would hope.

<p>This comment is to start a discussion about AMGs prominence as a reference for musical genres. I have used AMG for much research although it seems to be hardly the last word. Since AMG figures so highly into what music critics are using as reference material i think it is important to note their influence in the AMG article. Since they are free to publish what they want and it might not be sufficiently referenced or cross checked, they have the tendency (in my opinion) to publish slightly sub-standard genre descriptions and are usually 2-3 years behind on their band biographies. These problems may be only apparent on their allmusic.com website, while the actually database may contain more in-depth information. Since I dont have access to the database I couldn't say. However since the allmusic.com site is one of the main sources for referencing music info, I thought it should be noted. <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 06:33, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been trying to add an AMG writer's name to the list of other writers on AMG's Wikipedia entry, and shortly after I add it, it keeps getting erased. The editor sent me a message saying "we need a source to make sure you are not adding it for vanity reasons" - what does this mean and how do I submit a source?</p>
