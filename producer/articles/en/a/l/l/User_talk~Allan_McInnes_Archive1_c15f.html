<p>Hi, while I generally don't think it is a good idea to confront new users with the darker side of Wikipedia, I have a request for you. Looking at the edits you have already made and your academic home page, you seem to be very knowledgable about CSP, distributed systems and such. A number of articles, such as <a href="../../../u/n/b/Unbounded_nondeterminism.html" title="Unbounded nondeterminism">unbounded nondeterminism</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html" title="Actor model and process calculi">actor model and process calculi</a> have been under heavy edit by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hewitt_103a.html" title="Carl Hewitt">Carl Hewitt</a> (of <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actors</a> fame). There are some serious doubts about the factual accuracy though (they seems to paint the actos model in a brighter color than it really is). Would you mind looking over them? Cheers, —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/k/User%7ER.Koot_9d15.html" title="User:R.Koot">R. Koot</a></i> 15:39, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>“Very knowledgeable” may be a bit of an overestimation, but I do have some background in process calculi/algebras. I will look over the articles you've pointed to, and, where I see any assertions of fact that I know to be false, try to fix them.

<p>Hi Allan. I don't think we have met before, but I wanted to thank you for preparing and presenting evidence in the arbitration case.

<p>Hey Allan, good work with WP:CompSci&#160;:D I'll try to drop in from time to time, but currently (meat-space obligations) &gt; (digital-space obligations). I just want to give you a heads up that, there's a small number of articles on Software Engineering (as a disciple). Since the wiki doesn't have a dedicated SoftEng project, you might wanna take those under the CS blanket, thought i'm sure that George Parnas/Ian Summerville would have me thrown in the PDP-01 Hell for saying so&#160;;) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProject2501a_7385.html" title="User:Project2501a">Project2501a</a> 11:13, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the heads up! Ideally, at least in IMHO, SoftEng would be covered by an Engineering WikiProject. But there doesn't seem to be one. And besides, let's be honest, most of the people who would be involved in such a project wouldn't have the first clue how to deal with SoftEng. So I guess it makes more sense to bring SoftEng into the CS fold. Hopefully there are a few of us with engineering backgrounds who can make sure that the "engineering" part of SoftEng doesn't get lost in the process. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 16:46, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Thanks for the hearty welcome to the project; I'm glad to be here. Why do you think it is that most of CS Wikipedians are theory people? Very strange — not that I'm complaining. --<a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgreenbe_c499.html" title="User:Mgreenbe">Mgreenbe</a> 22:53, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it's because academics (or theory people) have more free time&#160;:-) Alternative answers might be that the practice people just haven't found us yet, or that they're just more interested in contributing to things like language-specific projects. Speaking for myself, my interest in theory is as much about seeking ways to apply it in practice, as it is developing new theory. But then, my background is in engineering... --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 23:58, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for the delay in responding: I'd be happy to be involved, though I'm trying to put as much of my effort into the logic articles (will try to start to logic wikiproject myself soon). I don't have much of a feel for whether trying to inject new life into the old project or starting a new one will work out better, but the former is probably less work and if it doesn't work out you can try your original plan. --- <b>Charles Stewart</b><sup><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChalst_00d6.html" title="User talk:Chalst">(talk)</a></sup> 03:13, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for getting back to me. I've now gone the "former route", and it seems to be working out ok so far.

<dd>I am sorry if you see my comments with regard to phrasing as personal attacks. They are certainly not meant that way. I have not judged you personally, or claimed that you are a poor writer. I have simply pointed out <i>specific phrases</i> that seem overly complex or unclear to me, and tried to either suggest alternate phrasing that (in my opinion) make things clearer, or ask you to provide an elaborated version of what you are trying to say so that we can work on a clearer way of saying it. I have similarly had other people suggest improvements to my own phrasing, when it has been less than clear, on this and many other articles. In my mind, it is simply part of the collaborative process of refining the text of an article, and one of the advantages of the Wikipedia system. I am sorry if you don't see it that way. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 19:29, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No problem ... if you check the talk on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computing_2546.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computing">Wikipedia:WikiProject Computing</a>, I proposed the same two articles there, and also the issue of implementing Sarbanes Oxley. I personally do not have a good grasp of what is considered <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> anyway. I learned my application programming trade after dropping out of College (couldn't make the grades) in the 1960's, then after I had worked in several different industries, managed to get back to College, this time to use the courses I had got good grades in, as collateral to take every class in computing that was then offered in academia. I was then not interested in the semantics, but in practical theory and technique, then I was back into application programming again. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:56, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One of the grievances by an editor at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_basic_computer_science_topics.html" title="List of basic computer science topics">List of basic computer science topics</a> was over what belongs in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> and what belongs in computing in general. I wonder what is the purpose of some articles like this, which makes the most sense for navigating what other articles exist on Wikipedia within a general concept:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Categories</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Portals</li>
<li>Main articles with templates for bottom of related pages</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Well perhaps I need more Wiki editing experience before I comfortable with trade-offs between the approaches. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not really sure what the best solution for navigation is either. It strikes me that there may not be a "best". Different approaches are going to work better for different people. As far as what's considered computer science, the precise definition is vague, but a good rule of thumb is probably "tools and techniques for creating and analyzing software, as well as the underlying theory of software creation and analysis". As I mentioned on the WPCS talk pages, I think that the current <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> article gives a pretty good overview of what is considered CS these days. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 16:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, from a cursory inspection it's pretty clear that the evidence provided for the first assertion doesn't actually back up that assertion (grammar fix&#160;!= "removing improvement" - in fact, I was going to make a similar edit, but you got there first), nor is it a personal attack. That pretty much blows a big hole in the second assertion, which depends on the first. A quick scan of the evidence presented for the third assertion makes it pretty clear that
<ol>
<li>you weren't the only editor reverting Dz's (drastic) changes (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompsci_07b4.html" title="User:Tompsci">Tompsci</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPowo_5c2a.html" title="User:Powo">Powo</a> were also obviously involved)</li>
<li>Dz was doing as much reverting as anyone else</li>
<li>the talk page reverts were valid, and explained in the edit summary.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'd guess (based on the template edit summaries, and the timing of his first edit to add evidence) that Dz got annoyed with the little conflict you two had over the template, and decided to hit back. I can't imagine that <i>any</i> of these assertions will do much to sway the ArbCom, so I'd just ignore them for now. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 04:20, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can look at it as a hit back, but that is your way to filter the messages. There is a lot of discussion and a lot of viewpoints that can be brought up in endless debates, but there are those that come to wikipedia to actually discuss the views and explore ideas. To prohibit such discussion is against the very foundation of open content and Wikipedia itself. It happens, and there are those who can work together. Do you want to work together?

<p>The way you formulated it is also used in <a href="http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/isbn/0521658691" class="external text" title="http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/isbn/0521658691" rel="nofollow">Milner’s book</a> on the topic, but, for what it’s worth, I do not quite understand why it’s useful. Isn’t concurrency intended to be expressed as <i>process</i>, vertical bar, <i>process</i>? And, since <i>P</i> is the non-terminal that describes all processes, wouldn’t the most straightforward way to write that be <i>P</i>|<i>P</i>? I know it’s generally a good thing to use the same notation as the textbook does, but in this case, I find the indices confusing, not clarifying, for anyone familiar with *BNF but not (yet) with π-calculus. To disambiguate further from the use of <i>P</i> and derivatives as variable/process names, how about the following?</p>
<center><img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/3/8/b38f07d40f5632ada97e899a6d9d356d.png" alt="\begin{matrix} \mathit{proc}&#160;::= &amp; x(y).\mathit{proc} \\     | &amp; x \langle y \rangle.\mathit{proc} \\     | &amp; \mathit{proc}|\mathit{proc} \\     | &amp;&#160;!\mathit{proc} \\     | &amp; (\nu x).\mathit{proc} \\     | &amp; 0 \end{matrix}" /></center>
<p>The advantage would be that <i>proc</i> isn’t used anywhere else in the article, so the concurrency syntax would be easy to read, and the disadvantage, of course, that it’s not quite the same notation as used by Milner et al.</p>
<p>On a related note, in his book, Milner defines a separate non-terminal for <i>x</i>(<i>y</i>) and <i>x</i>&lt;<i>y</i>&gt; and defines sums as part of the process syntax. Should I <del>plagiarise from there</del><ins>put that into the article</ins>? —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 21:45, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was mostly trying to find something that would be consistent with the discussion of the meaning of the productions that appears below the BNF syntax (where it becomes necessary to differentiate between the concurrent processes). I like your suggestion of using <i>proc</i> in the BNF though. Then we can use <i>P,Q,R,...</i> to refer to specific processes in the following discussion without generating too much confusion. I may rewrite <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communicating_sequential_processes.html#Syntax" title="Communicating sequential processes">Communicating sequential processes#Syntax</a> in the same form, just to maintain some consistency among the presentations of different process calculi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's not obvious to me why the sum was left out of the syntax. Certainly, Milner includes it in the original presentation, and Sangiorgi includes at least the guarded version in his PhD thesis (and also provides a separate non-terminal for <i>x</i>(<i>y</i>) and <i>x</i>&lt;<i>y</i>&gt;). So I'd support adding sums to the syntax. Not sure how I feel about separating out the communications events. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 22:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
