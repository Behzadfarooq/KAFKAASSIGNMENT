<p>i got another question why does the RIAA site says that DEATH ROW/INTERSCOPE as the label?i have the album and i can not see the the interscope logo but he says this in the booklet One love to Death Row, Interscope and ...etc. so i'm really puzzled about the labels. it says the following below of the back of the album:</p>

<dd>Which part of that do you consider POV?

"27 track hip-hop tour de force" is frankly idiculous. It is a legendary and nearly diamond album, but "tour de force" never belongs in a description, let alone as a substitute for a pronoun.

<li>Referencing online news sources that Wiki readers can actually <i>look</i> at is preferable to only "The Source, August 2006". And if magazines that have no electronic compnent are to be references in any context, a proper citation should be made. See <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>.</li>
<li>Calling it the "highest selling album in hip hop" is patently untrue. Any number of news sources, including the one I cited that you deleted, will confirm that All Eyez on Me is the <b>second</b> best selling hip hop record of all time.</li>
<li>"Diamond Album" is not a proper noun and should not be capitalized.</li>
<li>Saying "rivals" consider All Eyez on Me one of the greatest rap albums of all time is a shakey proposition. Tupac is not a universally worshipped figure in the music, even among sympathetic critics.</li>
<li>Saying it "<i>has become</i> an influential album" is an unnecessary use of the perfect tense. It <i>is</i> an influential album.</li>
<li>Reverted extreme POV language.</li>
<li>Mostly I'm just reverting an unexplained revert that re-introduces poorer organization and bad sources, without explanation. When you edit an article, particularly when one is performing a mass revert of new content, writing and sources, it is considered polite to provide an edit summary.

<p>Although I do agree with some of your edits, I believe your edits have lowered the quality of this article. Of course there was some stuff that needed to be removed. I have never read the entire article.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>All Eyez on Me</i> is not a Diamond album, and it has not sold 9 million copies. It has sold 7 million copies and that was confirmed in a recent issue of The Source. Your source for sales is by far outdated. The article was written in 1998.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Saying that people "Consider" it to be one of the greatest albums is not POV language and it is completely true. There is no need to downplay success <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a> 20:28, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wait, your source is newer and it says <i>less</i> albums were sold? The Yahoo article is older, true, but easily corroborated. You can use the link <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> provided to check the RIAA website. <i>All Eyez On Me</i> has in fact sold 9 million copies and was certified diamond. And the fact that it is the second best selling rap album ever is notable and does not deserve deletion. (And again, "Diamond Record" is <b>not</b> a proper noun, and does not get capitalized.) Perhaps the Source just has bum info.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No one is downplaying success. There appears to be a small consensus about "greatest album" and "tour de force" here--from myself, <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksta_x_bf48.html" title="User:Yanksta x">Yanksta x</a> and Habnabit--that it is POV language. Calling something unequivocally "the greatest" is like saying "the best", which, again, is something Wikipedia does not do. Cite critics, please. Not one's own opinion. And really, there is no single article in Wikipedia that should ever contain the phrase "greatest album ever".</dd>

<p>9x Platinum means it sold 4.5 million copies. You deleted a lot of content from the article that is perfectly legitimate <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a> 23:05, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>RIAA says it did. RIAA trumps other sources on albumn sales; they are regarded as an authority. Terminology and phrasing you can work out here on talk; but 9 Million is the sales figure from the most reliable source. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 10:33, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That was last updated in 1998 and a credible source says otherwise <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a> 12:22, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I mentioned before, the article I referenced <i>is</i> from 1998, but its information is backed up by the contemporary stats on the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp" rel="nofollow">RIAA site</a> that <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> provided a link to. I reckon their stats are the most authoritative in this case. Also, 9x platinum is indeed 9 million records. See <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_certification_8715.html" title="RIAA certification">RIAA certification</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although that article introduces a whole <i>new</i> level of confusion, as it says a diamond album = 10,000,000 sales, which I think we can all agree <i>All Eyez on Me</i> did not reach, right? <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 21:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>All Eyez on Me</i> is a double album, therefore 500,000 = 1x Platinum. That means 9x Platinum equals 4.5 million sales which is not only a well known fact, but it states it right in the article. So in the June issue of The Source they said it sold over 7,000,000 copies meaning it would be Diamond (14x Platinum). The RIAA stops updating sales of old albums unless you pay for a recount <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a> 03:07, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice if you had mentioned the whole double-album reckoning thing from the start! Just for a future FYI, this isn't a general rule for ALL double-albums, just ones with a total running time over 100 minutes. e.g. the new Christina Aguilera record, while a double album, does not qualify. Also, I still don't trust the Source's figures vs. the RIAA's website, sorry. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 06:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You actually think that sales figures that haven't been updated for 8 years are accurate? Please. The Source is a very respectable reference, plus Danny Boy said that it sold 7 million (who get's an accounting) <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a> 21:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a>, we're <i>all</i> right! Seriously! Here's the thing:</p>
<p>Because of a quirk in its reckoning of album sales, the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_ae97.html" title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</a> counts each sale for a double-album longer than 100 minutes <b>twice</b>. Because they're more expensive and contain significantly more material.</p>
<p>So, technically, only about 4.5 million units of <i>All Eyez on Me</i> were sold. But it <b>was</b> certified 9x platinum for being the equivalent of 9 million sales. See also <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_certification_8715.html" title="RIAA certification">RIAA certification</a>.</p>
<p>Part of me feels like this is cheating, though. There are any number of more contemporary rap artists who've sold a hell of a lot more than 4.5 million records. So calling <i>All Eyez on Me</i> one of the "best selling rap albums ever" rings a little false. How to integrate this into the article? <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 22:15, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Major kudos for figuring this out.

<p>Hey there License2Kill, I trust you read <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a> before reverting my tag. The sentence that reads "The album has become one of the most influential albums in hip hop history and is often considered one of the crowning achievements of 1990s rap" is loaded with weasel words. Its without question the best example of weasel words I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Lets start with "one of the most influential" - Well who has it influenced? Who has said "This album influenced me". How can we quantify if more people have said that about this album versus any other album in hip hop history? Did a great many major publications (Rolling Stone, Spin, Source, Vibe, XXL, Blender, etc) call it "one of the most influential"? If so, we Need to source that. It may be many peoples opinion that this is true (hell, its my opinion that its true), but to put it in an encyclopedia article, we need a poll to prove that.</p>
<p>Moving on to "is often considered one of the crowning achievements of 1990s rap" again, according to who? is there a plethora of rap artists clamoring to crown albums by other artists? Has anyone of note actually called it a "crowning achievement" ever? For this statement to be encyclopedic it needs as many sources to prove its point as the word "often" indicates.</p>
<p>But how often is often anyways? Setting aside the fact that it is physically impossible for something to be "often considered" (a person either considers it a crowning achievement or he doesn't, he doesn't often think it is but sometimes think it isn't. The correct term would be widely, but that, of course, is another weasel word), does it indicate like 50 people think that? or 5000? 50 million? most important artists? all important artists except Bad Boy veterans? I personally don't think its even the best 2pac album, doesn't that make the statement wrong?</p>
<p>A statement like this CAN NOT exist unless there is a source with people actually saying this. Thats what WP:WEASEL is all about, and thats what this whole paragraph repeatedly violates. I count 6 weasel phrases in just this sentence, I've pointed out three so you get an idea what I mean. FYI: The worst offender is where it says "Tour de Force" - that definitely cant be said without a source.</p>
<p>The whole article badly needs a rewrite. Every sentence in the first paragraph except the last one makes at least one major grammatical error, usually by leaving out words. The fourth sentence is especially bad, starting with "Although the album has sold more than seven million copies", but never saying what the "Although" is referring to - what did or didn't happen?</p>
<p>I hope you understand now why I added that box, and why I'm gonna have to go ahead and rewrite parts of the article tomorrow.--<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a>|<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECastAStone_a48a.html" title="User talk:CastAStone"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no need to put this on my page, stuff like this is discussed in the articles talk page. You are getting far too literal with this, as another admin once said, there is no need to downplay success. The album is one of the top selling albums in hip-hop, of course it is one of the most influential. Try reading the featured article, <i><a href="../../../i/l/l/Illmatic.html" title="Illmatic">Illmatic</a></i>, there is no source for "today one of the most celebrated and influential albums in hip hop history." I will add sources though <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicense2Kill_10ad.html" title="User:License2Kill">License2Kill</a> 05:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
