<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_NekoDaemon_f220.html" title="Edit section: Pearle perspectives">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pearle perspectives</span></h4>
<p>Well, this definitely overlaps a lot with what <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPearle_6f07.html" title="User:Pearle">Pearle</a> does now. I having working code to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an article to a category.</li>
<li>Remove an article from a category.</li>
<li>Change an article from one category to another in a single edit.</li>
<li>Depopulate an entire category.</li>
<li>Move an entire category, including intro text.</li>
<li>Add the {{cfd}} tag to a page.</li>
<li>Remove the {{cfd}} tag to a page.</li>
<li>Maintain proper ordering for category, interwiki, stub, and other tags. (This was a non-trivial parsing problem, and this code is used by all of the other editing commands.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have found that there are certain complications that do crop up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many times there are mistakes in specifying the desired command, or weirdnesses in the names or contents of pages (including special characters) that cause execution to fail with an error message. Many errors are intentionally fatal, because bad input on the first line is often a good indication that subsequent input lines are also bad, and the early warning prevents undesirable edits.</li>
<li>Some edits require human followup. Instead of capturing terminal output and examining it, I have taken to tagging articles and then checking Category:Pearle edits needing manual cleanup and the like.</li>
<li>Category-frobbing operations and batch operations in general generate a considerable amount of server load. Some batches take a long time (on the order of hours) to run, because there is a lot of artificial delay, to allow the servers plenty of time to service human editors.</li>
</ul>
<p>My general advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>A big, red "emergency stop" button would be a good idea.</li>
<li>I like the idea of posting errors and completion notices to user talk pages.</li>
<li>The "undo" feature is an excellent idea. It may not be necessary to maintain verbose logs on a wiki page. As long as there's a way to select which command should be undone, most of the rest of the information that humans need to see is accessible from the "User contributions" page. The bot could simply store "undo" information on local disk instead of a "really hope no one changed it" wiki page.</li>
<li>Design the input interface so it's hard to make massive errors, and avoid command-line-like syntax. An HTML form with a "from" field and a "to" field might be better than a special Wiki page for this reason. That way, you don't have to worry about whitespace, and you can provide immediate validation. On the other hand, it makes authentication against Wiki user harder. (And you could squawk about input errors to their talk page, anyway.) A CGI-powered HTML interface might also reduce complexity in dealing with race conditions, edit conflicts, unexpected changes, etc. Certainly some sort of status reporting mechanism is necessary.</li>
<li>The ability to queue multiple batches would be nice. That way, if there is an error with one batch, it can move on to the next. This would also enable multiple users to queue sequential requests. You're pretty much going to have to have a queue of some kind, because a lot of "umbrella" requests that are basically long lists of changes are punted to the CFD bot.</li>
<li>You will have to be careful not to allow cleverly crafted user input to compromise the machine that the bot is running on, circumvent the authentication mechanism, or cause undesirable behavior that could affect Wikipedia operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to user authentication and security restrictions...</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_policies_0ded.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion policies">Current policy</a> requires that all categories being moved or deleted be listed on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>. However, because of the complexities of how nominations are made, especially the large batch moves that require bot assistance, it is not possible to automatically verify that a category has been listed there. It <i>is</i> possible to automatically require that a page have been previously tagged {{cfd}} or {{cfr}} or whatever, and to print a fatal error message explaining that this is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that at some point a human is going to have to look at WP:CFD and decide what input the bot should get to implement any given decision. On the one hand, it's good to keep this as open as possible, to prevent a backlog of requests from piling up. On the other hand, it's important to keep the bot out of the hands of vandals and people who don't cooperate with the CFD process. For similar reasons, people who want to operate bots have to get approval from this page. So I would agree that unrestricted access would be a bad idea.</p>
<p>My advice would be to start with a relatively simple authentication model, and add complexity only if problems occur. I can think of three different mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow access by authenticated Wikipedia administrators.</li>
<li>Allow access by authenticated Wikipedia users on a special list.</li>
<li>Allow access by anyone, but run commands on a 24-hour delay, to allow others the chance to veto execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps some combination of these would be optimal. Personally, I'm not an administrator, and I do clear out a great deal of old and complicated WP:CFD requests, so I'm hoping some kind of mediated access for non-admins will be allowed. I do actually like the idea of a 24-hour delay, because I have certainly made spelling mistakes and misinterpreted people's suggestions before, so a little pre-publication peer review might be a good thing. But on the other hand, it's not like there isn't plenty of peer review after the fact, and an "undo" feature would make the difference somewhat smaller.</p>
<p>I would be happy to share my existing code base to speed up this project, or to give advice about a re-implementation, including how to avoid complaints and behavior deemed undesirable by the community. In fact, it would be nice to pass this rather mundane janitorial position on completely to another party or a community project, and move on to more interesting things. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 07:31, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about we use a combo? An offsite request is made using a CGI form somewhere where the bot can access and the request is static. Then a Wikipedia subpage somewhere is confirmed by the requesting user and signing it. The file name of the request should match the subpage name. Based on checking the history, a confirmation can be given on who request it and the like. Also, it can match the authorization methods that I suggested above. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:07, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm...I wonder if embedding an HTML form <i>on</i> a wiki page would make things easier. In any case, I'm merely trying to make suggestions to simplify your job and making using the thing as easy as possible. Whatever sort of interface you see fit to code is fine with me. It's certainly better to have a simple thing that works than a complex thing that's halfway finished. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:42, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
