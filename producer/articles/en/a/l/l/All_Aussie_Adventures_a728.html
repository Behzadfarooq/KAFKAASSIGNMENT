<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Aussie_Adventures_a728.html" title="Edit section: Genre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Genre</span></h2>
<p>The outback-adventure genre is a television genre achieving some success in Australia, beginning with the iconic series of the <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leyland_Brothers_9b8a.html" title="Leyland Brothers">Leyland Brothers</a> in the 1970s. The format generally involves a host travelling throughout the outback and meeting "characters" of outback life, while providing insight into the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flora_%28plants%29.html" title="Flora (plants)">flora</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauna_%28animals%29.html" title="Fauna (animals)">fauna</a> of the country. Perhaps the most famous exponent of this genre would be the "<i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile_Hunter_434b.html" title="Crocodile Hunter">Crocodile Hunter</a></i>", <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Irwin_a65f.html" title="Steve Irwin">Steve Irwin</a> (although Coight's activities are usually closer to the activities of The Bush Tucker Man, Malcolm Douglas, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Butler_29ea.html" title="Harry Butler">Harry Butler</a> and Albie Mangels). The closest comparison, however, is certainly to Troy Dann, host of the similarly titled "Troy Dann's Outback Adventures."</p>
<p>The genre is often the target of cynicism. Much of this comes from the stereotypically "blokey" culture of the outback portrayed by the hosts, such as Irwin's frequent usage of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_slang.html" title="Australian slang">Australian slang</a>. The focus of most of these shows is on the male aspect of the outback, with <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drover_%28Australian%29_386c.html" title="Drover (Australian)">drovers</a> and farmers being the major characters met.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narration.html" title="Narration">narration</a> (typically provided by the host) often verges on <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a>. This is primarily because the hosts are not often experienced television personalities, and are unsure of how to handle themselves on the screen. Attempts at having more experienced personalities front these shows often results in incongruous appearances of hosts more well-known for hosting quiz shows or news programs, such as former <i><a href="../../../s/a/l/Sale_of_the_Century_bf19.html" title="Sale of the Century">Sale of the Century</a></i> host <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Ridge_580d.html" title="Glenn Ridge">Glenn Ridge</a>.</p>

<p><i>All Aussie Adventures</i> follows a relatively predictable format. Coight greets the audience and explains his latest reason for needing to travel through the outback as a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_guide.html" title="Tour guide">tour guide</a>, often his need to help out a "mate", and introduces the episode with the tagline "So let's get started on another <i>All Aussie Adventure</i>". The delivery of this line is designed as a parody of the "sincerity" of television hosts and has become something of a catchphrase among devotees of the series.</p>
<p>The remainder of the show consists of Coight's travels. He meets friends, encounters animals, sets up camps and provides information on the history of the area through which he is driving. He eventually arrives at his destination and ends each show with the line "We've seen some pretty special places and met some pretty special people", another catchphrase of the series.</p>
<p>The episodes generally end with a collection of "<a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-take.html" title="Out-take">out-takes</a>", although the point is often made that there is very little difference between these and what made the show.</p>
<p><a name="The_Russell_Coight_character" id="The_Russell_Coight_character"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Aussie_Adventures_a728.html" title="Edit section: The Russell Coight character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Russell Coight character</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps the kindest adjective for Russell Coight is "<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accident.html" title="Accident">accident</a>-prone". Invariably, if something can go wrong for him, it will. Coight is a naturally outgoing man who, unlike many of his colleagues in the genre, is reasonably comfortable in front of the camera (he even showers in front of the camera).</p>
<p>Often one may unintentionally get a personal insight into Coight. He is single, although he had a wife who while he says is "completely over her", is obviously missing her dearly. A disclaimer at the end of the particular episode tells her to log onto bigcoight.com to regain contact with him. One, by watching the episodes, also discovers some dubious qualities, such as his card for the local Adult Video store, and that he is known to frequently bring some 'blue' magazines into the bush with him.</p>
<p>He has a sister, Meredith, who is unseen, although is credited for everything from being a Crocodile tamer to stunt-coordinator. In one episode, "Daintree", she is heard singing dreamily a somewhat dubious song, "Daintree", apparently off her album "Daintree", from the Daintree label.</p>
<p>The series is presented as if Russell Coight were a real person, eschewing on-screen credits for his portrayer Glenn Robbins. Following the success of the first season, comedian and talk show host <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_McManus_ffb9.html" title="Rove McManus">Rove McManus</a> interviewed Russell Coight, who provided information on his (fictional) background (An apparent big fan and co-host, one <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Robbins_fdfc.html" title="Glenn Robbins">Glenn Robbins</a> was not present that night). The only mention of Robbins in the series appears at the end of the credits, when he is thanked "for his assistance".</p>
<p>"Wallaby Jack", a similar character from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Show_%28Australian_TV_series%29_458d.html" title="The Late Show (Australian TV series)">The Late Show</a></i>, is thought to be a precursor to the Coight character. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Gleisner_f26f.html" title="Tom Gleisner">Tom Gleisner</a>, a writer for both series, points this out in <i>The Late Show</i> <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary.html" title="Audio commentary">audio commentary</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Sight_Gags" id="Sight_Gags"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Aussie_Adventures_a728.html" title="Edit section: Sight Gags">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../s/i/g/Sight_Gag_4dd6.html" title="Sight Gag">Sight Gags</a></span></h3>
<p>Much of the humour of "<i>All Aussie Adventures</i>" is contained in the sight gags. Coight attempts to set up camp in most episodes, which gives rise to some or all of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tent.html" title="Tent">tent</a> falls down (either as it is being erected or with Coight in it)</li>
<li>The camp stool falls over (generally with Coight either in it or attempting to be, however see below)</li>
<li>The fire burns out of control (frequently burning either Coight, his clothes or his tent)</li>
<li>A tree-branch falls onto something (generally either the car or the tent, occasionally Coight)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything worse than this is generally only hinted at. One episode features Coight making a camp stool out of wood by filing one log to a point and placing a flat round log on top of it. In the process of preparing to sit on it, he knocks the top log off, leaving a sharp point. The camera cuts just before Coight actually sits down, leaving the viewer to draw the obvious conclusion.</p>
<p>Other sight gags involve cars. Coight is frequently required to film a scene in which he stops his car at such an angle that his window is level with the camera in order to talk about the area he is driving through. Filming such a scene generally results in Coight either stopping too early or too late - and cursing as he attempts to get it right. Similarly, Coight's car inevitably rolls away from him to great embarrassment or disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Coight is also prone to finding broken down cars on his travels and attempting to help the drivers. Coight always refers to these people as "complete <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galah.html" title="Galah">galahs</a>", or "unexperienced cityfolk", usually within hearing distance of them. His failed attempts to correctly hook the two cars together with a <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snatch_strap.html" title="Snatch strap">snatch strap</a> invariably result in the broken down car's bullbar or Coight's rear bumper bar being pulled off. Typically, Coight's 4WD recovery antics are contrary to everything which experienced 4WD users would do in that situation.</p>
<p>His attempts at recharging batteries or fixing tyres have explosive side effects. In one instance, he actually reverses his car into the same mud hole that he is trying to get the other traveller out of. The one time that a car is actually fixed by Coight, he ends up completely stoned on marijuana laced biscuits.</p>
<p>One particularly memorable scene features Coight paying a surprise visit to the home of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kernaghan_ddcf.html" title="Lee Kernaghan">Lee Kernaghan</a>. He gets out of his car and knocks on the door, only to see Kernaghan's car speed out of the driveway and away.</p>
<p>Another source of visual humour is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniden.html" title="Uniden">Uniden</a> <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-way_radio.html" title="Two-way radio">two-way radio</a> Coight carries with him. Coight generally gives a lecture on how to use this piece of equipment or how important communication is in the bush, only to have it not work correctly. In one episode, he uses what he claims to be "the emergency frequency" only to be talking across a conversation by two other people (who are not impressed Coight is in on their conversation), while another episode features a memorable dialogue with a station owner who constantly begins speaking before Coight has finished - rendering his instructions inaudible.</p>
<p>Coight also regularly suffers from <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>, especially when he is sitting in a quiet idyllic pool, whereupon bubbles inevitably rise to the surface. Likewise, when bending over, he will occasionally pass wind.</p>
<p>Coight is also fond of saving indigenous Australian wildlife and historical Australian sites. Of course most of these scenes conclude with Coight unintentionally killing or destroying the animal or location.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Aussie_Adventures_a728.html" title="Edit section: Stock Footage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stock Footage</span></h3>
<p>Another source of humour is the frequent use of stock footage in incongruous situations. The most well-known example of this is the "handshaking shot".</p>
<p>A common feature of this genre is for the host to "introduce" the viewers to a "mate", possibly a station owner or another Outback character. The host greets his friend and shakes his hand, with the handshake itself often being shown very close up. In the "All Aussie Adventures" version of this shot, the closeup of the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handshake.html" title="Handshake">handshake</a> is patently not of Coight and his friend, rather of Coight and someone else from an earlier episode. When Coight shakes hands with an indigenous Australian, the closeup will show two white hands. Conversely, when he shakes hands with a white Australian, the closeup will show a black and a white hand. This serves to highlight the artificial and constructed nature of this sort of television series banter.</p>
<p>Scenery footage is often re-used in the different episodes. People unfamiliar with the areas Coight "travels" possibly won't know, but people familiar will certainly know, particularly if they see bits of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a> when Coight is far into the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a>.</p>
<p>Some obvious errors have been made. In one episode, Russell gets a call from a woman with a blocked septic tank. He proceeds to use an excavator belonging to '<a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerilderie.html" title="Jerilderie">Jerilderie</a> Excavator Hire' (based in southern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>, near the Victoria border) when Russell is supposedly in north east <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Aussie_Adventures_a728.html" title="Edit section: On-Camera Bloopers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">On-Camera Bloopers</span></h3>
<p>While the show traditionally ends each episode with a collection of outtakes, there are many shots throughout an episode which would otherwise be classed as outtakes, if it were not for the deliberate parody being employed.</p>
<p>One such example is Coight's interview with two shearers, one of whom is constantly hawking and spitting very loudly. An exasperated Coight is forced to interrupt his own interview to tell the man to stop - which he does not. A similar setup is employed in another interview scene, where the subject instead spends most of his time scratching his crotch, resulting in a <i><a href="../../../s/o/t/Sotto_voce.html" title="Sotto voce">sotto voce</a></i> remark from Coight that "You've been touchin' yourself all interview. Can you knock it off?". Others include a subject that communicates entirely by farting loudly, and another who uses many censored expletives.</p>
<p>Another frequent source of such bloopers is the friendly greeting exchanged by Coight and his friend. Often, the friend will get Coight's name wrong - calling him "Rick" or "Roy" rather than "Russ".</p>
<p>There are also many scenes in which Coight is supposedly "catching up with an old friend" where clearly the two have very little to say to each other. Coight's attempts to elicit stories of bush life often meet with little success - either the interviewee is unable to think of anything to relate or he begins a long and detailed story that has to be cut in the interests of time.</p>
<p>In one episode, Coight comes to the aid of a national park ranger friend to deal with a crocodile. The two men are seen standing at the side of the waterhole occupied by the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile.html" title="Crocodile">crocodile</a>, with the ranger making vague hand gestures towards the water. This scene is shown with the faintly-audible instructions being given to the ranger by Coight of "Alright, now point to the water...good". This is again a parody of a common shot in this genre of television.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Aussie_Adventures_a728.html" title="Edit section: Attempts At Humour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Attempts At Humour</span></h3>
<p>Coight often attempts to make jokes with his friends during the programs. Unfortunately, most of these fall flat, providing even more humour for the viewer.</p>
<p>One interview is with an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Aborigine</a> who is educating Coight on finding "bush tucker". Coight attempts to tell the joke about being on a "seafood diet...I see food and I eat it", achieving absolutely no reaction from the friend. The aborigine himself is about as dubious as Coight, rejecting all Coight's ideas on "bush tucker", and telling Coight that the outback is filled with wild bananas, out of season at the time.</p>
<p>Another famous scene features Coight talking with a group of shearers. To begin with, the scene appears to be of banter before the men begin shearing, however the shearers greet every statement of Coight's with uproarious laughter. An irritated Coight asks, "Are you guys going to laugh at everything I say?" (laughter). "Stop it. It's really annoying" (more laughter).</p>

The (fictitious) credits and warnings</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As in all outback adventure programs, Coight makes use of a voiceover to provide a sort of commentary on his adventures. It is in this aspect of the program that much of Robbins' skill in characterisation can be seen, as the Coight character is clearly unsuited to this activity. The voiceover is always upbeat, and does not display any of the stress Coight endures.</p>
<p>Episodes are introduced with tautologies such as "Australia is a land as vast as it is big" or "Australia. A Land as ancient as it is old".</p>
<p>Commentary is often given about the native animals seen in the episode, however, this is often completely incorrect. In the episode dealing with the crocodile in the waterhole as referenced above, Coight can be heard describing the reptile as "the giant <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marsupial.html" title="Marsupial">marsupial</a>". Another time, a camel is referred to as a beautiful tropical fish.</p>
<p>Another memorable line deals with the statistic that seven of the ten most deadly snakes in the world can be found in Australia. In an attempt to simplify this fact for the viewer, Coight progressively ties himself in rhetorical knots. One rendition of the statistic suggests that "seven of every ten snake bites are in Australia", with another one turning into "If you are bitten by ten poisonous snakes in Australia, then...no, that's not right" and so on.</p>
<p>The natural landscape is also the source of much commentary and more proof of Coight's problems with the language. Attempting to describe the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Mountains_0565.html" title="Blue Mountains">Blue Mountains</a>, Coight delivers the cult line "But what they lack in height they make up for in elevation".</p>
<p>Coight also attempts to discuss the explorers who had travelled the country before him. The historical facts delivered here are somewhat dubious, however that is not the source of most of the humour.</p>
<p>One explorer is described as having discovered the (real) <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Disappointment_858b.html" title="Mount Disappointment">Mount Disappointment</a>. Coight explains: "He named it Mount Disappointment after his wife". Coight explains the naming of the Mitchell Track: "The Mitchell Track, named after its discoverer, Mitchell Track."</p>
<p>After attempting to help out a person with their car troubles, he destroys the car by accident. The next shot is Coight driving off and Coight describes the destruction of the personâ€™s car as "problem solved" as if he had actually fixed their car.</p>
<p>Another adventurer was apparently faced with the choice of pressing further into the bush or returning home to his wife (at which point a picture of an angry woman appears on the screen). Coight tells the viewers that "He decided to press on".</p>
<p>A group of "savage Aborigines" features in one story, complete with a photo of such people. The photo actually shows a group of modern-day Aborigines smiling placidly for the camera.</p>
<p>Another pair of explorers is said to have taken <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a> with them on their journey. While this was a normal enough practice at the time for pain relief among other things, Coight re-tells the story with both men getting high on the drug.</p>
<p>Coight also attempts in one episode to talk about the Polish explorer <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawel_Edmund_Strzelecki_5785.html" title="Pawel Edmund Strzelecki">Paul Strzelecki</a>. Unsurprisingly, this name causes him to become tongue-tied.</p>
<p>Possibly Coight's most dubious attempt at storytelling outback explorers would be of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Cook_c624.html" title="Captain Cook">Captain Cook</a>. If you believe Coight's version of the story, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Cook_c624.html" title="Captain Cook">Captain Cook</a> discovered Cooktown, Queensland on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a> (a confusion with <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abel_Tasman_12d3.html" title="Abel Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> perhaps) on the Endeavour, depicted by Coight as a 19th Century <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> steam paddle boat.</p>

<p>Russell: "Our journey will take us north into central Australia, just east of the north-eastern border of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Russell: "Someone who knows more about bush tucker than anyone I know is an old mate of mine by the name of Greg Stewart."</p>
<p>Russell (speaking to the parent of a 14-year-old girl): "And I'm fully qualified to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Not that I will. Unless I have to. But I won't, you know... there's a woman coming with us that can do that. Not that I approve of girls doing that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Russell: "I learnt everything I know from my father, Russell Coight senior, who passed on all his knowledge to me before he died of a combination of sunstroke, snakebite, and a self-inflicted axe wound."</p>
<p>Russell: "Accompanying me will be Helena, a Swedish swede from Sweden, and Tom, a Scottish divorcee whose wife left him for an IT consultant."</p>
<p>Russell (telling a joke at the bar): "I'm holding this five metre croc and some American guy comes up and asks 'Is it tame?'. 'Is it tame?' I said. 'It's tame alright. It'll eat off your hand...right up to the elbow'."</p>
<p>Russell: "Later that night it was time for the elbow to go up...on the bar...of a pub."</p>
<p>Russell: "And with a few beers under the belt, it was time to put the kids back in the car and hit the road."</p>
<p>Russell: "Saltwater crocs live in salt water, as the name implies. But they can also live in fresh water, which the name does not imply and it just goes to show how they should not be trusted."</p>
<p>Russell: "Another outback sunrise and it was time for this Aussie traveller to do the same...rise."</p>
<p>Russell: "Some of these animals are nocturnal, others only come out at night."</p>
<p>Russell: "Some crocs can grow up to twenty feet...but most just grow four."</p>
