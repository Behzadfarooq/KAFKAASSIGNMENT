<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally_McBeal_%28character%29_c37b.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Ally is the daughter of George McBeal (played by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Naughton_1285.html" title="James Naughton">James Naughton</a>) and Jeannie McBeal (played by <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Clayburgh_1303.html" title="Jill Clayburgh">Jill Clayburgh</a>). She claims to have at least one sister although this sister is never seen (not even in the occasional flashbacks). She used to have a sister who died at the age of five.</p>
<p>Ally attended <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_School_e417.html" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a> with Billy Thomas (played by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Bellows_caf1.html" title="Gil Bellows">Gil Bellows</a>), with whom she had had a relationship since they were eight years old. Billy, however, left Harvard to go to another law school, thereby breaking Ally's heart. The next thing we know about Ally is that she lives with district attorney Renee Radick, and she is employed in a Boston law firm.</p>
<p>Ally quit the law firm because her boss harassed her and was then recruited by old classmate Richard Fish to join his law firm, Cage &amp; Fish. To her own surprise she found out that Billy, now married to fellow lawyer Georgia, also worked at Cage &amp; Fish. She immediately fell in love with him again, to the horror of Georgia. However, Ally and Georgia became friends and Ally learned to work side by side with Billy.</p>
<p>Throughout the series Ally dated lots of men. Due to the fact that Billy remained the love of her life, no relationship ever got serious until she met Dr. Greg Butters (played by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_L._Martin_cf07.html" title="Jesse L. Martin">Jesse L. Martin</a>). Greg and Ally got quite serious until the two were spotted kissing by Billy. Billy felt so jealous that he imagined himself to be in love with Ally after which he declared his undying love for Ally. The two subsequently engaged in a short affair, which Ally finally broke off. Nonetheless, Greg broke off the relationship after finding out.</p>
<p>Ally started dating again, finally meeting a British lawyer named Brian Selig (played by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Dutton_ea75.html" title="Tim Dutton">Tim Dutton</a>). The two started dating and ended up having a six-month relationship (untroubled by Billy, who had by now died of a brain tumor). When, after six months, Brian asked Ally to move in with him, Ally realised Brian was much too boring for her and then broke off the relationship.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, she fell in love with fellow lawyer Larry Paul. The two started a serious but rocky relationship. Troubled by the fact that Larry had an ex-wife with whom he was still close, an ex-girlfriend (played by <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famke_Janssen_ce86.html" title="Famke Janssen">Famke Janssen</a>) who was also the mother of his child and the fact that Ally did not trust Larry, she ended the relationship after a few months (initially Ally was supposed to get married to Larry at the end of season 4 but when actor <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Downey_Jr._2376.html" title="Robert Downey Jr.">Robert Downey Jr.</a> was arrested on drug-related charges and sent to jail, the network fired Downey, thereby canceling the marriage storyline).</p>

Also, in <i>Just Friends</i> Ling said that she should not pursue a relationship with John Cage as "She wasn't sure she was even interested in women" which Ally immediately denied, yet she seemed to respond when Ling used Richard's knee pit technique on her.</li>
