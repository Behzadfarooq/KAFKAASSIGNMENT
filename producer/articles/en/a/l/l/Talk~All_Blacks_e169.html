<p>I think we should try and make the history section more <i>chronological</i>. Just reading it, it jumps from the Sout African rivalry back to the 1880s and the development of a legacy. Allblacks91 16:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>After looking at doing some edits to it today I agree. It goes from talking about South Africa in 1921, 1937, 1956 and 1996 to talking about the 1888 tour by the British Isles in the next paragraph. I propose that the history section be rewritten in a more chronological manner. For someone unfamiliar with the All Blacks it would be terribly confusing as is. - <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 04:18, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed "Some say that the All Blacks greatest opponent is their own legacy." 'Some say' makes this statement inappropriate. If someone has a quote from someone notiible that says something similar, then by all means add it. Eg. 'Former All Black Joe Blogs once remarked that the All Black's greatest opponent is their legacy' (cited reference). But for now I think the statement should be removed. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 07:56, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You originally criticised it because it was "a handful of lines and looks kind of random/scrappy/out of place". Now you wonder how much can possibly be written about it. What? What exactly are you on about? Nothing more can be written about it. Nothing more needs to be written about it. It is concise, accurate, all encompassing and informative. It is a true oddity, a quite amazing record unique to the ABs. It justifies it own little mention because of all of those reasons.

<dd>Err mate, calm down. I can have as many criticisms as I wish. If little can be written about it, then obviously its notability to demand its own heading is dubious. Im a huge rugby fan, and I have not really ever heard of it, only really through the wiki article. Thats not to say it is not notable, but I thought it may have been written in by an Aussie or something, and noone took any notice of it, and it just stayed there. What am I on about? I thought having a few lines about one event did not look too good, and I had my doubts if it deserved its own heading. Unless its notability (to uphold its own heading or sub-heading) can be proven, I think it should be merged. Why? Because it looks stupid and out of place. And I dont know what your problem is (<i>Some people apparently prefer large chunks of text</i>...?)

<p>It is mentioned in the history section that the All Blacks narrowly missed out on a Grand Slam tourin 1972/73 by drawing with Ireland.

<p>I think we need to get the lead sorted out first, it currently reads like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All Blacks is the name of New Zealand's national rugby union team. Rugby union is New Zealand's national sport and hence All Blacks selection is considered a high honour. The All Blacks are a formidable power in international rugby union, possessing a winning record against all rugby nations. As well as winning the Rugby World Cup in 1987 they have been Tri Nations champions seven times (in the 11 year history of the tournament) and have twice (in 1978 and in 2005) completed a Grand Slam (wins over England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland) tour of the Home nations. They are also current holders of the Bledisloe Cup, contested annually against Australia. They are currently the number-one ranked team in the world.[1]They are also the 2006 International Rugby Board (IRB) Team of the Year.[2] Their name dates from the first tour of the United Kingdom by a New Zealand national rugby team, the Originals, in 1905–1906. According to Billy Wallace, one of the members of the Originals, a London newspaper said the New Zealanders played as if they were "all backs". [3] Wallace claimed that due to a typographical error, subsequent references were to "All Blacks". This is likely myth however, as the name also describes their playing uniform of black shirts, shorts and socks.[3] Block quote</p>

<dd>I agree with most of that however I don't think there is too much of an emphasis on current holders of what etc. The fact that they are IRB team of the year is very important, as is their rank and the fact that they hold the Bledisloe Cup. You may want to do the rewrite yourself Cvene64 as you have a good idea of how this should be written. - <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 10:59, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I checked it and added a reference. Also changed Autumn internations to November Tests as it's Spring in NZ when they take place (I think calling them the Autumn internationals is a bad idea on wikipedia).

<dd>I have a couple of problems with this. One is that it will need to be updated after every test. The next is that it doesn't give any information about their position and province.

<dd>it does not have to be updated after each test, (in the French versin) it is completed by a list of other players who recently played test matchs (in november). A team is more than 15 players anyway, for example Piri Weepu is in the added list. As you have seen there are links for each players, so all information about the provinces ... can be found easily and are updated. Up to you, you could have both the present table and a typical team for test matchs. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDingy_0c61.html" title="User:Dingy">Dingy</a> 01:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with mentioning that is that this is really only an overview of All Blacks history. At some point, when I get time, I'll created the article All Blacks history. When that is created we can go into a lot more detail. There is a lot more info on both the 1976 Olympic Boycott and the 81 Tour in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_Springbok_Tour_f969.html" title="1981 Springbok Tour">1981 Springbok Tour</a>. Which is linked in the article. Also, much of the 81 Tour stuff isn't just about the All Blacks, but also the provincial games (which falls outside the scope of this article). - <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 21:14, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
