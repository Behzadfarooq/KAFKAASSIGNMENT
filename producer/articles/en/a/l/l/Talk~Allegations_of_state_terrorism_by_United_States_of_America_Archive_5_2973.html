<dd>Sorry but "Allegations" just isn't a "weasel word", it's not on the list of weasel words, can't be, and never will be - it's a noun that describes a definite article.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 02:51, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes it is a weasel word that takes away the authority of the act. And it is on the list and it is in the style guide. Only when used to describe a crime by a person should it be used. In this case, it opens the door for all sort of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> because it just has to be "alleged" and not real.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 03:06, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>See the coversations below, and the hard work of Lisa. There seems to be a constructive comprimise toward a viable name change which we can <b>all</b> agree with, so thankfully, the argument over whether "allegations" is a weasel word appears to now be moot, and we can move on, agreeing to disagree.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Effects of name change to "political violence" - and an alternative suggestion</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to get an idea of the effects that the proposed name change would have on the article before 'voting'. As this is a non-trivial ponderance, I have broken this out to it's own discussion. Next to each TOC entry in italics is my opinion of the change's effects, and as an experiment you will find, under each entry, my one-line summary (occasionally in a comic style) of the text:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Definition and the term American terrorism <i>- obviously is going to change significantly</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Best entry here talks about the CIA and covert acts against hostile states, otherwise focuses on the name itself</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1.1 Criticism of the term <i>- most likely will be dropped</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Probably a very good argument for renaming</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 Allegations
<ul>
<li>2.1 Latin America
<ul>
<li>2.1.1 Cuba <i>- one of the more strongly terrorist-refering sections</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>CIA training of covert/paramilitary groups mostly</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>2.1.2 Nicaragua <i>- whilst true, does not fit well with either title</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hello CIA operatives and their training of groups again...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.2 Middle East <i>- seems to suit the new title</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>CIA and others helping paramilitary groups</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>2.3 Western Europe <i>- parts political but not that violent</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A quote - "covert policy of training partisan"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>2.4 Court Cases <i>- supports more the new title</i>
<ul>
<li>2.4.1 Nicaragua vs. United States <i>^</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unlawful use of force by supporting guerrilla forces</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2.4.2 Yugoslavia v. United States <i>^</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Refering to a military action better covered in the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo_War_c7a9.html" title="Kosovo War">Kosovo War</a> article</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.5 Other allegations of American terrorism <i>- would vanish under new title</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Poor collection of points linked only by the term, and not their content. Would be worth removing, really.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 References</li>
<li>4 Further reading</li>
<li>5 See also <i>- unrelated, but... why <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>?</i></li>
<li>6 External links</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm seeing that a change of title is needed, but it's not political violence. Almost all the core sections talk about <i>covert acts by the US against other nations</i>, and I suspect a less cludgy version of that will be exactly what we want - clearly defined, and covers most of the current article's spirit (and allows us to use references to state that some call such acts "american terrorism"). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I dont understand, are you advocating we change the name to one that matches only one specific definition of terrorism. Further the Nicaragua thing does not call it terrorism at all, they also specifically state the US was not responcible for the acts of the rebels. The accusers did not file terrorism charges but charges of unlawful force, which was their funding of those rebels, not participation in any actions. There is a big problem basically unless sources are provided that state terrorism specifically and actually contain someone making the allegation. The straw poll was nice but still elaves a burden of proof in sources. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 02:17, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am suggesting that we eliminate the word terrorism in it's entirity. it serves no purpose, as the examples being given are majoritively those of covert actions or support of paramilitary groups. The article should have a name accurate to the intent of the content (and vica-versa, but in this case the content indicates a different title). I'm suggesting a <i>radical</i> rename with virtually <i>no significant effect</i> on the content itself. The references are all there to support a title implying covert acts, and no inferance will ever be needed. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:22, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Covert actions of the United States? Perhaps Alleged illegal activities of the CIA? That last one I like most as it can then include things like COINTEL Pro, right cointel = CIA? etc. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 02:24, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Cointel was FBI turns out, so maybe Alleged illegal activities of the United States. Kinda long but easy to source as the person doesnt have to be saying they did terrorism, just something illegal, that means the court cases are automatically included since they themselves are accusations of illegality. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 02:25, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, not bad. How would <i>Alleged illegal activities by the US</i> effect the sections on Cuba, the Middle East and Western Europe, however? These talk mainly about allegations of terrorism and sabotage, which whilst they probably would fall under the remit, one could be pedantic about it. Perhaps the leading section would detail that allegations of terrorism and support of groups performing illegal actions should count? We're getting somewhere!&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:54, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well terrorism is illegal, as for sabotage that may be illegal. All in all as long as someone is alleging illegality its fine. So if Alarcon is saying the US commited an illegal act by sabotaging XYZ, then it works. I think its safe to assume terrorism is illegal, so any direct allegation of terrorism would be an allegation of illegality. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 03:00, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looks like we're almost there, then. The big question is, however, can we find a means to remove <i>alleged</i>, as this is a <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel word</a> of sorts, and the article would seem stronger if this was avoided. A quick search by prefix, though, shows us to be in good company&#160;:P <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 03:38, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You can always remove alleged but it then cuts down on what can be added, removing alleged makes it a statement of fact and then removed the ability to add allegations, things like the court case can stay in, but items that have not be proven factual, meaning courts deciding they are illegal is then up in the air. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 08:22, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think we will ever get a 100% unanimous consensus.

<dd>Apart from a possible use of "Alleged", which can be avoided by a title such as "Covert actions of the US against other nations", we actually seem to be reaching some form of a consensus here based upon what the article covers. To be quite frank, "political violence" is too loose a term, almost a weasel word in it's own right as even the article <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_violence.html" title="Political violence">Political violence</a> has to acknowledge that there is no formal definition. Any use of this will be entirely POV. I really don't see your problem with the new suggestions that avoid 'alleged', other than the fact they are new. If I'm missing something major here, please say. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:06, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is all nonsense. "Political Violence"??? *ALL* acts of violence perpetrated by a Government are "political violence" -- including wars of aggression, wars of defense, policing actions, the prosecution of political parties and cliques (McCarthy era, anyone?), and whatever else one can think of. Labelling this page "political violence" is essentially the same as renaming it "Violence by the United States"; what's the point? The original entry dealt with a specific *type* of violence; that would be the use of violence not to gain specific logistical ends, nor in the defense of the nation, but instead the use of violence to instill terror in civilian populations so as to force certain polling-booth results and/or treaty concessions from a greater power. Calling the page "Political Violence" is rather like renaming a page explaining sodomy "Human Sexuality" -- and less relevant.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 07:17, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Addendum: Moreover, the title "Political Violence..." would leave the article open to including such facts as the Kent State Massacre, the Cointelpro activities of the FBI, the various political assassinations during the late '60's/early '70's for which J. Edgar Hoover is largely considered responsible, the history of the U.S. Labor Movement and how it clashed with State forces throughout the 1800's and up into the mid-1900's, and so on.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 08:10, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry I dont think you understand how sources work. You cannot include an incident then into an article on political violence unless the source specifically calls it that. Hence the idea for simple illegality. You would also be hard pressed to find a definition in line with yours for political violence as it seems partially like your own concoction. We do not do our own research here, meaning you cannot start an article on poltiical violence and define it yourself, then add items that are not being called political violence by the sources themselves. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 08:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><i>Covert actions by the United States</i> sounds like a "new analysis or synthesis of published arguments, concepts, data, ideas, or statements that serves to advance a position." Is this going to be a list? I only see about 150 google hits for the phrase. Is this a subject people have written about? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 21:32, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concede that the disambig page for <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_action.html" title="Covert action">covert action</a> takes us to <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_operation.html" title="Covert operation">Covert operation</a>, hence the article name should be Covert operations by the United States or similar. No OR is needed to state any of those, if you simply look through the article, almost all the referenced entries are refering to such things (as I summarised above). "Covert operation" gets 433,000 google hits, and the article on the subject itself clearly defines it, as do the references already in this article. Searching for the exact phrase would be foolish, as the exact phrase isn't the best of copywrite, but if we search for both "Covert Operation" and "United States" and eliminate forums and blogs, we get a rather nice <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Covert+operation%22+%22United+States%22+-wikipedia+-forum+-forums+-board+-boards+-bb+-ubb+-blog+-blogs&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Covert+operation%22+%22United+States%22+-wikipedia+-forum+-forums+-board+-boards+-bb+-ubb+-blog+-blogs&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">60,000 web hits</a>.

<dd>I guess someone could write <i>US covert operations</i>, but that would be a different article. Some of the material now here could go there.

<dd>It seems to me the problem is in the selection and aggregation of bad things America has done, presented as factual. The issue is not so much the title, as the original research by synthesis. It looks to me like the assemblage we have now is well described by the title we have now, or maybe by <i>American terrorism (term)</i>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 23:24, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tom, if you look through all the parts to the article as it currently stands, only the yugoslavia bit is <i>not</i> about covert operations. So I really don't see how this makes this article <i>not</i> about covert operations by the US. Any such article would infact be almost the entirity of this article, anyhow. I beg you to put aside your attachment to the current name, and consider simple compromise solutions that allow the article to remain almost unchanged, and better fit the material within. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 23:33, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not want the article to remain unchanged; I want it to improve as it conforms to our policies about original research and verifiability, as it must if it is to exist at all. The article as it is now only presents things thought to be discreditable to the US, with the added 'bonus' of implying US hipocracy in calling anyone else a terrorist. The article as it is now is an <i>example of</i> how "American terrorism" is used in contemporary discourse. It could instead be <i>about</i> how the term is used, as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism_%28term%29.html" title="American terrorism (term)">American terrorism (term)</a> was for some time. I have no sentimental attachment to the present title, or to any other. As it is, and as it might develop, it is well described as <i>Allegations of state terrorism by [the] United States of America</i>, or by <i>American terrorism (term)</i>. It is not well-described as a sober encyclopedic discussion of American covert operations.

<p>The whole issue of this page is to show how the use of the word "terrorism" by U.S. government sources is as equally and legitimately applicable to activities that are sponsored and initiated by the U.S. government, but are rarely mentioned or addressed in the U.S. media or educational institutions. With the current debate following its current line, the original page will be entirely effaced by a series of pages that in no way whatsoever address the original issues raised by the original page. 125.232.200.224 05:57, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where did you come up with this? "rarely mentioned or addressed" seems to imply "poorly sourced". That is never the intent of a wikpedia page and the problem with the title. It is very difficult to find a consensus for what constitutes terror, therefore including anything on this page implied that it was terrorism even if it was contested.

<dd>The term 'Covert Operations' is too broad and inclusive and as a result an article with this title would need to include US Covert Operations such as the CIA planned/executed coups in Iran, Guatemala, Chile, etc.<a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 02:23, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I susepct that there are editors that would consider those actions "terrorism" so what is the difference?

<p>I totally oppose the name change. The idea of a "covert operation" is not something to which i am ethically or morally opposed; "terrorism" is. This simple fact demonstrates that the two ideas are only analagous in a very shallow and irrelevant way, and so to change the name of this article to "covert operations by the United States" is to change the very purpose of the entry. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And to address the nonsensical assertion made above: to wit, that "encyclopedia entries" "don't have a point" -- where in the world is this "person" comin' up with these ideas? OF COURSE encyclopedia entries have a point! It's called the title of the entry! When writing an entry about, say, the color Blue, one doesn't put in pictures of the color Red and Yellow and make the claim that they're all the same just because they're colors. Similarly, when explaining the concept of "State Sponsored Terrorism" and how it does or doesn't relate to the United States, one shouldn't be putting in WWII special ops missions (i.e. -- "Covert Ops by the U.S.") and/or 1890's era labor violence (i.e. "Political Violence by the United States") and start claiming that these "compromises" somehow represent the same ideas. They don't. Anyone who argues otherwise is not interested in seeing the topic explored in the way the creators of the page intended. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The simple fact is that "State Sponsored Terrorism" is a term that was popularized by the U.S. Dept. of State and the British Foreign Office, and now that the term has taken hold it is perfectly legitimate to explore how this term does or does not apply to those two countries (or any other, for that matter). In our arguments over the title, we have completely lost track of the simple fact that this entry was created to explore how a term that is routinely heard on U.S. and British nightly news does or does not describe the governments of those same two countries. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me restate that once again: the term "State Sponsored Terrorism by the United States" is and always has been meant as an exploration of how the idea of "terrorism" does or does not apply to the United States. If you don't think the term jusifiably applies, then fine: write part of the entry and clearly explain -- through popularly available research and analysis -- you arrived at your opinions. In order for us to properly represent this topic in its entirety, then *both* sides of this issue need to be properly represented. Unfortunately, there is a junta of people who do not like to see the word "terrorism" used in reference to *any* acts of the United States, regardless of the amount of evidence and documentation to support such a judgement. These people want to change the title because *they are offended by it*, when in fact their response should be to *document evidence that shows how the term is inaccurate*. Unfortunately, we have a crew of very lazy and self-serving ideologues here, each of which finds it more entertaining and satisfactory to force the page to remain in its current ambiguous state rather than doing the intellectual and moral heavy-lifting to present a solid case for why it's inaccurate or incorrect. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Finally, this page is not merely about current events! There are libraries of books which demonstrate beyond any shadow of a doubt that terrorist tactics were used by the people and government of the United States from its very first founding moment, and by its people's ancestors even long before that. I'll be happy to post some of those long- and widely-accepted historical conclusions once the page is able to be edited again; unfortunately, if we change the title to something like "Covert Operations" or "Political Violence" then we are no longer discussing the topic which this page was initially established to elucidate. We will instead be capitulating to the whimsy and self-congratulatory malaise of right-wing ideologues who can't accept that an ethnically neutral term like "terrorism" does not in fact imply "people other than us". <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And this is aimed directly at "zerofaults" -- encyclopedia articles most certainly do have a point. They are a place where basic research and understanding of a particular topic can be gained, and from where further research may be undertaken. The point of this page was -- and if i have any say in the matter, will remain -- how the term "State Sponsored Terrorism" can or can not justifiably be applied to the activities of the United States. It is my sincere hope that my children, their friends, and future generations of schoolchildren, university-level historians and political scientists, interested adults and all manner of curious people will be able to look at this page and learn more about why people -- both foreign and native -- say that the U.S. itself engages in terrorism. Without such a page, the protests of people around the world will remain a cypher for the average american hobnobber: people like the Filipinos -- who are currently seeing about 80 major journalists murdered a year, and about half of those by the U.S.-supported, trained, and financed Filipino military (which is itself responsible for two coups of state in the last 10 years) -- and the Indonesians (Aceh, Timor, Suharto); and the Iranians (1952 coup, anyone? 30 years of a brutal, U.S.-trained secret police state?); and the American Indians, and Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, the Vietnamese, and a multitude of other peoples have, can, do, and -- if events continue to spiral out of control like they have these last 6 years may *well increasingly* -- accuse the United States of violent acts widely considered to be terrorism.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When people hear these accusations, they should be able to turn to their encyclopedia and ask "What in hell are they talking about?", and our beloved compatriots, living as they do in the "land of the free", where our "right to free speech" is a deeply cherished part of our very identity, should be able to expect a rational, reasoned, well-documented analysis of exactly what these charges consist of and why they have been made. Indeed, in a land where the right to free speech and open expression is presumed, such a transparent and forthright analysis is *expected*. Consequently, i absolutely refuse to back down on the issue of this page's title. It must as closely adhere to the former title's intent as possible, so as to best serve the needs of the Wikipedia community's queries. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In other words, when someone types in a question: "Has the United States ever engaged in terrorism?" -- a perfectly legitimate and honest question, that might be asked by any child or concerned adult -- then Wikipedia's response should be to point them here. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If at that point the title of the page they get is "United States Covert Operations", then the person will be only confused and frustrated. "I didn't ask about covert ops! That's spy stuff! I want to know about terrorist acts!" Creating confusion and frustration is not the **POINT** of an encyclopedia entry, regardless of whether zerofaults'd like to dissemble that it is. It's high time we returned the page to proper editing status, and began to resolve these issues within the intended scope of the original page: State Sponsored Terrorism by the United States, Terrorism Sponsored by the United States, Terrorist Acts by the United States or its Agents, The Use of Terrorism by Agents of the United States, The Use of Terrorism by the United States, Acts of Terrorism and United States Involvement, United States Participation in Terrorist Acts, or some other such permutation.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zleitzen if you feel so strongly that there is plenty of sources to be presented stated specifically state terrorism, the please provide them for the entire article. The problem is there are not sources calling the events terrorism for most of them, almost none of them calling anything state terrorism either. If you fel you can populate all the sources for the article then go ahead. However since the AfD I believe 3 sources have been cooked up and all of them attributed to Alarcon ... not really enough to supported the WP:RS idea of claims on that scale needing multiple sources. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 09:31, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hate to be a spoil sport since Lina's solution is so effective in getting many to agree. There should be a US international covert action article. In addition, so as avoid the charge that WP is a US gov't apologist, we should follow the other "terrorism" articles as Zleitlin points out and have this "terrorism by US" article. There are such articles for other major countries, there is one called "state terrorism," so there should be one for the US too. The sources already cited in this article provide more than sufficient support for the examples provided in the article.--<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 17:42, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem as I keep pointing out is sourcing an article on terrorism. The sources has to meet WP:RS and WP:V and specifically accuse the US of terrorism. This means saying John Doe that works for the CIA is a terrorist, is not eligible for inclusion, cause they are accusing John Doe, not the US. The article is also stating a specific type of terrorism, state terrorism, the difference in the end I couldnt tell, however the source should be alleging state terrorism specifically then, or accusing the US of being a terrorist state, are they reversible like that? While I do not mind an article on such a thing existing, the real issue to me is sources calling the US a terrorists state, guilty of state terrorism etc, not simply stating the US did bad bad things, not simpyl headlines with terrorism in the topic, but an actual being making an actual accusation.</dd>
<dd>As for the others I have no clue if they are actually filled with valid sources maknig accusations, just from recent news however I am sure there are plenty of examples of Syria being accused of terrorism by Israel. However as state covert operations gets rid of the terrorism dark hole of infinite definitions. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 17:54, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to reiterate, I respect Lina's work and in light of the conflicting opinions, she has done an ingenious job. Will someone (Tom, perhaps) now propose watering down the title floated by Lina to the less threatening "Allegations of covert operations by the United States" and then insist that only if the source recites the magic words "covert action" can the source be cited in support, and even then, only in the form "x alleges that the US performed y covert action." I am not trying to be funny. I am simply pointing out the farcical nature of the process that led to this point: a perfectly legitimate title "Terrorism by the US" was consistent with the other such WP articles (State terrorism, state terrorism by country z, etc.). This is an important topic given the high-stakes war on terrorism now under way. But this was a no-go (too close for comfort for long-cherished sacred cows), so we had "Allegations ..." which some maintained had to be limited to sources and sentences as above-discussed. But that runs afoul of WP rules, so we are urged to move to the more bland "covert action." If I cannot stop this I would like to at least register my opposition and note for the record how we got here.--<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 02:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has to be "<i>allegations</i> of state terrorism by the US". Without it imples universal agreement which is impossible - as it would be for any account of state terrorism including Syria.

<dd>User:Zleitzen, we have consistently attempted to get this name change taken care of, so we can "get back on track", but some wikiusers stubbornly hold onto views about weasel words and refuse to comprimise, even after third party mediators decide those weasel words should be removed (this mediator decision was supported by liberals and conservatives). In addition these same wikiusers hamper building consensus to the point that we will may never be able to "get back on track". Please don't complain about our inablity to stay on track, when you helped get us lost.&#160;:) Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 06:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Travb. You say "we have consistently attempted to get this name change taken care of". Who is "we"? Even the strawpoll supported the original title. You can attempt to resolve your differences with Zerofaults and co via mediation - but that shouldn't compromise this page or the <i>majority</i> of us who have no issue with the present title, voted to keep it and just want to edit notable allegations of state terrorism. If you prefer, start a new page about covert actions and take your dispute elsewhere. But I'm here to talk about allegations of state terrorism. ie - staying "on track". --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 06:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NPOV does not mean we need to have moral equivalence between Syria and the United states. There is a reason why Syria has a terrorism article and it doesn't mean we need a U.S. version of it. How far would you take this logic? Is it unfair that Russia has a "Stalin" and Germany has a "Hitler" but no leader in the U.S. have been identified as a mass murderer of it's citizens? Please. Syria has a strong terrorist component to it's articles in Wikipeida because it has a strong tie to terrorism larger than most countries. Certainly a lot stronger ties to terrorism than the United States. There is no moral equivalence or requirement that the U.S. have a state terrorism article simply because Syria does. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 07:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is going to start looking like a joke if you start adding sentences like William Blum accuses the US of terrorism in conflict X by action Y. Cause most people do not care nor know who William Blum is. Mark Twain is going to seem like a comical reference and most people will just laugh at Chomsky. I no longer object to anything in this article case it seems the people who want it to stay as is are going to sufficiently make it a joke. I reserve the right to over turn this later.

I am saying if you want to write a good article on this topic you may want to go beyond. If Bill Cosby said america was a terrorist state, would you include it?

<p>Include Bill Cosby? Possibly. Did he call America a 'terrorist state'? There's a whole section of controversial statements in the article on Harry Belafonte, including these: <i>"In January of 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West which met with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. Belafonte was quoted as saying, "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush says, we're here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people... support your revolution."</i> and <i>"On a Martin Luther King Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte claimed he found no difference between the American government and the hijackers of 9/11, saying, "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?"</i> Why are they there? Because he's notable, and the quotes were notable. I don't believe many people consider Belafonte a respected scholar a la Chomsky or Zinn. What ARE the Bill Cosby quotes you'd like to include, Zero? <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 00:49, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't exactly call Bill Cosby's opinion on Terrorism notable. Bill Cosby as a person is notable but not everything he says would be considered a reliable source. It's not peer reviewed, published in notable journals on terrorism, etc.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 01:06, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not published in notable journals on terrorism? Erm? Anyway. Following up the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_R._Bolton_b6fd.html" title="John R. Bolton">John R. Bolton</a> article it reads:</dd>
<dd><i>In 2002, Bolton accused Cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it "to fully comply with all of its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention."[23]</i></dd>
<dd>Now, most people in the world who read these extraordinary claims found them ridiculous, (they were quickly discredited and downgraded by his peers). Should they be removed? Of course not. They are notable allegations whether people find them ridiculous or not.</dd>
<dd>Read these serious and complex allegations against the UK. They could be worded and sourced better, but the inference and style is correct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acts_labelled_as_state_terrorism_sorted_by_state#Northern_Ireland" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acts_labelled_as_state_terrorism_sorted_by_state#Northern_Ireland" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<p>Zero, the article on 9/11 even includes conspiracy theories - so does the article on the Oklahoma City Bombing, I'm sure dozens if not hundreds of articles do. The article on Iraq and WMD devotes multiple paragraphs to these "wacky theories" - <i>"Rumors from top governmental officials have abounded of possible transportation of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to foreign countries, namely Syria and Lebanon, right before Operation Iraqi Freedom began."</i> If an allegation of US terrorism comes from a notable person, and has some degree of acceptance, it should be included. I look forward to compiling the fiery quotes from Belafonte! By the way, Ronald Reagan's and Arnold Schwarzenegger's political fortunes were due to their 'notability' as actors. Bad actors, I might note. <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 02:49, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are confused. "Terrorism rumors from top government officials" is notable. "Terrorism rumors from top of the chart pop singers" is not. John Bolton is the ambassador of the U.N. His opinion on foreign affairs is notable. His opnion about who the best singer in the world is not notable. Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzeneggers notability in the political arena is due to their political fortunes, not their life as actors. Ronald Reagan's political opinions were not notable until he became a politicion. If Bill COsby becomes a politician and comments on Terrorism, then by all means quote him. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 03:48, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So now you contend that we should include 'rumors' if they come from 'top government officials'?That sentence was referring to Iraqi officials, so you are even arguing that claims about alleged American Terrorism from Chavez and Kim Jong Il need to be included! Perhaps the 9/11 article should give equal weight to ex Bush official Morgan Reynolds, since he was a 'gov official' <i>"Morgan Reynolds served as chief economist for the United States Department of Labor during 2001–2002, George W. Bush's first term. In 2005, he gained public attention as the first prominent government official to publicly state that 9/11 was an "inside job," and is a member of Scholars for 9/11 Truth."</i> WOW! <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 05:14, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recap</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I explained to Zerofaults that the article will be relating notable allegations of state terrorism, regardless of how amusing he finds the subject matter. And that no more arguments or comments are necessary.
<ul>
<li>Zerofaults continues to argue and make comments replying that "the people you are willing to settle for make the argument look silly." - ie. Zinn, Pinter even Belefonte.
<ul>
<li>That he finds Zinn (historian), Pinter (noble prize winner) or Belefonte (calypso singing-household name-<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Irish_origin_e8e0.html" title="List of English words of Irish origin">gobshite</a>) silly isn't a satisfactory argument nor a reason to prevent editing. Therefore we can proceed and unlock the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tbeatty argues "Only Terrorism rumors from top government officials is[sic] notable"
<ul>
<li>The page already carries allegations from top government officials. But of course there is no rule on any page on any subject that allegations need to be restricted to <i>top government officials</i>. For instance, Harold Pinter's allegations are notable by any interpretation of policy as explained above.
<ul>
<li>Again there are no new arguments from Zerofaults and Tbeatty's corner. Again we can proceed. So can we unlock the page and allow users to continue editing as per their reason for being here? I think it's time. If it reassures these users, I'll monitor the page to ensure that claims by non notables, or claims that don't refer to state terrorism in name are removed. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 11:02, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

WP:RS also states that extraordinary claims require many sources, so I hope that are multiple sources for each claim and not just one. Meaning we cannot bypass WP:RS by simply stating Belafonte said XYZ when the subject is the allegations themselves, therefore more then one person really has to be making them and those people have to pass WP:RS. Also the source reporting the allegation has to pass WP:RS as the subject is still the allegationa nd not the person. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 12:28, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Last I knew, that was the original plan months back, before this decended to mediation. And indeed that plan didn't really work, thanks to the need for "terrorism" to be explicitly called out in references. This must be the US, or a department of the US goverment, explicitly being accused of performing terrorism, rather than meerly supporting or protecting terrorists. The other articles on state terror are based on the same premise - since terrorism has almost no definition, we ourselves at wikipedia cannot declare if something is a terrorist action or not. If everyone is willing this time to follow such a plan, then I see no reason why we can't decide now how to strip the article down to such statements. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:24, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The source should define whether it is "state terrorism" or not. See the Syria page, Lina. Backing, supporting or protecting terrorist groups is what the US accuse the Syrians of under their "State terrorism" terminology. Therefore it goes into that page. If a notable accuses the US of state terrorism by backing, supporting or protecting terrorist groups then it should go into this page.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 14:40, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>If a notable accuses the US of state terrorism <b>because they are</b> backing, supporting or protecting terrorist groups then it should go into this page.</i> That is how I think that should read, meaning if the accusations is they are supporting terrorists, that is not an act of state terrorism, nor an accusation of it. The source has to say the US commited state terrorism. Its WP:OR for us to say the US says state terrorism = X so all accusations of X = state terrorism. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 14:43, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. Although in other forms of writing it is Allowable to go "A is B; B is C; Therefore A is C", that is explicitly not allowed under <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Whilst I support some leeway for trivial cases, allegations of state terror is not one of these, especially since terrorism has no real definition. We cannot define that something that there may be cause to allege as state terrorism is alleged as that, unless it infact has been called that. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:48, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I am saying is, if the source says the US is harboring terrorists, that is not an accusations of state terrorism and cannot be included. If the source says the US is commiting state terrorism by harboring terrorists, then that is fine. I believe Lina is saying the same.

<dd>Yes the same thing. Sorry. The U.S. accused Iraq of "State Sponsored Terrorism" because it was "harboring terrorists" -- in fact, the terrorists were just living there, very much against the Iraqi Government's wishes -- and then used that as an excues to **initiate**a**war**. So yes -- harboring terrorists is "involvement in international terrorism" by the U.S. government's own estimation, so it's quite o.k. to say the U.S. government is engaged in terrorism simply by harboring a known terrorist; and when it can be shown that the U.S. government was responsible for supporting, training, or aiding (whether through logistical intelligence or the transfer of materiel) a known terrorist group or actor, then yes -- the United States is in that case, as well, sponsoring and/or initiating terrorism.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is the provenance of this page and the citing editor to make the proper distinctions between initiating and sponsoring, but the efforts of "zerofaults" and "lina" are clearly intended to weight citations down with so much artificial, irrelevant criteria as to make it impossible for there to be any actual, realio, trulio information presented on the page. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The use of the word "terrorism" is by no means a valid requirement, because what is called "terrorism" today was at one time called "vandalism", at others "barbarism", at others "violation", at others "pillaging", and so on. "Terrorism" is a word used to describe a set of acts associated with a certain tactical method; its legal definitions are largely non-existent, and its use as an ethical condemnation is haphazard and chauvinistic. Meanwhile, although ancient writers obviously didn't use the word "terrorism", they would yet recognize our intent. Just as it's ridiculous to make the assertion that ancient times didn't suffer identical tactical and military outrages, so also it's ridiculous to pretend as if the one, consistent meaning in all uses of the term is in fact the least relevant to our current debate. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>After all this is, once again, nothing more than a disingenuous attempt by people who are offended at the association of the word "terrorism" with the entity of the United States. The response we give them should be singular and loud: tough luck. If you don't like it, then present your case on the page. But kindly do so in a respectful manner, limit yourself to the facts which are presented, and leave the title and structure of the page as it stands. If you disagree that this or that act was terrorist in nature, then find analysis that supports your position and put it on the page. Otherwise, act honorably and let both sides present their case. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The biggest problem in this case is that acomplice is a deliberately vague word, ranging from everything but the attack itself, to training people to be able to commit the attack. Much like terrorism, infact. We could agree to a level of inference that is appropriate, but we must be very careful indeed. I am reviewing other state terrorism articles now. <b>additional:</b> <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">state terrorism</a> is really in need of a rewrite, to give appropriate focus to it's equal meaning as <a href="../../../s/t/a/State-sponsored_terrorism.html" title="State-sponsored terrorism">state-sponsored terrorism</a> (should be a redirect). <b>As such, I back down on sponsorship issues - these should be included</b>, as long as we get a rewrite done to <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">state terrorism</a>, and some details proving the interchangability.

<dd>As I said any section not meeting the requirement sof actually containing allegations will be removed 3 days afte protection from the page is removed, giving plenty of time for users such as yourself to source sections. On the first day I will post here articles that do not contain allegations of terrorism, much like I did above. Please see WP:COn WP:STRAW and WP:NOR WP:RS. A straw poll cannot overcome WP:RS and WP:V. Also 4-1 is not a concensus. I know this because i took part in a previous poll and was told by an admin that 23-4 was not sufficient enough to be a concensus. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 13:33, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The title is currently being reviewed by other users, and so it will not make the final cut. The following is a rule I used to determine how to keep or delete a section: <b>Only if a consensus wanted to keep it, the result is 'delete'.</b></p>
<p>SECTIONS TO BE DELETED: Gladio, military operations by national armies (even if considered war crimes by certain units), Vietnam, Wounded Knee, McVeigh, Ba'ath Party, 1980's support for Mujahideem.</p>

<dd>Wait a second here! Wikizach determined that there was 'no consensus' for '1980's support for Mujahideem'. It was tied 2-2, without my vote ( as I got here too late to vote ) and I support INCLUDING this, so please change from 'delete' to 'keep' or 'no consensus', or I will.

<dd>I was the person who added the word "tie", User:Wikizach then determined it was a "delete". I have consistently said that I support anything that User:Wikizach decides. The '1980's support for Mujahideem' section was added the last day or so of the straw poll, so there wasn't really a chance for everyone to decide on this section. I would suggest brining this up to User:Wikizach.</dd>
<dd>But the results of the straw poll are set, please don't modify this graph unless I made a mistake in counting the votes, or applying User:Wikizach decision on total votes. If we allowed you to add your vote, then anyone could come along and do the same, there needs to be closure on this strawpoll. You are not the only person who has came to this page after the straw poll was closed. Lina has contributred a lot to this page, and she came after the straw poll was closed. I am sorry you came to late--your only option is to talk to the mediator, User:Wikizach about this.

<p>OK Travb, but it sounds like Zero doesn't plan on abiding by the results of the straw poll anyway, so why should everybody else be hamstrung by it, if one user chooses to ignore it? Thanks.</p>
<p>Plus 2-2 isn't much of a consensus, AND the inroduction of my Guardian link changes one of the votes to result in 3-1 for inclusion (4 to 1, if my vote were to count)&#160;: <i>"Oppose per Zer0faults unless someone can document an instance of Mujahedeen terrorism while the US sponsored them, ie against the USSR.

<dl>
<dd>"During the Cold War, two more chilling examples of so-called false flag operations have come to light. (False flag operations are covert situations conducted by governments or other organizations that are designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities.) In his recent book, NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe, Dr. Daniele Ganser, a senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies, Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reports that NATO, guided by the CIA, supported terrorist attacks on civilians in various European countries to discredit the left and create fear on the part of the populace."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I found this article and was very happy to find some info what was that about. I searched for Ganser and found op. Gladio. After some reading I moved on the talk page and found out that there is a hot discussion ongoing and some want to remove Gladio.</p>
<p>Why? It's notable. It's something from a recent research. The title of the article is "Allegations..." so if it's not backed up strongly - I don't see a problem with that. imho. Wow, I've just found out that Gladio has it's own whole article! I don't know what are you arguing here so maybe my argument doesn't apply.

<p>I don't think most people who voted in the Straw on Gladio were aware of the specific connection this source establishes between the CIA and the Gladio operations. I would ask people to read the source and the mediator to allow a re-vote on this issue based on the new source brought to our attention. Similarly, while I will abide by the mediator's decision, I don't think it is the intent of this mediator or the purpose of this process to freeze this article for ever in its current form. As new sources are brought to bear, the information in the article should be updated, expanded or modified as necessary. This I thought is so self-evident as to be unnecessary to state, but in view of the above debate between Salv and Zero it seems it bears articulation. I would ask the mediator to respond.--<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 15:09, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="There_are_competing_definitions_of_Terrorism_at_work_here" id="There_are_competing_definitions_of_Terrorism_at_work_here"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">There are competing definitions of Terrorism at work here</span></h4>
<p>There are basically three competing definitions of terrorism:</p>
<p>A) "Terrorism" as a military tactic: This is the usage of the term as a description of a military tactic, typically utilized by small forces, where the intent of military activity is to purposely avoid confronting "hard targets" to instead focus on poorly defended, usually civilian "soft targets". The result of such activity is the spread of fear and undermining of overall economic activity, thereby establishing a deteriorating quality of life for the population in question. "Hard targets", in this instance, would be well-guarded, well-armed, or well-defended installations (usually military or police) where armed resistance would normally be expected. "Terrorism" in this usage strictly describes a tactical usage of violence, and nothing else. Critics of this usage of the term generally contest that all war participates in this sort of activity, and that modern, "Western" (i.e. -- Western European) militaries do not make use of it. Proponents of this usage counter that western militaries do indeed make direct use of terrorist techniques, albeit more rarely than those of third- and second-world nations; they also assert that many actions by modern industrialized militaries wind up having the same effect, regardless of what the stated ethics, aims and motives of the action in question may be, and that in addition many western democracies -- notably france, the U.S, and germany -- have prolifically condoned and supported these tactics in client states, or neighbors. A good example of how this usage can spawn huge disagreements is the debate here over Yugoslavia, where the participation of the United States and Germany in the early part of the war is asserted by some and denied by others, and where the NATO bombing campaign against civilian infrastructure is qualified by some as terrorist in nature, and denied by otheres.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>B) "Terrorism" as an international legal term: this is the usage of "terrorism" as a legally defined and formally argued political concept. Relevant processes include, but are not limited to, the United Nations, the International Court, and various national governments. As a legal term, "terrorism" is widely debated and few conventions -- if any -- regarding its usage have been established. However, the advantage to this term is that it does provide a legal framework and formal standard by which actions may or may not be classified as "terrorist". The disadvantage, however, is that this term has not been widely tested, and so its definitions are widely acknowledged to be poorly representative of the legal concept in play, and overwhelmingly favor wealthy and powerful states. A good example here is the debate over U.S. activity in Nicaragua; it is widely acknowledged that the activities of the Contras were "terrorist" in nature -- from a tactical standpoint -- but disingenuous debaters reluctant to admit U.S. complicity in those tactics consistently shift the terms of debate to "legal questions", thereby sidestepping the well-documented use of torture and the tactical focus on soft-targets to instead argue the finer points of legal interpretation and how they do or do not apply. A good negative example is the debate over the Yugoslavian conflict: virtually no-one here is arguing a legalistic case to refine their understanding of that conflict, while many -- on both sides -- do avail themselves of legalisms to deny that "terrorism" even applies to that conflict in any fashion. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>C) Finally, there is the word "terrorist" as a strictly ethical or moral usage, generally used to contrast entities who have submitted or established a national or legal authority as against entities which have not been sublimated to a national authority, or have not yet established those mandates; this usage often appears in casual conversations with military personnel. "Terrorists" are generally described by military personnel as poorly organized or non-regular forces who are utterly lacking in the ethics and morality which most professional, well-disciplined military organizations share. Similarly, they are disdained as self-appointed tyros who do not accurately represent the will of the population they claim to represent. Critics of this usage, however, point out that "terrorist" organizations like Hizb'ullah and Hamas make accusations against Western and Israeli militaries that are precise relfections of this outlook, except re-interpreted into the culture and economic conditions of the region or culture in question. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most often, however, the usage of "terrorist" as an ethical or moral condemnation is seen in popular media, where the usage is generally applied to reflect the opinions of the media-item's progenitors. In this usage, there is little or no consistent, defining quality except for negative, sub-human assertions. This usage is overwhelmingly apparent in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, where *both* sides regularly use "terrorist" to characterize the activities of the enemy. Another good example is the sub-human, politically emasculated characterization of the 911 bombers as "cowards", "mere criminals", and so on, thus stripping their act of any message or meaning beyond a desire to kill. Likewise, one finds Hezb'ullah levelling the exact same accusations against the Israeli government (and now the U.S, as well). In such cases, virtually no attempt is made to understand or evaluate the opposition's political goals which, despite public denials, are often accepted as legitimate -- if unacceptable -- by the opposing political elite. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The overarching problem with this page is that we have several people and groups of people (like "zerofaults") introducing material based on incompatible and conflicting interpretations of what "terrorism" is or is not. For instance, zerofaults likes to assert that *any* discussion of terrorism *must* be based on "legal definitions", despite the fact that if you ask any formal participant in the International Court or UN, they will each tell you that by no stretch of the imagination is there a widely accepted legal basis for what terrorism is or is not. Moreover, although consensus has been nearly reached on several occasions, it has -- in both the UN and the International Court -- been blocked each time because of protests and vetos largely introduced by the United States and Israel (typically objecting alone, against an overwhelming international consensus, i might add). Since most international court decisions haven't reached a conclusion on these issues, and since competing legal visions would of course all be written in languages other than english, to insist that "legal consensus" be the overarching criterion of inclusion would critically hobble the article, so that it could in effect introduce no material whatsoever unless it was in accordance with the U.S. government's stated position. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Similarly, interpretation A) is often confused with interpretation C), although the two usages of the term "terrorism" are quite distinct. In one, the term is used to describe a set of tactical decisions and objectives; in the other, it is a loose, imprecise use of the term to describe something that is basically distasteful, or on the opposite side of an ethical or strategic line. When i use the term, i consistently use it to describe activities which clearly qualify as tactical techniques and objectives and i make a strong effort to avoid using the term loosely, as is commonly done in popular media, propaganda releases, and even some "scholarly" research; for me there's a very clear distinction between the two usages. If someone feels like these differences in usage aren't sufficiently clear, then let's make some quick modifications and move on (the key being, of course, to move on). For the moment, however, i'll assert that these are basically the three different usages at work on this page and that most of the arguments here consist not in disputing whether or not the events in question actually happened nor whether they were reprehensibly violent, but whether or not they actually qualify as terrorism according to whichever definition one or the other poster here favors. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This situation plays right into the hands of obstinate editors who refuse to allow the association of the word "terrorism" with their idealization of the "United States". For instance, were i to introduce demonstrable evidence that the military utilized terrorist tactics during the revolutionary war -- or during the Indian wars -- the response would be "the idea of terrorism isn't applicable to regular military engagements". My response would of course be that yes, indeed it is, because terrorism is a set of tactics as applied to a military encounter. Another interlocutor would respond that there's no legal precedent, and i would respond that there doesn't need to be a legal precedent because we're not talking about legal issues. There would be an impasse, and an edit war, and then the page gets frozen and nothing would go forward.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point is that we would each be right in our own interpretation of terrorism. I don't know why i should need to remind people of this, but it appears that i must: the beauty of Wikipedia is that we can each add our own insights to the page in question (so long as they are relevant). Once those insights are down on the page, properly represented, then there should be no need for further edit wars. The unfortunate circumstance here, however, is that a group of people *refuse* *to* *allow* *this* *page* *to* *remain*, and the appointed "moderators" are acquiescing to this most extreme and unreasonable demand. It is not necessary. *All* of these viewpoints can be accomadated; the page can be expanded to be however large it must, so long as the viewpoints included are relevant and important. *Both* sides of this conflict can be represented, and there is no reason for the article to presume that accusations of Terrorism against the United States are necessarily true or not. It is a small matter for one person to write an entry on the myriad acts of aggression that the United States has condoned and sponsored against Nicaragua, while another editor adds a final paragraph representing equally well-documented arguments about why, in the eyes of some, these acts don't properly qualify as "terrorism". <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is: the proper challenge against this page is not "That's not a terrorist act!" "Yes it is!" "No, it isn't -- so let's change the name of the page to something different so that we can all just avoid discussing whether or not the event actually was "terrorist" in nature", but instead -- "Many people in ______ view the actions of the United States in this conflict as terrorist in nature. They hold to these conclusions because the United States was obviously supporting ________ in their targeting civlian infrastructure in an effort to erode the social stability and public peace so that __&lt;&lt;put objective here&gt;&gt;__ could be established. Supporters of the U.S. position counter that ________ was not actually a terrorist activity because it was not ________, did not ________, and was ________. Moreover, they assert that __________ are not equatable with __________ because of the inherent structures of command and control."<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's the kind of copy we should be generating. Not this "Political violence by the United States" claptrap, and certainly not "Covert Ops by the U.S.", which is as pathetic a compromise as i've yet seen tabled, anywhere.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Finally, should anyone protest that this is not the place to "define" terrorism, i challenge back that these competing interpretations are more than appropriate on this discussion page, and in fact demand tacit references in the formal article itself; indeed, the discussion page was created to provide a place for just such analysis as this, and i guarantee that if we better structure our discussion and analysis here, then the agreements on the final edit of the front page will become much easier.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wish you would read my posts more carefully. I do not care what definition of terrorism is being used nor who is really saying it, however they have to actually be saying the US has commited terrorism in XYZ. No I will not accept your personal definition of terrorism, those nice large paragraphs that in the end include almost any act of violence. If the source contains a person, stating that the US commited a terrorist act, then its included, I do not care what the sources definition of, however your definitions are WP:OR. So if John Dole says eating banana's is commiting terrorism and then says the US commited terrorism from eating lots of banana's then its fine to be included, as silly as it is. However if John Dole says the US slaughtered lots of banana's to frighten the population, then thats not an allegation of terrorism. It may fit one of the many many terrorism definitions, but its not actually an allegation of terrorism. So stop mentioning me if you are not gonig to get my arguement right. Present a source, the source must have a person, stating X act was terrorism by the US. Not X act was very very mean, not X source was an outrage, but that it was terrorism. Also supporting people who turned out to be terrorists is not commiting an act of terrorism unless we have some source that proves it and then issues the accusations themselves. Meaning we cannot say John Dole says supporting terrorists is an act of terrorism itself, then state John Fry stated the US helped the terrorists in conflict H, so the US commited terrorism in conflict H. That previous example is synthesis of published material, noone is actually making an accusation that the US commited terrorism. So when you present a source, ask yourself if you can answer this. Who is saying it? What makes them notable? So you have a quote of them actually saying it was terrorism by the US?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also its WP:OR for us to define terrorism then apply it to acts X Y and Z. We are not allowed to define things here. Is there really not enough enough people stating that act X was terrorism that we resorted to making up our own definition and applying that to other people. If John Dole said the US commited horrible acts in Nicaragua, then we define that as terrorism, is it right for us to say John Dole said the US commited terrorism in Nicaragua? I am almost positive that would be highly illegal and possibly get Wikipedia in trouble.</dd>

<li>It defines new terms;</li>
<li><b>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</b></li>
<li><b>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;</b></li>

The fact that we exclude something does not necessarily mean the material is <i>bad</i> — it simply means that Wikipedia is not the proper venue for it.

<dd>Terrorism: the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion</dd>
<dd>Corresponds exactly with my definition A), and completely excludes any and all objections you have yet made to the content of this article. Consequently, we should be able to simply eliminate any and all edits by you and lina -- who have obviously gone out of your collective way to weigh down the article with artificial and contrived definitions of what is and is not "terrorism" -- and the article will finally be in accordance with Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:50, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Considering the respect and formality with which you have insisted that we adhere to protocol, i presume that this solution will be as apparent to you as it is to the rest of us; of course you will honorably abide by your own decision, won't you? On that basis, I hereby call on the mediator to declare this "resolution" adjourned, ban Zerofaults from posting on it, and return it back to a responsible set of editors. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:50, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Or, if you don't like that, then perhaps the Britannica Online entry will do:</dd>
<dd>the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective. Terrorism has been practiced by political organizations with both rightist and leftist objectives, by nationalistic and religious groups, by revolutionaries, and even by state institutions such as armies, intelligence services, and police.</dd>
<dd>Whups! Sorry! That sounds suspiciously like my definition A) too, doesn't it!!</dd>
<dd>Wow! This is looking more and more like it's not actually "my" definition, but in fact "THE" definition!!! Gosh, now that we know that will you promise to vamoose and stop defacing this page???? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:55, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, gosh. After looking through those, i thought i'd check out the Wikipedia entry, just to be sure. And look at what i found on the very first line!!</dd>
<dd>Terrorism: Any violent act perpetrated to cause distress in a population. Also: Political Violence.</dd>
<dd>Doesn't that look an awful lot like my definition A)? Lemme hear the "Yeaahhh!"</dd>
<dd>So now we've got: Webster's Dictionary, Britannica, and Wikipedia all agree that my off-handed definition of the term actually allowed for *more* space, for *more* freedom so that you and your cadre could work in peace. But here we are, after hearing you insist that "external definitions shouldn't be introduced", looking my suggestions in the eye, and whadd'ya know!</dd>

<dd>I was doing you a favor!!!! I was actually giving you a nice, cushy environment in which you can expound your ideas without any need to worry about the bother and inconvenience of actually <i><b>adhering to established, public definitions</b></i>.</dd>
<dd>Of course, i'm under no illusion that you're going to take this as an opportunity for personal growth and learn a littl bit about not getting involved with issues you don't understand; so no, i'm not really calling for the mediator to ban you and allow this page to do what it's supposed to do, in peace. Instead, my offer still stands: these three definitions allow more than enough room for you to present your side of the case, and those with whom you disagree (because i guarantee, most of them probably don't disagree with you nearly as much as you think) to represent the rest of the story in as much detail as is necessary. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:02, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On page 41 he says, "By convering up for San Salvador after it had commited terror, Washington was an accessory after the fact. It gave diplomatic support to state terrorism. By trainng and equipping the Salvadoran security forces in, and for, counterinsurgency warfare, Washington served as an accessory before and during the fact." I think later the author blames Reagan for the <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Flood_e368.html" title="Noah's Flood">deluge</a>, so it is probably not a stretch to say he claims that the US has supported terrorism in central America. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 15:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok. I've added the specific references to terrorism on the Nicaragua section from the above sources. The Middle East section is well referenced and the book "All the Shah's men", which is already referenced, goes into considerable detail of the CIA operations and called them terrorism. I don't have my copy of this book handy to find page references, so maybe someone else can look this up. Basically the whole of that book is a documentation of CIA terrorism during the 1953 coup, so I don't see the need for page references anyway. I have removed the Yugoslavia section for the moment. This is because the William Blum book talks about the CIA connections with KLA terrorism and KLA connections with Al Qaeda. However, the Yugoslava vs US case was not about this, but was about the official non-covert bombing. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 16:47, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Can you please source this better, it seems there is no accusation in that specific incident that the US commited an act of terrorism, just that the school is a terrorist training ground. The obvious problem with this logic is saying Afghanistan commited 9/11 because the terrorists were trained there, or Germany did it because the terrorists lived there for a while. I am sure the source you have levels a specific allegation against the US for benig responcible for that incident, if not you may want to break off that incident and instead add a section on the School specifically. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 17:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does he actually accuse US of terrorism, he says they were simply complicit, not actually responcible or in charge of etc. Currently its not an allegation really of terrorism, just in not caring to stop it. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 18:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>He specifically claims that the US payed for it, ordered it, trained the individuals who committed it on US soil, and then rewarded them for thier acts. He uses "complicit" in the legal sense, as in someone complicit of a crime is also guilty of it. Remember, the US is a system and and organisation, not a person. The US itself cannot carry out any acts, as it does not have a corporal existence. He accuses the US of State Terrorism specifically, and infact calls his book "State Terrorism and the United States". <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 18:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True and I will simply let this pass as long as it doesnt become a slippery slope, however I want to point out that the title uses, "and", instead of, "of", which would mean the acts were commited by the US, not simply in relation to the US. We really should not try to assume what an author attempts to say and instead go by what they actually did say. Complicit does not equal responcible for. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 18:48, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Please revert what you changed it to, what is now there, that he said the US was guilty of state terrorism does not appear in the book and is simply your drawn out understanding of it. ITs best left complicit as those are actually the authors words. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 18:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that his words are better. But there should be no doubts raised that the author believes the US simply stood by and watched these events happen on their own. The book's 231 pages make clear the author believes that the United States was deeply involved in the planning and training of acts of state terrorism. He uses the phrase "wholesale terrorism" and concluded that the US population should be informed of the acts of their government. His recommendation is for a South African-style Truth Commission.</dd>
<dd>It is an acedemic work and the author chooses acedemic language and style. This includes using words like 'complicit' and removing judgement from the title, hence the use of 'and' rather than 'of' or 'by'. Get the book and see for yourself.

<dd>Well, this pretty much worked itself out, didn't it? I will say I'm not entirely thrilled to see Zer0faults' arbitration case wielded like a sword nor my name used as a shield. If I had to choose sides I would say that Nuclear was generally right in removing the sections originally and <s>RyanF</s> Travb was wrong to revert them. There is an important difference between an editor believing that certain actions were terrorism and finding sources for evidence, versus reporting the allegations and evidence given in third party reliable sources. It was not originally clear which the article was doing, now, thanks to Seabhcan, it is. Ten days was a reasonable time to wait, and consensus does not trump a core policy like NOR.</dd>
<dd>I do think that this comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America&amp;diff=83416349&amp;oldid=83416148" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America&amp;diff=83416349&amp;oldid=83416148" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> was a failure to assume good faith.

<dd>Allegations, as used for this page would be 1) creditable allegations attributed to a reliably published source; 2) or allegations by a significant party such as another country, the UN, or a promint NGO -even when in the second case the allegations are suspect. Because WP is an encyclopedia, the term “allegations” is not used so broadly as to include any conceivable allegation. You are correct, we have no requirement to prove that the US government actually published the FM, nor is it within our means to prove that one way or the other even if we where intent upon doing so. However, there is considerable doubt as to the source of the FM. The former USSR/KGB had an extensive disinformation program, and the FM could have come from there, as they had a vested interest in producing such documents, or it could be real. In short, it’s not attributable, and therefore not useable, even as an allegation. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 04:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question is whether Dr Ganser's allegation is notable. Deciding this is not an exact science, but we had a vote here a while ago and decided that it was. Dr Ganser published an academic work on Gladio with the backing of Zurich ETH. The allegation is attributable to Dr Ganser. You don't get much more notable than that. Yes people disagree with his conclusions and evidence. These disagreements were mentioned in the section you deleted. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 11:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>“Deciding this is not an exact science, but we had a vote here a while ago and decided that it was.” This would violate <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>, you cannot vote something into WP that would otherwise fail guidelines.</p>
<p>Notability is not achieved on the basis of a research grant. If universities funding in someway = notability…what would not be notable? Universities fund things that they hope will ultimately be notable, that’s why they spend the money, but spending money alone does not equal notability. The outcome must stand on its own.</p>
<p>If Dr. Ganser had gained FM 30-31B through the FOIA, or acquired it through another form where a direct link back to the US Government/military could be established, then it would be useable. We where saying that he “uncovered” it. How? Where is the linkage?</p>
<p>Regardless of Dr. Ganser standing as an academic, the FM has an already acquired history, one that does not simply vanish when Dr. Granser steps into the picture. There where questions already attached to the FM concerning its authenticity, and those questions remain.</p>
<p>The interaction of Dr Ganser with the subject does not raise it to the point of inclusion. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 15:19, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't relevant whether it is or not or whether you think it is or not. I think the Bible is nonsense, but I don't think all mention of it should be deleted from wikipedia. The fact that notable people proport these things and that people agree with them means that we should also include it as one side of the argument.

<dd>The <b>FACT</b> that 30-31B is a forgery is extremely relevant when it is used to bolster a factual argument from a tin foil wear crackpot. No forgery, no evidence, no argument. And for the record, Ganser did not "unearth" jack, 30-31B has been widely circulated in the Turkish and European leftist press for the past 30 years since it was first “discovered” in the Philippine Embassy in Bangkok. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 22:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am unaware of this fact. I am aware that it was been suggest to be a forgery by other researchers. This no more counts as a proven fact than Ganser's opinion that it isn't a forgery. This is wikipedia, we present both sides. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 22:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We most certainly do not provide equal weight to every POV and yes, this one is garbage. It also goes to show the poor level of scholarship on Ganser’s part that he did not mention either the "debate", if one could call it that, behind the documents authenticity nor did he go through the customary step of having it authenticated, a move that would have been easy because Westmoreland’s signature is on the “document” (itself a red flag that it’s a fake) and a handwriting analyst could easily confirm to Ganser that it’s a fake. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 01:19, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, Ganser does address the issue of authenticity, on page 235 of his book. Or perhaps you haven't read it? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 11:36, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>p235: (Its a long section, I'm not going to type it in word of word): Says the BBC investigated the document. Ray Cline, Deputy Director CIA, said "This is an authentic document". William Colby, CIA Director said "I have never heard of it" CIA propaganda expert Michael Ledeen claimed it was a Soviet forgery. Licio Gelli, leader of P2 said "The CIA gave it to me".</dd>
<dd>Do you claim that the book doesn't say this on page 235? I have it here in black and white in front of me. Who are you trying to kid?! <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 15:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Doesnt really sound like its adressing authenticity, at least not in the context you have written it out. The fact that the allegation of a forgery is actually listed there seems to make it a not fully verified document. I think on that basis it shouldnt be included after all. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 18:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That someone suggests it is a forgery doesn't mean it is a forgery. And even if it was, we have a whole article on a known forgery: <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_Diaries_9360.html" title="Hitler Diaries">Hitler Diaries</a>. I don't see how accusations of forgery should lead to censorship.</dd>
<dd>Ganser clearly believes that the document is genuine. Secondary sources quote Ganser on this. And he quotes three people who also believe it is real. To delete reference to this document removes important information. Any reader looking of information on this topic expects to see both pro and con sides presented. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 18:21, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You would consider “that” an overview of the authenticity of 30-31B on Ganser’s part? Of course Ganser believes the document is real, because it one of the key pieces of “evidence” he has to tie his screwball theory together. Interestingly enough, I actually looked at the Allan Francovich’s BBC documentary (The video can be found <a href="http://11syyskuu.net/video/" class="external text" title="http://11syyskuu.net/video/" rel="nofollow">here</a> in three parts towards the bottom of the page), and found some interesting things about Ganser’s sources. Ray Cline said quite clearly that he never saw the document in question and Colby called it horse manure.</dd>

<dd>Among some of the better witness in Francovich’s “crock-umentary” is a “Colonel” (like Colonel Sanders evidently) Oswald LeWinter, former literature professor and now Ex-con. According to LeWinter, he has been everywhere, he was in the Korean War and Vietnam War and was even Deputy Director of Counterespionage for the CIA (a position that does not "officially” exist). According to LeWinter he had ties to not only Gladio, but his super-duper triple secret agent status made him a “key player” in the Kennedy assassination, the October Surprise, and even the CIA’s involvement in the death of Princess Diana. Although this last claim put him jail for fraud after he was caught peddling phony documents about this. Naturally though, LeWinter’s records that could prove his long service in US intelligence agencies and the military have all been destroyed.</dd>

<dd>FYI..... <i>"GUATEMALA CITY, March 10 – President Clinton expressed regret today for the U.S. role in Guatemala's 36-year civil war, saying that Washington "was wrong" to have supported Guatemalan security forces in a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that slaughtered thousands of civilians.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Clinton's statements marked the first substantive comment from the administration since an independent commission concluded last month that U.S.-backed security forces committed the vast majority of human rights abuses during the war, including torture, kidnapping and the murder of thousands of rural Mayans.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"It is important that I state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the kind described in the report was wrong," Clinton said, reading carefully from handwritten notes. "And the United States must not repeat that mistake. We must, and we will, instead continue to support the peace and reconciliation process in Guatemala."</i> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/clinton11.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/clinton11.htm" rel="nofollow">WAPO</a> Admitted to complicity? <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> 05:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>YOu can check through the archives but the majority of editors has gone over this, specifically stating that the source must alledge the US commited an act of terrorism to satisfy this article, as the article is on <i>allegations of terrorism</i>. If you do find a notable WP:RS WP:V source stating its terrorism then feel free to add it, however please add it in the appropriate fashion, Person X in item Y states the US commited acts of terrorism in situation Z.
