<p>This author seems to present a bias that is obviosly not shared by NASA and other scientific communities around the world. The Allais effect is very far from junk science and mention of an article where all experiments for the last 30 years are called ambiguous is misleading.</p>
<p>Read about the 1999 experiment held simultaneously all around the world through the cooperation of NASA and other scientific establishments from multiple countries: <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast12oct99_1.htm" class="external free" title="http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast12oct99_1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast12oct99_1.htm</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If you believe the article does not reflect the mainstream scientific literature, point to a recent published article in a mainstream journal that reports an unexplained Allais effect...I did a literature search and I didn't find any recent papers other than the ones cited.</dd>
<dd>In the 1999 URL you point to, they don't actually have any results yet (they were still analyzing the data); moreover, the two scientists mentioned (Noever and Koczor) apparently <i>never got</i> any results that were worth publishing, because a literature search on INSPEC for their names and "eclipse" or "allais" comes up with nothing. The only thing your URL really establishes is that people were still trying to measure the Allais effect in 1999, and the Wikipedia article already says this (reporting the Wang measurements, which <i>were</i> published...and then refuted.) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<dd>Well an article refuting the Allais effect would have been worth publishing but I haven't found any too. What I found, but only from unconfirmed sources, is that Noever never disclosed the result and resigned from NASA to create his own web company. Some say this is because of mistakes in the conceptions of the experiments. The team didn't know that Mr. Allais was still alive and Allais himself was not aware of the experiments until a few weeks before the eclipse. He is then said to have sent a lot of advices explaining what he thought was wrong in this experiment. This is a voluminous document and it is published on the web (in French only). This is only gossips. It may also be that, having resigned from Nasa, he didn't took time to publish his results.</dd>

<p>The history tab shows that the original article contained no such bias. The bias was added subsequently. I also believe the original article was much more interesting! —<a href="../../../e/t/i/User%7EEtimbo_91ec.html" title="User:Etimbo">User:Etimbo</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right, before my edits, the article was more interesting. It also happened to be false and/or misleading, unfortunately. The original version said, "there is growing evidence that the Allais effect does exist and it is believed by some to represent the only gross anomaly outstanding in the current scheme of physical knowledge." (In fact, the evidence is shrinking in the literature as the recent experiments were refuted by multiple papers, and apparently the only people who still believe it is an anomaly are so far outside the mainstream of science that they don't even publish.) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<p>I have now edited the page to remove confusion between the Allais effect (precession of a physical pendulum), the Jeverdan effect (period shortening of a Foucault pendulum), the Saxl&amp;Allen effect (period change of a torsion pendulum), and the Wang observations (gravimeter readings).</p>
<p>I do wish people would read the references to know something about the subject, before making erroneous edits!</p>
<p>I have also reinserted the reference to the Allais paper, which is a primary reference which should be mentioned, and have inserted and discussed a quotation from the Thomas van Flandern paper, while trying not to be too sarcastic about it.</p>
<p>Moreover, having reviewed all the Wang et al papers concerning their gravimeter experiments, I am frankly astounded at the gross nature of the misrepresentation above. These recent experiments have not been refuted; in fact, I am not aware of any published articles discussing them, except for the Flandern paper which is, to put it politely, unconvincing. Still less have the original authors disclaimed their observations. I have modified the article to reflect the actual state of affairs. Galileo would understand the situation..... Thomas Goodey</p>
<p>Please leave Galileo out of this. This article clearly has a bias towards the Allais effect, which is not even close to accepted by the majority of physicists. Could someone with an in-depth knowledge of this subject edit this page to improve it's neutrality? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrokmoo_388c.html" title="User:Grokmoo">Grokmoo</a> 15:19, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You say the article "has a bias towards the Allais effect". Do you mean towards the <i>existence</i> of the Allais effect?</dd>

<dd>The article concludes with the line "Exotic explanations for Allais and related effects have not gained significant traction among mainstream scientists" which I believe is a beautifully neutral summary of the state of knowlege.

<dd>Hello, Etimbo. While the last line doesn't favor the Allais effect, I fear that it is vague and would not be understood by many non-scientists. The article also seems to be biased towards "the existance of the Allais effect" for its bulk. I'm not entirely sure what to do to fix this, but it would be a better article if the position of mainstream scientists was made clearly and concisely, instead of sprinkled throughout the article. It seems like most of the article favors the Allais effect, with only the occasional rebutal. I think an entire section devoted to the mainstream (and to Allais's) positions would be in order. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrokmoo_388c.html" title="User:Grokmoo">Grokmoo</a> 16:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say, "I'm not entirely sure what to do to fix this". Well if you're not sure, then we're a bit stuck. I <b>am</b> sure that the article is written from a NPOV.

<dd>I agree with Etimbo. The article is clear that the subject is theory, and debated, but at the same time clearly explains and discusses the theory without a bias towards the likliness of its falsehood. Due to the assinine nature of an explaination of theory being viewed as biased in favor of a theory, especially when clearly weighted with claims to its disputed nature, and the stagnation of the NPOV debate, I'm removing the DNPOV tag. -- Corwinoid 08:35, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Blueboar. The guidelines state that "Fringe theories and even demonstrably incorrect assertions like the Face on Mars conspiracy theory can merit inclusion in an encyclopedia by sheer notoriety" and that subjects can be included in Wikipedia if they relate "to ideas which are accepted or at least somewhat discussed as being plausible within major publications (large-circulation newspapers or magazines)". The Allais Effect was the subject of an <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PTDQPNT" class="external text" title="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PTDQPNT" rel="nofollow">article</a> in a large-circulation magazine, <i>The Economist</i>, on 19 August 2004 entitled "An Invisible Hand?", which contains the following passage:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Since that first observation, the “Allais effect”, as it is now called, has confounded physicists. If the effect is real, it could indicate a hitherto unperceived flaw in General Relativity—the current explanation of how gravity works.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, according to Wikipedia guidelines this article certainly should not be deleted. -- <a href="../../../e/t/i/User%7EEtimbo_91ec.html" title="User:Etimbo">Etimbo</a> ( <a href="../../../e/t/i/User_talk%7EEtimbo_e5a9.html" title="User talk:Etimbo">Talk</a>) 23:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAllais_effect_be02.html" title="Edit section: Article is skewed and needs rewriting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Article is skewed and needs rewriting</span></h2>
<p>I don't think it should be deleted; the "Allais effect" is sufficiently notorious, despite not being widely believed, that it deserves a Wikipedia article. However, I do think the article in its present state is misleading. (I tried editing it for NPOV a while back, but eventually gave up trying to battle with proponents.)</p>
<p>For example, I added the Flandern citation, but then it was edited to quote them out of context in such a way as to suggest the complete opposite of their conclusions: since the original experiments of Allais et al. claiming large effects not explainable by simple atmospheric models etc. have never been replicated, and predate the recognition of the need for careful controls in this sort of experiment, Flandern et al concluded that they were most likely experimental errors having nothing to do with gravity (unlike the 2000 Wang experiment, which they argue measured a real gravitational variation, albeit one due simply to conventional atmospheric motion). In contrast, the article quotes Flandern in such a way as to suggest that Flandern "admits" the original Allais observations are still a scientific mystery.</p>
<p>Even worse, the article originally (when I edited it) stated regarding the Wang paper that "however, the same authors later (2002 and 2003) published papers showing how their observations <i>could be explained</i> by conventional thermal phenomena (e.g. temperature and pressure changes and their indirect effects) caused by the eclipse." The article now states the <b>complete opposite</b>: "the same authors later (2002 and 2003) published papers maintaining that their observations <i>could not be explained</i> by conventional phenomena such as temperature and pressure change caused by the eclipse, and that, although tilting of the ground due to temperature changes could, in the extreme, have been responsible, that hypothesis was unlikely." This is totally false, and even libellous.</p>
<p>Also, I should point out that the proponents of this effect on Wikipedia seem to want to restrict it to experiments <i>exactly</i> like Allais' original experiment: that is, if you are not measuring gravity with a pendulum in a specific way, you are not measuring the "Allais effect". This is not how the term is used in actual published articles, like the Wang article—actual published articles use the term "Allais effect" to indicate any supposed gravitational anomaly during an eclipse, regardless of how it is measured. (Proponents apparently want to restrict the term to pendula, despite the fact that much more sensitive gravitational measurement techniques are now available, in order to deny the fact that numerous attempts have failed to replicate anything remotely of the magnitude claimed by Allais, at least as published in mainstream peer-reviewed journals. See also the lighthanded dismissal of the Kuusela and Jun experiments because they used the "wrong" kind of pendula...this kind of sniping has nothing to do with real error analysis, and is an original interpretation imposed on published articles that violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia policy</a>.)</p>
<p>Our penultimate paragraph cites the Duif article, which is self-published (and has never appeared in a peer-reviewed journal as far as I can tell), and therefore dubious as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a> according to Wikipedia guidelines (not to mention standard scholarly practice).</p>
<p>In short, while the article should be kept, it needs substantial rewriting. I personally have decided that I don't have the energy to keep the crackpots at bay in Wikipedia's relativity-related articles, however, so I leave this to others. I merely warn you to actually read the mainstream published sources, rather than trusting skewed summaries of them by Allais proponents.</p>
