<p>I removed the bit above. "Strange" &amp; "odd" are redundant, "almost seeming to imply" is so nebulous as to say nothing.

<p>It is to be noted that "All your base" is by no means the first piece of thoroughly <i>opaque</i> slang to have come to currency. In eighty years, studies of slang will likely still record exactly where the expression came from, and from what context -- but we will not be appreciably closer to understanding the original context of the 1920s slang expression, "<a href="../../../2/3/_/23_skidoo.html" title="23 skidoo">23 skidoo</a>". --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>I did the current 'correct' English tranlation for Wikipedia from the Japanese text here. Because I didn't have to think about how words would appear on the game screen, lines are longer and more descriptive. I think it makes more sense now and the sarcastic tone of the enemy, missing from the original translation is there as well.</dd>
<dd>Most of mistakes happened because Japanese is spoken with few words as possible with the great dependence on other person to judge its meaning. So if a translator simply pick words from a dictionary, the tranlated text is not going to make any sense. I think the best line to compare between translations is the line 11. Zero Wing FAQ's translators wrote "Im...impossible!" and I wrote "Damn you...!". Judging from the Japanese and the original, I think the captain had tried to say "Baka na koto wo iuna!" which in a word for a word tranlation is "What you say is stupid!". I think my translation is better here because it shows the defiance as the captain had not given up yet. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 06:59, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Good job, was very interesting to read! Perhaps we could use what you said here, about the problems of translating japanese, in the article as well? --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintran_9423.html" title="User:Wintran">Wintran</a> 09:01, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've added an introductory paragraph before the translation, based on the comments here. Thank you Revth for providing this rather useful content!</dd>
<dd>One amusing thing that just occurred to me was whether <a href="../../../../ja/index.html" class="extiw" title="ja:">the Japanese Wikipedia</a> has/could have pages for this kind of thing - informing Japanese readers of the phenomenon of <a href="../../../../ja/a/y/b/AYBABTU_f73d.html" class="extiw" title="ja:AYBABTU">AYBABTU</a>. Now <i>that</i> would be an interesting use of multilingual collaboration... --<a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 14:16, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since that translation was added, a whole string of people have come along and "corrected" it. Some of those changes I simply reverted, because they did little to alter the meaning, but made the English seem somewhat stilted - spoiling the whole purpose of an unconstrained translation. However, line 11 (as mentioned above) is particularly liberal, and not knowing the Japanese, I don't know how correct Revth's justification is - is the Captain expressing defiance ("Impossible, you will never succeed!"; which Revth rendered as "Damn you...!") or merely incredulity/disbelief ("That's impossible! This can't be happening!")? At the moment, I've put in a bit of a compromise - including the word "impossible", but adding the defiant "damn you!" to make it look more like real English dialogue. Does anyone want to have an opinion on which is "better"/"more correct", or have a further idea? --<a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 18:00, 30 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not a native Japanese speaker, but I do have 5 years of experience. My understanding is that the Captain is expressing only incredulity and disbelief, not defiance, in line 11.
<dl>
<dd>Revth appears to have simply misunderstood the original Japanese. In line 11 the captain says, stutteringly, "ba-b-baka na!". The word "baka" is an extremely common word in Japanese, which in 90% of cases means "stupid" or "foolish". However, it also has a rarer secondary usage as an exclamation meaning "no! impossible! it can't be!" --- often omitted in smaller dictionaries --- in which case it always appears in the irregular form "baka na". Revth seems to have been unaware of this second usage, and since the form "baka na" looks like (if you don't know this irregular usage) an odd abbreviation of a longer phrase, he guessed that it must mean something like "don't say stupid things!", or "you are stupid!". So he incorrectly inferred a defiant tone in the captain.</dd>
<dd>My view is also supported by the fact that the Captain stutters in this line, and also stutters previously ("o-omae wa!") in the line when CATS arrives. He seems in turmoil, and only gets back in control of his emotions when he gives the order to launch the ZIGs. I think the "damn you!" is the result of a misunderstanding and should be removed. Perhaps CATS' "go ahead and struggle" in line 13 ought to be removed as well --- no such phrase appears in the original Japanese.</dd>
<dd>By the way, another line that appears to be a clear mistranslation is line 18, "mirai ni kibou" to "future and hope". The particle "ni" surely does not mean "and". A better translation would be "hope for the future". This is more natural English as well.</dd>
<dd>I had a few other small gripes with the translation, but they were more a question of taste. Those two seem to me clear errors which can't be ascribed to "free text"-ness. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShibboleth_3624.html" title="User:Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> 21:09, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've been learning Japanese on my own for a few years now. A while back I romanized and translated the Japanese text to the best of my ability. Unlike the translation presented at the end of the article, which as noted was intended to capture the feel, my translation is closer to a literal meaning. I cannot guarantee that it is necessarily correct, since I am not a native speaker, nor have I had formal lessons, but I think it is correct enough to at least be considered. Would anyone like to see my efforts?</dd>

<dd>Bad_CRC, on the AYBABTU Video site (which really helped to kick it up) stated that Tribalwar thread as "making it great". Probably helped lead him to making the video. However, I do doubt that Tribalwar started the thing (and most or at least many people on the forums agreed last time the question was posed).

<dd>The Easter Egg might not refer to the AYBABTU phrase directly, but it's related to the whole "AYB phenomenon" instead. If people haven't decided to keep repeating that phrase and create tons of photoshopped pics years ago, the fad would have never started... and I'm sure that little Easter Egg would have never been inserted into that game, because it is the phrase that made the world <i>notice</i> the existence of <i>Zero Wing</i> and all the little elements pertaining to it (like CATS himself). The way I see it, this article deals with the AYB phenomenon that spread out within the Internet years ago, as well as the effects of it. Not just about the opening sequence text. That's just what launched the fad. Your argument on that is still valid, but this is my opinion. =] – <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Mackeriv</a> 03:45, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A lot of things referred to as part of "the animation" are often things that happened in the song "Invasion of the Gabber Robots." There are animations floating around that say everything correctly (well, according to the intro) or have mistakes in different places and include the Operator saying "Captain<i>!!</i>" - they're not nearly as popular as spin offs of BadCRC's Flash to Invasion of the Gabber Robots, but they're out there.

<dd>I agree with you about erratic nonsense claims deserving to be removed by reversion, but is this just an erratic claim? Have we checked to see how widespread this rather cockeyed "theory" actually is? If it isn't just one person's deluded omen-mongering, then we might be able to help people think more rationally about it if we explore the idea. Of course, if it <i>is</i> just a crackpot conspiracy, then reversion is the obvious choice. --<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInformationalAnarchist_2d02.html" title="User:InformationalAnarchist">InformationalAnarchist</a> 23:04, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My (admittedly brief) Google check <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=iBB&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22someone+set+up+us+the+bomb%22+%22bomb+the+us+upset+someone%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=iBB&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22someone+set+up+us+the+bomb%22+%22bomb+the+us+upset+someone%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> came up with less than a screenful of pages, mostly or entirely blog entries and not seriously proposing a conspiracy theory (more of a "hey, check this out" kind of thing). If someone can demonstrate that this is a seriously held theory (by more than a nutcase or two), then by all means I would support its inclusion and counterarguments. Heck, if someone just wants to point it out and say it's a coincidence, well, I still don't think it's that important or relevant, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to delete it, either. It's mostly the claim that it "predicted" the attacks that I take issue with. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConeslayer_540b.html" title="User:Coneslayer">Coneslayer</a> 00:09, 2005 July 14 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Release of Zero Wing in N. America?</span></h2>
<p>I have a question here: the AYB article says <i>"Zero Wing was never released in North America, and therefore never came to the Sega Genesis, the North American Mega Drive."</i> However, the <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Wing_59e8.html" title="Zero Wing">Zero Wing</a> article claims the exact opposite: <i>"The console version of Zero Wing was released in North America for the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive)"</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should the transcript be exact?</span></h2>
<p>1. Should be "exact" as the ending transcript is later in the article, in all caps? 2. Is there really a comma in the first line (Narrator: In A.D. 2101, war was beginning)? Or should it be two seperate lines, like in the animation? <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayerischermann_8eb2.html" title="User:Bayerischermann">Bayerischermann</a> 00:41, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
