<p><b>Allamah Rasheed Turabi</b>, a prominent and distinguished scholar, was born on 9th Jamadiul II, 1326 / July 09, 1908 in Hyderabad, India. He was the eldest son of Maulvi Sharaf Hussain Khan, a pious and a noble person from Hyderabad. He got his basic Islamic education from his father who taught him till the age of 5. He did his matriculation from Hyderabad, intermediate-high school from Shia College Lucknow, BA and MA from Osmania University. He got his basic and advance religious studies from Syed Abubaker ibn Shahab -e- Urezi (descendent of Imam Jafar e Sadiq (A.S.), Sadrul-Ulema Maulvi Syed Ghulam Hussain, Maulana Abbas Ali Sharif, Maulana Syed Sibt -e- Hasan and Hujjatul-Islam Agha Mirza Mehdi Pooya. He learned Urdu and Persian literature from Agha Mohsin Sheerazi, Ali Haider Tabatabai, Allamah Zamin Kanturi, Agha Dai'yal Islam and Agha Mohammed Kirmani. He learned Arabic language from Agha Tahir bin Mohammed and Maulana Sadiq Hussain Majjan, His mentors in Urdu and Persian poetry were Agha Syed Hasan Isfahani, Allamah Zamin Kanturi and Nawab Haider Yarjang Tabatabaie. On the political side, he started his political career as member working committee of Hyderabad Legislative Assembly and worked with Nawab Bahadur -e- Yarjang. Later on, he was nominated by Quaid -e-Azam, the founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, as member working committee of All India State Muslim League, there he was involved in the organization of Muslim League and established branches all over Indian Subcontinent. Simultaneously he had a responsibility to supervise the publication of newspapers and magazines of almost 600 states in then un-divided India. He remained the member of Hyderabad Assembly and All India Muslim League till the partition of the Subcontinent. After partition he migrated to Pakistan in 1949, left active politics and devoted himself only to religious affairs.</p>
<p>He had the unique honor of having <i>Ijazah</i> of <i>Riwayah</i> and <i>Narration</i> from almost all of his contemporary Mashayekh mainly from Iran and Iraq, notably Ayatullah Sheikh Mohammed Mohsin -e- Tehrani, Ayatullah Mohsin AlHakim Tabatabaie, Ayatullah Syed Hibbatuddin Shahristani, Ayatullah Syed Hadi -e- Meelani, Ayatullah Syed Ibrahim -e- Isfahani, Ayatullah Syed Shahabuddin -e- Marashi and Ayatullah Syed Kazim Shariatmadari.</p>
<p>He was exceptionally competent and proficient in many branches of Islamic sciences such as Tafseer (exegesis of the Holy Quran), Hadith (Sayings of the Holy Prophet (S.A.) and his infallible Household (A.S.), Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence), Usool (Basic principles of Islam), Islamic history and Rijal (the study on the authenticity of the chain of narrators of a Hadith). He never claimed and was not a jurist per se. He was highly educated who kept himself up-to-date with modern sciences especially in the development of political, economic and social thought.</p>
<p>His mastery of above sciences along with other sciences like philosophy, logic, mathematics, literature, vocabulary/terminology, geography, medicine, astronomy, political science, world history and other physical sciences had established him to be well known as a matchless and outstanding figure in the history of Shi'ite Islam.</p>
<p>He was a literary authority on Arabic, Persian and Urdu poetry. He literally memorized thousands and thousands of poetic lines, stanzas, verse paragraphs and contos of different masters. He had a profound affection and respect for Allamah Sir Mohammed Iqbal, Mir Anees, Mirza Dabeer, Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Ghalib, Maulana Jalaluddin -e- Rumi, Hafiz -e- Shirazi, Sheikh Sa'adi -e- Shirazi, Fariduddin Attar, Shamsuddin Tabrezi and Yagana Changezi. A good evidence of his command can be seen in his speeches and writings. He delivered more than 5,000 religious lectures and speeches over the period of 57 years that he spent out of his 65 years of total physical life in the service of Ahl Al-Bait (A.S.).</p>
<p>He has been considered as "unparalleled" in his comprehensiveness with regard to <i>Art of Oratory</i>. He has also been reported to be too much clear and meticulous on the complex topics and ideas. Allamah's explanations on the verses of the Holy Quran and its narrations, Sayings of the Holy Prophet and his Infallible Household (A.S.) are much compelling and accurate. Further to his magnum opus, he was a true genius in Ilm -ul- Rijal, although he did not had enough time during his lifetime to publish his master work on Rijal which he already named it in his life as "<i>Wasl -e- Qawl</i>".</p>
<p>Allamah Rasheed Turabi had a magnetic personality and spiritual charisma. People from all parts of the country used to attend his majalis because of his overflowing knowledge, spiritual influence, and magical oratory.</p>
<p>Allamah Rasheed Turabi had received the title of Allamah (The Most Learned) from Shi'ite scholars and religious luminaries of his time, who unanimously acknowledged and recognized his wisdom and application methods.</p>
<p>Allamah Rasheed Turabi had a legendary life. In his 65-year of lifetime, as mentioned above, he delivered more than 5,000 religious speeches, created supreme nature of poetic work, wrote many books and articles. He was proud of his library that contained thousands of books and hundreds of rare manuscripts. His library was one of the famous religious libraries of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Allamah Rasheed Turabi died on 22 Zilqada 1393 / December 18, 1973.</p>
