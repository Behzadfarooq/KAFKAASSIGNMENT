<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ganser and RS</span></h2>
<p>It is insane to claim that Ganser's book fails WP:RS because he joined a club two years after it was published. The book was published and endorsed by ETH Zurich. If that isn't a reliable source then we're going to have to delete <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">General relativity</a> because they published that too. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 16:07, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not taking sides cause I am done with most interaction with this article, but I do not think the problem is the book was published by ETH, I don't think you actually believe that is the issue either. However as noted above the document the book is based on, the proof basically that it happened is refuted by the CIA and others as being a fake, that I believe is where the issue lies. The idea that RS simply implies a published book is kinda shallow, the basis of the book is what is being challenged, and has been challenged, so its Reliable Source tag is whats being debated on that merit, not the merit of ETH publishing it. SO while its WP:V, its not really WP:RS, cause it exists, doesnt mean its true. Apologies if I am mistating anyones case. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:13, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for that summary, but I think you ignore the passion some editors hold for Ganser. The issue for many of them is that he became a member of ST911.org after the book was published. Here is a sample of what editors have said about Ganser:
<ul>
<li>"for the umteenth time Daniel "jewish hologranms took down the towers" Ganser is not an WP:RS" - TDC</li>
<li>"removed unsourced conspiracy cruft -- disreputable source not meeting WP:RS requirements" and "removed unsubstantiated "Gladio" material -- complete fabrication" - Monty Devonshire</li>

Hi, I wonder if you could lend an outsiders opinion to a dispute that has been raging on articles related to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Gladio_6040.html" title="Operation Gladio">Operation Gladio</a>. The dispute is whether a book on the subject is an <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> or not. The book is by Dr. Daniele Ganser of the <a href="../../../e/t/h/ETH_Zurich_925d.html" title="ETH Zurich">ETH Zurich</a> university. The book was published by them and Ganser received a PhD from that University for this work. ETH Zurich is very prestigious, having been the university where Einstein worked and having 21 Nobel prize winners on their staff. It is one of the fore-most universities in Europe. I and others say this makes the book notable. Another group of editors say that because Ganser joined a group called 9/11 Scholars for Truth two years after the book was published, Ganser's work becomes suspect and cannot be referenced. What do you think? I'd prefer not to go through the trouble of arbitration for such a specific issue. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 16:14, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</blockquote>

<dd>It really depresses me, actually. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by a bunch of anti-free speach fascists, and I'm getting sick of it. The idea that if someone raises their voice about something the majority disagrees with then everything that person ever said or did becomes 'wrong'. I noticed that when the "Dixie Chicks" spoke against the Iraq War, US freedom of speech rights went out the window. As for science, I'd point out that Newton believed a bunch of crazy stuff about the occult and alchemy. Guess that must mean that gravity doesn't exist, eh? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 18:28, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just stumbled on this. Sorry, but this is total baloney. Even if Ganser's work <i>on 9/11</i> were considered unreliable due to his support of this effort, it has no bearing whatsoever on his assessment of Operation Gladio. Ganser is, in fact, a well-respected academician who has repeatedly been called on by both the executive and the legislative branch of the swiss government as an expert on security policy. Ganser is, in fact, neither a full nor associate nor any other member of "Scholars for 9-11 truth". While he has contributed a chapter to the book "9/11 &amp; American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out", it deals with the Cold War. Declaring Ganser as unreliable on this issue here could well be seen as unauthorized assumption of authority, given that he wants to trump an entire faculty. Since this is indeed Ganser's dissertation topic, if any of you has evidence that its conclusions are unreliable, they should be brought to the attention of the department of history of the University of Basel. If you don't, please desist from contaminating Wikipedia with jingoism just because you don't like his findings. --OliverH 19:34, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Being an active participant in a campaign of disinformation seriously damages a person's credibility.

<p>and</p>
<p><i>"A source authored by a person engaged in a propaganda operation such as Scholars for 9/11 Truth would be considered unreliable"</i></p>

<p><i>"Just use common sense. If someone is promoting one phony thing, they can be expected to promote others."</i></p>
<p>The US Government unequivocally and unambiguously states that <i>"the Earth is at least 4.3 billion years in age"</i> <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, therefore anyone who publically contends that the earth is 1000's of years old, be that person a preacher or a creation 'scientist', politician or scholar, must be considered <i>" an active participant in a campaign of disinformation"</i> and esposing young age earth arguments can only be seen as <i>"propaganda operations"</i> and the arguments themselves as 'Conspiracy Theories'.

<dd>Is there nothing like a feature pieces, kind of in the form like Time Magazine does that would allow a significant ammount of content to be drawn from it. The worry on connecting dots is that you take source and A and join it with B to make up C, however if something is covered greatly in A and not as much in B C and D, then its ok to use B C and D to support A, just not to make a new arguement. So if you have one concise source that everyone or a majority can agree on, then you should be able to build from that and use other sources to support it. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:50, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some editors are deleting vast amounts of referenced material which has no Ganser references and claiming it is based on the Ganser discussion. Really folks, come on now. This is childish. How are you supposed to be accepted as an editor if you show yourself unable to read before you delete? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 02:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. This is nuts. The Ganser material is simply a reference to a reputable academician published by a reputable publisher who has provided information in support of the idea that the CIA -- and by extension the United States -- regularly engages in Terrorist activity. The article has already acceded to a very great many things; it's time that these hostile editors like TDC, Nuclear Zero and "Monty" grow up a bit and allow the page to develop in a reputable and even-handed fashion. Watching them systematically attack each and every reference and fact to the U.S. and British "terrorist" tools far more to damage their credibility than it does that of Ganser.</p>

<dd>I am not "arguing law".

<dd>We need a citation that demonstrates that there is no higher International body that can adjudicate the dispute about whether or not the latest invasion of Iraq was legal? Heck, just quoting the "citation" would take a longer and more involved digression than the actual statement itself -- which, again, is so patently obvious that it's a no-brainer. And what would this citation consist of, exactly -- the complete compilation of all current legal documents of every country on the planet, analyzed in detail, eventually leading to the conclusion that there actually does not exist an international consensus on an international court, international law, and international terrorism? All assembled into one nice single-sentence summarization? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 15:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes of coruse you need a citation to say this. Oddly enough this is already international criminal courts and wars that have been deamed illegal. There have been military actions cited as illegal in this very article, so of course you need a citation to assert something completely opposite of the points presented later. Maybe there is maybe there isnt a concensus on international terrorism, I know people have been tried for terrorism in their owncountries as well as others and we had milosovic tried recently in international court, and according to documents here the US was found guilty of engagnig in illegal acts and terrorism. So yes please provide a citation in the next 10 days. Also your sarcasm doesnt really help, if what you are saying is so obvious then plenty others would have said it in WP:RS and WP:V sources, so just source it back to someplace. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 15:28, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You need to learn how to read. I said nothing about the illegality or legality of the Iraq war, only that it was in dispute and that there is no body of law around that can adjudicate it. If you think there needs to be a citation about the dispute over the legality of the Iraq war, then i'll be happy to oblige. But saying that a citation is needed to demonstrate that there is no universally recognized international adjudication body that can resolve this matter is something i'll leave for you or your brethren; this very fact is referenced in several other areas of this article and others, and nobody has ever saddled it with a demand for a citation. That's like asking for a citation to demonstrate that there exists something in the United States called a Supreme Court. If somebody references that the Supreme Court is the highest adjudicative body in the U.S, people don't demand a citation. If someone says that they don't have jurisdiction outside the U.S, people don't demand a citation. You are out of line here, and so far as i can tell merely because it entertains you.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 16:02, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at the problem from another angle, government definitions of international legality can often be at odds with their defitions of internal legality.[citation needed]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Why is another citation necessary? We already have one by Ganser, and all I'm doing is paraphrasing his words. Why isn't quoting the documents directly and pointing out that a responsible researcher and specialist in international relations unequivocally supports this rather obvious interpretation enough? The two quotes are themselves simple and unambiguous: the FBI says that any illegal use of violence to coerce governments is terrorism, and the CIA mandate specifically says that it was created to use insurgencies, guerillas, subversion, sabotage, and "economic warfare" to conduct its operations. Are you suggesting that those words have some sort of ambiguity, and that we need to appeal to a higher source to resolve the confusion? Are you seriously suggesting that worldwide, most governments and people consider subversion, guerilla war, insurgency, sabotage and "economic warfare" to be legal and patriotic activities in the service of one's country? If not, then asking for a citation here is rather silly. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 15:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If this is Gansers opinion then cite it as that. Ganser feels the problem is governments definitions of international legality ... and cite a page in the book that he says that. So if you indeed feel Ganser said this you can provide a direct source to when he said it. Also its best not paraphrase and instead quote Ganser, if you have the quote you don;t need the paraphrase, you are being redundant. As for what I am suggesting ...

<p>I am going to state the obvious here, as it seems that in the heat of the argument, it may have been forgotten: 1) Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. 2) Any edit lacking a source may be removed. 3) The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. 4) Be careful not to err too far on the side of not upsetting editors by leaving unsourced information in articles for too long.

I challenge the idea that the material i presented are "facts" that can be referenced in the first place. I challenge that the sentences referenced present any "facts" to speak of beyond those that are already explicitly presented and cited in the article elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>I can go on: I challenge that the wikiedia guidelines you are citing were ever actually agreed upon, but in fact are the invention of a malicious, all-powerful hacker who has altered the page for you just now, so you can play games with me. i challenge the idea that people breathe quicker when they get excited; i challenge the fact that coffee keeps you awake; i challenge the idea that women generally have smoother skin then men; i challenge the fact that the sky is most often blue; and so on --</dd>

Yes, but if you have an Italian documentary that shows clear photographic evidence that White Phosphorous was used, shows that the bodies in question are clearly those of ex-women and ex-children, and shows the relevant documents from the Geneva Conventions that the use of white phosphorous and other chemical weapons on areas of civilian population is a war-crime, and then the documentary goes on to equate the act with the behavior of terrorists, then what you've got is a valid source.</p>
<p>And yes, the documentary exists; it's about forty minutes long, and I've got a copy of it on my hard-drive here. If someone would like to look up exactly where and when it was shown, it'd be nice. If not, gimme a few weeks and i can probably figure it out.

<p>Well, you obviously watched the wrong video, because on the video i watched i saw:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bodies charred beyond recogntion, laying on beds, and in at least two cases wearing women's clothes and embracing children.</li>
<li>large white clouds of phosphorous floating to the ground in a civilian area</li>
<li>Testimony by two soldiers that during the battle in Falluja -- and while moving through civilian occupied areas -- they received orders that they should vacate the area because White Phosphorous was to be deployed.</li>
<li>Admission by soldiers that they were ordered to consider all non-military personnel in Falluja as a combatant (i.e. -- admission that civilians were purposefully targetted by orders from the officer corps)</li>
<li>Corpses displaying unmistakable signs of torture after passing through U.S. authorized "security services"</li>
<li>Civilian living rooms with entire families piled together in death</li>
<li>Surviving children and adults with hair loss and skin disfigurations consistent with chemical warfare</li>
<li>The testimony of two journalists relaying the experiences of themselves and at least two others, describing acts of censorship by the U.S. government regarding the Falluja offensive</li>
<li>Journalist testimony that harmful chemical substances coated many civilian homes and areas after the departure of U.S. troops from Falluja</li>
<li>Testimony and documents from the British Ministry of Defence that the U.S. in fact used Napalm -- a banned chemical weapon -- on the people of Falluja</li>
<li>Reference to the UN conventions on chemical weapons</li>
<li>Regarding its position on Iraqi WMD's, there is a statement by an ex-minister of the British parliament that "the hypocrisy [of the U.S.] is stinking"</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, this is all relevant to our discussion here. Since these subjects were the focus of the documentary in question, i can only presume that you followed the wrong link.

<dd>Just to counter some of your points, the soldier says that they were told that the combat age was changed and to be weary of anyone as yound as 10, then goes on to state that he has witnessed 10 year olds with machine guns, this is vastly different then your summary of <i>"admission by soldiers that they were ordered to consider all non-military personnel in Falluja as a combatant"</i>, which is also vastly different then your trailing summary in parenthesis. The British Ministry of Defense did not say Napalm was used, you should pay better attention, MK77 was used, you can view an article on it here on Wikipedia to clarify your misunderstanding. UN convention on Incendiary weapons is what White Phosphorous falls under, not conventional, another misunderstanding by you. I seen a child with a birth defect that the father blamed on the US's weapons. I am sure it wasnt the chemical weapons the insurgents prepare like al-abud network. Ahh yes we have the bodies that the reporter says must be civilians because all insurgents wear bullet proof vests, odd everything else I have read ever, says quite the contrary, I didnt know insurgents were now making it clear they were insurgents. As for the clouds you are viewing it from miles away, so no I do not see it landing on civilian areas. I do not doubt that civilians were killed, but you obviously didnt pay close attention if that is your summary above. Also that I heard of a reporter who's stuff was stolen by super agents of the government ... seriously how can you even take that semi-seriously, why isnt the person who was robbed telling the story? hear say. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 11:57, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have admitted nothing of the sort! First, to counter *your* points:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one -- and if i remember correctly, both -- soldier(s_ in the documentary categorically declare that they were told to consider anyone in the city as an enemy combatant. You can pretend like they didn't, but fortunately that's why we have sources: because it's there, and it's undeniable.</li>
<li>The British Minsitry said that MK77 -- which the documentary goes on to explain is an only very slightly modified version of Napalm -- was definitely used by the U.S. in its invasion of Iraq, and probably in Falluja. Again, you can claim otherwise but it's there, and that's why we have sources.</li>
<li>The child's father in the video says that the child had suffered from the hair loss and deformities since the bombing. Regardless of what you would like to fantasize about, it's stated clearly in the commentary. While it is up to debate whether the assertions are true, the video evidence that accompanies the video makes it very possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the rest of your rationalizations, they are pablum. The source stands. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 16:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, i missed one:</p>
<p>The UN convention on chemical weapons states quite clearly that if a weapon is used for its toxic properties against enemy combatants, then regardless of its arsenal classification it is to be considered a chemical weapon. Thus, the classification of white phosphorous as an incendiary is *only* applicable when it is being used as such, and ceases to be relevant the moment it is used for its toxic properties.</p>
<p>In other words: if one uses white phosphorous as a smoke-screen, or to light up a no-man's land, or as a sky-light to spot enemy planes or ships, then it is not considered a weapon. The moment you use it on an area where there are acknowledged enemy combatants, however, it becomes one.</p>
<p>Again, the source stands. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 16:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The citation as last posted did not mention Gladio, and was relevant to the article. Ganser is a respected academic from a military educational institute founded and administered by the Swiss government. His specialty is research on intelligence agencies, covert operations, and the world's developing terrorist networks. As far as credentials go, his are beyond dispute in this matter. The citation that was removed was an explicit assertion that, through the CIA, the U.S. government sanctions and promotes activities that are widely regarded as terrorism. There is just no reasonable justification for removing it. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 14:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering the nature of this article can the person who added the recent edits that I reverted please source them first before adding. Items like <i>"Critics have long accused the United States government of selectively editing the list, sometimes adding enemy states on the basis of flimsy evidence while purging it to favor allies for whom evidence of wrongdoing is much stronger."</i> need sources are they are accusations against an entire nation of wrong-doing, multiple sources is needed to support such a claim. The revision of the state terrorism explanation should also be documented as to why, please use edit summaries also as they help others understand why you made such edits and what you are using as a basis. There was also additions to what acts may be considered terrorist acts, can we please have this sourced as well.

<p>That is not editorializing. This page is about "Allegations of State Terrorism" against the United States. The statement is presented as the position of many of the critics of U.S. foreign policy, thus helping to explain the divide between how the United States can perceive its actions as legitimate while others simultaneously accuse it of acts of terrorism. It is more than appropriate to include it in the article -- it's in fact a necessity. Moreover, such assertions are commonplace among organizations like Amnesty International, HRW, and others. If you have a problem with the assertion, or think it needs a citation, then you should state so; in this case, we have a fact presented as an assertion, and a request for a citation of some sort is apropos. Thus, i am replacing the comment and will come back at a later time with an appropriate citation. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 15:29, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're asking me who believes that the U.S. is an exporter of terrorism? Well, let's see: the governments of Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua; many of the people in Honduras, Costa Rica, Columbia, Europe, China, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe -- do you realy want me to go on?</dd>
<dd>The point is that we have already posted sources of someof these critics -- in the content area, following the introduction, where they should be. You know: Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, the Middle East, areas of Europe, etc. That's where the appropriate sources for these complaints are located. This is an introductory area, where we politely explain what the relevant issues and evidence are; the citation provided is enough to demonstrate that the issue in question is one that is internationally verifiable and widely acknowledged (i.e. -- an easily verifiable record of a UN vote), and that is all that is needed for an explanation of what these issues are. That the fact is sourced through a Chomsky article in no way implies that the vote is not a matter of public record, nor that the interpetation in question is obscure, so there is no justification for attempting to portray the *fact* that the United States has opposed several overwhelmingly popular UN resolutions on Terrorism as a singular opinion held by Chomsky.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, the introduction is not the place where we should source exactly which critics avail themselves of these facts. We have already each agreed that the place where the actual complaints themselves are sourced is beneath, where the various complaints and allegations are expanded upon, and i am sure that we all agree to change that structure would be arbitrary and counter-productive.</dd>
<dd>So really there is no substance to your objections. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 07:56, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I really do not care what the US does and doesn't do, that is what your problem is, you think I oppose your edits out of ideology, however I am an independant and already believe the US is responcible for terrorist attacks, including hiroshima, however we need sources for articles like this or we (wikipedia) look like fools. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:06, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You're absolutely right; this isn't complicated at all: the sources have already been posted, below, where they should be.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, i don't care what motivates you and i don't really spend any time wondering about it. I do pay close attention to your demands and actions, though, and the simple fact is that you're asking me to source the idea that "many people" think a certain way, and that's simply not possible except in the way it is below: to go through, country by country, and show that there are indeed many complaints against the U.S. as an exporter of terrorism. Since that is done here, in this very article, you are asking for what amounts to a self-referential footnote, and that *truly* would look bad.</dd>
<dd>The fact as i have presented it here includes uncontroversial commentary and provides an explanation that both elucidates the U.S. government's position as well as outlining the mindset of those who say that the U.S. is endorsing terrorism; moreover, it is a clear indicator that the United States' views on terrorist activity are in the world's minority, and not its mainstream. The fact is publically available and well referenced, and it is properly sourced through a reputable commentator. So really you have no right to ask for more.</dd>
<dd>Instead, what you are asking is not that the *fact* be sourced, but that the indication of the facts *relevance* be sourced -- and since the relevance is made clear in the article below, what you're asking for is rhetorically and academically absurd. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 15:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And there is one more thing i forgot to point out: the very fact that the U.S. refuses to acknowledge certain acts as 'terrorist' in nature -- while the vast majority of the UN has already agreed that those acts do in fact qualify as terrorism -- logically implies the assertions in the article. So again, your asking for a "source" in this instance is not just overkill, but *precisely* the sort of foolishness that most people mention when they ridicule Wikipedia's content. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 16:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Look, i've been noodling around Wikipedia for some four or six years now, and i have enough post-graduate education to qualify as an authority on sources and citations. I'm a teacher, in fact. I am perfectly clear on what requires proper sourcing. What you are asking for is *not* one of those instances. So what i'm going to do, see, is keep explaining myself and keep returning the edits to their proper place. In fact, *right* *now* i will be restoring the Ganser quotations.</dd>
<dd>Now, I am perfectly happy in allowing you and anyone else to register your rebuttals and counter-points to each point made in the article; i understand that this is a controversial topic that many people find uncomfortable. But it is more than obvious that your insistence on "sourcing" is being used as a tool to whittle away the content of the article, and that is simply not in the spirit of Wikipedia guidelines.</dd>
<dd>I suggest that you and your 'tater gallery should figure out some way to come to an agreement with what you want to say on this page; the unfortunate truth is, however, that up until now you and the others here have only agreed on what you *don't* want said, and as time goes by it's more than apparent that this amounts to eliminating the entire existence of the page. This is unfortunate, because it is contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia, contrary to the spirit of the U.S. Constitution (relevant because most of you are U.S. citizens who think you're "defending" the United States), and contrary to the spirit of virtually all Western academic and ethical traditions.</dd>
<dd>So, to summarize: this isn't a rant. It's simply a statement of my perceptions of what is going on here, logged for whoever wants to register the history of this page to plainly find. If you're bothered by the length and detail of my responses, then i suggest that you start tabling some suggestions to create a more clear middle ground on which we can all satisfactorily present our insights. Until then, we are simply going to go around and around on this, until the Wikipedia staff gets involved and begins to take more drastic measures. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 05:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Look, you are simply not acting here for the betterment of Wikipedia, but instead as a means to further your own POV. As i have pointed out repeatedly -- this being, what, the fifth or sixth time in four days? -- i did not cite the *blog*, i cited the RAI/BBC video is found there. Moreover, i did this in response to a request by you to link to a place where the video could be found. I have fulfilled your demands for a copy of the video and you have already acknowledged that it qualifies as an adequate source. Thus, there really is no problem here; that you continue to claim the link to the video is invalid because it's located on a blog is really bad-faith on your part, and your insistence that my source is equatable with citing the blog itself is just plain silly.</p>
<p>Now i just went by and read [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks|WP:NPR" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks|WP:NPR" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>], and i'm quite sure that i haven't violated anything in there; on the other hand, my talk page has started receiving threats from people associated with many of the reverts and edits to this page; i'm not making any sort of public accusation here, merely pointing out that i have made note of this behavior and am logging it for future reference.</p>
<p>I am also entreating you here to agree to disagree; you and many of the people here who support your deletions and reverts have done little or nothing to contribute to either the sources or the content of this article, and that is explicitly against Wikipedia policy. We should come to an equitable reckoning on what is going to be posted here, otherwise i worry that the page may eventually be locked down to only registered editors, and that would truly be a sad reflection on the state of dialogue regarding this topic, not to mention U.S. political and intellectual discourse. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:20, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The video clearly states that it is a war crime by the Geneva conventions -- except that the United States isn't in a war. It's in an occupation. That qualifies as State Terrorism, and if you don't believe me then you need to review all the definitions we've set up on this page.</p>

<p>This is becoming frustrating because it seems either you are flooding the article with sources you know arent good or just do not know how to source. You make a statement that the US blocks attempts to define terrorism ... this has to be sourced with something stating the US blocks attempts to define terrorism, not something that says there was an attempt to define terrorism, its misleading to add 7 citations, which do not address the point of the sentence, but the lesser idea, that there was simply an attempt. Also I ask you review your sources, Media monitors is a website that simply takes submitted articles, is written by the site owner, and the articles are not consulted with an expert, nor is the website owner a legal expert either.

</ul>
<p>where [the U.S. was] allies of those who were abusing human rights.</p>
<p>This specifically asserts -- by the founder of Human Rights' Watch -- that the U.S. selectively edits its definition of human rights' violators depending on who its allies are. This is a specific assertion that supports the statement that references it; while no "list" is mentioned, i could quite easily modify the statement to include "list and/or definition of human rights violators", if you'd like. But really that's over-kill. Since all terrorists are, by definition, human rights' violators -- and since the context in which the above statement is made is in an analysis of the 'war on terror' -- there is no reason to delete it.

<dd>And honestly what you just said above is the definition of WP:OR. Since all terrorists are human rights violators (no proof given), oddly you are argue they are freedom fighters, then all human rights lists are now international terrorism lists, wouldnt that make it the other way around that all terrorism lists are then human rights lists making it so that your paragraph is still wrong since it should say that the US manipulates its human rights lists, then we can export it out of a terrorism article into a human rights article.

The legal journal -- that specifically uses the Pinochet case to make its point -- will stay, however, because we cite Chile and the Pinochet case below, as an instance of State Terrorism. It has makes several clear and unambiguous statements that the U.S. holds a double standard when evaluating the Pinochet case specifically because it fears the prosecution of the case will lead to the prosecution of U.S. bureaucrats and/or leadership. While that does not specifically mention the list, i will modify the entry on the page to properly reflect the content of the source. The statement will remain relevant, and the source accurate. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 16:09, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can move it to the section on Chile it will be a great addition, it just was not appropriate for where it was. While I do not care generally about that section because Sea went a sourced it so nice, you may want to be careful of changing content to meet sources instead of just sourcing the current content, you may end up making other sources given no longer valid in the proccess. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:21, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Leaving</span></h2>
<p>I have decided to leave this article as its grown to the point where I see Stone's objective is not to make a NPOV article but simply a POV one, he has taken sources from anyone he can get them on to condemn the US, and never attempted to balance anything he has added, such as listing Chomsky, but not giving an alternate opinion or explaining how many other disagree greatly with him. Resorting to obscure human rights groups that don't even have functioning websites apparently or are made by a single man and never have gone to do anything anywhere except serve as an application filler. I can spend all day removing most of the crap he has inserted including the lies that the documentary he pointed to me accuses the US of terrorism, when he still has not provided a quote to that effect. The idea of WP:OR and WP:RS, WP:V and most of all here WP:OR seem lost on Stone and the anon, which seems to be Stone as well since he talks about his contributions here, though there are none. Is this me no longer Asumming Good Faith, yes it is, I have tried to make right this article for some time now and applaud efforts of people like Seabhcan to produce good standing sources, but Stone digs on google for anyone that claims to be someone. Unfortunatly my checking power can not match Stones power to google everyday for the words "US" "terrorism" If someone takes up this project of fixing this article, please let me know and perhaps as a team it can one day be made NPOV. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:17, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I object completely to this characterization of my presence here. I have included many statements and qualifications that only serve to undermine and challenge my own POV, and have taken every effort to allow the opinions of all editors here to be properly included. I have often been frustrated by some here -- NU/Z, in particular -- when seeking to include sources which i consider satisfactory, but i have never allowed the situation to develop into an edit war. Similarly,i have made political and rhetorical capitulations regarding the inclusion of material i personally consider irrelevant and contrary to the spirit of the article. Moreover, my work has largely been isolated to cleaning up the "definition" and "introduction" areas to show both that there is a vague but established international legal consensus and what that consensus fully is.</dd>
<dd>In that regard i have made every effort to remain NPOV and to substantiate my suggestions with solid sources culled from international law journals, organizations of international legal experts, Human Rights organizations, UN documents, informed journalists who qualify as authorities on the subject matter, political think tanks and activist groups, and the opinions of plaintiffs and legal claimants in relevant cases. I object that these sources should be summed up and dismissed as "POV".</dd>
<dd>I am sorry NuclearUmpf is leaving; his presence here has contributed to the development of a solid article. Unfortunately, it seems that he regards my vigorous defense of sources as equivalent to a personal rejection of his opinions. I would love to show him wrong by allowing him to contribute more to the article, but -- again, unfortunately -- his activity here has been restricted entirely to challenging sources and deleting large portions of the article.</dd>
<dd>Nuclear, i'll be happy to see you again and welcome your inevitable return, and i sincerely hope it will be under the same name. I always have hope that all interaction, no matter how contrarian, leads to respect; debating you under a pseud would be a rather sad way to continue, as we would not have any opportunity to reflect on our past posts here.

<dd>Sure ... Your a teacher and find blogs t be satisfactory, ask yourself if your student said your government commits terrorism and offered a source that does not say that, would it be acceptable, I am sure it wouldnt be. Your law journals I have not seen, your human rights groups that have webpages and havent done anything, blogs and 30 minute TV programs pirated on blogs, no political think tanks, no activist organizations (as if that isnt the definition of POV), and lelga claimants cases that are not connected to what you are alleging. The fact of the matter is the more silly sources you add the more you disprove your own point. About the name sorry your are unable to see the "zer0" part in the name and discern something, most people have the persceptions skills necessary to understand something from that. If only you knew how to source as well as your write diatribes. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 11:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
