<p>The <b>All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship</b> (known for sponsorship reasons as the <b><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness.html" title="Guinness">Guinness</a> Hurling Championship</b>) is the premier "knockout" competition in the game of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a> played in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. The series of games are organised by the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> and are played during the summer months with the All-Ireland Hurling Final being played on the first or second Sunday in September in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croke_Park_ebdd.html" title="Croke Park">Croke Park</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. The prize for the winning team is the <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_McCarthy_Cup_da0a.html" title="Liam McCarthy Cup">Liam McCarthy Cup</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">Hurling</a> is considered to be one of the most skillful games and is the fastest field game in the world. Because of this only a handful of teams participate in the Championship, the most dominant teams coming from the provinces of <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a>. Cork, Kilkenny and Tipperary are considered to be the "superpowers" of hurling. Between them, these teams have won the Championship on no less than 83 occasions. After winning the Championship for the 30th time in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Cork is the most successful hurling county. Not only has the team won back-to back titles but Cork is the only team to have completed a famous four-in-a-row in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship_6134.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Following the foundation of the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>, one of the association's early aims was the promotion of a national competition that involved the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Games_4f17.html" title="Gaelic Games">Gaelic Games</a> of <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a>. At the third meeting of the new organisation in January <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, new rules for the ancient game of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a> were drawn up and were soon published in local newspapers throughout the country. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a> "County Boards" were created to run the affairs of the various <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Ireland_391f.html" title="Counties of Ireland">counties</a> that participated in the competition. By <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a> the first All-Ireland Hurling Championship took place. Although only five teams participated, it was a step in the right direction for the organisation.</p>
<p>For the first few years of the Championship the various counties were represented by the team who won the county club championship. For instance, the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a> Championship saw <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurles.html" title="Thurles">Thurles</a> representing Tipperary and <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meelick.html" title="Meelick">Meelick</a> representing Galway. Dedicated inter-county teams were only introduced in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a> when Cork put forward a mixture of all the best players from that county's best local GAA clubs. Over the early years various changes were made in the rules of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a>, and its sister sport, <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a>. Teams were reduced from 21-players to the current number of 15, and the rules regarding the value of a goal were also tweaked in the first few years of the competition.</p>
<p>The provincial championships were eventually introduced in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster_Senior_Hurling_Championship_5229.html" title="Munster Senior Hurling Championship">Munster</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster_Senior_Hurling_Championship_bf07.html" title="Leinster Senior Hurling Championship">Leinster</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connacht_Senior_Hurling_Championship_a494.html" title="Connacht Senior Hurling Championship">Connacht</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Senior_Hurling_Championship_b07b.html" title="Ulster Senior Hurling Championship">Ulster</a> on a "knock-out" basis. The winners of the various provincial finals would go on to participate in the All-Ireland semi-final stage. Over time the Leinster and Munster teams grew to become the superpowers of the game, as <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> was the more dominant sport in Ulster and Connacht. After some time <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a> became the only credible team in Connacht and was essentially given an automatic pass to the All-Ireland semi-final every year. This "knock-out" system remained for many decades and was considered to be the fairest system as the All-Ireland Champions would always be the undefeated team of the series of games.</p>
<p>In the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> looked at developing a new system whereby a defeat in the championship for certain teams may not necessarily mean an early exit from the Championship. In the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship_1997_b7b8.html" title="All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1997">Championship of 1997</a> the first major change in format arrived when the so-called "back door" system was introduced. This new structure allowed the defeated <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> finalists another chance to regain a place in the All-Ireland semi-finals. <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> were the first two teams to benefit from the new system when they defeated <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_GAA_481b.html" title="Down GAA">Down</a> and Galway respectively in two "quarter-finals". The All-Ireland Final in the first year of this new experiment was a replay of the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> Final with <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_GAA_cf86.html" title="Clare GAA">Clare</a> defeating <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a>.</p>
<p>The new "back door" system proved successful and was expanded over the following years. The <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship_2005_6aae.html" title="All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 2005">2005 Championship</a> saw even bigger changes in the "back door" or Qualifier system. Now the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> champions and defeated finalists automatically qualify for the new Quarter-Final stages. While two groups of four other teams play in a league format to fill the vacant four places in the quarter-finals. Many have criticised the new structure for not being a real championship at all, for degrading the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> Championships and for penalising the strongest teams. However, the new "Qualifier" structure has provided more games and has given hope to the "weaker" teams, as a defeat in the first round no longer means the end of a county's All-Ireland ambitions.</p>

<p>The county is a geographical region in Ireland, and each of the thirty-two <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Ireland_391f.html" title="Counties of Ireland">counties in Ireland</a> organises its own GAA affairs through a County Board. The county teams play in their respective Provincial Championships in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connacht.html" title="Connacht">Connacht</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>. The hurling championship qualifying structure works as follows:</p>
<p><b>Counties Participating:</b> Twelve Counties shall participate in the Championship (initially the Counties participating in Division 1 of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hurling_League_83c6.html" title="National Hurling League">National Hurling League</a>). Additional provision shall be made for the Ulster Champions, if not already included.</p>
<p><b>Provincial Championships:</b> Provincial Championships will run as normal in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster_Senior_Hurling_Championship_5229.html" title="Munster Senior Hurling Championship">Munster</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster_Senior_Hurling_Championship_bf07.html" title="Leinster Senior Hurling Championship">Leinster</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Senior_Hurling_Championship_b07b.html" title="Ulster Senior Hurling Championship">Ulster</a> on a 'Knock Out' format.</p>
<p><b>All Ireland Qualifier:</b> The 8 Counties participating shall be the First Round Losers in the Leinster and Munster Championships (two Teams), the Losing Semi-Finalists in the Leinster and Munster Championships (four Teams), <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antrim_GAA_3659.html" title="Antrim GAA">Antrim</a>.</p>
<p><b>Groups (2):</b> Two Groups of four Teams shall be drawn, with a maximum of two Teams from Munster and Leinster in each Group. Each County in a Group shall meet each other i.e. each Team shall play three games.</p>
<p><b>All Ireland Quarter Finals (4):</b> The Pairings for the All Ireland Quarter-Finals shall be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> Champions v Second Placed Team in one Qualifier Group.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> Champions v Second Placed Team in the other Qualifier Group.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> Championship Runners Up v First Placed Team in One Qualifier Group.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> Championship Runners Up v First Placed Team in the other Qualifier Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Draw shall be made to determine who each of the 'First Placed' Teams and each of the 'Second Placed' Teams shall meet.</p>
<p><b>All Ireland Semi-Finals:</b> The <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> Provincial Champions, if still involved, shall be drawn against the other two Quarter Final Winners. If the Leinster and/or Munster Provincial Champions are defeated in the Quarter Finals, the Team(s) that defeated them shall take their position(s) in the Draw.</p>

<p>This new format has been criticised for making the provincial championships largely meaningless. Eight teams will qualify for the All-Ireland quarter-finals, and there are eight county teams who are considered to be far above the rest, and so are guaranteed the quarter-final spots: <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_GAA_cf86.html" title="Clare GAA">Clare</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick_GAA_92c5.html" title="Limerick GAA">Limerick</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterford_GAA_9463.html" title="Waterford GAA">Waterford</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a> have won the All-Ireland Hurling Championship the most times - thirty in all as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. They are also the only team to have won the Championship on four consecutive occasions (1941-44). Only three teams have won the McCarthy Cup on three consecutive occasions - Cork (1892-94, 1941-43, 1952-54 &amp; 1976-78), Tipperary (1949-51) and Kilkenny (1911 - 13). Kilkenny, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a> and Wexford have all achieved the "double" by winning back-to-back titles over the years. Antrim hold the unfortunate record of appearing in two All-Ireland Finals (1943 and 1989) without ever winning the cup.</p>

Kilkenny and Tipperary are the first counties to benefit from the new format. Tipperary and Clare contest the first, and to date, only all Munster final under the new structure.</li>
<li>In the All-Ireland Semi-Final replay of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> between Clare and Offaly, referee Jimmy Cooney blows the whistle two minutes early. Offaly's players and supporters launch a sit-down protest on the pitch due to the fact that they were losing when the whistle was blown early. An extra replay was forced to be played, which Offaly won.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> a bookmaking firm exploits a loop-hole in the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a>'s Official Code and sponsors the hurleys of three players in an All-Ireland Semi-Final clash between Cork and Wexford. The rule is later amended to prevent any repeat of the incident.</li>
<li>In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> Final, Wexford trail Kilkenny by 1 points withs seconds to go. A block down on a Kilkenny clearance leads the ball to the hand of one of the Wexford forwards who scores a winning goal with the last puck of the ball.</li>
<li>The All-Ireland Final on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> was the first to be played at the fully refurbished <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croke_Park_ebdd.html" title="Croke Park">Croke Park</a>. The Cusack Stand, the Canal Stand, the Hogan Stand and the new Hill 16 and Nally End all have a combined capacity of 82,300. Unfortunately this capacity was not met due to ticketing errors in the GAA.</li>
