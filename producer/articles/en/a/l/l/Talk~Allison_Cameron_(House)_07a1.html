<p>I've noticed this article repeatedly being "corrected" when certain flaws of Cameron are mentioned. This article is a very, very pale imitation of the actual character in the show and will remain so as long as this stays the same. The rest of the characters of House's wikis are riddled with their weaknesses, yet this one is somehow completely clean of any outside of her softy-wofty side, which is a really, a small fraction of her character. <i>Cameron has flaws</i>, and simply wiping her wiki article of them isn't going to change that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>At the very least "She has also occasionally shown extreme reluctance to relate bad news to patients or their family" should be re-worded so that it doesn't read as confirmation of the first sentence in that paragraph "Cameron is the most empathetic member of House's team and possesses the best bedside manner." No other character in the show views this as either a healthy or helpful tendency of Cameron's (ie it's empathetic but not a good bedside manner or good practice), and I believe that most real world medical professionals wouldn't either. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThayvian_6dd4.html" title="User:Thayvian">Thayvian</a> 21:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Seriously, this page needs to be changed to show some faults she has. She stole confiscated meth from the hospital! She's caused significant pain to patients she doesn't like! Why is there nothing about that in the article? It talks about her co-workers' manipulations, but none of hers. But, what's the point of editing it if it's just going to be edited to say nothing bad about her? Waapplepie 02:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>A word weasel warning has been added until this is resolved. Anyone who has watched the show can recognize this is more or less a love letter to Cameron. Which would be fine if it portrayed an accurate version of the character <i>at all</i>. The Cameron written out here is a sickening Mary Sue. I'd rather not have to argue it, it seems obvious to me, but if anyone feels this is wrong, please, let's get to it.</b></p>

<p>Was is it meth or ecstasy she took before engaging in sexual relations with Dr. Chase?</p>
<p><br />
I believe that she was not on meth, but that she was on ecstasty. There was two types of drugs in the guy's bag - meth and ecstasy. Cameron, never having taken drugs before, would have most likely not have taken meth but have taken the ecstasy instead. My reasons for this are as such</p>
<p>- Cameron would see meth as much more trashy, eg. meth mouth, and never having taken drugs before, she would probably not choose meth as her fist choice. And also, meth would require that she chop it up and snort it up her nose or shoot it up, something she probably wouldn't do as her first experience with drugs, while ecstasy is just a pill you swallow</p>
<p>- Chase immediatly recognizes that her eyes are dialated which is stereotypical of ecstasy use</p>
<p>- While meth is used as a sexual stimulant, it is normally not the precipating factor that leads to sex but instead as an enhancer to prolong the intercourse; ecstasy on the other hand, is typically percieved as causing someone to become overwhelmed by the desire to love</p>
<p>It has been a while from when I saw the episode, but while I was watching I thought she was obviously on ecstasy. I might have missed something but I fairly sure it was ecstasy. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdw052_57b6.html" title="User:Jdw052">Jdw052</a> 06:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While it is true that Cameron has been called an atheist (and has even affirmed that, or if I remember correctly has not said anything against it), in the episode "Damned if you do" she said that she believes in a "higher order" of things. Hence, it would be more accurate to classify her as a mysitc instead of an atheist. While it is correct that mysticism and atheism are not mutually exclusive, the term atheist is more commonly used for someone who does not belief in any metaphysical guiding entities weather deity or higher order. In any case, since Cameron believes in a higher or of things, "mystic" is more precise than "atheist". So I move to change "-she is an atheist" to "-while having been called an atheist and having affirmed that, it is more precise to classify her as a mystic on the grounds that she stated that she believes in a "higher order" of things."</p>
<p>...with the references to the episode "Damned if you do" and one of those where she was called an atheist and affirmed that. -MikeB</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd think I'd disagree with that. A "higher order" does not even really imply a spirit, force, or the supernatural. In theory a "higher order" could just mean some as yet undiscovered physical law or a romantic reverence for nature itself that's not mystical. If anyone who believes in "a higher order" is to be classed as something other than atheist than there are many actual atheist who'd have to be reclassified. (I think even Dawkins believes in a higher force than humanity, but this doesn't mean any rejection of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_naturalism.html" title="Philosophical naturalism">philosophical naturalism</a>) Unless she says she's a mystic, deist, or pantheist I'd say leave it as is.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>-Atheism is believing that people are the highest form of being. Cameron believes in something higher. I believe it would be more correct to call her agnostic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Atheism is most certainly <i>not</i> the belief that people are the highest form of being. Atheism is the disbelief in the existence of deities. There's no specific requirement of disbelief in any higher creature, only that such could not be a deity. Similarly, agnosticism is the belief that deities are unknown or unknowable which again is not what Cameron claimed. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
