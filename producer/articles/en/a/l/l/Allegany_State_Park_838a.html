<p><b>Allegany State Park</b> is a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_park.html" title="State park">state park</a> in western <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_572b.html" title="New York State">New York State</a>, located in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattaraugus_County%2C_New_York_0b37.html" title="Cattaraugus County, New York">Cattaraugus County</a>, just north of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_National_Forest_7f77.html" title="Allegheny National Forest">Allegheny National Forest</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park.html" title="Park">park</a> is divided into two sections: The Red House Area and the Quaker Run Area.</p>
<p>The Red House Area is the northern half of Allegany State Park. It is usually considered to be the most developed area of the park. The Red House area's attractions include Stone Tower, the Summit Fire Tower, Red House Lake, Bridal Falls, and the Art Roscoe Ski Area. This section also contains several hiking trails and camp sites. The Red House area is the location of the Administration Building for the park.</p>
<p>The Quaker area is the southern section of the park. Its attractions include Quaker Lake, the Mount Tuskarora Fire Tower, hiking trails, Science lake, Bear Caves, Thunder Rocks, the Quaker Amphitheater, and of course several campsites. The Cain Hollow campground is located on the Quaker side of the park.</p>
<p>Allegany State Park is nicknamed the "Wilderness Playground of Western New York."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The 65,000 acre, Allegany State Park began on May 2, 1921, when an Act of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Legislature_024f.html" title="New York State Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> approved the purchase of a 7,000 acre tract of land in the Quaker Run Valley. The land was purchased for $50,000.00 (half of the money was raised locally as per the legislature agreement) on June 18, 1921. was purchased through the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland_Land_Company_b13d.html" title="Holland Land Company">Holland Land Company</a> in the Quaker Run Valley. The park was formally dedicated on July 30, 1921.</p>
<p>Albert T. Francher was appointed by New York Governor Nathen Miller to head a 5 member team to develop a vast park that continues to grow to this day. A converted schoolhouse (near the present day Quaker Inn) served as the park's first administration building, and World War I Army Surplus Tents, on 16'x16' wooden platforms were primarily used during the time between the park's creation until the completion of the first permanent <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabin.html" title="Cabin">cabins</a> in 1925.</p>
<p>The first State Park Bond Issue was passed in 1924, and provided funds for the development of the Redhouse Area, including the construction of the Redhouse Administration Building and the building of the Redhouse Dam, which created Redhouse Lake.</p>
<p>In 1926, Science Lake was built and offered the first official swimming area in the park. Adjoining the lake was the Allegany School Of Natural History, a group of 42 cabins, and a main building housing a library, several science laboratories, and an assembly room. The park was developed extensively between 1933 and 1942 when the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian_Conservation_Corps_8e19.html" title="Civilian Conservation Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>(CCC) took on the project of building roads, bridges, camping areas, trails, and picnic areas. The CCC was also were responsible for numerous conservation projects from reforestation to stream bank retention and wildlife improvements.</p>
<p>Through the years, the park was developed further with the addition of Quaker Lake, winterized cabins and full service cottages, hiking and snowmobile trails, picnic and recreation areas, bike and horse paths, and better roads enabling people to access Allegany State Park.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegany_State_Park_838a.html" title="Edit section: Dance Halls">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dance Halls</span></h3>
<p>Among some of the park's rich history is the <b>Old Quaker Dance Hall</b>. The dance hall was located off ASP 3, just over the creek from the Quaker Inn, near the Brow Cabin Trail and the Quaker Maintenance Area. Unfortunately the hall was torn down in 2002 due to its poor condition. Many dances occurred here through the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> era into the mid 1900s. Bands would play live music at the hall while scores of people danced on the large dance floor.</p>
<p>The <b>Redhouse Dance Pavilion</b> was located along Redhouse Lake, near the beach parking lot. The old dance hall was built upon the concrete barn floor of a farmer (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sharpe_40f4.html" title="John Sharpe">John Sharpe</a>) that formerly owned the land. As with the Quaker Dance Hall, weekend dances were held at the Redhouse Dance hall throughout the summer, from the 1920s through the rock n roll era. The Redhouse Dance Pavilion was last used for an Independence Day dance in 1973. The building then housed a game room until it was torn down in 1984. The Redhouse Miniature Golf Course now sits on the same concrete floor.</p>

<p>Also a part of the history is the settlement of New Ireland (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrollton%2C_New_York_99a4.html" title="Carrollton, New York">Carrollton, New York</a>) which was formed in the early 1900s near <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone%2C_New_York_3fa4.html" title="Limestone, New York">Limestone, New York</a>. The village since was incorporated into Limestone, New York, and no longer exists. Ruins of the old village are still visible and are accessible off of the Limestone Run Road.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegany_State_Park_838a.html" title="Edit section: Park Fire Towers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Park Fire Towers</span></h3>
<p>Due to the danger of forest fires, and the damage caused by them in New York State Parks, three <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_lookout_tower.html" title="Fire lookout tower">fire lookout towers</a> were constructed. The first; Summit Fire Tower; was completed in 1926. It stands 66 feet tall. The other fire towers were the Mt. Tuscarora Fire Tower located in the Quaker Area, and the Mt. Irvine Fire Tower located in the Rice Brook (Limestone) area. The Mt. Tuscarora Fire Tower still stands today, near Quaker Lake. The Mt. Irvine Fire Tower, however, was disassembled by the park and moved near the Bradford, PA entrance. When all the fire towers were abandoned in favor of aerial surveillance in 1971, the Mt. Irvine tower was the only one taken down by park personnel in the early 1970s. It was saved however, when reassembled by a BOCES class in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellicottville%2C_New_York_9ecb.html" title="Ellicottville, New York">Ellicottville, New York</a>. <a href="http://www.asphs.org" class="external text" title="http://www.asphs.org" rel="nofollow">The Allegany State Park Historical Society</a> has formed a committee which has undertaken the task of restoring and preserving the park's fire towers. Information on the restoration project is available on their website.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegany_State_Park_838a.html" title="Edit section: Gas Lease">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gas Lease</span></h3>
<p>Contained within the park off France Brook Road is a large storage pool for <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_Gas_a9ce.html" title="Natural Gas">Natural Gas</a>. Formerly a large <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_well.html" title="Gas well">gas well</a>, the Limestone Storage Pool is operated by <a href="http://www.nationalfuelgas.com" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalfuelgas.com" rel="nofollow">National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation.</a> National Fuel leases rights to maintain and operate the 20+ wells it uses to store and regulate the natural gas it stores in the massive underground <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandstone.html" title="Sandstone">sandstone</a> deposit. The storage pool is connected to the "K" line which is a 16 foot gas <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipeline_transport.html" title="Pipeline transport">pipeline</a> that runs from <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo, New York</a> to <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldred%2C_Pennsylvania_b69f.html" title="Eldred, Pennsylvania">Eldred, Pennsylvania</a>. The pool is regulated by equipment located in a <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_compressor.html" title="Gas compressor">compression</a> station situated on the access road near the Bova Ski Area and Camp Allegany. The gas stored in this pool is utilized by the park (which it receives for free as part of the agreement), and by local industry in the area requiring high pressure, high volume gas supply. The rest of the gas is used on the K line for distribution in New York and Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegany_State_Park_838a.html" title="Edit section: Park Roads">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Park Roads</span></h2>
<p>The park uses a system of 3 main roads linking the Red House area and the Quaker Run area, and serving as major thoroughfares in the Red House and Quaker Run Areas. These roads are called:</p>
<p><b>Allegany State Park Route 1</b> (ASP1); which runs North to South, through the middle of the park. ASP 1 runs between the park's entrance from exit 21 of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_86_%28east%29.html" title="Interstate 86 (east)">Interstate 86</a> (formerly <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Route_17_99e0.html" title="New York State Route 17">New York State Route 17</a>, aka the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Tier_Expressway_d58e.html" title="Southern Tier Expressway">Southern Tier Expressway</a>) in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamanca_%28city%29%2C_New_York_2b53.html" title="Salamanca (city), New York">Salamanca</a>, to its intersection with ASP 3 in the Quaker Run Area near the Quaker Rental Office. ASP1 also intersects with ASP2 by Redhouse Lake. During the winter months, due to its winding nature, ASP 1 is shut down and used only as a snowmobile trail.</p>
<p><b>Allegany State Park Route 2</b> (ASP2); which runs North to South as well, but more toward the Eastern side of Allegany. ASP 2 runs from exit 19 of I-86 in the town of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_House%2C_New_York_0be5.html" title="Red House, New York">Red House, New York</a>, to its intersection with ASP 3 at the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford%2C_Pennsylvania_810d.html" title="Bradford, Pennsylvania">Bradford, Pennsylvania</a> entrance of the park. ASP2 also intersects with ASP1 by Redhouse Lake. ASP2 to ASP 3 is the sole automobile road between Red House and Quaker Run within Allegany State Park, during the winter months, because of the closure of ASP 1.</p>
<p><b>Allegany State Park Route Route 3</b> (ASP3); which runs West to East. ASP 3 runs from the termination of ASP 2 near the Bradford entrance, to the park's Quaker Run entrance in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldspring%2C_New_York_b4ad.html" title="Coldspring, New York">Coldspring, New York</a>; from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Route_280_a79d.html" title="New York State Route 280">New York State Route 280</a> which is also connected to I-86 via exit 18. Because of the closure of ASP 1, ASP3 to ASP 2 is the sole automobile road between Red House and Quaker Run during the winter months.</p>
<p><br />
There are also a few paved <b>secondary roads</b> in Allegany State Park, these are:</p>
<p><b>Quaker Lake Road</b> runs from its intersection with ASP 3 (about 1 mile east of the Quaker Entrance) around the North East side of Quaker Lake to just past the Quaker Beach.</p>
<p><b>Cain Hollow Road</b>, which goes from Quaker Lake Road (just north of ASP 3) into the Cain Hollow Campground.</p>
<p><b>Allegany State Park Route 2A</b> (ASP2A) runs along the southern shore of Red House Lake between ASP1 and ASP2.</p>
<p><b>Friends Boat Launch Access Road</b> is entered from outside the park, off of NY280, about 2 miles north of the Quaker Entrance. This road leads to the boat launch onto the Allegheny Reservoir, near the site of the old "Tunesassa School"(Indian School)</p>
<p>The park also has many <b>minor access roads</b> contained within it. These usually are dirt roads that go unmaintained during winter months, but otherwise range from good condition to rough condition. These roads include&#160;:</p>
<p><b>Bay State Road</b> which goes from its intersection with ASP1 (about midpoint between Red House Lake and ASP3, by the former Big Basin Ski Area) north into the Town of Redhouse (near Lonkto and Beck Hollows).</p>
<p><b>France Brook Road</b>, goes from its intersection with ASP2 (near Group Camp 10, about 5 miles South of Red House Lake) to where it intersects with ASP1 (near Bay State Road)</p>
<p><b>Ridge Run Road</b> starts at its intersection with ASP2 (about 1 mile North of the Bradford Entrance) and follows a ridge north to Thunder Rocks. Ridge Run Road is the Main Entrance to Thunder Rocks</p>
<p><b>Limestone Run Road</b> goes from its intersection with ASP2 (by France Brook Road) to the Village of Limestone NY on the eastern side of Allegany. About mid way though this road intersects with Ridge Run Road (the entrance way to Thunder Rocks). During the summer, Limestone Run Road serves as the eastern Entrance to Allegany State Park, from Limestone.</p>
<p><b>Coon Run Road</b> runs south from it intersection with ASP3 (just east of the Quaker Inn) into the State of Pennsylvania and the Allegheny National Forest.</p>
<p><b>Wolf Run Road</b>, is entered outside the park from NY280 (about 1 1/2 miles south of the Quaker Entrance) It follows a southern path into the State of Pennsylvania and the Allegheny National Forest.</p>
<p><b>Holt Run Road</b>, is also entered off of NY280 (about 2 miles North of the Quaker Entrance, across from the Friends Boat Launch</p>
<p><b>Bova Ski Hill Access Road</b> cuts off of ASP2 at the fork in the road about 1/2 mile South of Red House Lake (by Camp Allegany), and runs east for about 1 mile (past the former Red House garbage dump) to the old Bova Ski Area.</p>
<p><b>Stone Tower Access Road</b> is a loop that runs from ASP1, by the Art Rosco Ski Area,(near Summit Cabins, about 1 1/2 miles South of the Salamanca Entrance) around past <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Tower_e86e.html" title="Stone Tower">Stone Tower</a> and back to ASP1 (about 4 miles North of Red House Lake)</p>
<p>The roads within the <b>cabin trails</b> (mentioned below) also are dirt roads, however they are maintained during the winter to keep access to the cabins opened. One exception to this is Ryan trail in the Red House Area. The cabin trail's road is too steep to allow vehicular traffic during the winter, consequently the trail remains closed for the winter months.</p>

<p>Allegany State Park offers 18 hiking trails of various lengths and difficulties available for use year round. Six of the trails are part of the Art Roscoe Ski Touring Area. The trails within this system are groomed for <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-country_skiing.html" title="Cross-country skiing">cross-country skiing</a> during the winter months, and are unavailable for hiking. The Ridgerun trail, which is part of the system, features a leanto. The Art Roscoe trails are located near Summit in the Red House Area. In addition to these trails, The Allegheny Highlands Snowmobile and Horse Trail begins in the park off ASP 2. Another unique bragging right the park has is that the famous <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Country_Trail_8dd6.html" title="North Country Trail">North Country Trail</a> passes through it. The North Country Trail is a 4000+ mile trail that spans through New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and terminates in North Dakota. Allegany State Park's 18 mile section of the trail includes 4 leantos, two in the Quaker Area, and the other two in the Red House area. The Black Snake Mountain trail is also unique due to its direct contact with the Pennsylvania state line. One of the attractions on this trail is a concrete marker shows the exact line where New York and Pennsylvania meet. It is short enough that one could sit on the marker, and be in two states at once. Many other attractions are viewable on or from the trails listed below. In the Quaker Area, the Tornado Trail tours the damage area caused by an F-1 <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornado.html" title="Tornado">Tornado</a> on August 28, 1990. Though much of the area has regrown, you can still see the path that was cut by the tornado; which was 1 of 4 to occur that day in Western New York. Here is a list of the hiking trails and their lengths:</p>
