<p>The New Testament is Koine Greek (a sort of colloquial ancient greek) in the original. Therefore what the Hebrew for Jesus actually is is entirely a matter of supposition.</p>
<p>It could be Yeshua, which roughly makes sense as having become Iesous (the greek), but Yeshua is just a pet name for Yehoshua, in the same way that Liz is a pet name for Elizabeth, so the formal Hebrew name could just as easily have been Yehoshua. You see the problem is, Jesus isn't actually written down in Hebrew in the bible, or anywhere else in the appropriate time period, for that matter, in a manner that it is guaranteed to being the Hebrew for Jesus.</p>
<p>Thus Jesus ben Nun is perfectly plausible as translating into Yehoshua ben Nun when converting into Hebrew. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 01:34, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.s. disambiguation pages are not meant to be NPOV, they are for people who might be looking for something else, or might wonder what else shares the same title or name, or is thought to do so by others.</p>
<p>P.p.s Shawn is a phonetic variation on Sean, completely missing the point. Sean is the same word as John, spelt according to Gaelic pronunciation rules, so that when assumed as a Gaelic word, it is pronounced "John". In the same way Seamus is actually just James. etc. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 01:34, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My IP address is 64.12.117.8. You have blocked me from editing entries due to "vandalism, pov edits," which I believe is in error, since I am very new here and haven't contributed much so far. Any enhancements or new entries I've made haven't been challenged or changed by anyone, so it seems this block is a mistake. Could you please rectify this situation ASAP?

<p>Sent via: Via Electronic Delivery Re: Demand to Cease and Desist and Retract Libel</p>
<p>December 19, 2005</p>
<p><br />
Dear Wikimedia Foundation Inc:</p>
<p>This agency represents Nico Demonte and we have been asked to write this letter to you. Many of your statements about Nico Demonte in your web and e-mail postings are untrue and defamatory. You made them maliciously to injure Nico Demonte in his trade, office and profession. As such, they are defamatory per se. Under O.C.G.A. 51-5-11, this letter constitutes a demand for immediate retraction in writing of these false and libelous statements. In accordance with O.C.G.A 51-5-11(b)(1)(C), Nico Demonte demands that your retraction and correction be accompanied by an editorial in which you specifically repudiated your libelous statements.</p>
<p>As you neither asked for nor received permission to use his biography, as the basis for Nico Demonteâ€™s trade, office, or profession, nor to make or distribute copies, including electronic copies, of same, I believe you have willfully infringed upon Nico Demonte's rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. and could be liable for statutory damages as high as $150,000 as set forth in Section 504(c)(2) therein.</p>
<p>Your web postings and conduct also constitute tortuous interference with the business and contractual relations of Nico Demonte. As such, they are actionable and expose you to the imposition of compensatory as well as punitive damages.</p>
<p>Below, we have noted some of the more patent, malicious, and libelous comments made by you, Wikipediaâ€™s members, editors, and your representatives in your e-mails; some of them also evidence your tortuous interference. If Nico Demonte is forced to file suit to stop your wrongful conduct, he will also seek an award of his attorney fees and litigation expenses.</p>
<p><br />
1. In your postings, â€“ you and/or your editors have stated that Nico Demonte is a Non-notable artist. This is patently false.</p>
<p>2. In your postings, you consistently and falsely stated Nico Demonte "added a lot of his stuff there." Your comments about this are false and malicious.</p>
<p>3. On the subject of Nico Demonte's biography you stated that "I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation." Your malicious attempt to interfere with Nico Demonte's business and contractual relations with Astley PR has damaged Nico Demonte for which you are liable in damages.</p>
<p>4. You incorrectly stated and inferred that Nico Demonte's is responsible for so-called "Vandalism" on Wikipedia's website. This is patently false.</p>
<p>5. In one of your postings, you referenced an article on Nico Demonte and claim with no basis in fact that it is similar to Nico Demonteâ€™s biography on Discomusic.com. Your comments about this are false and malicious.</p>
<p>6. In a web posting you stated: "For Nico Demonte, however, he added a lot of his stuff there, without Wiki formatting or anything, just like we saw already. I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation, and well, looks like it really is. That text comes straight from this page, and as you can see in the bottom, the content is indeed copyrighted. Now unless he is Bernard F. Lopez himself, it is a violation." Your contact with Nico Demonte constitutes tortuous interference in Nico Demonte relations and contract with Astley PR. There is no basis in fact for your malicious comments. This is patently false.</p>
<p>Many of these errors have been previously brought to your attention. Your failure to correct your erroneous and false statements and their reputation after notice of their falsehood constitutes further publication of libel. It also confirms your malicious intent to maliciously injure Nico Demonte in his trade, office and profession..</p>
<p>I demand that you immediately cease the use and distribution of all infringing information derived from the Nico Demonteâ€™s biography, and all copies, including electronic copies, of same, that you deliver to me, if applicable, all unused, undistributed copies of same, or destroy such copies immediately and that you desist from this or any other infringement of Nico Demonteâ€™s copyrighted works, information, images, reputation, and recordings. If you do not immediately publish the requested retraction, and cease and desist from tortuous interference and making false and malicious comments about Nico Demonte, his copyrighted works, biography, recordings, likenesses, and reputation, we will file suit against you. Please govern yourself accordingly. If I have not received an affirmative response from you by January 1, 2006, indicating that you have fully complied with these requirements, we shall take further action against you.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Anna Astley</p>

<p>Hello. Seems like our little Kraftwerk/Demonte enthusiast is back on track. He edited those two articles again, though I'm not sure if the things he put there are necessarily bad or not. For <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraftwerk.html" title="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>, it's just a covers external link. Seems harmless to be. Not much of vanity or anything. For Nico Demonte, however, he added a lot of his stuff there, without Wiki formatting or anything, just like we saw already. I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation, and well, looks like it really is. That text comes straight from <a href="http://www.discomusic.com/people-more/3589_0_11_0_M76/" class="external text" title="http://www.discomusic.com/people-more/3589_0_11_0_M76/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, and as you can see in the bottom, the content is indeed copyrighted. Now unless he is Bernard F. Lopez himself, it is a violation.</p>

<p>I know this could be just a confused user, but the way he insists with his edits without paying attention to what we say, he's probably just being annoying and vandalizing. I've just been granted sysop powers (five days after you, it seems), so I'm still trying to learn how to deal with certain things. I noticed you protected those pages before, but looks like the standard proceeding regarding repeated vandalism by a single user to a group of articles is to deal <i>with the user</i>, not the pages, since protection of pages is nocive to Wikipedia and should usually be avoided. But that's alright, don't worry.</p>
<p>About the user, I'd do something right now, but I'm not very sure, and since you're aware of what he's being doing, perhaps I could ask your opinion. What do you think?</p>

<p>I decided to block him for three days, after thinking about what you said. Sounds more appropriate to me. I didn't warn him again, since it looks like he had plenty of warnings.

<p>Hi AllyUnion,</p>
<p>I spotted your comments on the Village pump with regards to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Grammar_778d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Grammar">Wikipedia:WikiProject Grammar</a>. This morning I came across a mildly interesting grammar question at ' <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Ships_0033.html#.22The.22_before_the_ship.27s_name" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ships">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Ships#"The" before the ship's name</a> ', which might interest you. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 20:55, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Pun intended). It seems to me that the proper way to address <b>the</b> problem is simply, as discussed, include 'the' when you do not have the ship's full name, i.e. USN Lexington. For some famous ships, it might not be necessarily included. I recommend to include it for readibility and to make it clear that you are speaking of a noun which is mostly likely an object, rather than a person. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 05:54, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, but many on the WikiProject Ships seem to have decided the opposite and are now systematically removing 'the's from articles on ships. One of the worst examples I have found so far is the article on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Rose_f430.html" title="Mary Rose">Mary Rose</a> - in the past couple of months that article has expanded a fair bit, but all references to the Mary Rose have had the 'the' removed. To me, it now reads very poorly. Elsewhere, the Mary Rose nearly always includes the definite article. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 06:27, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't answer that question directly. However, I was first alerted to the issue when the <a href="../../../g/o/y/Goya_%28ship%29.html" title="Goya (ship)">Goya (ship)</a> article was changed a couple of days ago. According to <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">User:gdr</a>'s figures on the <a href="../../../g/o/y/Talk%7EGoya_%28ship%29_d649.html" title="Talk:Goya (ship)">talk page</a> there, the ratio of common usage for 'The Mary Rose' vs. 'Mary Rose' is 12:1. On the other hand I don't know what Google searches he was trying - I would have thought they were quite a difficult searches to construct accurately. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:25, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If we take a look at the dictionary (www.dictionary.com) definition for "the":</p>

<dd>I noticed. That more or less corresponds to the last comment there from <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">User:Stan_Shebs</a>. However, it is perhaps too prescriptive the opposite way. It certainly seems acceptable to loose the 'the' when personifying a ship, and in particular when describing a blow by blow account of naval battles. Also with quotes like this, it is a good idea to mention which dictionary you are trusting as there is no single 'the dictionary'. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 08:01, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, /Log is certainly a better plan than shifting in midstream to VfD/debate/Jow Bloe. And probably -- despite my impulse to say "gee, it's a shame we didn't start out doing VfD/debate/..." -- the best solution that could be hoped for without a top-heavy software-design plan.</p>
<p>I still don't have a sense of having gotten the viewpoint of the comments right, but i'm getting closer; as i get more used to the implications of the doubly nested structure (hey, was i the first to suggest that?), i should be able to get to a point where i grasp what the <i>current</i> mistakes are, that get users into the bind of editing VfD on one hand or the day on the other when they want to nominate a page for VfD or add a point to the debate. At the moment, i'm still "planning to win the previous war".</p>

<p>It could have been a useful idea if it had been implemented when the topic stubs were first created. I think that it could still possibly be a useful way of doing thing in the future if someone would spend the time with a Wiki-bot to "fix" the stub name/category name disconnect (I assume there must have been some reason for that disconnect, but I can't figure out the reason, and I haven't seen any discussions in the archives on why things were done the way they were). I probably wouldn't have laid into the proposal so hard in the TfD discussion if he hadn't YELLED and then <b>SHOUTED</b> at everyone. <a href="../../../g/k/_/User%7EGK_aed0.html" title="User:GK">gK</a> <a href="../../../g/k/_/User_talk%7EGK_b00e.html" title="User talk:GK">Â¿?</a> 03:41, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The history of stub sorting went as follows... <a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> created the bio-stub back in 25 Jul 2004. Since then, I added geo-stub, then other people added more stubs, and it just kept growing. So the set precident was multiple stubs. What Norman was suggesting did radically change the entire structure of stub sorting, but his suggestion comes far too late. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 05:52, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>re:"use full names for stubs, perhaps?" You mean biography-stub instead of bio-stub? Would that be fairly easy to fix with one of the Wikibots? And what about trying to make the stub names match category names? (And even regularizing a few of the non-"standard" stub names like mathbiostub and Ireland-place-stub instead of Ireland-geo-stub?) <a href="../../../g/k/_/User%7EGK_aed0.html" title="User:GK">gK</a> <a href="../../../g/k/_/User_talk%7EGK_b00e.html" title="User talk:GK">Â¿?</a> 08:02, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
