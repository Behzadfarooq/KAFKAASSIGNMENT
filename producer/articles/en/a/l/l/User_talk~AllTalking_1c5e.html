<p>I was blocked for putting a public domain image on Wikipedia, so I won't be contributing anymore articles. I was hoping to complete the pages for the early Technicolor films as well as other early talkies. Unfortunately that isnt going to happen now.

<p>So that's the thanks I get for all the pages I contributed. THE DAMN IMAGE IS PUBLIC DOMAIN. I will contribute my time eslewhere where it is appreciated. Goodbye and Good Riddance.AllTalking 01:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We need more proof that the image is in Public Domain though, as far as I see, it's not. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a> <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 20:35, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AllTalking, I sincerely hope that you take your 24hs ban free time to cool down think things cleary. Your comments on the <i>Edit Summaries</i> of your last changes to the image we're not exactly civil nor serene. I expect you to understand that I would like to have that image to be used on Wikipedia almost as much as you do. And that's why I cared so much about assuring it has a correct image copyright tag. Images that lack verifyable source and licensing information end up being removed from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly, it seems that we do not have enough evidence that image is Public Domain. If it was really published in 1930 as you say, as of my understanding of the text on {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-US_e8fa.html" title="Template:PD-US">PD-US</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old_4083.html" title="Template:PD-old">PD-old</a>}}, someone still keeps it's copyrights.</p>
<p>Also, I don't really see how that image could be useful under a fair use claim. It's not a notable image, so, it's unlikely we would be discussing it on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As a last note, I apologize for not noticing earlier that your we're loosing your mind on the issue. I should have contacted you directly here on your talk before. At the time I though we were doing good on our limited communication and I never expected that reaction from you. I feel guilt for lettig that happen. All I can say is that I really expect to be working again with you soon. You'll remove that good-bye notice from this page and find a thousand free images to be used on all Wikipedias. Best wishes, --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 03:40, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AllTalking, if you promise to cooperate with Abu Badali or anybody else in finding the correct license tag for this image, I will unblock you. As a person who uploaded ~900images to the enwiki and commons and still not completely familiar with all the details of the licensing, I understand your frustration, but people on image patrol are the wrong folks to vent our frustration to. As you are understand they are the same volunteers as you and me and deserve praising for their extremely needed work not the attacks and revert warring. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 05:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
