<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows%27_Middle_School_c36c.html" title="Edit section: Middle School History 1861 - 2006">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Middle School History 1861 - 2006</span></h2>
<p>All Hallows' School had a Middle School / Primary School from 1861 until 1979. In fact in 1861, Mother Vincent Whitty, the founder of All Hallows' School noted that the ages of students at All Hallows' ranged from "five years to late teens" (Mahoney, 1985, p5). Wartime concerns however led to the temporary closure of the Junior School in December 1944.</p>
<p>In a prophesy of more recent times, community pressure mounted to re-open what is now the AHS Middle School. In 1952 this community pressure "could no longer be disregarded" and the so-called "junior" school re-opened (Mahoney, 1985, p.248).</p>
<p>Initially this Junior School was located in the basement of <i>Adderton</i> building before moving to the more pleasant surrounds of <i>Coolock</i> - an area overlooking the Kangaroo Point Reach of the Brisbane River. By April 1952, the precursor of today's Middle School, had moved to <i>Nazareth</i>, a school house and grounds on the site of what is now the Loretto and Mercy Hall complex. In 1979, Nazareth became the All Hallows' art centre until it was removed to make way for the new Celestine Complex.</p>
<p>In 1979, despite community sadness, the Middle School section closed as All Hallows' began to refocus the school upon secondary education. After significant community pressure over numerous years and at the completion of an exhaustive process of consultation with other schools and educational authorities, the Middle School re-opened in 2006 with an intake of 150 year 5 and 6 students. These students were to find their home in a refurbished state-of-the art McAuley Hall.</p>
<p>McAuley Hall was initially built in 1957-8 as the McAuley Training College, a religious based teacher training insitute. In time, the McAuley College would expand and relocate to <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoggera.html" title="Enoggera">Enoggera</a> as McAuley College. In the 1990s, it would move again to Banyo as the central component of Queensland's home of Catholic education in the tertiary sector, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Catholic_University_5213.html" title="Australian Catholic University">Australian Catholic University</a> (McAuley Campus).</p>
<p>Current Middle School girls would be interested to know that the lawns on which they lunch were the original location of an aviary and guinea pig hutch which were much beloved by Junior School girls as McAuley Hall was built in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>In 2007, the All Hallows' Middle School further expanded as it reintroduced year 7 students. Middle School students, nick-named "Blue Sox", have been embraced by the All Hallows' School community and have added a greater vitality and excitment to education at the School.</p>

<p>Despite opposition from some systemic schools within the Brisbane Catholic Education, the All Hallows' Middle School was re-established with the support of Archbishop John Bathersby in order to provide greater choice to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> families within Brisbane who wished for their daughters to be educated in an all girl environment. Such an opportunity for single sex schooling had been offered to male students within the Brisbane Archdiocese for many years. Catholic girls in Brisbane had not had such an opportunity however.</p>
<p>The re-establishment of the Middle School by All Hallows' in 2006 was, therefore, greeted with great enthusiasm by many members of the Brisbane Catholic community and enrolment at this premier educational institution for girls became highly sought after. All Hallows' School found that it rapidly had numbers of applicants for enrolment well beyond the number of places available.</p>
<p>Embracing current educational theory and pedagogy, students of the All Hallows' Middle School experience a wide variety of age appropriate, yet challenging, learning experiences within a high professional educational context. All students within the School are highly familiar with information technology and they make use of this technology in their studies each day.</p>
<p>Located within the inner City of Brisbane, All Hallows' Middle School emphasises the ongoing safety and security of its students.</p>
<p>Many students attending the AHS Middle School have older sisters within the Secondary section of All Hallows' School.</p>
