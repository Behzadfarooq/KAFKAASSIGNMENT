<p>Israeli terrorism goes without punishment, they think they are the chosen people for some strange reasen, they will perish horribley in hell for the crimes they commit against the innocent. They kill the unarmed after stealing their land what goes around comes around and when it comes around its going to be most panifull, and may i add areil sharon is feeling that pain in his coma where his body might be on earth his mind and soul is occupied with hell , i is in no doubt that the good lord is showing him how long he's going to be feeling the pain of hell at this moment in time.</p>

<dd>Among the most famous cases of the killing of innocents are the cases of the deaths of Ian Hook, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Corrie_2413.html" title="Rachel Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hurndall_05a0.html" title="Tom Hurndall">Tom Hurndall</a>. While their deaths made headlines because they weren't Palestinian, Israel's <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin_Bet_146e.html" title="Shin Bet">Shin Bet</a> sercurity service determined that of the 2,341 people killed by the IDF, only 551 were bearing arms or explosives (about 23%). Given that in many cases Palestinians and international observers have reported that Palestinians were armed when they weren't (such as the case of <a href="http://www.palsolidarity.org/reports/writings/15Mar03_JeninJenin.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.palsolidarity.org/reports/writings/15Mar03_JeninJenin.htm" rel="nofollow">Hisham Amer</a> <a href="http://www.palsolidarity.org/reports/writings/1Mar03_JeninLasseSchmidt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.palsolidarity.org/reports/writings/1Mar03_JeninLasseSchmidt.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, who was killed with a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_point.html" title="Hollow point">hollow point</a> bullet), this number may be notably lower still.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Rachel Corrie case -- is the article calling this a "crime against humanity"? I thought she purposely stepped in front of a bulldozer that was demolishing a house.</p>
<p>Was it Corrie's death, or the demolishing itself, which is a "crime"? And who made the accusation?</p>
<p>I'm not taking sides -- just asking that the POV be attributed to its advocate. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 21:12, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for Rachel, her death was caused by an accident. An investagation found that the bulldozer driver didn't see her. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarOfDavid_8e03.html" title="User:StarOfDavid">MathKnight</a> 22:12, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>The fact that Israel virtually never punishes their soldiers for the acts they commit in the Intifada is discussed, and an Amnesty International article is referenced.

<dd>Actually, that photo was about 1 hour beforehand, not "2-5 hours". The bulldozer that crushed her (serial number 949623) *approached* (and somehow didn't see her in the approach), then started plowing a pile of debris toward her. She then stood on *top* of the debris (which you can see in several pictures is typically about half the height of the blade), and continued waving her hands (her head, on top of the pile, was well above the blade, and her arms were (of course) even higher). Please explain to me how a driver approached a person (she moved into the path about 15 meters in front of the bulldozer before setting) wearing a bright red jacket who was waving her hands, never once saw her, , nor saw the people who tried to run toward her to stop it. How does that happen? Does the IDF hire blind bulldozer drivers now? <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<dd>ISM eyewitness acount were self-contardictionary. Some claim she stood, some claim she knelt before the bulldozer. I saw the movie from the incident - and it was clearly seen that Rachel wasn't on the top of the pile. I don't from do you derived those "facts" but the ISM and Palestinian media aren't a reliable press. Unless you believe Israel giving radioactive candies to Palestinian killed, or that Shalhevet Pas ( a baby girl that was shot dead in Hebron by Palestinian sniper) was killed by her father - according to the official Palestinian radio. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarOfDavid_8e03.html" title="User:StarOfDavid">MathKnight</a> 20:37, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Demonstrate this "self-contradictory" reporting - go on, I directly challenge you. Every single case that I have seen reports that she knelt/sat, for the entire time that it approached (in her bright red jacket), and when it got close to her (i.e., when she would no longer be visible), she stood up and climbed to the top of the pile. The pictures back this behavior out. And what video on earth are you talking about? I could go on for ages about your post: The ISM is not "Palestinian press", but they do issue reports (mostly by the international volunteers, because their main audience is in the western world) (challenge: find one thing that they've reported incorrectly); it's a volunteer organization, and anyone can go become part of it (and I've known people who have; they got some great pictures of shot-up ambulences after a raid, and of IDF soldiers shooting at kids' kites for fun (the kites were designed to look like the Palestinian flag, since -flying their own national flag- is banned in the OT by the IDF as an incitement)). The ISM has never reported anything related to "radioactive candies" (which, given a web search, it appears that Zionists are the only ones pushing that claim: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22radioactive+candy%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22radioactive+candy%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22radioactive+candies%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22radioactive+candies%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> , nor have they reported on the baby of <a href="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:tP1Ex8XejTIJ:www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/388505.html+%22Shalhevet+Pas%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:tP1Ex8XejTIJ:www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/388505.html+%22Shalhevet+Pas%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">convicted weapons smuggler</a> Yitzak Pas. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<dd>Well, as for <i>The ISM has never reported anything related to "radioactive candies"</i> - I didn't claim ISM used this blood libel but the Palestinian media, as been reported in <a href="http://.www.wafa.pna.net/EngText/21-05-2001/page014.htm" class="external text" title="http://.www.wafa.pna.net/EngText/21-05-2001/page014.htm" rel="nofollow">Wafa - the official PA news agency</a>: "Israel has started a new genocide against the Palestinian people by poisoning them, using poisoned candy bags dropped down from airplanes." As for Pass, I told you that the report appeared on Palestinian radio. The ISM are not innocent volunteers but a pro-Palestinian group who aids terror and serve Palestinian propoganda. For example, in their offices in Jenin, an <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Jihad_cb44.html" title="Islamic Jihad">Islamic Jihad</a> terrorist was arrested by the IDF. As for <i>"self-contradictory" reporting</i> I send you to the Discuss page of the article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Corrie_2413.html" title="Rachel Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a>.

<dd>Um, hello! We were just talking about the reliability of the ISM's reporting - what do you think you were doing by referencing things that they *didn't* report if not trying to smear them? I'll also note that you didn't give a single example of something that they reported incorrectly - in short, you failed my direct challenge to you. The ISM *are* volunteers, and they're peaceniks - the ISM volunteers I've known have come completely from the peace community, and have been avid followers of nonviolent civil disobedience. Go ahead - don't believe it - you're free to not believe reality if you so choose.</dd>

<dd>Why must you rely on attempting to distort everything to try and match your view? (for example, lumping the ISM's reporting in with WAFAs, even though they're not at all related). Quote1: What, peaceniks advising civility in conversation?! Whoda guessed? Quote2: Of course they have a right to legitimate armed struggle. So do the Israelis. Don't pretend that the word legitimate isn't in there. And now, notice, you change from: "The ISM are not innocent volunteers but a pro-Palestinian group who aids terror" to "they do support Palestinian violence". No. They support the right for Palestinians to resist within the boundaries of the Geneva conventions and other international law (and again, I'll mention, that they do *regularly* condemn suicide bombings on their email list). They themselves do not take part or offer support, however, to even that. They're peaceniks. As for your "an Islamic Jhad terrorist" line, did you not read a word that I wrote about that? Including the IDF link where they describe how the suspect was fleeing them, and that their other spots to check for where the suspect may have fled to were the Red Cross and Physicians Without Borders? Are those aid agencies terrorist-lovers also in your worldview? DId you bother to release the ISM's description of the event from before the IDF said who he was?

<dd>They don't support violence. They do support the *right* to resist within the boundaries of the Geneva conventions (do you *not* support their right to resist within the boundaries of the Geneva Conventions?), but do not take part in it themselves - they *constantly* advocate nonviolent resistance as the best way to achieve the goal. Anyone who claims otherwise is denying almost everything that they've ever written and almost everything that their members have stated. The ISM does not use people as human shields - they do, however, enter dangerous situations to render aid which is completely legal under international law. Most of their actions involve escorting nonviolent activities - peaceful protests, children moving to and from school (which is what Tom Hurndall was shot while doing), and olive harvesting. You say "You can bring me as many ISM reports as you want - they worth nothing as they are anti-Israeli biased propoganda." We're discussing what the *ISM Believes* - ISM reports are exactly what you need in a discussion of what the ISM believes (if you'd like, I could get an ISM member or two to discuss the issue with you on here directly). "Stop saying that violence is peace" - what on earth are you talking about? They take part in *nonviolent activities*, and only *recognize* the right for resistance *within the boundaries of international law* and they do NOT take part in it. What will it take to get this through your head? Will you *ever* provide any sort of evidence to back up your off-the-wall views? Seing as I know people who've been in the ISM and have talked with them about their time there, I'd say I'm a bit more qualified to discuss this than you. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

You then (I assume because you don't know any better) reference the arrest of Shadi Sukia. Are you aware that the IDF themselves reported that he was fleeing IDF searches (which nabbed one of his accomplices), and that their other suspected locations to look for Salah were the Red Cross and Physicians Without Borders (Medica Sans Frontiers) <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0n8c0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0n8c0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>?

<dd>"One of the volunteers went into the hallway to see what was happening and met a young man coming up the stairs. He looked terrified, was soaking wet and appeared to be in pain. Concerned about his welfare (under Israeli military curfew, Palestinians spotted in the streets are shot on site) he was brought into the apartment. He spoke only Arabic, which none of the ISM volunteers present understood. He was given a change of clothes, a hot drink and a blanket... Eventually the military knocked on the ISM door and 30 soldiers entered with their machine guns trained. They arrested the young man, claiming he was wanted. The two women were not able to prevent the soldiers from taking the young man, whose name they did not even know, but requested that he be treated humanely."</dd>

However, you can find those words all over the net. Where? Zionist sites. I.e., zionists are the only ones pushing that. I should add that Israel is the country that, while having the world's 4th largest nuclear arsenal and even having *pictures* taken of their nuclear weaponry production and engaging in an elaborate sting operation to arrest the scientist who leaked them (Mordechai Vanunu), while having a major scandal with the US when they first developed them, while publicly developing missiles whose sole purpose is to carry nuclear warheads, continues to adimantly insist that they have none.

Did thousands of people, a measurable portion of an entire city, over a process of several months, steadily booby trap every house on the south side of the city as a goal to make themselves homeless?

<dd>"Did thousands of people", no. Hundreds of terrorists did that. Five armed terrorist can booby-trap tens of houses. The terrorist themselves are not living in the houses they use for terrorism, that's why they doesn't care if they would be destroyed because of the terrorist activity. More over, civilian redisdents of Rafah attacked PA officials as a protest against their lack of actions against the smuggling tunnels. In one case they set on fire a house which hosted a smuggling tunnel. Even they understand that the blame of the distruction lies on Hamas, Jihad and the terrorist networks who use them as "Human Shield". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarOfDavid_8e03.html" title="User:StarOfDavid">MathKnight</a> 15:21, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'd lose in a sanity poll. Stop and consider what you're saying. Several thousands of people let their all of their several hundred houses get booby trapped in their goal to end up with themselves and their children homeless and all of their posessions destroyed, all on one side of a particular city that Israel wanted to make a barrier in (and only there, not in the rest of the city). The IDF doesn't even try and claim that they're booby trapped or that the people inside were terrorists, not a single house blows up, etc, all over a period of months, and this fact completely slips under the radar of every UN organization operating in the area and the Israeli government itself? By the way, this is not to mention what the local Palestinians report, but I know you think that their entire race and everyone who supports them are just a bunch of liars, so I figured I'd skip it (it's hard to call satellite photos liars, though, isn't it?). I'll sum up: *Several Thousand People Ended Up Homeless Because Of This - Were They All Terrorists Or Hosting Terrorists*??? If so, you might as just well make the ultimate in racist claims - that every Palestinian - father and son, mother and child - is a terrorist. Or is your claim, again, that Israel was in the right to mow down an entire swath of a city to make a buffer and look for tunnels, leaving several thousand people (mostly families) homeless (an act condemned by every major human rights organization on the planet - Amnesty, HRW, Medica Sans Frontiers, you name it)? <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<p>The title is very POV and in fact, misleading. Most of the acts claimed to be commited in this article do not consist "crimes against humanity". Some of them may consist <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a>, other are a legitimite (and legal) acts of war (such as checkpoints, demolishing house with a terrorist inside shooting on peole etc). I suggest the title should be changed to <b>War Crimes comitted by Israel during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</b> instead of the current one, which is not only not NPOV or close to it, it is even mosleading. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarOfDavid_8e03.html" title="User:StarOfDavid">MathKnight</a> 22:12, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I clicked on crimes against humanity and got to this page. Why not change the links as well? This is very misleading. War crimes are bad enough, we should not want to change this into a different level. By the way, I read that Amnesty International defines the suicide killings as crimes against humanity. It is so sad all these things happen. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">Gidonb</a> 10:28, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This title is TERRIBLE! How can it possibly be NPOV? We aren't allowed to use the word "terrorist" to discuss the September 11 attacks, but "war crime" is bandied about here nonchalantly? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 03:02, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who told you that you weren't allowed to use the word terrorist to discuss the September 11th attacks? That's nonsense; everyone calls it a terrorist attack, and rightly so. Additionally, I should add (again, if you didn't already notice) that this is a response to all of the pro-Israel pages. If you'd rather, I could merge all of the disparate pro-Israel pages and this one into one, but I think it would turn into a gigantic fight (don't you?). Its probably best if each side gets their own. By the way, I've referenced virtually every single thing on this page (unlike many of the pro-Israel pages, who are lucky if they even provide a "The IDF said..." link). Also, if you'd rather, I could take the Israeli-side's method, and make instead of this one big page, a hundred little pages all over the place. But the (well referenced) information needs to be out there. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I moved the page to alleged Israeli war crimes, rather than accusations of Israeli war crimes. To the best of my judgement the new name is more neutral than the former one. This is not an endorsement of the content. I encourage the author to do more research. Better, open this page or merge it with war crimes or alleged war crimes from all sides. War crimes are a much too serious business to make them into a propaganda page on base of which monkey business is suggested ("If people don't like it's presence, I've got a laundry list of other articles out there for you to delete"). It this page a hostage? <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">Gidonb</a> 21:32, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is this page a hostage? Hardly. However, I would expect that you would treat all pages equally. Should we rename the "terrorism against israelis" and "massacres committed during the al-Aqsa Intifada" to "alleged terrorism against Israelis" and "alleged massacres committed during the al-Aqsa Intifada" (for just two examples of many)? If your answer is "no", then you should take into account the fact that there are far more references on this page than there are on any of those types of pages.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Can anyone justify why this page should have "alleged" but those pages should not, given that the things here are referenced? "Accusations" of war crimes works fine by me, however, since that's what it is - accusations (by respectable groups such Amnesty, HRW, various UN groups, etc, but accusations nonetheless). I think, if anyone wants to rename this page, they should have an answer to this before anyone moves this page. Is this not reasonable?</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to your suggestion about merging it into an alleged war crimes from all sides page, are you *sure* you want to do that? Because that would involve merging probably about 10 or so of the pro-Israel articles into this one. You'd have a a huge and very hostile edit war break out here. Do you really want that? My suggestion would be that it's best to have the general articles (such as the Al-Aqsa Intifada, articles on Palestine and Israel, etc, which people try to keep neutral and balanced; and then the specific-topics pages (which tend to slant toward one side or the other) in which it is accepted that they're going to slant toward one side, but that they have to reference articles or information the other side's POV (feel free to add more of the pro-Israel articles in the links section on the bottom!) and that they have to support their assertions with solid references. What do other people think? I mean, the other option for balance is merger, and honestly I find that a bit frightening of a prospect. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a>.</dd>

<dd>The neutrality of all pages that talk about the Al-Aqsa Intifada should be treated the same. As Rei said, if this page is 'alleged', they should all be 'alleged'. But I don't think that 'alleged' or 'accusations' are the right words that should be chosen. Israel commited (and is commiting) war crimes during Al-Aqsa, you can't say it's an accusation, or that it's alleged, because it's more than that - it's obvious. However, it doesn't mean that the page should be anti-Israeli, and it definitly doesn't mean it should contain partly-correct to incorrect info, and info about stuff that have nothing to do with the basic title of the page (war crimes by Israel during Al-Aqsa) like 'unnice things' that Israel did during Al-Aqsa.</dd>
<dd>My suggestion is that the page should be more like <i>War Crimes by Israel during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</i>. And other pages that have to do with Al-Aqsa should be more or less the same (e.g. <i>War Crimes by Terrorist Organizations during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</i>).</dd>
<dd>The content should be neutral on all sides. Saying that the title of this page should be anti-Israel to balance against pages that are pro-Israel is wrong. Why not make those pro-Israeli pages more neutral instead? It's better to all sides.</dd>
<dd>Most of it should talk about actual <i>war crimes</i>, and a small part of it about <i>accusations</i> that can't be agreed on their validity. Same should be about the other Al-Aqsa pages that deal with these things. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintNuclear_bac4.html" title="User:SaintNuclear">SaintNuclear</a> 16:48, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note that the paragraph above the table cites the Shin Bet's study on what percent were combattants, including a Haaretz reference. Seriously, I think people here are good enough to do basic math. I could also point out that this is only deaths that occured in the OT, since (as the reference states) the data is from the PRCS (who get their data from their field posts in the West Bank and Gaza); this would rule out the vast majority of attacks against Israeli civilians (the only people who died in attacking Israeli civilians who would appear in this table would be the ones who attacked any of the (illegal) Israeli colonies in the West Bank). But, in my opinion, the table and the Shin Bet's combattant percentage number should be enough for anyone who has graduated elementary school. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<dd>The Shin-Bet never approved the numbers Amira Hass (Haaretz colluminst) claim. Counterwise, study by the ICT center shows that at least 1200 of the casualties were combatants killed by IDF actions (that is not including suicide bombing). If you write an article , at least write correct facts whether than queoting blindly the Palestinian media. The article is very one sided, and everyone could see it is a low-quality Palestinian propoganda, doesn't even trying to reflect any truth. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarOfDavid_8e03.html" title="User:StarOfDavid">MathKnight</a> 00:19, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is very misleading to add in suicide bombers, Palestinians murdered by other Palestinians and those shot by their own while fighting Israel into the entire casualty count. What else is added in? When a Palestinian family murders one of their daughters in an "honor killing" is this also included?</p>
<p>-Suicide bombers murder themselves.</p>
<p>-Several bomb makers have killed themselves in the past 5 years.</p>
<p>-Collaborators are murdered by Palestinians.</p>
<p>-Many Palestinian children have been either shot in the back by Palestinian gunmen or have picked up bombs left on the sides of roads by these terrorists.</p>
<p>All of these Palestinian deaths are the result of Palestinian violence and should either be put into a separate 3rd category or added to the list of Israeli casualties that includes victims of Palestinian terrorism.<i>(this unsigned comment was made by 64.131.184.221 - next time please remember to add your signature by typing four tildes (~~~~) at the end of your post).</i></p>

<dd>tewfik, this article just survived afd, so you certainly can't delete it because you don't like it's content. if you want it merged, propose that (<a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a> in case you've forgotten)&amp; it will be discussed. as i said above, afd does not decide on merges, even if the closer thinks they should be able to. granted tho, a huge ammount of work, &amp; probably a name change is needed. it's effectively an article about idf attacks on civilians &amp; should be called such, any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> calling these war-crimes (or arguing against that) should of course be mentioned. merger is also pretty much ruled out on npov grounds as we have separate articles for the attacks by the 'palestinian' organisations so we have a separate article for idf attacks/atrocities.&#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 16:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello. On 8th January, Tewfik nominated the article for deleiton making the following argument: "<i>Forking of information which is either POV and unencyclopaedic, or <b>should be merged to</b> or already exists at Al-Aqsa Intifada.</i>"{emphasis added) Tewfik basically lost this when there was no concensus on his/her proposal. Now he/she is deleting the entire article (by blanking it), in a clear violation of the results of the AfD. The AfD <i>encourages</i> a merge, doesn't mandate one. What it does mandate is that this article be kept. If you, Tewfik or anyone else feels this article should be blanked, then start another AfD and hope to get a concensus.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 00:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No Jayjg, merging is what Tewfik proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Accusations_against_Israel_of_war_crimes_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Accusations_against_Israel_of_war_crimes_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, he even bolded the word "merge"[ed].

<p>To clarify, as the admin that closed the AfD: The consensus was to keep the article with strong encouragement to merge on the basis of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">WIkipedia:Content forking</a>. Involved editors need to apply themselves to merge the contents of this article with the main article, or find another strategy to avoid what is an obvious POV fork.<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 00:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. Some thoughts:
<ol>
<li>As ever the protect isn't a decision, its a hold until we make one.</li>
<li>The other article is long and has a POV tag. Presumably it is POV in the opposite sense (in which case this is going to be fun). Trying to add this content clause by clause in will cause an edit war.</li>
<li>At present (without any personal knowledge of the subject) I would say there hasn't been any serious attempt at merging. At the VERY least there should be a substantial section in the other article bearing a title of the name of this article? The fact that the merge has implications for the other article needs to be taken on board by editors there.</li>
<li>The process of merging isn't intended to be a disguised delete. Therefore in this rather contraversial environment I think we need to get editors on both articles to work together and produce a joint article before we direct one into another. This has to be done in good faith not by people trying to overturn the "keep" aspect of the AfD by the back door?</li>

<p>you're missing the point: the problem with the 'vote' (in a forum that doesn't go by votes but by reasons) for merge is that is was a fantasy of jossi's. if it really needs to happen, given the contention about the issue, it should go thru formal debate per <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a>. the obvious problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>npov: there are articles devoted to atrocities commited by palestinian groups, there should be one for the idf/israel (possibly this for the army, and another 'settler attacks on palestinians')</li>
<li>size, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> is already too long</li>
</ul>
<p>at best there is some question about jossi's call (the 'strong encouragement' seems to be a way of avoiding those implications of 'no consensus' that don't suit your views on the matter), so can we just agree to go thru merge procedures properly so we don't have to stuff around like this? &#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 13:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll ignore the slightly personal aspect of your remarks but you are proposing restore the article but start a merge debate to consider the proposal. That sound sensible to me.

<p>For 12 days after the AfD there was no effort from any side to merge the article. When I returned to look over the entry, I could find no encyclopaedic information in it that was not already covered in the main article. You point out that there is no section sharing a name with this article in "al-Aqsa Intifada" - that is because there isn't a section that actually covers "allegations of War crimes" in <i>this</i> article, and indeed much of the article suffers from OR etc. Several invitations to merge information that may have been left out were made by myself and other editors, and I continue to believe that editors of differing POVs should look this over to ensure that I didn't miss anything. However this shouldn't become an attempt to maintain POV and OR based "content" any longer than it amazingly managed to. Cheers, <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 07:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tewfik, If no one had believed that there was separate encyclopedic content in this article worth keeping, a line of people would not have voted to keep the article. You have to consider their views whether you agree or not. The AfD closing comment encouraging people to consider merging did not circumvent the process described in <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a>. You can see from the long AfD clearly a lot of contraversy around the article. In these circumstances unilaterally putting in a divert is very very close to edit warring/vandalism. The article was already edit protected when I got to it otherwise I would have been seriously thinking about some sort of ban, whether you are right or not about the content (on which I offer no opinion). I may have decided not, of course, the number of people involved was very saddening for WP. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 16:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not saying that there is definitively no new encyclopaedic information, only that I didn't see any, and thus didn't add any. As I said, myself and other editors have asked numerous times for anything that someone may consider new and encyclopaedic to be merged, but no one has attempted that. Rather the efforts were only focused on maintaining a POV/OR content fork, which the AfD recognised needed to be de-POV/ORed and unforked. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 21:05, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>this is not a content fork, there are seperate articles about attrocities commited by 'palestinian'/islamist groups, hence there should be articles about attrocities by seperate zionist/israeli groups.</li>
<li>a method for resolving this problem has been suggested several times, &amp; seconded by non-involved party. this method (proposing merge etc) also happens to be in line with policy. it is unclear whether, at the moment, re-directing is so in line: at the very least jossi needs to clarify/justify a closing statement which contradicts itself &amp; appears to introduce editors own opinion.</li>
<li>there are obvious problem w/ article. these can be discussed &amp; fixed when this dispute is resolved (i have suggested solutions above)</li>

<dd>By either side, I agree. That of course doesn't entitle anyone to delete the article and divert it just because people are being a bit slow or grumpy about it. We are not in punitive action mode, it is not about deadlines and threats, we are trying to write an encyclopaedia. I have given one test above that the content has not been merged. Another is for example the Amnesty International references don't seem to have been incorporated (I could have missed them: these are long articles to plough through). A merge is encouraged and other solutions to a POV fork are to be sort. IMHO, and according to the "keep" vote, until that happens the article has to stay. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 11:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But it seems to me that it was deleted unilaterally in spite of no consensus and no record of admin-only voting. And it was done in such a way that the material (in effect) was censored so that it could not be found and merged.</p>
<p>Wikipedia should not work unilaterally like that. I want to file a complaint against the wikipedia editor(s) or admin(s) that did this.</p>

<dd>No, it was not always there. The protected redirect prevented access. Days ago I tried to open up the revisions and it did not work. The closing admin recommended keeping the material. And trying to merge it. It can not be merged if it is hidden away. The logical location is as a talk archive at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>. It is against wikipedia guidelines to delete talk page material. See: <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines</a>. I am putting it back where it was. If you remove it again I will report you to the appropriate incident boards. I could have pasted all of this directly into the current talk page at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Talk%7EAl-Aqsa_Intifada_70e8.html" title="Talk:Al-Aqsa Intifada">Talk:Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>.

<dd>That is the only change I note in the logs and in the revision history from when I could not open that particular revision and when I could open that revision. Maybe there is more involved. I don't know. The fact remains though that the revision would not open. One could see the revision history, and the dates and links for all the revisions, but they would not open. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 19:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I may ask some other admins about this. I may ask at some incident boards too. I believe you are violating the spirit of the remarks by the closing admin for the AFD.

<p>I suggest an archive page be created. It can be labeled something like "old page: Accusations against Israel of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada‎"</p>
<p>I created a blank archive page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/-/Talk%7EAl-Aqsa_Intifada_Archive._Old_page_861f.html" title="Talk:Al-Aqsa Intifada/Archive. Old page">Talk:Al-Aqsa Intifada/Archive. Old page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I put a link to it in the archive box at the top of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Talk%7EAl-Aqsa_Intifada_70e8.html" title="Talk:Al-Aqsa Intifada">Talk:Al-Aqsa Intifada</a></p>
<p>I suggest that an admin copy the most complete version of the old article into the archive. Probably the last revision by <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> would be best. That way we can copy what we want from the old page into <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:42, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest changing the title. "War crimes" is too strong a phrase for some of the human rights violations described in this article.</p>
<p>Also, there is a lot of territory covered by this article. I suggest creating multiple pages.</p>
<p>I also suggest changing all the links to reference links. By adding &lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt; tags. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 21:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the title from "Accusations against Israel of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada" to</p>

<p>"War crimes" is too strong a term for some of the human rights violations being described in the article.</p>
<p>I think it is important to describe events and actions. That is the easiest to source. I believe analysis should be avoided in most cases because it too often becomes spin and violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<p>My edit summary when returning the article after someone redirected it:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I am doing a lot of work on this article. Please give me time. We will merge parts of it. It is too long to merge all of it. Have patience. See talk."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I spent a lot of time yesterday converting a whole section from external links to reference links. I have a lot of other work to do also. Please have patience. We will merge what we can into <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>. There is too much to merge all of it.</p>
<p>The new name for the article takes away a big reason, I believe, why many people wanted to delete the article. Accusing Israel of war crimes is too much for many people. And inaccurate for the most part. I find the old title to be offensive. And such a title needs an article that meets very high standards.</p>
<p>That is no longer this article. This article is about <b>alleged</b> human rights violations, and it also must meet high standards for sourcing, etc.. I am working on it. Please assume good faith. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 18:33, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that there is very little encyclopaedic information here. Most of it is juxtaposition-based OR. The HRW/AI critiques have been merged to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">al-Aqsa Intifada</a>, as any other info should be (though again, I don't anticipate there being anything else that isn't already there). It would be far better if instead of working here, you point to what info you think is missing, and we then discuss how to best incorporate it. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 18:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is your opinion. You are violating the wikipedia guideline on merging. Here is a previous comment by Bsnowball:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"tewfik, this article just survived afd, so you certainly can't delete it because you don't like it's content. if you want it merged, propose that (<a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a> in case you've forgotten)&amp; it will be discussed. as i said above, afd does not decide on merges, even if the closer thinks they should be able to. granted tho, a huge ammount of work, &amp; probably a name change is needed. it's effectively an article about idf attacks on civilians &amp; should be called such, any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> calling these war-crimes (or arguing against that) should of course be mentioned."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I just changed the name. I am starting on the "huge amount of work". But I can't work on it if you keep deleting it. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 18:46, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why must everything be combative and hostile. No, it isn't my opinion. Read the closing admin's comments please. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 19:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not hostile to disagree with you. Accusing someone of hostility where there is none is also considered a personal attack. Look it up in the wikipedia guidelines. Point out the hostility in my last comment, please. Here is the closing admin comment from January 17, 2007:</p>
