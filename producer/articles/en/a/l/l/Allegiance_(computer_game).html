<p><b>Allegiance</b> is an <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMOG_6842.html" title="MMOG">MMOG</a> providing a mix of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real-time_strategy.html" title="Real-time strategy">real-time strategy</a> and player piloted <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_combat.html" title="Space combat">space combat</a>. Initially developed by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Research_2e01.html" title="Microsoft Research">Microsoft Research</a>, the game was later released under a <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shared_source.html" title="Shared source">shared source</a> license and is now maintained/developed by volunteers. Gameplay relies heavily on good teamwork and forward thinking. Players can fly a variety of craft, striving to destroy enemy team installations and protecting their own. Resource collection figures significantly in the game, since new technology can be expensive and money is usually scarce.</p>
<p>It was developed as an experiment by a team of programmers who had never worked in game design before. Allegiance was released in March of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, after an extended <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_testing.html" title="Software testing">beta test</a> period. Allegiance is based on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alto_Trek_ca7b.html" title="Alto Trek">Alto Trek</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>), which was also written by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Rashid_e868.html" title="Rick Rashid">Rick Rashid</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its exhilarating fast-paced teamwork-oriented gameplay and sharp 3D graphics, the game never achieved commercial success (perhaps partly due to its reliance on Microsoft's less-than-reliable <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Zone_0c5c.html" title="Microsoft Zone">Microsoft Zone</a>, the lack of advertising or both). It did manage to build a dedicated following, who have stayed with the game and continued its development despite multiple setbacks (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> pulling support, player cheating, etc)</p>
<p>Due to the lack of commercial success, the official servers closed in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. As a consequence of this, the original retail version of the game is largely unfunctional. However, the Allegiance community has been tireless and largely successful in its attempts to make the game free for all to play. The updated version of the game client is downloadable for free from <a href="http://www.freeallegiance.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.freeallegiance.org/" rel="nofollow">the FreeAllegiance.org web site</a> and many servers are currently hosted by members of the community.</p>
<p>Allegiance received <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s <i>Best Game No One Played</i> award in 2000.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Allegiance's original development team released the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_code.html" title="Source code">source code</a> for Allegiance, signaling yet another chapter in Allegiance's unique history. Developers have since released two minor updates to the game engine, with the first major one coming in a few weeks, while enthusists develop/refine new mods for gameplay.</p>
<p>With the intention of allowing an even larger number of people to play the game, the current development team has found a way to work around the router port forwarding issues that has kept many from returning to the game or playing it while behind a college firewall. Following the release in August 2006 of the latest version, it appears that the overwhelming majority of port and NAT problems have been resolved and the game is fast to download and incredibly easy to install and run. The game's exe file install is only 70 megabytes and unpacks to an at most, economic 500 megabytes.</p>

<p>The biggest drawcard for Allegiance is its capacity to field 100 players a side. Players can choose between piloting individual fighter, bombers, stealth and scout craft. Players can also choose to fly massive capital ships from carriers to dreadnoughts and missile frigates, all sporting multiple turrets. Several players can man each capital ship, including turret positions.</p>
<p>Games are normally two team matches, though it is common for Deathmatch games to be multi-team affairs. Play starts when a team commander has been chosen or has stepped up, and a team has signed-up. These type of games are called 'pick-up' games due to their 'pick-up and play' nature. An effort is sometimes made to keep the teams even in skill, when a team is vastly more skilled than the opposing side the overskilled team is said to be 'stacked'.</p>
<p>To avoid this, the players can have a 'picked' game, as opposed to a 'pick-up' game. A third team is created as a picking pool, where the commanders then choose players based on skill level. This tries to create an even balance of skills, but unfortunately whether due to bad picking through unfamiliarity with the better players or the skilled players waiting in the lobby to 'stack' the team after play has begun, these games sometimes become unbalanced as well.</p>
<p>Settings for the match, for example the map, the money settings and number of teams can be assigned, after which the game proper starts.</p>
<p>Gameplay consists of regular <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real-time_strategy.html" title="Real-time strategy">RTS</a> strategies with the major difference that each individual unit is a player. Each team gathers resources using miners and builds bases in different sectors. Reconnaissance is followed by expansion for more resources to fuel the war machine and then either a decisive showdown or a long, drawn out stalemate.</p>
<p>Strategies are as numerous as any other online game, most based around the technology offered by the three different 'techbases', the main garrison and various special buildings associated with some certain factions.</p>
<p>Supremacy, where technologies for bombers, fighters, and upgrades (maneuverability, sensor range, missile damage, etc.) are researched allowing for a balanced offense and defense.</p>
<p>Tactical, home of technology designed to ruin enemy infrastructure (the ability to destroy miners and base constructors) and perform sneak attacks using stealth fighters and bombers.</p>
<p>Expansion, for technology used primarily for defense (interceptors), but includes infrastructure upgrades and troop transports used in capturing bases.</p>
<p>Each of these buildings can only be built on certain types of asteroids which are fairly limited, which inevitably leads to combat to both secure the asteroids and denying the enemy use of them.</p>
<p>The game itself is arguably quite difficult to learn and appreciate unless a considerable investment of time is made, which turns away many potential players and keeps the community small, with roughly 350-400 active players.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Factions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Factions</span></h2>
<p>The following nine factions are featured in the <a href="http://www.dark-nebulae.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dark-nebulae.com" rel="nofollow">Dark Nebulae</a> (DN) core, version 4.45 alpha. DN is currently offline but reportedly had at one stage 10-40+ Players online at a time. As of May 2007, FreeAllegiance had about the same number on as well. FreeAllegiance has largely the same factions as DN.</p>
<p>Each faction's fighter-class ship is depicted below.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Current Factions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current Factions</span></h3>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Iron Coalition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Iron Coalition</span></h4>
<p><i>Order. Strength. Unity - This is the creed of the Iron Coalition. Formed as a space borne United Nations peacekeeping force, the Earth's destruction has transformed the Iron Coalition into one of the dominant powers in space. Led by Brigadier General Derek Fisk, the Iron Coalition Struggles to restore and maintain order to the remaining members of the human race - by any means necessary.</i></p>
<p>The Iron Coalition was also one of the three original factions created by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Iron Coalition features a weak economy with few frills, but very strong ships (they carry extra ammo, fuel and energy, and do more damage per shot than most other factions). The Iron Coalition Heavy Interceptor is considered by some to be the best dogfighting ship in the game. Iron Coalition is considered to be a basic faction, though it does have some unique qualities. For instance, IC commanders need not spend money researching tech-path specific ships. As soon as a tech base is built or upgraded, the ship is available. Additionally, IC miners can ripcord which makes defending them slightly easier, and all IC bases are invincible against the galvonic blaster (a special weapon that can destroy small bases).</p>
<p><a name="GigaCorp" id="GigaCorp"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: GigaCorp">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">GigaCorp</span></h4>
<p><i>Founded by the enigmatic Emmet Longstreet, this massive corporate entity has managed to survive the destruction of Earth. Led by Mercedes Kelleher - a cunning and ruthless businesswoman - GigaCorp has one goal: total domination of humanity's remnants.</i></p>
<p>Gigacorp was one of the three original factions created by Microsoft.</p>
<p>GigaCorp has the strongest economy of all the factions, but starts with very weak ships. Even when better ships are researched, they tend to be more fragile than those of other factions, unless the commander forks out 500 credits for the purchase of 'Luxury' ships. These Luxury ships are significantly better than the base model, for example Lxy Fighters carry an extra gun, Lxy Interceptors can ripcord (which makes them extremely versatile) and Lxy Stealth Fighters can cloak indefinitely as well as carry an extra missile. Gigacorp ships are also faster than the other factions besides Belters and Dreghklar. Bases are less expensive to build, but small bases are very vulnerable and can be damaged by small arms fire. GigaCorp can supplement its already strong economy by building special mines, which provide income every minute.</p>
<p><a name="BIOS" id="BIOS"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: BIOS">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BIOS</span></h4>
<p><i>Originally spawned by Gigacorp genetic engineering projects, the BIOS are physically and mentally advanced, perfectly designed to withstand the rigors of life in space. After the death of their leader - GigaCorp founder Emmet Longstreet - the BIOS have launched a shadowy crusade against "stalegene" humanity, with the goal of dragging the human race into an evolutionary watershed.</i></p>
<p>Bios were one of the three original factions created by Microsoft.</p>
<p>BIOS ships are stealthy and have excellent sensors, making them very difficult to attack and hard to defend against. Their tech bases are already upgraded once they're built, and research costs half that of other factions. The catch is that research takes 10 minutes per item. BIOS teams tend to take a beating early in the game, but they are very dangerous once time passes and researched items become available. It is not unknown for a BIOS team to be cornered into a single sector, and then fight its way back. Commanding BIOS is considered a test of patience and timing.</p>
<p><a name="Belters" id="Belters"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Belters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Belters</span></h4>
<p><i>The Belters - a loose collection of independent traders, prospectors, pirates, and privateers - share a common belief: that freedom from tyranny is the right of all humanity. Belters are a rough-hewn, unruly bunch of borderline anarchists. Led by unlikely hero Orion Sholes, the Belters pilot an odd mix of captured and jury-rigged equipment: the "Junkyard Armada.</i></p>
<p>Belters were one of the bonus factions created by Microsoft, supposedly named after an old squad called 'The Belters' (later renamed to Jihaad and then Shifters).</p>
<p>Belter bases are strong and inexpensive, and while their miners are slow, they can squeeze more money out of a sector than most other factions. Their research is slower than other factions, and many items cost more to research, besides ship types. Their ships are like flying bricks, and many ships can't mount shields. They have better armor and ship mass than other factions (which makes ramming a favourite pastime of Belter pilots), but their real strength lies in their versatility. With some exceptions, all Belter ships can mount equipment normally reserved for a specific type of ship (ex. fighters can mount equipment normally reserved for interceptors). They also retain most of the items they've researched, even if the base providing those items is destroyed. Technology that is stolen or found can immediately be put to use, where other factions can only use captured/found technology after meeting certain prerequisites.</p>
<p><a name="Rixian_Unity" id="Rixian_Unity"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Rixian Unity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rixian Unity</span></h4>
<p><i>First contact with life outside the solar system -- with the Rixian Unity. So far, the Rixian have proven themselves superior scientists, explorers, and, as has now been made clear to mankind, crusaders. They are led by Issa Rix, a being so revered among his people that his very name stands for all Rixians. Little is truly known about this species, certainly not their true goals or intentions.</i></p>
<p>Rixian Unity were one of the bonus factions created by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Rixians have no missiles, but mount powerful guns with improved damage and range and can use deployable "combat pods" that function as mini-turrets. They also have increased mobility, as their scouts can mount teleport receivers that allow teammates to quickly move across the map. Scientifically advanced, Rixian technology is researched in seconds and costs the same as most other factions. Their ships have excellent yaw and roll, but poor pitch rates. Rixian economy and base quality lacks any notable features, and is generally on par with most other factions.</p>
<p><a name="Dreghklar_Empire" id="Dreghklar_Empire"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Dreghklar Empire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dreghklar Empire</span></h4>
<p><i>The Dreghklar Empire - the beast of the Apocalypse. This race may be responsible for the destruction of Earth, after tampering with the already poor coordination of the Mass Conveyor System, believing that humanity was lost without its home. For hundreds of years, they have traveled and been a plague to intelligent life.</i></p>
<p>Dreghklar Empire is a player (Vegeta and Noir) created faction.</p>
<p>The Dreg have a decent economy, but are saddled with increased research and base construction costs. Even with the increased expense, Dreg ships and bases are more fragile than other factions. As their weapon technology is similar to those of other factions, the Dreg's real power is their incredible speed and fast research time. Dreg ships can quickly zip across a sector to meet a threat (or be a threat), and their utility craft can easily outrun attackers who do not conserve fuel. They can supplement their income by building mines on depleted <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helium-3.html" title="Helium-3">Helium-3</a> asteroids.

<p><i>Technoflux - AI at its best. Originally created by the Iron Coalition to strike at no cost of men, the Technoflux project was abandoned when risks were judged too high and the public opinion was opposed. Unfortunately, the project managed to survive in remote research areas and eventually attacked any and all factions it encountered, including the Iron Coalition. They pursue no goal. They seek no vengeance. They simply obey their programming. Whether a third party managed to take control of them is not known.</i></p>
<p>Technoflux is a player (Vegeta) created faction.</p>
<p>Technoflux ships have no missiles and begin with weak guns. They also have a weak starting position, very slow research time and an economy that takes a lot of planning to run properly. While their small ships are harder to hit, they are much slower than the ships of other factions. Like the BIOS, Technoflux's real power becomes apparent as researched items become available. Their advanced ships and weapons are much more powerful than those of other factions. If allowed to live long enough, Technoflux teams usually surpass their opponents and dominate them, unless the other faction has even stronger end-game technology.</p>

<p><i>The Ga'Taraan Federation - Founded twenty years ago by the uprising of two science colonies under the iron fist command of the Iron Coalition, the Ga'Taraan Federation remained isolated from the war that ensued after the destruction of Earth. Developing different technologies, they felt their involvement was necessary, and recently began assaults in the Solar System.</i></p>
<p>Ga'Taraan Federation is a player (Orion) created faction.</p>
<p>GT, being descended from science colonies have a very powerful economy and ships. Their research costs less than any other faction besides BIOS and Technoflux, however their mining speed is pathethic but each individual miner is an absolute tank because of GT's naturally stronger hull and shields. Enhanced GT miners are generally seen as 'indestructible' unless attacked with great co-ordiantion and numbers.</p>
<p>In order to access high-level technology, Ga'Taraan commanders must first build an expensive Palisade base that offers few additional benefits. Despite these weaknesses, Ga'Taraan teams start with strong, extra durable ships that only get better as the game progresses. Persistent commanders can also access exotic technologies such as lasers, rescue drones, salvo rockets and the doomsday resonator, a non-tracking missile fired into alephs (the mode of inter-sector transport in the game) that can destroy everything on both sides of the aleph.</p>

<p><i>The Phoenix Order is made up of Apocalypse survivors from deep underground at Area 51 and various shadow governments. They blame Earth’s destruction on the greed and selfishness of the other “Spacer” factions. For years, hidden under the deadly debris clouds that cover the planet, they have been collecting left over military hardware and modified it with previously captured alien technology. While they still use Earth as a primary base of operations, the Moon has become one of their first lines of defense.</i></p>
<p>Phoenix Order is a player (Noir) created faction that is unique to the Dark Nebulae (DN) core.</p>
<p>Phoenix ships are very thin and have excellent pitch and roll, but normal yaw rates. Combat ships have very strong shields and can mount extra missiles, which track better than most factions but do slightly less damage. However, they are very vulnerable to anti-shield weaponry, and player-controlled ships (i.e. not miners and constructors) can not be repaired in the field. They have access to many exotic and powerful weapons, like laser turrets and vulcan cannons. These items are very expensive to research, however. Luckily the Transceiver base that houses these technologies is as strong as a normal technology base, requiring quite a dedicated bomb run to destroy it. The Phoenix economy is very strong, with faster mining speeds and greater yield (each miner load brings in a bonus payout), to compensate for the expenses need to access the exotic technologies.</p>

<p>Effix is a player (oldGB, Romeo, Orion) created faction that is unique to the Edge of Reality(EoR) core.</p>
<p>Effix is primarily a missile-based faction, which they have developed in order to counter the superior guns of the Rixians. Their economy is slow, but hardy, mining speed is by far the slowest of any other faction but their miners have incredibly high capacity.</p>

<p>This is the oldest player-made core, a project of Spunkmeyer and later Fox_Four. This core has gone through some 15 revisions, starting from the Microsoft core (release 1.25). It had widespread support after fixing some of the more glaring problems in the Microsoft core, such as the utter dominance of Iron Coalition Expansion or "Tacspansion" strategies, and the relative weakness of Bios. The core lost popularity in later revisions, due to the advent of the Dark Nebulae core, the absence of the Core's developers, and the fact that during this absence the core was unplayable due to an artwork bug. Some, who complained about <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nerf_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Nerf (computer gaming)">nerfs</a>, felt they eliminated the uniqueness of the factions; this also detracted from its popularity in more recent years. It features all of the Microsoft factions, as well as Dreghklar and Ga'Taraan. Alleg+R7 was used as a basis for the "GoD"(Good Old Days) core, which has recently been revived as "GoD II" *section needed*</p>

<p>This core plays much differently to other cores. It does due to its modified thruster strength, speed, ammo, weapon power, names, and tech paths. EoR has Belters, Bios, GigaCorp, GaTaraan, Iron Coalition, and Rixian factions available to it, with Effix being added as of release 6aa.

<p>This heavily modified core is based on an older, unbalanced and unfinished core named "Extended Allegiance," which in turn was based on an older version of the Alleg+ core (which itself was based on the original 1.24 core). The main feature of RPS is the addition of several new levels of technology, expanding on the original three levels of technology to up to five levels. These new technologies are different for every faction and range from fighters to gunships to scouts, to new and improved weapons and missiles. This core is especially popular for maxed out money deathmatches, while every other core's preference is for the conquest mode.</p>

<ul>
<li>incredibly high agility and acceleration rates</li>
<li>energy doesn't recharge</li>
<li>lack of ammo-using weapons (all weapons use energy)</li>
<li>lack of boosters</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegiance_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Free Allegiance Zone (FAZ)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Allegiance Zone (FAZ)</span></h2>
<p>The Free Allegiance Zone is the name of the community code project. After <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> released the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_code.html" title="Source code">source code</a> it was discovered that the released source was not the source for the client and server software currently in use. The FAZ project's initial aim is to create working client and server software from the source code. From this base it will be possible to enact gameplay changes and upgrade the netcode that Allegiance uses to <a href="../../../d/i/r/DirectPlay_94c5.html" title="DirectPlay">DirectPlay</a> 8 and remove some major bugs.</p>
<p>FAZ will also allow many more players to play Allegiance, particularly those restricted by the ports they can have open on their routers (this port access is blocked in many universities and colleges). Increasing the player base is a major aim of the FAZ team.</p>
<p>The first release (<b>FAZ R1</b>) of FAZ was completed on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, however the first release was deigned to simply be as similar to the last release from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> rather than fixing bugs. The FAZ releases are faster than the original because of the more advanced development environments used to produce them.</p>
<p>The second release (<b>FAZ R2</b>) of FAZ has been released on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. It did add ranks back into the game, like during the old <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> Allegiance Zone and some other game relevant changes.</p>
<p>The third release (<b>FAZ R3</b>) of FAZ went gold on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and is the <b>current release</b>. It ports the code to Visual C++ 2005 (VC8), adds DirectPlay8 calls to allow players to connect through NAT boundaries (that is, manually configuring routers to allow gameplay is no longer required), upgrades the sound engine to DirectSound8, and adds an automatic balancing feature based on the ranking system. Besides considerable bugfixes, the release also adds support for hi-resolution textures and a new help system.</p>

<p>Special players in Allegiance have extra additions to their username to distinguish them from regular players.</p>
<p>*: Denotes a Squad Leader (SL) who commands an Allegiance squad. Example: *Callsign@SQUAD</p>
<p>^: Denotes an Assistant Squad Leader, who is second-in-command of a squad. There can be multiple ASLs for each squad. Most squads appoint between one and three ASLs. Example: ^Callsign@SQUAD</p>
<p>?: Denotes an Allegiance Chancellor or @Alleg, who are first-level administrators. These players have been chosen to help answer questions for new players, and guide others ingame. In addition to their teaching role, @Allegs are also charged as the first line of defence for enforcing the Rules of Conduct and Terms of Service. These players have the ability to eject others from games should it be necessary, as well as the ability to ban players for a limited amount of time. Example:&#160;?Partofcallsign@Alleg (Such as, if someone with the callsign SpaceWarrior is an @Alleg:&#160;?Space@Alleg)</p>
<p>+: Denotes a Senator, Leading Allegiance Chancellor, Gameserver Administrator, or Community Administrator who are 2nd, 3rd, or 4th-level administrators respectively. Senators are chosen by their squads to speak on their squad's behalf in the Senate. Leading Allegiance Chancellors are @Allegs who have performed the duty for a long time. Gameserver admins administer servers on which the community plays, and the Community Administrators designed the security system used to authenticate users, or support the main servers financially. All players with a + token have the same privileges as&#160;? tokens, with the addition of being able to look up alternate callsigns for players, and ban players for an extended period of time. Community Administrators can ban for unlimited amounts of time (although in these cases, the Senate votes on such usage) since they wrote and administrate the system itself. Example: +Callsign@SQUAD, or +Callsign</p>
<p>$: Denotes a special developer. Currently, only one player has the $ token (KGJV), who was the lead of the FAZ Team for years. He has since taken a leave of absence from the community. It should also be noted that another player, Imago, was given the $ token for one day to make him eligible to play in the "Admins vs World" game with the Admins, as a reward for the amount of work he put in to the FAZ team. $ Tokened players do not have any administrative privileges. Example: $Callsign</p>
