	    <p><b>All Star Baseball</b> is one of the two most popular <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_games.html" title="Board games">board games</a> of the last sixty years, and has been honored as one of the fifty most influential American board games of all time. It was manufactured by Cadaco-Ellis and designed by <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> player <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethan_Allen_%28baseball%29_b1de.html" title="Ethan Allen (baseball)">Ethan Allen</a> (1904-1993).</p>
<p>The game first appeared in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> and a special version is still sold today. It was the best-selling baseball board game of all time, and is the only such game to have been distributed through mass market channels and toy stores for any extended period of time. The annual versions of the game were discontinued in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> due to the loss of market share to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_games.html" title="Computer games">computer games</a> and greatly increased player licensing costs, but a commemorative version was issued in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike more simulation-focused competitors, most notably <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strat-o-Matic_2bc9.html" title="Strat-o-Matic">Strat-o-Matic</a> Baseball, <i>ASB</i> is aimed at a younger audience and is simpler to play; Allen's initial target audience was boys 9-12 years old. It simulates batters' performance well, but makes no attempt to model the performance of individual pitchers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many fans passionately bought each year's cards and collected stats from neighborhood leagues, some amassing as many as 2,500 games worth of paper box scores and comparing those totals with the actual players' statistics.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Star_Baseball_c9e9.html" title="Edit section: Game play">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Game play</span></h2>
<p>The game board for <i>ASB</i> has two spinners on top of a diagram of a baseball field. A hole for a baserunner peg is cut at the location of each base. A cardboard back panel is inserted into cut-out slots in the board, displays the key to the game cards and cardboard wheels that can be turned to display the correct inning, the number of outs and the score.</p>
<p>Each circular player card has a series of lines and numbers arranged in a circle around its center. The card is placed on a spinner, which the batting player spins. (Aficionados would spin the metal pointers with rubber bands to avoid blisters.) Once the spinner came to rest between two lines, the number for that section defined what happened to that batter.</p>
<p>If one or more runners were on base, the pitching player would spin the other spinner, which displayed zones that defined whether runners advanced, scored or were out on the play.</p>
<p>Some special plays, as well as attempted steals, required the use of two special pink situation cards, which went on the pitching player's spinner and indicated the result when spun.</p>
<p>There were no pitching cards nor fielding cards, although pitchers' batting statistics were present on their cards. This made the game inherently less mathematically accurate than its older-audience rivals.</p>
<p>The chart for the meaning of each number on the cards is below. The earliest versions of <i>ASB</i> utilized this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Home Run</li>
<li>2 Ground out, double play with runner on first base</li>
<li>3 Runner reaches based on error</li>
<li>4 Fly out, all runners advance</li>
<li>5 Triple</li>
<li>6 Ground out, all runners advance</li>
<li>7 Single, runners advance one base</li>
<li>8 Fly out, runner on third base scores, others hold</li>
<li>9 Walk (Base on balls)</li>
<li>10 Strikeout</li>
<li>11 Double</li>
<li>12 Ground out, runners advance if forced</li>
<li>13 Single, runners advance two bases</li>
<li>14 Fly out, runners hold their bases</li>
</ul>
<p>Later versions featured a simpler chart, augmented by second spins on the fielding player's side (presumably to give that player more to do), with only the "3" section fundamentally changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Home Run</li>
<li>2 Ground out</li>
<li>3 Fly out (Formerly <i>Safe on error</i>)</li>
<li>4 Fly out</li>
<li>5 Triple</li>
<li>6 Ground out</li>
<li>7 Single</li>
<li>8 Fly out</li>
<li>9 Walk (Base on balls)</li>
<li>10 Strikeout</li>
<li>11 Double</li>
<li>12 Ground out</li>
<li>13 Single</li>
<li>14 Fly out</li>
</ul>
<p>All other rules of the game match those of regular baseball.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Star_Baseball_c9e9.html" title="Edit section: The Players">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Players</span></h2>
<p>Until about <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> <i>ASB</i> had a mix of current Major League stars and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_of_Fame_867e.html" title="Hall of Fame">Hall of Fame</a> players. As more athletes (and their estates) asserted licensing rights over the use of their names the old-time players were dropped from the game, although a handful of individuals were included occasionally in an annual set.</p>
<p>Ethan Allen personally asked each of the current players in the game to sign off on a release form granting permission to include their batting statistics in the game, and continued this practice for almost fifty years after the introduction of the game. Although a few declined, most agreed despite the fact that they were not compensated for being included.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> the game came under the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLBPA_317a.html" title="MLBPA">MLBPA</a> license, which made the design of the game cards more sophisticated but also added significantly to the cost of production. Since the change in its business model to absorb the MLBPA royalties Cadaco has stopped issuing regular annual updates to the game, and its publishing future remains unclear.</p>
<p>Although numbers have varied, the typical <i>ASB</i> boxed set contained 40 player cards for early sets, and 63 player cards for later sets.</p>
<p><a name="The_Cards" id="The_Cards"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Star_Baseball_c9e9.html" title="Edit section: The Cards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Cards</span></h2>
<p>During most of its history <i>ASB</i> has had annual updates of its boxed board game with new players and updated stats. During some eras Cadaco-Ellis has also sold older cards by mail, and in recent years the cards have become popular on <a href="../../../e/b/a/Ebay.html" title="Ebay">ebay</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the special 2003 commemorative version, Cadaco also issued separate individually packaged sets of player cards for an All-Star Player Pack, the 2003 Ultimate Series (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> vs. <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Marlins_0c4d.html" title="Florida Marlins">Florida Marlins</a>) and the 2003 Fantasy Series (<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> vs. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>). These held action photos to further identify them as being collectible baseball cards.</p>
<p>There is a significant collectors market for older cards, which are broken down into several eras (all years are approximate) as printing technology evolved:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> -- Black and white cards printed on heavy cardboard, with die-cut center opening so the card can be put on a cardboard block to hold it steady beneath the spinner on the game board. Most if not all years' cards in this era have solid dark green backs.</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> -- Old time players' cards are printed in red instead of black. The cardboard is lighter weight.</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> -- Current players are on multicolored cards with blue-gray backgrounds and with key colors indicating <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a>. Old time players' cards have red backgrounds. Wooden baserunner pegs were also replaced with plastic pegs at this time.</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> -- The game board is redesigned and the cardboard block to hold the cards beneath the spinner is replaced with a plastic holder on which the spinner rests; the card is inserted in the top of the holder and is centered beneath the spinner. This eliminated the need for the die-cut hole in the middle of the card, making them less likely to tear. Some die-hard players, accustomed to holding the cards through the center hole, manually cut holes in the new cards.</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> -- Player photographs are added to the cards, in part to try to increase their collector value.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Variants" id="Variants"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Star_Baseball_c9e9.html" title="Edit section: Variants">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variants</span></h2>
<p>Ethan Allen viewed the published 1941 game as only a first draft, and for decades until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> tried to persuade Cadaco to issue improved versions with his new ideas. In 1975, they did try a version with 8 categories instead of 14, but the cards were already collected by dedicated players and the re-design was abandoned by Cadaco. Despite the increases in complexity, Allen always saw the game as being intended for boys, not adults.</p>
