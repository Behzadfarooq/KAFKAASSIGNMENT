<p>The lead should fairly characterise the views of both sides. One of the similarities between Israel and South Africa, as conceived by those who use the term, is that both were colonial states. The comparison is fairly interesting because in both cases land rights are nothing like straightforward. One could bicker over whether Israel is a colony or not, but we are representing the views of both sides, not posting the "truth", whatever we believe it is. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's OR to mention colonialism in the lead just because one or two of the quotes attach it to the accusation of apartheid. In fact there seem to be colonialism quotes added to this article, which should be removed if they're not directly attached to quotes about apartheid. It seems like many of them are just added to show how much these people hate Israeli policies, rather than to discuss the accusation of apartheid.</dd>

<dd>By the way, has anyone noticed how noone cares when protestors talk about apartheid and nazis and colonialism at this point? Great way to ruin a legacy of anti-racism, people!

<p>As per my edit: The rights and privileges are "disparate" not seperate.</p>
<p>disparate \DIS-puh-rit; dis-PAIR-it\, adjective: 1. Fundamentally different or distinct in quality or kind. 2. Composed of or including markedly dissimilar elements.</p>
<p>The term "separation" refers to physical separation/apartheid. This should also be included in the lead, since the allegations refer to disparate rights AND physical separation of the two groups impose largely by Israel. (i.e. the wall, etc.)</p>
<p>I have tried to make the lead more accurate. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKritt_aaaf.html" title="User:Kritt">Kritt</a> 06:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because South Africa wasn't allegations. Read the template, allegations is the key word. Apartheid actually happened, today we have allegations and analogies.

<dd>Well, for starters, the banner is a mess. More importantly, your whole premise here is to distinguish real apartheid from mere allegations. Whether accurate or not, that's clearly one POV. I'm going to remove it for now; I think this needs to be discussed before being thrown into the article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 15:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>South Africa <b>said</b> it was practicing "apartheid". The government gave that name to its own practice, in its own language. In the case of Israel, other people are accusing the government not only of practicing similar things, but they are using a word imported from another time, place and language to do it. I would say that is a legitimate distinction. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 15:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The distinction is real, I agree. The question is whether it's neutral to make it the premise for a banner at the top of the page. My longstanding problem is making this kind of statement indirectly. If we want to say that this is an important distinction, then I think we should state that clearly, not make it the premise for a banner that's included to illustrate it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 16:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mackan, banners that hold lists always go at the top of pages if there is only one. There is therefore no NPOV issue because it's a useful list of related pages, and no style issue because of the traditional way banners are placed. Noone ever got mad at me on <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop music</a>, yknow? If you insist on adding the content of the banner to the article explicitly, I say go ahead, I'd like that very much. Then again, would it not be kind of retarded to have such redundant information? I like the tidy little template more. Feel free as a bird to make that thing look better. But please don't try to hide it, because it's completely in line with Wikipedia practices and policies. --<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 16:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The banner 1. editorializes, and 2. defaces the article. Both of these are POV issues. Also, banners don't always go at the top, see <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>. As far as the helpfulness of the list, I don't think it helps show your good faith when the first article, which you recently (today) created, starts off "Some go so far as to allege that there is racial apartheid in Australia." I'm sorry, but is this really the best you can do to respect <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>?

<dd>It doesn't editorialize. I used the same method for deciding to create it as is used in any other info box. Info boxes go at the tops of article on the right, usually, so point number 2 is also invalid. Also, the banner on anti-Zionism is at the bottom because the word anti-Semitism isn't in the title of the article. It's a subsection that's part of the series, not the article itself. This ENTIRE article, not just this section, is part of an obvious series of allegations of apartheid.

<dd>A series that you created today for the purpose of placing this banner? If you want to play games, we could of course create a very nice big banner here on Allegations of Apartheid, with links to all related articles. Primary articles could include <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_of_Apartheid_54dc.html" title="Crime of Apartheid">Crime of Apartheid</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Apartheid_0256.html" title="Allegations of Apartheid">Allegations of Apartheid</a>, with all of the secondary articles you list here.

<dd>Mackan, the anarchism template proves my point exactly-- Every single title is a subset of anarchism. This is specifically what I made clear about info boxes earlier, and repeating my point for me doesn't really accomplish anything for this discussion. Everything is in the realm of <i>anarchism</i> on that info box. Not political philosophy, but <i>anarchsm</i>. The same paradigm holds logically true for this template, as well-- everything invovled deals with <i>allegations of apartheid.</i> It would be just as much of a complete non sequitor to "play games" by adding Crimes of apartheid to this info box as it would be to add a link to Hobbes's political philosophy to anarchy's info box.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are yet to shed any light on how this box editorializes in any way whatsoever. Is it a POV that these are allegations of anti-semitism? Sensitive topics which are this large tend to have one box or another, grouping them with other topics. If you view it as normalizing the accusation, I might ask why you don't say the same thing about the anti-semitism infobox. (Aren't we "editorializing" by showing how prevalent anti-semitism is? Perhaps the info box should be removed from every single page??)--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 19:40, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to butt in on the fun, but all this talk of subsets and supersets, going "up" a category or down, is a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a>, and a rather lurid and pongy one at that. The banner is just a clumsy POV-pushing effort. It lists nine countries (well, eight plus the amateurishly bigoted catch-all "Muslim countries"), only three of which actually link to articles, only two of which in turn existed before today, when Urthogie revved up his google engines and found six instances where the word "apartheid" was used in connection with Australia. 6SJ7 is right that there's an important difference between South African apartheid and the system of rule in the occupied territories so unsettlingly reminiscent of it to so many. There's an equally important difference between the South Africa – Palestine parallels, which have been the central subject of numerous books and articles, scholarly and popular, on the one hand, and the <i>ad hoc</i> for-the-nonce metaphorical usages Urthogie is busy collating and building articles around in his effort at well-poisoning, on the other.</p>
<p>There's an argument you want to make: Israel's been accused of apartheid, but so has everyone else. Fine. Just find a source that makes that argument, and we'll include it. The sources critical of the analogy on the whole don't say this, though. In fact by and large they say precisely the opposite: they say Israel is being singled out for special opprobrium. That's a pervasive argument, so it's well-represented here. As far as I know, however, the argument that <i>everyone's been accused of apartheid – where apartheid is everywhere it's nowhere</i> etc. has only been made by Wikipedians. It doesn't belong here, and certainly not in the form of a coy banner.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 20:24, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Urthogie, first of all, sorry for attributing to your personal researches what was in fact culled from that content-dump of an article, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Apartheid_0256.html" title="Allegations of Apartheid">Allegations of Apartheid</a>. Now, to your bill of particulars:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know that infoboxes are "based on categorically grouping concepts," but that doesn't mean their use is therefore by definition NPOV. We could, for example, add an infobox to this page categorically grouping "Crimes under international law associated with the Israeli Occupation." That infobox would, like yours, be a violation of NPOV.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You would need an article called Crimes under international law associated with the Israeli Occupation to do that. We already have an article for <i>Allegations of apartheid.</i>--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There's a secondary question of whether grouping together every country whose policies someone at some time or another has likened to apartheid creates a compelling, relevant, and self-evidently justifiable "category." I would say it does not. The invocations of "apartheid" raked together in this crude manner vary enormously in number and kind in their different contexts, from <i>ad hoc</i> rhetorical flourishes to extended academic comparisons intended with greater literalness. Take a parallel case. "Ethnic cleansing" originally applied only to the former Yugoslavia. It has since been applied to many contexts. Sometimes the comparison is literal and widely used; other times it's metaphorical and idiosyncratic. The difference is important. You wouldn't create an infobox about "allegations of ethnic cleansing," and list therein the Junjaweed's campaign in Sudan side-by-side with the socioeconomic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, or the gentrification of San Francisco's <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_District_cb32.html" title="Mission District">Mission District</a>, even though all three have been the subject of such "allegations."</li>

<dd>First off, notice how not every country is on the template. Only those countries which have significantly large sections on <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of apartheid">Allegations of apartheid</a> (or which already have large articles of their own) were added to the template. This is not a crude manner, it is a manner reflecting the content on wikipedia, namely, an article entitled <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of apartheid">Allegations of apartheid</a>. As for "Allegations of ethnic cleansing", that is not comparible to apartheid, because apartheid is named after a specific racist south african policy, while ethnic cleansing is concretely recognizable in some circumstances. "apartheid", in short, is subjective outside of its original home (south africa).--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't propose we replace "Muslim countries" with something else; I propose we get rid of it. It's crude and bigoted. There are 20+ "Muslim countries" comprising a billion+ Muslim people. So far as I know no serious scholar has written about apartheid as a common feature of these.</li>

<li>The comparisons with anarchism, Hobbes, etc. are misleading. In such cases there are copious reliable sources linking the topics that we link with our infoboxes. So far as I know there aren't reliable sources linking the discourse of "apartheid" in Israel-Palestine to the discourse of "apartheid"-like conditions in the tourist industry in Cuba, or Brazil, or elsewhere. In this case, the categorical grouping of "related" concepts seems to have been performed by Wikipedians and Wikipedians only.</li>

<dd>There are no "sources" for any info box as far as I know of you just made up this concept of sourcing an infobox because you don't like this one. The anarchism info box isn't "sourced", it's just so damn obvious that an article with anarchism in its title fits under anarchism. Same goes here with an article with allegations of apartheid in its title. Also, another point-- the subsets of a given subject's info box don't need to be connected to each other by any given source. If this were the case, you couldn't put <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existentialism.html" title="Existentialism">Existentialism</a> in a philosophy info box if it hadn't been once linked with <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Urthogie, what you haven't answered is why you decided the correct infobox here is one which provides the different countries in which Apartheid has been alleged, and yet then nothing about apartheid itself. Your statement about "separate templates for separate levels" is simply nonsensical, as well as inconsistent with the example of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> that you provided. What you're saying here is that all of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> should link to each other, but shouldn't link to the United States itself, because that's on a different level. Really?</p>
<p>This is the fundamental problem from which the POV is apparent: on a neutral basis, these choices don't make sense. A neutral attempt to give background on this subject would not simply provide other countries where the allegation has been made: it would provide the full information on Apartheid, the crime, the allegations, and everything else. The problem, of course, is that this adds further gravitas to the article, which everybody here is willing to accept is not needed. Equally problematic, though, is what you're attempting to do, which is pick only the information that appears to promote one POV. I say that not as an accusation, but as an objective statement of how it appears to the reader.</p>
<p>Also, you're incorrect again that infoboxes don't have to be sourced. If something is contested as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, it has to be sourced like anything else. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 22:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>First off, you're attacking a straw man. "What you're saying here is that all of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> should link to each other, but shouldn't link to the United States itself, because that's on a different level. Really?". No, not really. As you can see, this template already <i>does</i> link to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of apartheid">Allegations of apartheid</a>, just as you would have the State link to the United States. --<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your second paragraph is barely comprehensible. Please write in clearer english as I can't even follow the logical progression of your thoughts. It might be partially my fault but this paragraph honestly seems to make no logical sense.</li>
<li>Ok, so on to your final point (third paagraph). No, I'm not incorrect to say that infoboxes don't have to be sourced. If they did, then you'd have to consider every info box an "original synthesis" of links.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I'm not sure the template is necessary at all. I'm simply saying: the assumption of an infobox is that we're providing information that readers are most likely to find useful. That said, would a person ariving at this article actually not be much more likely to want to read more on <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> than they would other countries where the phrase has been used? Certainly there's a curiousness to finding out that Australia or Cuba has been accused of Apartheid, but I can't think those are the most notable things people would be looking for.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason you say it's not necessary, I'd guess, isn't because you don't think it would be useful, but because you probably recognize it would be too pointed. Surely the information is otherwise useful enough to provide, right? In fact, if Urthogie and I were talking about the Cuba article, I bet we'd both agree that extended links to articles about Apartheid would be useful. Why not?</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Anyway, I can't say this is the end of the world for me either way, I just think these things cheapen WP.

Can you cite one other example of an article which fit these criteria that <i>doesn't</i> benefit navigationally from having an info box? Perhaps it's your personal POV of the world that makes you think such a template doesn't benefit the article. To me, it is obvious that any educated person should examine how allegations such as apartheid are used today. This doesn't imply a POV. It's possible to think Israel has apartheid and still get some insight on how the word is used from navigating through this handy info box..--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:35, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAllegations_of_Israeli_apartheid&amp;diff=118372866&amp;oldid=118364336" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAllegations_of_Israeli_apartheid&amp;diff=118372866&amp;oldid=118364336" rel="nofollow">point-by-point reply</a> above, Urthogie. May I ask however that in the future you provide a single rebuttal to my posts rather than breaking them up into little pieces? My post was intended to present an integrated set of points, rather than a grab-bag. I also think that interjecting point-by-point rebuttals leads quickly to impasse, in the form of thick, gnarled, weed-like arguments between two people, instead of a vigorous but open debate that anyone can join.</p>
<p>With respect, I think you haven't quite answered the objections raised about the value of this infobox and the NPOV issues it raises. There are, as I said, many ways of "categorically grouping concepts," and some are indeed POV-pushing. Frontloading a "handy" list of all the other countries in which apartheid has been "alleged" is as POV-pushing as frontloading a handy list of all the other crimes Israel has been accused of. Now, you keep saying that infoboxes don't need reliable sources. This is true but only in the trivial sense; we don't, that is, include footnotes for infoboxes. The conceptual groupings they endorse, however, should be ones that are important to – or at the very least ones that have <i>occurred</i> to – the reliable sources that provide us with our understanding of the topic in the first place. Infoboxes are not little free zones where WP:NOR doesn't apply, where Wikipedians get to present their own idiosyncratic conceptual frameworks for the material at hand.</p>
<p>You rather breezily waved aside my point about the parallel case of "ethnic cleansing, saying that it's <i>"not comparible to apartheid, because apartheid is named after a specific racist south african policy, while ethnic cleansing is concretely recognizable in some circumstances. 'apartheid', in short, is subjective outside of its original home (south africa)."</i> I think this won't do, and if you don't mind I'm going to return to it and press you a little. <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">Ethnic "cleansing"</a> is a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanword</a> from Serbo-Croatian named after specific policies in the former Yugoslavia, just like <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> is a loanword from Afrikaans, named after specific policies in pre-1994 South Africa. The fact that you find the application of the term "ethnic cleansing" outside of its "original home" to be self-evidently justified in certain contexts ("concretely recognizable in some circumstances") is – with respect – beside the point. Many prominent persons with no particular axe to grind find apartheid conditions to be "concretely recognizable" in Israel-Palestine. That's also beside the point. What is <i>not</i> beside the point is that in both cases a morally charged historical analogy (apartheid, ethnic cleansing) is invoked in a <i>huge</i> variety of contexts. Sometimes the analogy is meant rhetorically and used merely for moral emphasis (describing the aftermath of Katrina as "ethnic cleansing" underscores the racial and socioeconomic fault-lines the disaster made visible, for example; referring to Cuban tourism as a form of apartheid, similarly, underscores the hypocrisy and unseemliness of a socialist pseudo-utopia kept afloat by a nakedly capitalist tourist economy). At other times the analogy is meant with much greater literalness, and becomes the subject of sustained historical comparisons by scholars, writers, journalists, activists and politicians (this is the case with ethnic cleansing in the Sudan, or apartheid in the occupied territories). An infobox that flattens these distinctions, and creates a single category for them, a category that is "so damn obvious" to Wikipedians with a given POV (but not obvious enough to have penetrated the thick skulls of our reliable sources), is POV-pushing original research. If apologists for the Janjaweed were well-represented on Wikipedia, they'd have a field day making little infoboxes about "allegations of ethnic cleansing," and neatly arraying within them whatever scraps of heated rhetoric they managed to comb together from their internet researches. I'd be opposing them as doggedly as I'm opposing you, so don't take it personally.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 15:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, i really disagree. Since Carter makes his point using the concept of apartheid, it is really better to leave that information in the entry, where others can find it, and use it.

<dd>You're ignoring what I said. I know he says "apartheid", that's the title of his book. But it's not a reference to Israel, but to the existential situation he thinks the Palestinians and the Israelis find themselves in, respectively. His book, I remind you, is called <i>Palestine: Peace not apartheid.</i> Palestine refers to the entire land both the arab palestinians and the jews are on. Not only this, but he's even devoted speaches and articles to clarifying how his view isn't that there is "Israeli apartheid." He blame both sides (israel for the wall, palestinians for terrorism) in creating this situation they find themselves in. I'm removing the libelous quote unless you have some further explanation for it, or can address what I'm saying here.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Urthogie, if you don't like the treatment, you should try to change it as seems appropriate. Suggesting this is libelous because you see a slight distinction from what Carter has said doesn't seem helfpul. As we define the analogy, we say that it refers to several things which are broadly defined. For that matter, where do we say the analogy alleges a policy of apartheid in Israel? Particularly with Sm8900's clarifications, I don't see any possible misunderstanding. Carter is extremely important to this debate, though; again, if you want to change something, do, but we can't just delete him. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 15:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but the article does in fact lay the definition square at the hands of Israeli policies: "Allegations of Israeli apartheid draw a controversial analogy from the policies apartheid era South Africa to those of Israel." Neither Carter, nor Zbigniew Brzezinski use it this way-- to describe Israeli policies. Only to describe the situation that the sides find themselves in. It's not only OR, but it's libelous. I'm sticking to that.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 16:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only way in which Carter is releveant to this article is his many speeches and article in which he has made clear why he named his book what he did:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, he [Dershowitz] has to go to the first word in the title, which is "Palestine," not "Israel." He should go to the second word in the title, which is "Peace." And then the last two words [are] "Not Apartheid." <i>I never have alleged in the book or otherwise that Israel, as a nation, was guilty of apartheid</i>. But there is a clear distinction between the policies within the nation of Israel and within the occupied territories that Israel controls[,] and the oppression of the Palestinians by Israeli forces in the occupied territories is horrendous. And it's not something that has been acknowledged or even discussed in this country. . . .

<p>"When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa."

<p>Israel unilaterally disengaged.

<dl>
<dd>I wasn't under the impression that anyone opposed this lead, but it seems like G-Dett might. Lemme exlpain why I wrote it this way:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>When the allegation of Israeli apartheid is made, it can mean one of two things. The first thing it can refer to is the claim that Israeli policy in the West Bank is analogous to apartheid. It can also refer to a seperate claim--which by default accepts the first one as well-- that Israel is a South Africa- style apartheid state. The issues involved the first allegation are the conditions and restrictions placed on Palestinian inhabitants of the West Bank, while the issues involved in the second allegation are supposed similarities between Israel and South Africa. A book-length study on the subject of these allegations said that the second claim is made most often by "Palestinians, many Third World academics, and several Jewish post-Zionists who idealistically predict an ultimate South African solution of a common or binational state." The first claim, however, is associated with a seperate group, "which sees both similarities and differences, and which looks to South African history for guidance in bringing resolution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians." The majority of intellectuals and journalists, however, disagree with the allegation being used in any way "and deplore what [they] deem its propagandistic goals."</p>

<dl>
<dd>As you can see, the entire article is framed in a way which represents the largest piece of summarizing literature on the subject. This is about as close as we can get to fairly representing this material, and as far as we can get from original research. This stands in stark contrast to the mud-slinging fights that occured on the editing of the former lead, in which various people with opinions would add sentences that had subtle POV's.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 19:23, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It misrepresents them because they're not talking about "allegations of Israeli apartheid." They're talking about broad historical comparisons; they're talking about any work (like theirs, for example) that attempts to "draw strategic lessons from the negotiated settlement in South Africa for the unresolved conflict in the Middle East." The mistake is hardly your fault; Adam and Moodley have been cherry-picked to death on this page. They're worth reading in the unadulterated original.</dd>

<dd>You're ignoring the basic fact that the three groups concern commentators on the analogy of apartheid. You're ignoring it by pointing out what the entire essay is about. Yes, the essay as a whole is about "broad historical comparisons", yes, but this ignores the fact that it's broken down into sections, and this is from one that deals with how people comment on the analogy. What you're saying is the logical equivelant of someone saying we can't use a book on dogs for a source on dalmations, because that quote doesn't deal with the "broader context" of dogs as an entire species.</dd>

<dd>The Adam &amp; Moodley material is from a book, not an essay. One chapter of it is available online; that chapter has tended to be read in isolation here (as an "essay"), and it's that one that's been cherry-picked to death. Now, it is absolutely clear that the tripartite division you're quoting from refers to attitudes towards the broad historical comparison, not the apartheid "allegation" (a word, incidentally, never used by A &amp; M). You will see this if you read the paragraph which precedes the tripartite division, especially the first two sentences of that paragraph (p.19 in the original, p.12 in the online pdf file). For Adam &amp; Moodley's presentation of the various components of that broad comparison, which include but are not limited to the apartheid analogy, see the next section (p.21-27 in the original), "Uses and Abuses of the Israel-South Africa Comparison."</dd>

<dd>One sec, if the overview already had conensus, why would putting similar stuff in the lead suddenly be "cherry-picking"? My lead already has consensus based on this fact alone, that the overview stayed so solid. The only element of my lead that needs improvement is it's style-- an issue you brought up just to denigrate my edits to stop them from staying in the lead.

<p>Urthogie, if you were being reasonable, you would admit that you came here a couple weeks ago to insert this argument in the lead,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid&amp;diff=115496618&amp;oldid=115490600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid&amp;diff=115496618&amp;oldid=115490600" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> failed, and so then decided to replace it in template form.</p>
<p>Either way, if you get around to responding to G-Dett's post, please also try to explain again why you think we should have this particular "lower level template" here rather than any "higher level template." As I pointed out above, your example of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> actually cuts directly against your point, since all of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_in_Austria_7fc4.html" title="Anarchism in Austria">Anarchism in Austria</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_in_China_7f5f.html" title="Anarchism in China">Anarchism in China</a>, etc. articles actually have a plain <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">Template:Anarchism</a>, not a narrow one on Template:Regional Anarchism. It's gotten a little silly here to ask you to actually argue your point consistently, but since three editors are disagreeing with you, perhaps it's worth asking again. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 21:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to second Mackan79's last post. Again, I agree with both him and G-Dett. And Urthogie, I am glad you see the merits of aruging with one point of view. perhaps you will realize that the essence of Wikipedia discussions is that each user usually represents a larger group of users who have a similar set of concerns. Since that simple idea seems to be in doubt here, i am using this to express my support for the other two editors, as a group.

<p>Kendrick, I'd be fine deleting the template, but simply tend to take a more minimalist approach. The problem with this template happens only to be specifically in regard to this article, where it was included as a sort of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, and serves to promote a particular argument. Does it make sense to require the deletion of the whole template because it presents a POV problem in one article?

<dd>I believe apartheid, as a crime against humanity, is evil in all its forms, and while I certainly believe that Israel is the most egregious current example of its practice, I don't think a template listing it whereever it might reasonably said to be in practice is a terrible thing. I do understand that Urthogie's motive might not be pure, but considering the pre-existance of the general <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of apartheid">allegations of apartheid</a> article, I can't say I disapprove of an overall (re)split with a navigatible template for this whole topic.

<dd>I, like the majority of journalists and commentators believe the analogy is complete propaganda in regards to calling Israel an "apartheid state", and hyperbole in regards to the West Bank. The wall, the west bank, all of this is because of Palestinian terrorism.

<dd>andy, the fourth paragraph did not in any way repeat the third.

<dd>It's a few hours ago, and therefor old history, but the fourth paragraph redundantly repeated the now-removed third (equally badly written) paragraph phrase "...that the cited practices of the analogy are based on security needs...". What's missing from the fourth paragraph now is the "instead of" component... Of course, apartheid had a real security component too, so it's a badly thought out argument for the illegitimacy of the analogy. The analogy is an attempt to appropriate the opprobrium earned by the racist components of apartheid to a situation where those elements are a much less important part of the ideology... But, I didn't remove the argument from the lead because it is a poor one. I just removed the then-existant repetition. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 22:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted back to a somewhat earlier version (not the version I wrote, but only with a small modification by me). It is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to give undue weight in the lead to those positions which accept the allegations. In fact, only in the final paragraph do we actually figure out what <i>most</i> commentators think about the allegation. Please don't remove this important fact, as we are otherwise giving undue weight to supporters (who are a minority in the press), and taking away the deserved weight of detractors (a majority in the press). If I were really being stubborn I'd insist we give more weight to the majority view on whether these allegations are valid, because the majority view is by definition deserving of more weight. However, I have been willing to compromise and give slightly less weight to the mainstream opinion which deserves immensely more. I've also compromised by not restoring my own lead, because I listened to consensus, despite the fact that I think it's immensely better than this lead.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we slow down a little with these incessant modifications of the lead? The usual protocol is to copy whatever version of the lead has enjoyed some stability (meaning weeks, usually) and paste it in on the talk page, list your objections to it and propose a substitute in draft form. Then others either echo your objections or dismiss them. If the latter, you're out of luck. If the former, then they make suggestions and modifications to your draft rewrite. By and by the draft rewrite tightens and refines and gets backing; and when it reaches some critical mass of consensus and stability it's moved, with a certain amount of fanfare, into the article itself.</p>
<p>The lead isn't the place to build sandcastles to be knocked down by the next caprice of the tides.</p>
<p>I'm not going to edit-war with you, Urthogie, but it may interest you to know that the last paragraph of the lead as you've got it now is virtually a word-for-word repetition of the second-to-last.

<p>Aloni's article clearly does not use the "Israeli apartheid" allegation in reference to Israel itself, but rather to its actions in the territories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jewish self-righteousness is taken for granted among ourselves to such an extent that we fail to see what's right in front of our eyes. It's simply inconceivable that the ultimate victims, the Jews, can carry out evil deeds. Nevertheless, the state of Israel practises its own, quite violent, form of Apartheid with the native Palestinian population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He therefore belongs in that section on settlements, not this one.</p>
<p>Lapid never even says there's apartheid. He variously says it "smell of apartheid" and that it's "getting close to apartheid". Note, he's saying this individual law is apartheid, not all of Israel, as well.

Also, note how it has had constant consensus in the Overview section.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:35, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you are splitting hairs. Tutu knows everything there is to know about apartheid, he's leveled the charge against Israel, and his direct quote refers to Palestinians that no longer can access their homes in Jerusalem inside of Israel itself. It's clear as day what Tutu is saying. Please stop trying to obfuscate the issue.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKritt_aaaf.html" title="User:Kritt">Kritt</a> 23:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but you're the one confusing the issue. You're saying that anything bad Tutu says about Israel is a reference to apartheid, even though he only uses the term explicitly in reference to the territories.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who says other countries practices more closely resemble South Africa's than do Israel's? Let's see some sources for that before it makes into a Wikipedia lead paragraph. Israel is accused of apartheid far more than is any other country in the world. South African anti-apartheid individuals have not accused Islamic countries, Cuba, Brazil, or Australia anywhere near the level they have Israel. The lead is POV and unsupportable.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKritt_aaaf.html" title="User:Kritt">Kritt</a> 22:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Read the sentence carefully. It's specified as an argument among those who oppose the analogy only. Sources seem to be already provided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Israel is accused more of apartheid more than any in the world because a large portion of the world doesn't think Jews have a right to a Jewish state in Palestine. But this petty argument has nothing to do with the article.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the two sources you have are very weak for the claims you make in the Lead. They belong elsewhere. I read those sources and they do not agree with the sentence you support: <i>"whose practices more closely resemble South African apartheid"</i>. The sources you have provided do not make that claim. Even so, it's a very small contingent that you are using, it's very much like cherry-picking, to support a point-of-view. Islamic nations may commit human rights abuses, but nobody calls it "apartheid" as they do democratic Israel. It truly doesn't belong in the lead and it's POV and unsupportable. Please reconsider it. Thanks.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKritt_aaaf.html" title="User:Kritt">Kritt</a> 22:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>UPDATE: Just noticed I misread you...Two sources work for that argument to establish that its made. I can add more if you insist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some Islamic nations bar non-muslims from entry, most treat women worse than anywhere in the world, most of them you can't live in safety if you're Jewish, and some of them you'll have econd class status in a lot of them if you're christian. I don't call it apartheid, though, because that's an insult to South Africa. People call Israel apartheid, despite the fact that arabs there have better lives than in any of their dictatorships, because they truly believe Palestinians own the entire land, believing that the Jews have no right to a Jewish state there. Such is politics. And that's why most educated commentators don't resort to such rhetorical violence.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I said that I read through the sources that are provided as the footnotes ( I think currently #3, #4), and they do not say what the Lead sentence says. It's POV and maybe your personal view of things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because you might hate Islamic practices, doesn't mean that the world calls them apartheid, that's what I'm saying, and you haven't shown where the back up is for <i>other countries whose practices more closely resemble South African apartheid</i>, where is it? We are talking about a lead paragraph, and there's no back up.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKritt_aaaf.html" title="User:Kritt">Kritt</a> 22:50, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some of the world does call it apartheid-- in major newspapers, policy magazines, etc. Two sources are enough to establish the argument exists for this page, by the way. I'll add more in a sec.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:54, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>also, can I ask how you came here all of a sudden, having edited almost solely this page, and knowing how wikipedia works from the very first second? This is just a sidenote.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seriously, the sentence's own sources and footnotes (as weak as they are) do not back up the sentence! It's misleading and doesn't belong anywhere near the Lead. It's POV and speculative.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKritt_aaaf.html" title="User:Kritt">Kritt</a> 23:01, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
