<p>I have tried to edit this to comply more closely with usual WP practice. I have written a short introductory section and replaced 8 external links to websites apparently owned by the subject's grandson, with a single link from which the other sites can be reached. I think more work is needed on the article. At present it contains a rather too much in the way of expressions of praise and tributes to Mashriqi and would be better balanced if there were more details of his works and struggles as leader of Khaksars to substantiate the tributes. I also think it would be useful to introduce some other references to show the wider perspective in which his work is held rather than to rely mainly on his grandson's websites and books, although it is clear that he has assembled a great deal of information about his father working through newspapers and Government archives in Pakistan and London. <a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op.

<dd>On this occasion it was not me who made the mistake, but an unregistered editor who may not be very familiar with the syntax and editing process. I am rather concerned that the article is still unbalanced lacking detail and with too much emphasis on tributes. I will search out more references to try and obtain a sample of authoritative views independent of the the work of the grandson's websites and works, which are the major references at present. <a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op.

<p>I think the anonymous editor at 65.110.153.102 is wrong to rely so heavily as a source on the works and the websites of Mashriqi's grandson Nasim Yousaf. To me these seem designed to only to report things which present Mashriqi in an exessively favourable light.</p>
<p>My attention was first drawn to this through the description in this article of his academic career. But, I then found the whole of the article has the sound of an exercise in <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>. Both <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">User:Rama's Arrow</a> and I have called (see above) for a wider range of sources to be consulted. I have found several, but when I try to introduce these to provide a balanced picture from the literature anything that is not fullsom praise of Mashriqi is being removed by 65.110.153.102 and in many cases my sources are also being removed.</p>
<p>After the latest deletions by 65.110.153.102, a careful study of the sources demonstrates clearly to me that there are mistaken quotation of sorces on Yousaf's website. here is what he says on page <a href="http://www.allamamashraqi.com/mashraqipraised.html" class="external free" title="http://www.allamamashraqi.com/mashraqipraised.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allamamashraqi.com/mashraqipraised.html</a></p>
<p><i>“Inayatullah Khan of Christ’s College [University of Cambridge], besides gaining First Class in Oriental Languages obtained Honours in Natural Sciences Tripos. He became Wrangler after only two years residence . . .” The Times, London, June 17, 1911</i></p>
<p>But I have carefully copied the following from that issue of the Times and one can clearly see that the words which are in quotation marks on Yousaf's website have in fact been edited to remove mention of the fact that the Natural Sciences examination result was a third class, and in fact Mashriqi was 27th wrangler, which means that 26 mathemetics students got higher marks than him:</p>
<p><i>University Intelligence</i> <i>Cambridge, June 16.</i></p>
<p><i>The following further tripos lists were issued today:-</i></p>
<p>.........</p>
<p><i>Natural Sciences Tripos Pt I</i></p>

<p><i>Class III</i></p>
<p>....</p>
<p><i>Ds Inayat Ullah Khan, Christ's</i></p>

<p><i>Class I</i></p>
<p><i>Ds Inayat Ullah Khan, Christ's</i></p>
<p><i>Arabic I, II. Persian I, II.</i></p>
<p>....</p>
<p><i>Inayat Ullah Khan, who was bracketed 27th wrangler in 1909, his second year of residence, also today obtained a Third Class in the Natural Sciences Tripos, Part I. He was born on August 28, 1888, and was educated at the Forman College, Lahore, the Government College, Armritsar, and the Punjab University.</i></p>
<p>Now all this may seem rather pedantic, but look then at the file name in the url of the page quoted above <i>mashraqipraised.html</i> . The choice of the word <i>praised</i> could be saying something about the mindset of the author.</p>
<p>Even more worringly look at the following extracts from a related website <a href="http://allama-mashriqi.8m.com/warning.html" class="external free" title="http://allama-mashriqi.8m.com/warning.html" rel="nofollow">http://allama-mashriqi.8m.com/warning.html</a> and draw your own conclusions after reading the whole website.</p>

<p>I hope 65.110.153.102 can assure us that he is not connected to Yousaf's websites.

<p>This page was badly in need of NPOV. I have removed the POV material and copyedited the text and the references. It is not necessary to have a long section of tributes to Mashriqi, so I have trimmed that right down.</p>
<p>At the moment, I feel there is a real lack of information on Mashriqi's role in the Khaksar movement in this article. Clearly, that movement is the main point of interest for a general reader, along with Mashriqi's literary works (which are quite well covered). Could we please have much more and some recognition of the fact that the Khaksars were controversial? At the moment, it makes very odd reading: lots and lots on what a noble scholar Mashriqi was, and then suddenly he keeps being arrested for no obvious reason. As I understand it, the Khaksars were emphatically a militant organisation, and Mashriqi's activities were controversial.</p>
<p>Another serious issue I think we need to resolve is the name of the page. Bearing in mind Wikipedia's policy against using titles, shouldn't the page be called "Inayatullah Khan al-Mashriqi"? This also extends to terms like "Holy Qur'an", which is specifically singled out for removal in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Islam-related_articles%29_b44f.html#Islamic_honorifics" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Islam-related articles)">Manual of Style</a>. -- <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinaSparkle_3b36.html" title="User:TinaSparkle">TinaSparkle</a> 16:42, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
