<p><b>The Alliance</b>, in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_New_Zealand_a429.html" title="Politics of New Zealand">New Zealand politics</a>, is a <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">left-wing</a> political party. The party is currently outside parliament, but has previously been a significant presence there. It suffered a major setback after <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Anderton_86b1.html" title="Jim Anderton">Jim Anderton</a>, the party's leader, left the party in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, taking several of the party's MPs.

<p>The Alliance is led by two co-leaders. At the 2006 National Conference of the Alliance, no co-leaders were appointed, but will be selected from the candidate pool for the next general election.

<p>The Alliance is a decidedly left-wing party. It is a strong supporter of free <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>, free <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healthcare.html" title="Healthcare">healthcare</a>, the reduction of <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a>, and the maintenance of the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_state.html" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a>. It also has a strong emphasis on <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_rights.html" title="Women's rights">women's rights</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalism.html" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a>, and <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/o/M%C4%81ori.html" title="Māori">Māori</a> rights. It is a strong supporter of New Zealand's nuclear-free policy, and believes that New Zealand should not participate in military action taken by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>The party supports higher <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxation.html" title="Taxation">tax</a> for wealthier people and lower taxation for poorer people. It also supports the removal of the <a href="../../../g/s/t/GST_65fa.html" title="GST">GST</a> tax on goods and services, claiming that the tax is unfair because the amount paid does not vary according to the purchaser's ability to afford it. Among its other economic policies are proposals to focus more on regional development and local economic planning, rather than on "big business". It also opposes the privatization of public assets, and the sale of non-urban land to foreign buyers.</p>

<p>The Alliance was formed at the end of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> as an alliance of four parties. The largest of the four was the <a href="../../../n/e/w/NewLabour_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_ad00.html" title="NewLabour Party (New Zealand)">NewLabour Party</a>, established by former <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Labour_Party_8ef8.html" title="New Zealand Labour Party">Labour Party</a> politician <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Anderton_86b1.html" title="Jim Anderton">Jim Anderton</a>. The oldest was the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Democratic_Party_4af3.html" title="New Zealand Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a> (originally known as the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Credit_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_deeb.html" title="Social Credit Party (New Zealand)">Social Credit Party</a>, and dedicated to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Credit_67ac.html" title="Social Credit">Social Credit</a> policies). The others were <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mana_Motuhake_62ac.html" title="Mana Motuhake">Mana Motuhake</a> (a Māori party) and the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand_df30.html" title="Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand">Greens</a> (an environmentalist party).</p>
<p>Until his departure from Labour in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Anderton had been the most vocal Labour MP in his criticism of his party's new direction. Led by <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Douglas_c917.html" title="Roger Douglas">Roger Douglas</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Finance_%28New_Zealand%29_9917.html" title="Minister of Finance (New Zealand)">Minister of Finance</a>, Labour had adopted radical policies of economic liberalization, free trade, and privatization of state assets - sharply in contrast both with the party's background and its campaign promises. This was deeply unpopular both with a section of the public and with ordinary members, but Douglas and his allies, without effective constraint by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand_9eee.html" title="Prime Minister of New Zealand">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lange_14c7.html" title="David Lange">David Lange</a>, pressed on with the reforms. Anderton, despite heavy pressure from the party authorities, refused to vote in favour of the measures, and eventually quit the party. He contested the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1990_71f4.html" title="New Zealand general election 1990">1990 elections</a> under the banner of NewLabour, a party he quickly established. He successfully retained his electorate seat, becoming the first MP to leave a party and not lose their position in the next elections.</p>
<p>NewLabour, the Democrats, and Mana Motuhake, all of which opposed the platform set out by Douglas, gradually began to work together to fight their common enemy. Initially, this co-operation was limited, but expanded after a joint candidate was successful in an <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland%2C_New_Zealand_9f22.html" title="Auckland, New Zealand">Auckland</a> local-body election. The Greens, who had policies and electoral support, but not party organization, also took notice.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">1 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, NewLabour, the Greens, the Democrats, and Mana Motuhake formally agreed to establish the Alliance as an official party. This established the three original pillars of Alliance policy - left-wing economics (represented by NewLabour and the Democrats), environmentalism (represented by the Greens), and Māori issues (represented by Mana Motuhake).</p>
<p>Shortly after the official establishment of the Alliance, a small splinter group from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_National_Party_f015.html" title="New Zealand National Party">National Party</a> applied to join. This group, known as the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Liberal_Party_%28Alliance%29_0ffb.html" title="New Zealand Liberal Party (Alliance)">Liberal Party</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Liberal_Party_1c8b.html" title="New Zealand Liberal Party">original Liberal Party</a>), consisted of two former National Party MPs who were disillusioned with the continuation of Douglas's policies by National's <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Richardson_3adb.html" title="Ruth Richardson">Ruth Richardson</a>. The Liberals became the fifth member of the Alliance.</p>
<p>There were also discussions regarding the Alliance's links with <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Peters_3496.html" title="Winston Peters">Winston Peters</a>, a former National MP who founded the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_First_de0c.html" title="New Zealand First">New Zealand First</a> party. Peters was also opposed to the economic reforms being undertaken, was hostile towards big business, and claimed to support ordinary New Zealanders, but was also highly <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> in his social policies. In particular, his views on <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration.html" title="Immigration">immigration</a> were incompatible with the Alliance's belief in multiculturalism. There were also problems regarding who would lead any merged entity - both the Alliance's Anderton and New Zealand First's Peters were well regarded for standing up to their old parties, leaving it unclear which of them should be senior. (Some have also claimed that neither Anderton nor Peters would accept being ranked second - both politicians are sometimes accused by their critics of being egotistical and controlling). Regardless of the reason, the Alliance and New Zealand First did not move together.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%28New_Zealand_political_party%29_535f.html" title="Edit section: Early electoral performance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early electoral performance</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, the Alliance contested a by-election in the electorate of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamaki.html" title="Tamaki">Tamaki</a>. The former stronghold of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Muldoon_f042.html" title="Robert Muldoon">Robert Muldoon</a>, a conservative National Party leader, Tamaki was not regarded as an easy run for the Alliance. It was, therefore, surprising when the Alliance nearly won the seat, pushing Labour into third place. Later that year, the Alliance gained control of <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland%2C_New_Zealand_9f22.html" title="Auckland, New Zealand">Auckland</a>'s regional council. These two performances helped establish the Alliance as a significant threat to the major parties.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1993_b59e.html" title="New Zealand general election 1993">1993 elections</a>, the Alliance gained 18% of the vote. However, the electoral system meant that the party only won two seats - one delivered by Jim Anderton, and the other by <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Lee-Vercoe_37e8.html" title="Sandra Lee-Vercoe">Sandra Lee-Vercoe</a> in Auckland. Occurring at the same time as this election, however, was the referendum which introduced the <a href="../../../m/m/p/MMP_6fe6.html" title="MMP">MMP</a> electoral system, making it much easier for smaller parties to get representation. The Alliance was a strong supporter of this change.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Jim Anderton left the leadership of the Alliance, citing family reasons. Sandra Lee-Vercoe was placed in charge of the party. Later, however, Anderton was persuaded to return, and resumed the leadership.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%28New_Zealand_political_party%29_535f.html" title="Edit section: Under MMP">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Under MMP</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1996_2f48.html" title="New Zealand general election 1996">1996 elections</a>, the Alliance gained 10% of the vote. Under the new electoral system, this secured the party thirteen MPs. New Zealand First, however, had obtained seventeen MPs, and held the balance of power between Labour and National. Eventually, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters opted to form a coalition with National, leaving both Labour and the Alliance in opposition.</p>
<p>The Labour Party, now led by <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Clark_9b2a.html" title="Helen Clark">Helen Clark</a>, had moved away from the policies of Roger Douglas - both Douglas and his strongest supporter, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Prebble_0e0d.html" title="Richard Prebble">Richard Prebble</a>, had left Labour to found the <a href="../../../a/c/t/ACT_New_Zealand_c833.html" title="ACT New Zealand">ACT</a> party, and Clark's more traditional faction had taken over. This allowed a gradual reconciliation between Labour and the Alliance, a process assisted by the impression that lack of cooperation had cost both parties support. Eventually, this led to an agreement between the two parties, with both sides agreeing to cooperate in forming a government should election results allow it.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, the Greens decided that they would leave the Alliance at the next election, believing that they could perform better individually. Other developments in the Alliance's makeup included the formal dissolution of both the NewLabour Party and the Liberal Party, with their members becoming members of the Alliance as a whole rather than of any specific constituent party. This left the Democrats and Mana Motuhake as the only parts of the Alliance with distinct identities.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1999_830d.html" title="New Zealand general election 1999">1999 elections</a>, the Alliance gained around 8% of the vote, giving it ten seats. This, combined with Labour's forty-nine seats and some support from the Greens, was enough to form a government. Jim Anderton become <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand_ee7f.html" title="Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand">Deputy Prime Minister</a>, and three other Alliance MPs gained positions in <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a>. The Alliance claims to have made a number of significant achievements while in government, citing (among other things) the creation of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Economic_Development_%28New_Zealand%29_2328.html" title="Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)">Ministry of Economic Development</a>, the lifting of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimum_wage.html" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a>, a change in funding systems for schools, and abolition of market rents for state housing. The party also claims to have exerted an important general influence over other governmental decisions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%28New_Zealand_political_party%29_535f.html" title="Edit section: Split">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Split</span></h3>
<p>Towards the end of the parliamentary term, however, internal tensions began to grow within the Alliance. This was partly driven by the party's low poll ratings, which were often blamed on perceived "subservience" to Labour. In particular, many members of the party organization were less willing to support Labour than the party's MPs were, leading to a rift between parliamentary leader Anderton and party president <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_McCarten_4f2e.html" title="Matt McCarten">Matt McCarten</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, Anderton decided to leave the Alliance and establish a new party. However, rules regarding changes of party allegiance meant that Anderton and his allies could not officially resign from the Alliance without also resigning from parliament, which they were unwilling to do. This led to the awkward situation of Anderton and his allies technically remaining part of the Alliance while actually operating outside of it. The conflict within the Alliance was one of the reasons cited by Helen Clark for her calling elections several months early in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>.</p>
<p>Anderton, along with three other Alliance MPs, established the Progressive Coalition Party (later just the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Progressive_Party_8f70.html" title="New Zealand Progressive Party">Progressive Party</a>). Three Alliance MPs, led by <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laila_Harr%C3%A9_4279.html" title="Laila Harré">Laila Harré</a>, chose to remain with the Alliance. The remaining three MPs (two supporting Anderton, one supporting Harré) decided not to stand for parliament again. The Democrats, one of the two Alliance components still having a separate identity, chose to follow Anderton, while Mana Motuhake, the other, chose to stay. Labour was largely successful in avoiding being drawn into the dispute.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%28New_Zealand_political_party%29_535f.html" title="Edit section: Decline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_2002_7d82.html" title="New Zealand general election 2002">2002 elections</a>, the Alliance and the Progressives competed against each other. The Alliance, believing that it would struggle to reach 5% (the threshold for a party being awarded representation proportional to its support), needed to win an electorate seat to gain entry to parliament. It chose to focus on <a href="../../../w/a/i/Waitakere.html" title="Waitakere">Waitakere</a> (contested by Harré) and Tainui (contested by <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Jackson_c587.html" title="Willie Jackson">Willie Jackson</a>, leader of Mana Motuhake). In both seats, however, the Alliance came second, losing each time to a Labour candidate, and so failed to gain parliamentary representation. In the list vote the party failed to meet the threshold gaining only 1.27% of the Party vote.</p>
<p>After the election, Mana Motuhake chose to leave the Alliance. This left the Alliance without any component parties - all members are now simply members of the Alliance as a whole.</p>
<p>Laila Harré stepped down as the party's leader on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">30 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, and was replaced by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_McCarten_4f2e.html" title="Matt McCarten">Matt McCarten</a>, the party president who clashed with Anderton. McCarten advocated a policy which would see the Alliance focus less on electoral activity and more on playing a co-ordinating role — he has been a particularly strong advocate of working with the new <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/o/M%C4%81ori_Party_8071.html" title="Māori Party">Māori Party</a>, which the Alliance had been involved with and practically supported during Tariana Turia's by-election campaign and the Maori Party launch. There was an ongoing debate within the Alliance, given the poll ratiungs of less than 1%, as to whether the Alliance should contest the list vote in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_2005_f2fa.html" title="New Zealand general election 2005">2005 elections</a>, or instead only stand in electorate seats and encourage its supporters to use their list vote to support the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand_df30.html" title="Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand">Greens</a> or the Māori Party. <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Ovens_f3a1.html" title="Jill Ovens">Jill Ovens</a>, a former candidate and the new party president, was critical of McCarten's support of the Māori Party, saying that working both for the Alliance and the Māori Party at the same time represented a conflict of interest and resigned at one stage over the issue (Ovens subsequently joined the Labour Party in 2006). When no agreement could be reached on the electoral strategy McCarten and Harré dissassociated themselves from the Alliance. Gerard Hehir, the outgoing General Secretary, informed the Electoral Commission that the Alliance no longer had the five hundred financial members required for registration.
