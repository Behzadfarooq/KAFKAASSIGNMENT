<p>I reverted the info on the page back to his still being a 76er. I'm sure there will be dozens of trade rumors within the next day or so -- let's wait for official news before moving his team, no?</p>

<p>It says on here that he is a ball hog ("He is criticized as being a "ball hog"." under Trivia) but he averages 7+ assists per game, is that really ball hog worthy, considering how much skills he has while the rest of his team is almost completely obsolete?</p>
<ul>
<li>I love Iverson's game and his teammates are so offensively inept, so had to dominate the ball. It's probably the best strategy. But I have to admit, so many critics think so, that this fact can't be ignored. He's now assisting more than ever though, and slowly shedding the label. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAree_d14b.html" title="User:Aree">Aree</a> 08:58, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Earlier in his career, it wouldn't have necessarily been an unfair criticism. He still has that reputation today, which I think is unfair. A lot of people ignore the fact that Iverson is currently one of only two NBA players in the top ten in scoring and assists. Dwayne Wade is the other. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuttaherephils_cf1e.html" title="User:Outtaherephils">J-Red</a> 04:41, 4 March 2006 (UTC)Outtaherephils</li>

<p>shouldn't cornrows be talked about in this article, they are his trademark and he is the one credited with popularizing them.</p>

<p>well i feel the same becaus he is just misunderstood</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought that <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latrell_Sprewell_441f.html" title="Latrell Sprewell">Latrell Sprewell</a> was generally accepted as introducing cornrows into the NBA. That is to say, that people had worn them for a long time, even in the NBA, but he began a trend that caught on rather widespreadly. But even so, allen iverson deserves more credit because he is a better team player and doesnt choke his coaches!</dd>

<p>allen iverson is one of the best to play the game and no1 should question that. he won MVP set team records, and lead his team to the finals. enough said- iverson is the best hands down. tyler</p>

<p>No player has contributed as much to his team then Iverson. Nash pretty much stole the MVP from him (he wasn't even runnerup, Shaq also deserved it more). If he doesn't win it this year it's a damn shame, especially if Kobe "ballhog" Bryant gets it.</p>
<p>i agree- kobe ruinned the lakers. he should be kicked out of the league- but he can score at will. - what the hell? those are the two most pathetic comments i have ever heard. first of all, nash couldn't steal the mvp from shaq, he didn't have anything to do with the balloting process. secondly, nash averaging career highs (at that point) and leading a team to a 40 win (wasn't it?) improvement and the best record is significantly better than shaq's career lows in pts and rebounds, leading them (and wade was actually doing the leading, as he had the highest assists and 2nd highest pt? on the team. not saying that shaq isn't worthy, but nash was and is much worthier, he was after all the MVP on the best team (in the regular season anyway). also a little guy like him scoring and distributing 11 assists pgame is far more impressive than a 7 footer grabbing rebounds and scoring easy shots.</p>
<p>and u can tell by his performance this yr-thanks to him without their highest scorer they are still 4th in the league and he's made a batch of what was earlier really weak players (diaw, bell, house, thomas,..) into starters and valuable bench players. also don't whine, iverson's won the mvp before. kobe didn't ruin the lakers, kupchak did (the owner, or the gm, or whatever), though he did make efforts at rebuilding. Plus they are probably gonna make the playoffs this year. and no, kobe shouldn't be kicked out for being the best player in the league, and for him to achieve the scoring average he does on a team with no real pt guard and really crappy other players (except mihm/odom) is one hell of an achievement. not to mention that his 81 pt game is the strongest scoring performance ever. iverson's just as much of a ballhog, if not more than kb, which u'd know if u cared to watch the people u write about...iverson can also score at will... i can't believe i just wasted five minutes of my time responding to ur... misguided comments.</p>
<p>I agree with you man, not to let ur five mins wasted ^_^</p>
<hr />
<p>Iverson is clearly not deserved of the MVP award. In 2005-2006 he had career highs in numerous statistical categories yet those personal numbers did not translate into a team even winning 50% of their games and thus not being able to make the playoffs. Fans often confuse spectacular plays or high individual statistical numbers with MVP. This is not the case. MVP denotes exactly what it's name implies. Who is MOST VALUABLE to their team. In the case of Iverson's team, the Philadelphia Sixers, the group did not make the playoffs inspite of Iverson's statistics, therefore he provided nominal value to the team. In fact, great personal numbers are often at odds with great team play when one player focuses their energies on ensuring he attains a certain point total each and every night regardless of wheteher or not the shot attempts are high percentage attempts or best suited to the chemistry of distributing the ball towards improving the entire team's shooting percentage. Also, a key unmentioned component is defensive abilities. One may score 30 points but if on the defensive side your counterpart regularly is allowed to score 20 points, then the net affect of your offensive performance is negated. Iverson is a noted poor defensive performer, be it his small size or expended energy on offense, he is extemely poor defending a man in one-on-one situations. And for every steal he manages to pick he leaves himself in a vulnerable position more time than not when he is unsuccesful in those steal attempts.</p>
<p>In summary the MVP is a cumulative work of efforts - incorporating points, assists, team play, defense, chemistry, etc - not merely a points total. Iverson does shine in points but in other categories it can actually be argued that he is a detriment to his team.</p>

Nor does the fact that NBA rule changes have "limited iversons effectiveness" have a place in this article (Just to name a few). --Scotsworth 23:40, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I see that the article apparently has/ had POV issues. But still, I feel that my "player profile" section was overzealously scythed. The guy scores 30 PPG, and answering the question "how does he do it?" is a perfectly legit contribution to an article, if you can back it up.

<p>To those that are currently involved in the on-going point guard/combo guard reversion war, please see <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. It's better to has this stuff out here on the discussion page than it is to just keep reverting each other.</p>
<p>As for my two cents on the issue itself: it's true that "combo guard" has become a fairly commonly used basketball term. But so is "utility player" in baseball. But depsite the fact that Alex Rodriguez <i>can</i> play either shortstop or third base, the fact that he currently spends the vast majority of his playing time at third makes it far more informative to refer to him as a third baseman in the opening introductory statement, then go on to refer to his utility ability and past time at shortstop in the body of the article.</p>
<p>I don't follow the Sixers closely, but last I knew, Iverson's role on the 76ers was clearly <i>primarily</i> as their point guard. So unless that's changed of late and he's now starting to spend about equal time at both 1 and 2, then the same principle should apply here. The opening statment should say his a point guard, then in the body of the article it should go on to note his ability to play the 2 also. (And add a link there to <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Combo_guard.html" title="Combo guard">combo guard</a></i>, if you like.) <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 00:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC) allen iverson is so hot!</p>

<p>A highly publicized incident on Valentine's day that almost jeopardized his college career, Iverson was involved in a racially-charged fight at a <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton%2C_Virginia_6cea.html" title="Hampton, Virginia">Hampton</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> bowling alley.

Allen's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually something of a shouting duel began with another group of youths (all white). The only indisputable fact is that shortly thereafter a huge fight erupted, pitting the local white kids against the blacks. During the fight, Iverson was accused of attacking a woman and hitting her in the head with a chair. He, along with three of his friends, also black, were the only ones arrested in the incident. Iverson, 17 years of age at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of "maiming-by-mob". Iverson and his supporters maintain his innocence. Allen cannot be seen on an amateur video of the incident, and he claims he left the alley as soon as the trouble ended. "For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen?" asks Iverson. "That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I wish at least they'd said I hit some damn man."</p>
<p>This incident was profiled on the television newsmagazine <i><a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> due to claims of racial bias in the adjudication of the case. <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Douglas_Wilder_5cd5.html" title="L.

<dd><i>Although Stern wouldn't say exactly how he would enforce the new regulations -- which, among other things, require injured players seated on the bench to wear a sports jacket and outlaw chains, pendants or medallions over the player's clothes while on team or league business -- he did say that the league "will use a broad range of authority" to enforce compliance.</i></dd>

<p>I have posted readily verifiable data regarding Iverson's team record while in the lineup. A fact which is arguably key (if not most important) in noting what value his play delivered to his team and where he stands relative to other "great" players' success. User Mosmof has deleted this information for no legitimate reason, other than it does not suit his agenda. Looking over his Talk page, it appears that he has a history of user conflicts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.242.199.58 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.242.199.58.html" title="User talk:71.242.199.58">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.242.199.58_d971.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.242.199.58">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I have no agenda here. But you're clearly trying to make a point with your edit, and drawing a connection between the team's record and Iverson's value as a player is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. "Readers can draw their own conclusions from this data", as you wrote on my talk page, is a little disingenuous when you're leading them to the conclusion with your wording. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMosmof_7aef.html" title="User:Mosmof">Mosmof</a> 01:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
