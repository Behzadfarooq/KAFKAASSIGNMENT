<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally_MacLeod_3c0b.html" title="Edit section: Playing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing career</span></h2>
<p>MacLeod started his playing career at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Lanark_F.C._060a.html" title="Third Lanark F.C.">Third Lanark</a> as a provisional signing as a schoolboy in 1947. He made his first team debut against <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stirling_Albion_F.C._6ba5.html" title="Stirling Albion F.C.">Stirling Albion</a> at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathkin_Park_31d0.html" title="Cathkin Park">Cathkin Park</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">6 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Stirling being victorious 4-2 MacLeod frequently joked that his was a debut with a difference - although he did not set the local heather on fire, someone else did! As the teams trooped off the field at the end of the match, Cathkin's grandstand was ablaze. The players had to run into the dressing room, grab their clothes and race out as four fire engines had arrived to tackle the fire.</p>
<p>In 1953, MacLeod was in the Thirds side which trounced <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloa_Athletic_F.C._b8c0.html" title="Alloa Athletic F.C.">Alloa Athletic</a> in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_League_Cup_1c06.html" title="Scottish League Cup">League Cup</a> opener, 10-0. Sitting 8-0 up, MacLeod's team mates' main objective was to get him on the scoresheet. He had set up five goals but had missed several sitters himself. A left foot rocket shot, and a simple tap in took Thirds tally to 10. He joined the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Scots_227e.html" title="Royal Scots">Royal Scots</a> for <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Service_0445.html" title="National Service">National Service</a> but was still able to turn out for the Thirds.</p>
<p>MacLeod was reluctant to move to <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Mirren_F.C._b721.html" title="St Mirren F.C.">St. Mirren</a> in 1956, but having secured a guarantee that the reported £8,000 fee would tremendously help Third Lanark's survival, he moved on. He spent only six weeks at St Mirren before moving to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> team <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C._07df.html" title="Blackburn Rovers F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>.</p>
<p>He was man of the match in the 1960 <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_Final_4f9a.html" title="FA Cup Final">FA Cup Final</a>, but the game was lost 3-0 to <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolves</a>. While at Blackburn he made strenuous efforts along with the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_Footballers%27_Association_d394.html" title="Professional Footballers' Association">PFA</a> steward <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hill_4b18.html" title="Jimmy Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> to help abolish the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_wage.html" title="Maximum wage">maximum wage</a>, but when subsequently his promised wage increase was not forthcoming, while other players in the team were raised from £20 to £25 per week, he entered into discussions with <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernian_F.C._6793.html" title="Hibernian F.C.">Hibernian</a>. When Blackburn realised that they were going to lose him to Hibs they matched their offer with an increase from £20 to £25. MacLeod, having already accepted Hibs' offer, felt he could not go back on his word, so left Blackburn to go back to Scotland.</p>
<p>He played with Hibs until 1963, when he returned to Third Lanark. In 1964 he signed for <a href="../../../a/y/r/Ayr_United_F.C._4aa2.html" title="Ayr United F.C.">Ayr United</a>, where he finished his playing career, with no major honours won.</p>

<p>He started his managerial career in 1966 when he took charge of Ayr United. He took Ayr back to Scotland's <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Football_League_First_Division_f664.html" title="Scottish Football League First Division">top division</a> and maintained their status. He took them to a League Cup semi-final and also set their attendeance record with 25,225 watching a 2-1 success over <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers_F.C._0dbb.html" title="Rangers F.C.">Rangers F.C.</a> In 1973, MacLeod was named Ayr's "Citizen of the Year".</p>
<p>In 1975, after nine years at Ayr, he accepted a new challenge at <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_F.C._38a9.html" title="Aberdeen F.C.">Aberdeen</a> where he guided them to a League Cup final success over <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_F.C._6309.html" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a> and second place in the Premier Division.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally_MacLeod_3c0b.html" title="Edit section: International management">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">International management</span></h2>
<p>After such success with Ayr and Aberdeen, in May 1977 the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Football_Association_46e9.html" title="Scottish Football Association">Scottish Football Association</a> appointed him manager of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_national_football_team.html" title="Scotland national football team">Scotland national football team</a>. He introduced himself to the squad with the blunt statement: "My name is Ally MacLeod and I am a winner." In his first year in charge, he ensured qualification for the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1978_425c.html" title="Football World Cup 1978">1978 World Cup</a> in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> from a group containing <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales_national_football_team.html" title="Wales national football team">Wales</a> and the then European champions, <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia_national_football_team.html" title="Czechoslovakia national football team">Czechoslovakia</a>.</p>
<p>Scotland's World Cup campaign started on a high, with MacLeod declaring to the world that he would be back with "at least a medal", to a background of fans singing "We're on the march with Ally's Army". Scottish comedian <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Cameron_7c29.html" title="Andy Cameron">Andy Cameron</a> recorded a version of this chant as a single, <i>Ally's Tartan Army</i>, which reached Number 6 on the UK charts just before the World Cup.</p>
<p>Qualification was particularly sweet for Scotland since, for the second World Cup in succession, Scotland had achieved what their traditional rivals <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> had not. Defeat against England (who had fallen to MacLeod's team the previous year) in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Championship_55b6.html" title="British Home Championship">Home Championships</a> of 1978 was taken to mean little. Spirits remained sky-high as 25,000 people came to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Park_6ad8.html" title="Hampden Park">Hampden Park</a> to watch the squad circle the ground in an open-top bus prior to their departure for Argentina. <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Prestwick_International_Airport_e384.html" title="Glasgow Prestwick International Airport">Prestwick Airport</a> was packed with supporters seeing the team off.</p>
<p>There had been some murmurs of discontent concerning MacLeod's selections, and some observers were worried by the absence through injury of full-back <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_McGrain_a9cf.html" title="Danny McGrain">Danny McGrain</a>, but <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru_national_football_team.html" title="Peru national football team">Peru</a> were not expected to provide many problems in the first match. Peru, however, won the game 3-1. Scotland took the lead but <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Masson_73ce.html" title="Don Masson">Don Masson</a> missed a penalty and in general failed to play to their potential. As MacLeod himself put it, the performance was "rank bad".</p>
<p>Plentiful excuses emerged: there had been a dispute concerning bonuses, the hotel swimming pool had no water in it, there was nothing for the players to do. It was then revealed that the winger <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Johnston_9e9c.html" title="Willie Johnston">Willie Johnston</a> had taken a cold tablet which contained a banned substance, <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fencamfamin.html" title="Fencamfamin">fencamfamin</a>. He was sent home.</p>
<p>MacLeod, at a press conference, saw a mongrel dog approach: "I think he is the only friend I have got left", he said, stretching out a hand.</p>
<p>The game with <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_national_football_team.html" title="Iran national football team">Iran</a> finished a 1-1 draw, after an even worse display by the Scots. They then needed to beat <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands_national_football_team.html" title="Netherlands national football team">the Netherlands</a>, one of the tournament favourites, by three clear goals, to qualify.</p>
<p>MacLeod gave <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graeme_Souness_ee28.html" title="Graeme Souness">Graeme Souness</a> his first game of the World Cup and was rewarded with a much-improved team performance. When <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Gemmill_d243.html" title="Archie Gemmill">Archie Gemmill</a> scored what is widely thought to be one of the greatest World Cup goals ever (it was officially ranked seventh best by <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>), to make the score 3-1 to Scotland, qualification to the next phase at last looked possible. Three minutes later, though, the Dutch pulled a goal back, the game ended 3-2 and Scotland were eliminated on <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goal_difference.html" title="Goal difference">goal difference</a>. The Netherlands proceeded to the final, where they lost to <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_national_football_team.html" title="Argentina national football team">Argentina</a>.</p>
<p>MacLeod survived an immediate inquest by the sport's authorities but resigned after one more game in charge, only 17 matches and about 500 days after his appointment.</p>
<p>The Scottish Football Association's annual report, issued in May 1979, stated that, "regardless of the depressing aspects of Mr MacLeod's latter days in the Association's employ, it would be quite unfair not to comment that he was largely responsible for kindling an enthusiasm for the Scottish team that far exceeded anything which had gone before. The Association benefited considerably from that enthusiasm and should not forget it".</p>
<p>In his autobiography, <i>The Ally MacLeod Story</i> (1979), he wondered whether he had "generated just too much excitement. Had I raised the level of national optimism just too high?" But he was able to console himself - "Would the Scottish fans have tolerated anything less from me than whole-hearted conviction?" MacLeod also reassured the reader that he, for one, never thought that Scotland were invincible, and claimed to be perfectly at peace with himself. "I am a very good manager who just happened to have a few disastrous days, once upon a time, in Argentina."</p>

<p>His subsequent managerial career, which included spells at <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motherwell_F.C._3210.html" title="Motherwell F.C.">Motherwell</a> (1979 - 1981), <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrieonians_F.C._ff72.html" title="Airdrieonians F.C.">Airdrie</a> (1984-1985), a return to Ayr (1986-1989) and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_the_South_F.C._1603.html" title="Queen of the South F.C.">Queen of the South</a>, continued into the 1990s (in 1992 he played one game for Queens' reserve team, scoring a goal from a penalty at the age of 61), and he came to be treated with sardonic affection by the Scottish footballing public, but he was never likely to be remembered for anything but Argentina, when the whole of Scotland was on the march with "Ally's Army".</p>
<p>In July 2003, at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Park_6ad8.html" title="Hampden Park">Hampden Park</a>, he was presented with a crystal decanter in appreciation of his services to the national team and to Scottish football.</p>
