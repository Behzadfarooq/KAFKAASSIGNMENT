<p>I don't understand this newly created section. Parts of it are literally incoherent. Also, the quote isn't sourced. The first sentence is of course from Genesis; but it's unclear where the rest of it comes from. Also, phrases like "has often been debated" and "other scholars" are weaselly. Who are these people? I'm thinking about erasing this section altogether for these reasons. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 19:59, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, I see. The quote is from the newly added internet source. But it still seems to me extremely odd that the only religious view cited should be from <i>one</i> exponent of <i>one</i> religion. If we're going to have this section at all, it needs to be much more complete and balanced; otherwise it affirmatively <i>detracts</i> from the article. Or so it seems to me. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 20:01, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All biblical/religious quotes must be sourced. There are far too many versions of far too many books to leave floating quote. I do think this section is important, because the statement itself is religious. The founders appealed to a doctrine of natural rights, which itself eminates from their religious beliefs, and the section should not be removed.</p>
<p>Of course, we need support for <i>those</i> assertions (i.e., the assertions that the founders appealed to natural rights, <i>and</i> that natural rights emanate from religious beliefs) too. I still maintain that it's not enough—it is unbalanced and looks very odd and indeed amateurish—to include in a "religious views" section only the views of a few rabbis. I am afraid that I feel obliged to delete the section, unless someone is willing immediately to expand it, with proper sourcing.

<p>I feel that this sentence is editorializing: "<i>Indeed, at the time of the Declaration, "men" was understood to mean "white males" instead of "human beings"</i>". For one thing, it seems to imply that the definition of "men" was different, which is ridiculous. It is basically a comment about who could vote at the time. The statement in the DoI is philosophical, not a statement of law or voting rights. I'm removing it. --<b><a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/w/1/User_talk%7EJW1805_b255.html" title="User talk:JW1805">(Talk)</a></small> 17:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear user, you said "For one thing, it seems to imply that the definition of 'men' was different, which is ridiculous". I agree this sounds ridiculous to us now, but it is a historical fact that by referring to "men" in DoI, its great author meant "white males". This is not to say that the statement was not philosophical in nature, or that it was not advanced for its time. But it did has its drawbacks and they should not stay hidden just because the DoI is one of the proud cornerstones of US history. I nevertheless respect the fact that my sentence is considered editorializing and would not add it again, unless I get a positive feedback.

<p>How do you know what was in Jefferson's mind when he wrote "men"? I understand what you are trying to say: that the state of the laws at the time didn't match up with what Jefferson wrote. But the definition of "men" was not different them from now. --<b><a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/w/1/User_talk%7EJW1805_b255.html" title="User talk:JW1805">(Talk)</a></small> 19:12, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We don't know that was in Jefferson's mind when he wrote it; but that's not what the sentence claims. The sentence claims that, contextually, at the time of the Declaration, "men" was usually understood that way. Jefferson's not adding a phrase redefining the term any other way, indicates, but does not prove, that he might have agreed with that then-common meaning. – Adhemar 08:48, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I consider the immigration reformation debate, I wonder if "America" believes this credo anymore. I think it was something like 13 total citations/fines were given to American firms in 2004 by the government for employing illegal immigrants, campared to the hundred or thounsands given each year in the late 80s and early 90s. Firms have certainly not stopped employing illegal immigrants. And of course these illegal aliens are exploited and given what American's would term a less than fair wage. Many will point out that because they are illegal they are not endowed with the same rights as legal residents and citizens are given. This is true, but does not give firms a right to exploit and use those people in such a manner. --129.82.187.214 19:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All people are created equal → All men are created equal. As per Liamdaly - Jefferson's phrase reads "all men," and gets <a href="http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=%22all+men+are+created+equal%22&amp;word2=%22all+people+are+created+equal%22" class="external text" title="http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=%22all+men+are+created+equal%22&amp;word2=%22all+people+are+created+equal%22" rel="nofollow">20 times as many Google hits as "all people."</a> Articles about specific phrases should be titled exactly with that phrase. It's certainly valid to discuss modern reformulations and gender concerns in the article itself, but the article should be where people expect to find it.</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b> It doesn't matter how many google hits it gets. Nor does it matter what Jefferson used. Jefferson was from a time way in the past when the views were quite different. Jefferson doesn't own the phrase and shouldn't determine where the article is. It should be at the neutral term, and that is "all people are created equal". Neutral terms are preferred in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/o/o/User%7EVoortle_783b.html" title="User:Voortle">Voortle</a> 13:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Google hits do matter, because people are going to search for "All men..." not "All people..." Also, given that the article introduces the phrase as a line from Jefferson, what he actually said is an entirely relevant fact and does give him some degree of "ownership." Wikipedia does prefer neutral terms, except when they interfere with the reality of what was said. The logical conclusion of what you are saying would be absurdity -- should we go through every quote from a different cultural context and rephrase it to what we would prefer today? Of course not, because then they would cease to be quotes and whatever credibility Wikipedia has would be destroyed if we felt justified in changing the past because it does not live up to the ideals of today. <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamdaly620_a833.html" title="User:Liamdaly620">Liamdaly620</a> 14:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
