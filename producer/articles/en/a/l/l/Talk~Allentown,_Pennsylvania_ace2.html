<p>The historical summary on Allentown and its founder has several inaccuracies: - The land Allen purchased hardly qualifies as an "estate" since the area was almost entirely wilderness and Allen had no intention of settling here. It should be mentioned that the land was acquired from the Penns, because it shows the historical roots of the land, its ties to the most influential family of the period. - Trout Hall was not built on the site of Allen's hunting lodge (also named Trout Hall). The lodge's site is believed to have been several blocks to the north. - The house (not a building) is not the city's oldest structure; Hunter's Cabin, built in the early 1740's in what is now Lehigh Parkway, qualifies for that distinction. I believe that pointing out Trout Hall's current use (home of the Historical Society) reflects the property's significance as well as the fact that the structure is still standing. - It is highly doubtful the city's proximity to New York City had anything to do with Allen's motivation since 90 miles was a considerable distance in those days and New York was far removed as a sphere of influence in eastern Pennsylvania. - One more quibble: Allen is often described in local histories as a "merchant," but that term is now limited to retailing so its use here is archaic; at any rate, it hardly does justice to the fact that Allen owned one of the largest, most successful shipping businesses in Colonial America.

<p>After a quick glance at a Google map of Allentown, it sure looks like the city is pretty well gridded to me! Sure, not every major road follows a grid once outside the central city, but very few cities of this size will be built entirely to any one rigid grid system.</p>
<p>Now if this was being written about downtown Boston...<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillsboro_b617.html" title="User:Hillsboro">Hillsboro</a> 21:24, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have to agree -- much of the content of the "Roads" section isn't particularly well-written, or even relevant. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 16:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Technically, US 22 actually doesn't "run" through any part of the city. All of US 22 is located just north of the City of Allentown. In the Allentown area, it runs through the following townships (heading west to east): Upper Macungie, South Whitehall, Whitehall, and Hanover (all in Lehigh County). I-78 is the only real highway that actually is on city land, and it runs through only an extremely small part of south Allentown. Made necessary changes in the article.</p>
<p>In the interest of consolidation, I'm going to fold HIGHWAYS and ROADS into one entry. I'm also going to remove much of the content of the "Roads" section mentioned previously... <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 10:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Dorney Park should be removed from the introduction, as it is located in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Whitehall_Township%2C_Pennsylvania_92e2.html" title="South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania">South Whitehall Township</a>, and has a <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorneyville%2C_Pennsylvania_e747.html" title="Dorneyville, Pennsylvania">Dorneyville</a> address, not Allentown. Maybe it should be noted somewhere in the article that Dorney Park is close to Allentown, but the introduction should be reserved for information pertinent to the city itself.</p>

<p>There were a number of edits I made to clean up the writing style somewhat. However, I made a number of deletions based on information that is NOT a part of Allentown. Eagles camp is in Bethlehem...why is that listed under Allentown? It shouldn't be. Had this been an article about the Lehigh Valley, I would agree. I also deleted the other sports team that is played in Stabler Arena. Again, this is in Bethlehem, not in Allentown.</p>
<p>I also removed the multiple airports reference. Of course this entry should mention Lehigh Valley International Airport. But then mentioning Newark, Philly, JFK, and LaGuardia...why? If you want to name airports, why not also include the airport in Harrisburg? Or Reading? They're both certainly closer to Allentown than JFK and LaGuardia. Where do you stop?</p>
<p>I went to school in Allentown, and it will always have a place in my heart, but this article should be about Allentown, not the surrounding Lehigh Valley. Asc85 00:26, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the idea was to basically write the article so that, if you were visiting Allentown, or wanted to know information about the city, it would be in there, including some sports and travel information. The idea of the airports is that they are larger ones that would be more commonly used for direct travel in Allentown if one were not using LVIA, as many don't. Like many mid-sized cities, a lot of these things aren't located in the city itself, as, come to think of it, LVIA isn't. Anyway, it's a judgment call. <a href="../../../p/a/w/User%7EPAWiki_d7f5.html" title="User:PAWiki">PAWiki</a> 10:04, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We're getting a bit lengthy (30k+ in size), and the article is getting unwieldy. I'd like to propose that we start a PEOPLE &amp; CULTURE subhead, and break-off NOTABLE RESIDENTS (which appears to already dupe a pre-existing page linked from the bottom of the Allentown article), POPULAR CULTURE, MEDIA, LANDMARKS and MUSEUMS into their own individual pages. I'd recommend taking a look at other cities (notably <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>) for an example as to how I propose handling. Since this is a fairly major edit, I figure I'd throw it out for group discussion before undertaking. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 12:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This page keeps getting longer and longer, and seems to be including more and more information that is better suited for <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehigh_Valley%2C_Pennsylvania_b36e.html" title="Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania">Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania</a> than here. Allentown is Allentown. Bethlehem is Bethlehem. If you believe it's a "region" thing, I'd recommend it goes into Lehigh Valley rather than Allentown. Sorry, PAWiki, but things like STABLER ARENA = Bethlehem. EAGLES TRAINING CAMP = Bethlehem. BEAR CREEK = Macungie. Allentown should be about Allentown, and we shouldn't poach things that belong to other cities/towns...if we do, put it in Lehigh Valley, since it probably impacts the entire region, not just Allentown proper... Just my two cents... <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 12:43, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, I killed the Lehigh Valley ballpark image. There is no way these conceptual images are not copyrighted, most likely by the architects who designed the facility.

This history is inextricably tied to the type of city Allentown has become. The current entry merely discusses current corporations based in Allentown (which I think should be broken-off into another page and expanded), not the history of industry in the city.</p>
<p>&gt;HISTORY: Still a little weak. There's more to Allentown's history than Trout Hall, the hiding of the Liberty Bell and beer.</p>
<p>&gt;FROM SCRATCH: How about CLIMATE? GOVERNMENT? SUBURBS?</p>
<p>&gt;CITATIONS: Lastly, if we really want to make this entry more solid, we need citations. As of this date, there are none associated with this article.</p>
<p>&gt;PHOTOGRAPHS: Can someone local get some good pictures for the article? Perhaps one of the PPL Building lit up at night, the Allentown Band playing at the bandshell in West Park, or something that is indicative of Allentown's image and personality?</p>
<p>That's it for now. Appreciate everyone's input and assistance in making this a great article! <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 12:12, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I need some assistance in trying to get the high school affiliations for all of the notable people on this page, since I think this would represent good and important additions to their articles. Some already have them listed, but others don't. If their Allentown-area high school is not listed, I did post a request for that information on the respective discussion page. Anyway, if anyone knows any of the high school affiliations for the notable Allentown people who do not have a high school listed, please post that information here so I can go about adding it to the respective page and also the article on the high school (if a page on the respective person's high school exists).

<p>It is undeniably warranted, and I don't think anyone but you has expressed reservation about it. At $34 million, architecturally alone it warrants inclusion. And its construction and the arrival of a AAA-level team makes it the largest sporting event in Allentown. Why is this so under your skin, by the way? I've edited wikipedia for years and never seen something so small consume someone. Just curious as to your angle and why you spend even a second thinking about it. <a href="../../../p/a/w/User%7EPAWiki_d7f5.html" title="User:PAWiki">PAWiki</a> 22:40, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Trying to be civil here, but suffice to say, I very much disagree with PAWiki continuing to list the Eagles and LVO in this entry. Very briefly, my position is that it is appropriate to list this under "Bethlehem" but not Allentown.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I was wondering if we could have a "vote" on this issue? Today is October 2...why don't we give it a week until October 9? See if anyone else besides PAWiki and myself have an opinion on this one? I'm certainly willing to abide by whatever the majority thinks if PAWiki will. As a sign of "good faith," I have not removed the reference on this article. Asc85 15:18, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My comments, copied from above. "This page keeps getting longer and longer, and seems to be including more and more information that is better suited for <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehigh_Valley%2C_Pennsylvania_b36e.html" title="Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania">Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania</a> than here. Allentown is Allentown. Bethlehem is Bethlehem. If you believe it's a "region" thing, I'd recommend it goes into Lehigh Valley rather than Allentown. Sorry, PAWiki, but things like STABLER ARENA = Bethlehem. EAGLES TRAINING CAMP = Bethlehem. BEAR CREEK = Macungie. Allentown should be about Allentown, and we shouldn't poach things that belong to other cities/towns...if we do, put it in Lehigh Valley, since it probably impacts the entire region, not just Allentown proper... Just my two cents... "<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 12:43, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My view was that it's a big part of Allentown athletics and certainly important to many Allentonians. If there wasn't a Lehigh Valley article, I guess I'd feel more passionate about it.

In the 1960s, when the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_78.html" title="Interstate 78">Interstate 78</a> freeway was constructed, it replaced the current freeway that today is U.S. Route 22 and once was known as Interstate 78. U.S. Route 22 used to run through northern Allentown as Tilghman Street and then became Union Boulevard, from which it goes into <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem%2C_Pennsylvania_d331.html" title="Bethlehem, Pennsylvania">Bethlehem</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easton%2C_Pennsylvania_f6e2.html" title="Easton, Pennsylvania">Easton</a>.</p>

<p>Tilghman Street starts at Pennsylvania Route 100, where it continues as Main Street then Old Route 22. The speed limit on the street is 45 MPH. Tilghman Street divides into a mini <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway.html" title="Freeway">freeway</a> when meeting U.S. Route 22. West-bound Tilghmam Street is used only for U.S. Route 22 West. The east bound of Tilghamn Street uses U.S. Route 22 EAST. The same thing for ramps coming off Route 22. Then, Tilghman Steet turns local and there's an enterance to the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Turnpike_370d.html" title="Pennsylvania Turnpike">Pennsylvania Turnpike</a> at <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_476.html" title="Interstate 476">Interstate 476</a>.</p>
<p>From there, it crosses above the Pennsylvania Turnpike and then intersects with <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Route_309_2200.html" title="Pennsylvania Route 309">Pennsylvania Route 309</a>. One mile east of that interesection, there's an intersection with <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedar_Crest_Boulevard_%28Lehigh_County%2C_Pennsylvania%29_62ff.html" title="Cedar Crest Boulevard (Lehigh County, Pennsylvania)">Cedar Crest Boulevard</a>. Then, Tilghman Street enters Allentown, where it crosses more than 30 streets in the city.</p>
<p>Tilghman Street is a fast route in Allentown, where the traffic lights give cars on Tilghman Street substantially more time to cross. Where Tilghman Street reaches the more populated part of the city, it interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 145, forming Alllentown's 6th and 7th Streets. Then it crosses the first of two bridges where Jordan Creek and American Parkway run below. From there, it reaches Front Street where it crosses the second brige and becomes Union Boulevard. You can still find Tilghman Street in East Allentown but not connected to this fast route.</p>

I also added a handful of professional baseball players born in Allentown to "Notable residents" -- four didn't have Wiki pages, but the links posted should give more than enough information if someone has the time and inclination. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 16:20, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article could really use some actual current photographs of Allentown, as opposed to the interesting but not especially informative art and historical postcards that are there now. --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 04:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, and mentioned above in "Sections for Development." The postcards, since in the public domain, are there to fill the void until someone comes up with something better. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphageekpa_6fa1.html" title="User:Alphageekpa">Alphageekpa</a> 23:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I definitely agree that actual photos (probably could use three or so) would be a great addition. <a href="../../../p/a/w/User%7EPAWiki_d7f5.html" title="User:PAWiki">PAWiki</a> 02:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I've went ahead and added a template. Wikiprojects Pennsylvania will work on, or I myself will personally work on it.<a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E1312020Wikicop_5d86.html" title="User:1312020Wikicop">1312020Wikicop</a> 01:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
