<p>In the original Star Wars, Obi-Wan refers to Vader several times in such a way that it sounds like "Darth" is merely his first name. The expanded universe doesn't give Sith the name "Darth" until after Episode I establishes that "Darth" is a Sith title, and that Sith typically (but not always, see <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Maul_eb17.html" title="Darth Maul">Darth Maul</a>) have a "Sith name." It might be useful to add something about this issue to the page. I don't think this is original research because I've seen fans discussion this on various forums and perhaps a website or two. It's more of an issue with the expanded universe and the prequels conflicting each other, but you could make a case for ANH as well ("You can't win Darth.") <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.53.95.31 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.53.95.31.html" title="User talk:68.53.95.31">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.53.95.31_a6f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.53.95.31">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I don't see an issue here. There are plenty of times where people are addressed by their titles alone, both in real life and in fiction (real world: "Mr. President" for the US President; fiction: watch just about any episode of Star Trek and notice how many times people are addressed by just "captain" or "commander"). There are numerous times in Star Wars itself where people are addressed just by their title. "Darth" is no difference. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 18:15, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Fine, but Obi-Wan is the only person to call Vader "Darth" as a proper name. Everybody else, even his enemies call him "Vader" "Lord Vader" Or "Darth Vader." Nobody calls Maul, Dooku or Sideous "Darth." That's why it stands out. When the original trilogy was created we had no reason to assume that "Darth" was anything but his name (even if by ROTJ it was his "new name" after he abandoned the name "Anakin Skywalker." This business about granting every Sith a new name with "Darth" as a title is something cooked up in the prequels. See "Lord Maul" and "Lord Tyrannus" and "Lord Sideous," etc. The expanded universe assumed that "Darth" was a title unique to Vader until the prequels came around (the TPM novelisation established "Darth Bane" as the first one to use the title 1,000 years prior to TPM and the one who started the "rule of two" something else the EU had never heard of before), hence you have "Sith" like Freedon Nad, Exar Kun, etc. Then all of a sudden you get supposedly ancient Sith like Darth Revan, Darth Malak, etc. The term "Sith" is never mentioned in the original trilogy (though the novelisations mention Vader as the Dark Lord of the Sith, as if he's the only one. The early scripts postulate a "Dark Knights of the Sith" order rival to the Jedi that are numerous (not just one or two guys). The Star Wars novel has no idea that Palpatine has force powers, that was something introduced in ESB. Anyway, sorry for the trivia, but I thought I'd throw that in there since it wouldn't belong in the article.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I gathered this list from elsewhere on the 'net. It is about inconsistencies between the two trilogies, without taking the Expanded Universe or explanations outside the movies into account (that is, somebody watches Episodes IV-VI then watches I-III and notices them). Bear with me, it's long, but might help people writing this article (and please don't shoot the messenger!):</li>
</ul>
<p>"- Obi-Wan serving Bail Organa in the Clone Wars (ANH)</p>
<p>- Clone WarS, plural (ANH)</p>
<p>- Age of the Republic - "for Over a Thousand Generations" (ANH) vs. "Which has stood for a thousand years" (AOTC)</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan Kenobi's master (ESB)</p>
<p>- Anakin wanting Luke to have his lightsaber when he was old enough but Owen wouldn't allow it (ANH)</p>
<p>- Apparent ages of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Owen &amp; Beru Lars; Anakin (ANH; ROTJ)</p>
<p>- Design of the Tantive IV and Death Star (ANH)</p>
<p>- Leia remembers the mother who died thirty seconds after she was born - and Luke does not. (RotJ)</p>
<p>- Owen Lars doesn't recognise C-3P0 at all. (ANH)</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan claims not to have heard his real name since before Luke was born. (ANH)</p>
<p>- Anakin being 'a great pilot' when Obi-Wan first met him (and no, there is absolutely no way you're going to convince me that 'pod-racer' is the same thing as 'pilot'). (RotJ)</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan's claim that "When I first knew him... I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him." (RotJ) Actually, he hadn't even met Anakin when he did the 'Midichlorian test'. (TPM)</p>
<p>- Vader tells Luke that "Obi-Wan once thought as you do" (i.e. that he could be redeemed), but there's absolutely no evidence of that in RotS. (RotJ)</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan's claim that Owen "didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved". (ANH) But Owen barely knew Anakin and never said anything of the sort. (AotC)</p>
<p>- The entire concept of Midichlorians, which was never mentioned - or even hinted at - in the entire OT. (Yes, introducing important plot elements only to completely forget about them later on DOES count as an inconsistency.)</p>
<p>- Ditto the prophecy of a Chosen One who'll bring Balance to the Force.</p>
<p>- Ditto the idea of the Force being 'out of balance' in the first place. In fact, Yoda states quite clearly in ESB that the dark side is not stronger.</p>
<p>- If the Empire has camo-colored armor for their troopers (since the Republic becomes the Empire), why didn't they use them on Endor?</p>
<p>- If the Republic stormtroopers can "see through" dust clouds and shoot accurately, as they appear to demonstrate in AOTC, why do they lose this ability under the Empire? (see R2D2's "smoke screen" on Bespin in ESB)?</p>
<p>- Speed of movement, flipping ability, etc. of even "elder Jedi" (and Sith) in the Republic era, vs. relatively sluggish, slowed down movement and grounded nature of fighting in the post-Republic era.</p>
<p>- Why didn't Yoda teach Luke or at least warn him about the Emperor's force lightning? (forget the novel, we never saw him even attempt to block it onscreen)</p>
<p>- More on the Death Star: Why did the first Death Star take so long to build, vs. the much shorter time for the second Death Star which was supposed to be larger and more powerful?</p>
<p>- Plot hole: Why does Owen Lars try to "hold Luke back" and exhibit anger and resentment towards Obi-Wan. We only get hints of what's going on in ANH (he's "afraid" that Luke is too much like his father), does he know about Anakin being Vader? Is it all an act? Obi-Wan makes it sound like he is in great tension with Owen, but this is never truly explained.</p>
<p>- Why did they think it was a good idea to "hide" Luke with his family on Tatooine, in the very house that Anakin had visited, on his home planet, and keep the surname of Skywalker? And Obi-Wan only changed his first name and hid close by, in his Jedi uniform?</p>
<p>- Plot hole: Did R2D2 have his memory erased? Did Obi-Wan? We only know Threepio did, because he doesn't remember anything before Captain Antilles on the Tantive IV.</p>
<p>- Han Solo doesn't believe in the Force, despite being so well traveled. Okay, he would have been a little kid at the end of the Clone War at best, but he's best buddies with Chewbacca, who fought in the war, AND was close personal friends with one of the top Jedi, Yoda. Did Han just blow off Chewie's war stories about fighting alongside the Jedi and how those guys got a raw deal from the Empire?</p>
<p>- Does Jabba remember the name Skywalker? After all, Anakin was supposedly the first and only human to win the Boonta Eve pod Race. Then again, he appears to have slept through the ending ceremony in TPM, but still, as the sponsor or person in charge, he should have known something about it. If any connection was made in his mind, he never let it show in the movie.</p>
<p>- Why doesn't Palpatine use a lightsaber in the classic trilogy? Considering how useless his guards are, it wouldn't seem very logical to go unarmed as the Emperor.</p>
<p>- Plot hole (or rather a loose end): how did the mysterious cave become "a domain of evil" on Dagobah? This is never explained.</p>
<p>- How did Anakin figure out how to appear as a ghost at the end of ROTJ, and why did he appear as a young man, instead of how he appeared at death, as Obi-Wan and Yoda did? Why didn't Qui Gon also appear, since he was supposed to be the one who started this whole "retaining your identity after death" thing?</p>
<p>- Loose end: "Sith Eyes" (yellowish pupils, surrounded by red) are never explained. Palpatine always has them as soon as he turns into prune face. Maul always has them, Dooku never does, Anakin only has them at two points (when he's murdering the Seperatist leaders and when he's burning up on Mustafar). What do they mean, if anything?</p>
<p>- R2's rocket boosters. Never seen in the OT.</p>
<p>- If they're supposed to be in hiding, and esp. hiding the fact that hes a Jedi, why does senile Obi whip out the lightsabre in the cantina?</p>
<p>- Obi-wan conveniently forgot about Leia when he says ‘that boy was our last hope.’</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan says that Darth Vader was "a pupil of mine until he turned to evil." Anakin stopped being Obi-Wan's pupil and was a full Jedi before he turned to evil. He does call Obi-Wan "my master." But Obi-Wan tells him (also in RotS) that he's a far better Jedi than he could ever hope to be. Vader says in ANH that when he left Ben he was "But the learner" when in fact they were more like equals or partners and friends as portrayed in ROTS (or "brothers" as Obi-Wan puts it). Originally it implied Obi-Wan was still training him or else he was much superior.</p>
<p>- Why hasn't Chewbacca heard of General Kenobi? Granted it was a big war, but with so few Jedi in the Clone War, surely he should have at least heard about him from Yoda (for all we know the only time he actually saw Obi-Wan was as a hologram during those war briefing scenes on Kashyyyk). Yet he lets Han mock him as an "old fossil" in ANH. Then again, the one time the two "talk" is when they are in the Cantina, and he introduces him to Han Solo. This might not be an inconsistency. Still, if he knows who Obi-Wan really is, you'd think he'd stick up for him, rather than treat him like any two-bit customer.</p>
<p>- What happened to the graves outside the Lars homestead? There wasn't just one for Shmi, but a few others. And since Clieg is gone by the time of ANH, we assume he must have died and been buried as well. Even if he died someplace else, they would presumably have erected a grave marker in the "family plot." If the graves were destroyed by a sandstorm or Tusken raid or something, wouldn't they just rebuild them?</p>
<p>- Yoda's hypocrisy. I could buy it if these are just the lofty ideals of the Jedi that are often broken, but since it's Yoda himself that does it repeatedly in the prequels, I'm going to call it an inconsistency, "a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, NEVER for attack." Realistic explanation (compare to lots of modern politics and military ethics vs. reality), but still. We assumed that the Jedi were defensive fighters, who didn't "cheat" by using the Force to attack their opponents like Vader and the Emperor did, and Luke using the Force to attack was him getting dangerously close to the Dark Side (as if the subtle hints of the black clothing, mechanical hand and anger during combat weren't enough). In the Prequels we learn this is no big deal and all the Jedi do it, even Yoda.</p>
<p>- You'll laugh, 'cause this one is a bit of a stretch, but... Hairbuns! Yes, it might just be a really common hairstyle among women of the Republic/Empire, and we see so few women, but still. Anakin is looking at his (unrecognized) daughter, with the same hairstyle worn a few times by his beloved deceased wife. Doesn't ring a bell? Right, his artificial vision and his hatred and clouded vision prevent him from recognizing her. Still.</p>
<p>- Luke does not know anything about his father, however at some point he should have heard of Anakin Skywalker the only human ever to compete (and win) in a Pod Race.</p>
<p>- The Sith rule of two, never suggested in the OT, and both Vader and Palpy had plans for Luke to "Join Them" (even if it was a hypocritical plan by them)</p>
<p>- The Subtle attempts by Lucas to show that Vader's kids were to be used later against him and the Dark Side (as part of a plan by Yoda and Kenoby), however the events in ANH seem completely random since Kenoby asked Luke to learn about the Force because some droid knocked on Luke's door.</p>
<p>- Anakin at 9 already deal with the Force, even if he was unware, was capable of using it. His son, at 18/19 only started dealing with the Force after some lessons from Kenoby. (of course we don't know the Midiclorian count of Luke, not even Lucas)</p>
<p>- Luke was too old too train at 20 (or something) Since Jedi's start training at 4 (or less) 20 something seems more than too old to train, even Anakin at 9 was "too old."</p>
<p>- Why is Leia a Princess when Bail Organa was never described as anything more than a Senator? This is never explained in the movies.</p>
<p>- Obiwan; "You're father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He was affraid you'd follow obiwan on some damn fool adventure like you father did." hmmm... sounds like Owen knew Anikan before obiwan did. It rather imples that, aside from the already established lighsabre having issue that; a. owen had in some way be a witness to 'obiwan luiring anakin away on some adventure' like gandalf in the hobbit. b. at some point owen and obiwan sat down and talked about Luke scoring his fathers weapon when he was of age, and owen took the view that it would encourage him to get dragged away from his duties to his family to go out and about with obi, JUST LIKE HIS FATHER WOULD. even though they only met once, briefly. c. that luke wasn't really old enough to be carrying a lightsabre before... even though we now 'know' that lightsabres are recomended for ages 4 up.</p>
<p>- "And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople, only Imperial Stormtroopers are so presice." Obi-Wan in ANH. And this isn't the inconsistency you all think it is (that Stormtroopers are lousy shots in the classic trilogy), rather that we see DANGED ACCURATE Sandpeople in TPM, nailing passing pod racers with their rifles! Compare shooting speed pods vs. shooting the tank treads of some big lumbering Sandcrawler. Which shows more shooting prowess? Explain this away with ignorance or the falling standards of Sandperson marksmanship, but I think it stands out as an inconsistency.</p>
<p>- Threepio's head is blown off by Imperial Stormtroopers (or it could have been Boba Fett, that sounds more like his voice, but then then he says "Stormtroopers, here?" when he's revived, in any case...) on Bespin in ESB and his head immediately "goes dead" until it's re-activated by Chewbacca later on. In AOTC his head is knocked off by some machines in the Geonosis factory and continues to be aware as he's bolted onto a battledroid body. Later on his head is torn off and dragged around by R2D2 and then welded back on his own body again. Throughout he remained aware, his eyes stayed lit up and he continued to talk as if there was no interruption in function. Likewise his body without his head wandered about with no problems. And before somebody argues that being blown apart by blasters was much more violent, recall that his head didn't show anymore physical damage on it in ESB than it did in AOTC when knocked off.</p>
<p>- Not only do we not know how Obi-Wan and Luke stayed hidden, but how did Yoda stay hidden all those years in exile? And even with the deleted scene of Yoda arriving on Dagobah we aren't told what happened to that ship he used to take there or how he built that stone looking shelter (why wasn't the shelter made of metal if he made it from the craft as the EU suggests?) if he lives in a bog? Loose end: how did the cave become a "domain of evil"? It might have been better to leave this unexplained, then we could theorize he just got dropped off by someone. Edit: Okay, I'm retracting part of this one. Keep the Yoda's ship/shelter inconsistency, disregard the "stay hidden" one. In ROTJ Luke is able to hide his presence from the Emperor somehow ("I have felt him Master." "Strange that I have not."), which is reaffirmed in the prequels with Palpatine somehow hiding his presence from the Jedi who fail to detect him until late in ROTS (and Obi-Wan goes undetected by Vader until the Falcon lands in the Death Star hangar). Yoda's hiding on Dagobah is far less objectionable than Obi-Wan hiding on Tatooine, since at least we don't presume that Anakin knows his way around Dagobah like he knows his way around Tatooine (Obi-Wan lives "somewhere out beyond the Dune Sea" according to ANH, making him much more well hidden than Luke, who is living in the same house that Anakin visited in AOTC). If we disregard deleted scenes (they are DELETED after all), we can ignore this inconsistency. Somehow Yoda got to dagobah and remained undetected the same way Palpatine or Luke could. Being untrained perhaps Luke doesn't give off the same presence. But Vader and the Emperor should know that Tatooine is "a haven for those who don't wish to be found" (Qui Gon knew this, in TPM) and at least do some checking. Vader had reason enough to keep tabs on "his family" as well, since they're his only remaining link to his mother.</p>
<p>- What was Owen's real motivation for wanting to erase the droids' memories? Did he know what he had uncovered? In purchasing the droids did he recognize them or not? He seems reluctant to purchase them, anxious to erase their memories after hearing Luke mention Obi-Wan Kenobi, but leaves Luke to do the job the next day rather than seeing to it personally. These scenes are rather ambiguous now.</p>
<p>- Why are Stormtroopers suddenly different heights with different voices, and lose all color identification marks and extraneous details like binocular visors, skirts, etc. (not just the loss of camo). Not to mention all those ground vehicles they used to have which seemed much more useful and powerful than what they had in the classic trilogy (even if the new technology is superior, why do they not even have the equivalent of LAATs, those carryalls for AT-TE's, etc.)?</p>
<p>- Why doesn't the Empire use battledroids, droid fighters or other droid technology? (and only droids in non-combat roles like protocol and astromech droids) This is never explained (even if you consider Lama Su's statement that clones are superior to droids in being able to think creatively, that says nothing about the fact that you can make many times more droids much faster than you can raise clones, and you can make them much more loyal much easier than brainwashing conscripts, and so many other advantages... and we know his statement isn't true, because we've seen Threepio and R2D2 who seem incredibly clever), really. With the Seperatists defeated, the Empire would have access to all their technology, and yet they don't use it. And no, I don't consider hiring IG-88 as a bounty hunter a fix to the problem.</p>
<p>- And conversly, why doesn't the Rebel Alliance use droids for combat? They seem able to afford all kinds of other gear and equipment, and it's not as if they are above using astromech droids in their fighters and protocol droids on their larger ships.</p>
<p>- When first viewing a New Hope and the OT, it appeared that Obi-Wan wore robes to blend in with the locals of Tatoone. Good idea while in hiding. And Yoda lived in a swamp for years and only needed rags. Makes sense. But the prequels start with most Jedi wearing robes everywhere. Is this the Jedi Uniform? Why else where bulky robes and cloaks walking around the Jedi Temple or city life in Coruscant and even in the cockpit of their fighters. And if it is a Jedi uniform, why would Obi-Wan keep wearing it while in hiding and with Storm troopers about on Tatooine and the Death Star?</p>
<p>Possible- Why doesn't the Empire have/use "Ray Shields" (like in ROTS) to capture the Rebels on the Death Star? You could say ANH itself shows us that "they let us go" in order to find the Rebel base to wipe them all out, but before Vader's plan was put into action it would seem useful for them to use Ray Shields. Obi-Wan could have been captured this way (they're useful for capturing Jedi), although you could say Vader said "escape is not his plan, I must face him alone" and that's why they were not used. Those are the only real opportunities they had to use Ray Shields (assuming it's a technology only present on starships). The Trade Federation didn't use them to capture Qui Gon and Obi-Wan, so (within the prequel continuity) not all ships may have them or we could chalk it up to an internal inconsistency in the Prequel trilogy and not applicable (like the reason why Jedi never use "force speed" ever again after that one instance in TPM).</p>
<p>Possible- It's interesting in light of the prequels and also in Empire and Jedi with objects being thrown about using the force, that the force is not used once in this way in 'New Hope' by Obi-Wan. What better way to convince a farm boy to join him then to levitate something . Heck, it worked for Anakin to get a babe to marry him. Why no Force-Push or Force-throw to help out Luke in the Cantina, instead of attracting attention with a Jedi lightsaber. Why not flip the tracker beam control switch off from the Falcon instaed of sneaking around a stormtrooper and office filled Death Star? I guess the argument can be made that he didn't want to alert Vader by using the Force except that he was alerted any way and would of known it. In Jedi, Luke new he was "endangering the mission" by Vader sensing him. So Obi-Wan might as well of just thought -flipped the switch and waited, since he said his "distenty follows a different path". He knew he was about to encounter Darth.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAlleged_inconsistencies_in_Star_Wars_43be.html" title="Edit section: Answers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Answers</span></h3>
<p>A lot of those can be fairly easily answered.</p>
<p>"- Obi-Wan serving Bail Organa in the Clone Wars (ANH)</p>
<p>Obi-Wan didn't have enough time to mention about any of his relations to people in the Clone Wars. All he said was "you must go with me to Alderann". If they had gotten there, it would be doubtful that Obi-wan wouldn't mention it upon meeting Bail.</p>
<p>- Clone WarS, plural (ANH)</p>
<p>Easily explained. People tend to mistakenly, or perhaps by slip of the tongue, mention large wars in plurals when there was only one. Like if there was a single, giant conflict between Sudan and another country, for instance, the scope of the conflict makes it seem as if there were a thousand wars going on at once (consider the fact that there were tons of almost mini-wars going about in all the campaigns of the galaxy during the clone war). Hence some people tend to refer to it as the clone warS.</p>
<p>- Age of the Republic - "for Over a Thousand Generations" (ANH) vs. "Which has stood for a thousand years" (AOTC)</p>
<p>The length and past of the Republic is cloaked in mystery. There isn't a lot of information about what it was like 10000 years ago, where the republic (approximately) was formed, so people tend to underestimate or mis-pinpoint the date of the formation of the Jedi and Republic.</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan Kenobi's master (ESB)</p>
<p>Yoda, and by extention the rest of the coucil members, all help in the training of initiates. The jedi go to them for advice, and while each Padawan is paired with a specific master, many Jedi consider the council and perhaps all the Jedi Masters in the Order their "masters" as well.</p>
<p>- Anakin wanting Luke to have his lightsaber when he was old enough but Owen wouldn't allow it (ANH)</p>
<p>Anakin could have told Padme if that anything happened to him, give his lightsaber to one of his children, and Padme told Obi-Wan before she died (off-camera). More likely, Obi-wan fabricated it on the spot to help shield Luke from the fact that Vader was his father.</p>
<p>- Design of the Tantive IV and Death Star (ANH)</p>
<p>The Geonosians designed the CONCEPT of the death star, and later the Empire picked it up and worked on it. The Correllian Corvette, of which class the Tantive IV belongs to, was around for a long time before ANH - the Tantive IV was later refitted to it's updated design in ANH.</p>
<p>- Leia remembers the mother who died thirty seconds after she was born - and Luke does not. (RotJ)</p>
<p>Answered in the article. Leia is force-sensitive, just like Luke, and she could have formed a mental bond with her mother in the womb. She could have tapped into her senses and memories and found out what her mother looked like. Luke may have simply not developed this connection with Padme</p>
<p>- Owen Lars doesn't recognise C-3P0 at all. (ANH)or doesn't remember.</p>
<p>C-3P0 is a standard protocol droid design. There are thousands of droids that look exactly identical to him. And it's not like he bothered to learn the droid's designation, anyway.</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan claims not to have heard his real name since before Luke was born. (ANH)</p>
<p>"Ben" could have been a fabrication of his, to aid his hiding. Or it might have been his nickname at childhood (perhaps a sibling kept calling him it) before he was taken away to join the Jedi Order.</p>
<p>- Anakin being 'a great pilot' when Obi-Wan first met him (and no, there is absolutely no way you're going to convince me that 'pod-racer' is the same thing as 'pilot'). (RotJ)</p>
<p>I know, I know what you're gonna say, but pod-racing has a ton in similarity with piloting. And while it's not the same thing, a lot of the controls, dynamics, and reflexes you need are quite the same. However, this isn't it - Obi-Wan is saying this out of fondness. He wasn't really aware of his amazing piloting skills when he "first met him" - he became aware just about a couple of weeks later, when Anakin flew his fighter at the Battle of Naboo.</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan's claim that "When I first knew him... I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him." (RotJ) Actually, he hadn't even met Anakin when he did the 'Midichlorian test'. (TPM)</p>
<p>Again, fondness and exaggeration.</p>
<p>- Vader tells Luke that "Obi-Wan once thought as you do" (i.e. that he could be redeemed), but there's absolutely no evidence of that in RotS. (RotJ)</p>
<p>Look at the landing pad scene on Mustafar. Anakin knew from one look at Padme and Obi-Wan, behind his rage at being "betrayed", that they were really trying to convert him back to the light path, and hoping in their own minds to do so. He could sense it.</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan's claim that Owen "didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved". (ANH) But Owen barely knew Anakin and never said anything of the sort. (AotC)</p>
<p>Obi-Wan perhaps assumed this, or made it up - again, he was trying to present the Anakin Skywalker image to Luke, not the evil Darth Vader one, to shield him from the truth.</p>
<p>- The entire concept of Midichlorians, which was never mentioned - or even hinted at - in the entire OT. (Yes, introducing important plot elements only to completely forget about them later on DOES count as an inconsistency.)</p>
<p>Obi-Wan was barely with Luke before he was killed by Vader. He didn't have a chance to tell him about the complexities or cellular structure of the force. Yoda held a beleif that it didn't matter how many midi-chlorians someone had, that they could become just as strong as he was if they gave enough effort. Besides, telling him about it might have stunted his beleif in it and made his training slower. I mean, it kind of spoils the facination you have with it when you know exactly how it works, doesn't it?</p>
<p>- Ditto the prophecy of a Chosen One who'll bring Balance to the Force.</p>
<p>Again, not enough time to tell him about it, from neither Yoda (after Luke learned Vader was his father) or Obi-Wan (who was getting weaker and could return less and less as the series went on).</p>
<p>- Ditto the idea of the Force being 'out of balance' in the first place. In fact, Yoda states quite clearly in ESB that the dark side is not stronger.</p>
<p>Yoda is talking about the fixed, overall strength and potential of the light side in a single being compared to the dark side, not the total balance of light and dark power in the universe.</p>
<p>- If the Empire has camo-colored armor for their troopers (since the Republic becomes the Empire), why didn't they use them on Endor?</p>
<p>There's no point. Life-sign scanners make camo all but worthless, and there's no need to waste even a miniscule amount of money repainting armor to match the environment as technology can see right through it. The Rebels wear camo because they need every single advantage they can get, and often choose places where life-sign scanners are disrupted.</p>
<p>- If the Republic stormtroopers can "see through" dust clouds and shoot accurately, as they appear to demonstrate in AOTC, why do they lose this ability under the Empire? (see R2D2's "smoke screen" on Bespin in ESB)?</p>
<p>The stormtroopers at Bespin aren't crack troopers - they're ordinary human recruits, not the bred-for-war clones of the Republic. Besides, they could have shot through it if they had been given more than a couple of seconds to aim (all the characters reteated and were out of sight in about a second and a half. Can YOU squint through a smoke cloud or change your helmet optics to thermal vision, THEN aim that fast, especially if you're fairly new?</p>
<p>- Speed of movement, flipping ability, etc. of even "elder Jedi" (and Sith) in the Republic era, vs. relatively sluggish, slowed down movement and grounded nature of fighting in the post-Republic era.</p>
<p>Answered in the article. Look at the lightsaber combatants. A cyborg who's heavy armor slows him down, an old, brittle Jedi, and an inexperienced Jedi-in-training. Compare that to the young, experienced, and skilled Jedi in the prequels.</p>
<p>- Why didn't Yoda teach Luke or at least warn him about the Emperor's force lightning? (forget the novel, we never saw him even attempt to block it onscreen)</p>
<p>No time. Yoda was still training luke in the ways of the force, and had no time to teach him Force Absorption (which is the skill Yoda used to block Dooku's lightning). Luke threw his lightsaber across the room, and couldn't use that to block it either.</p>
<p>- More on the Death Star: Why did the first Death Star take so long to build, vs. the much shorter time for the second Death Star which was supposed to be larger and more powerful?</p>
<p>Delays, slave problems, and design troubles. The first death star was assembed by millions of Wookie slaves and various-species prisoners, who were constantly sabotaging it wherever they could. That, and they weren't even sure if the thing would work in the first place, and so had to pause construction while they built a prototype at the Maw.</p>
<p>- Plot hole: Why does Owen Lars try to "hold Luke back" and exhibit anger and resentment towards Obi-Wan. We only get hints of what's going on in ANH (he's "afraid" that Luke is too much like his father), does he know about Anakin being Vader? Is it all an act? Obi-Wan makes it sound like he is in great tension with Owen, but this is never truly explained.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Owen knows about Vader, and is scared that if Luke goes off planet and is trained, he'll fall to the dark side and become a monster just like Vader.</p>
<p>- Why did they think it was a good idea to "hide" Luke with his family on Tatooine, in the very house that Anakin had visited, on his home planet, and keep the surname of Skywalker? And Obi-Wan only changed his first name and hid close by, in his Jedi uniform?</p>
<p>Obi Wan lived in the desert miles away from civilization, and used force powers on whoever came near to make them go away. Moisture farmers are largely ignored and Tatooine is a backwater planet. Besides, Luke hadn't even been able to use the force yet and wasn't quite fully in tune with the force, making him extremely hard to detect. Houses change hands over the years, especially on Tatooine. The house isn't really even the same one anymore, and besides, Vader wouldn't waste his time, beleiving already that he probably killed his unborn twins in the womb.</p>
<p>- Plot hole: Did R2D2 have his memory erased? Did Obi-Wan? We only know Threepio did, because he doesn't remember anything before Captain Antilles on the Tantive IV.</p>
<p>3P0 did, R2 didn't. R2 knew very well what was going on, and we know that he must have never gotten his memory wiped because he developed a stubborn personality, which should never happen (he shouldn't develop a personality at all) unless the droid goes years without wiping.</p>
<p>- Han Solo doesn't believe in the Force, despite being so well traveled. Okay, he would have been a little kid at the end of the Clone War at best, but he's best buddies with Chewbacca, who fought in the war, AND was close personal friends with one of the top Jedi, Yoda. Did Han just blow off Chewie's war stories about fighting alongside the Jedi and how those guys got a raw deal from the Empire?</p>
<p>Probably. Besides, Chewie knew that Han wouldn't beleive it in the first place, and probably didn't mention the Jedi because of that.</p>
<p>- Does Jabba remember the name Skywalker? After all, Anakin was supposedly the first and only human to win the Boonta Eve pod Race. Then again, he appears to have slept through the ending ceremony in TPM, but still, as the sponsor or person in charge, he should have known something about it. If any connection was made in his mind, he never let it show in the movie.</p>
<p>If you're one of the most sucessful and profitable Hutts in the galaxy, do you spare a couple of moments to maybe think or investigate if a nine-year old boy who just happened to do something extraordinary, which you don't really care about as you hire smugglers to make cash and podracing was just a side-money-maker back then, has any relation to a human with the same last name who you just captured and are about to throw into a desert predator? If I were, I'd just throw him into Carkoon and get the hell back to making money.</p>
<p>- Why doesn't Palpatine use a lightsaber in the classic trilogy? Considering how useless his guards are, it wouldn't seem very logical to go unarmed as the Emperor.</p>
<p>Because he has one, perhaps several, but just never used it. Vader blocks the blow to his master and he decides to use Lightning to kill Luke. Besides, he has the force and is so strong with it that he can probably kill anybody who threatens him without having to get up from his throne.</p>
<p>- Plot hole (or rather a loose end): how did the mysterious cave become "a domain of evil" on Dagobah? This is never explained.</p>
<p>Explained in the article and in the Expanded Universe.</p>
<p>- How did Anakin figure out how to appear as a ghost at the end of ROTJ, and why did he appear as a young man, instead of how he appeared at death, as Obi-Wan and Yoda did? Why didn't Qui Gon also appear, since he was supposed to be the one who started this whole "retaining your identity after death" thing?</p>
<p>Qui-Gon had reached the end of the time he was able to stay, and was absorbed and became one with the force, as ultimately all beings, even Jedi must do. Maybe Obi-Wan and Yoda helped Anakin and prevented him from becoming one with the force right away, or maybe he somehow learned it an instant before death, I don't know.</p>
<p>- Loose end: "Sith Eyes" (yellowish pupils, surrounded by red) are never explained. Palpatine always has them as soon as he turns into prune face. Maul always has them, Dooku never does, Anakin only has them at two points (when he's murdering the Seperatist leaders and when he's burning up on Mustafar). What do they mean, if anything?</p>
<p>The Dark Side warps it's victims the more they use it. It can cause adverse physical affects ranging from cracked and withered skin, degraded bones, and yellow eyes.</p>
<p>- R2's rocket boosters. Never seen in the OT.</p>
<p>Explained in the article. R2 had his boosters removed by a previous master after Obi-Wan and Anakin but before Luke.</p>
<p>- If they're supposed to be in hiding, and esp. hiding the fact that hes a Jedi, why does senile Obi whip out the lightsabre in the cantina?</p>
<p>Maybe he didn't have time to do anything else, or acted on instinct. There could be a number of explanations.</p>
<p>- Obi-wan conveniently forgot about Leia when he says ‘that boy was our last hope.’</p>
<p>Perhaps a slip of the tongue or how two old friends banter - one says something and leaves out something else, letting the other finish his sentence because it's simply the way he's used to how they talk. He knows about Leia, just lets Yoda finish. Silence is not indicative of ignorance.</p>
<p>- Obi-Wan says that Darth Vader was "a pupil of mine until he turned to evil." Anakin stopped being Obi-Wan's pupil and was a full Jedi before he turned to evil. He does call Obi-Wan "my master." But Obi-Wan tells him (also in RotS) that he's a far better Jedi than he could ever hope to be. Vader says in ANH that when he left Ben he was "But the learner" when in fact they were more like equals or partners and friends as portrayed in ROTS (or "brothers" as Obi-Wan puts it). Originally it implied Obi-Wan was still training him or else he was much superior.</p>
<p>Anakin wasn't really even a full Jedi Knight, having not gone through the trials. Technically he was still a Padawan and would probably be taken off the council once the crisis was over. He wasn't really finished learning, either, though Obi-Wan still regarded him as an equal.</p>
<p>- Why hasn't Chewbacca heard of General Kenobi? Granted it was a big war, but with so few Jedi in the Clone War, surely he should have at least heard about him from Yoda (for all we know the only time he actually saw Obi-Wan was as a hologram during those war briefing scenes on Kashyyyk). Yet he lets Han mock him as an "old fossil" in ANH. Then again, the one time the two "talk" is when they are in the Cantina, and he introduces him to Han Solo. This might not be an inconsistency. Still, if he knows who Obi-Wan really is, you'd think he'd stick up for him, rather than treat him like any two-bit customer.</p>
<p>He's a freelance smuggler now, and doesn't want to get involved. Besides, he was only fighting with Yoda, he didn't have time to sit around and chat with him about all the Generals involved in a battle on a planet.</p>
<p>- Yoda's hypocrisy. I could buy it if these are just the lofty ideals of the Jedi that are often broken, but since it's Yoda himself that does it repeatedly in the prequels, I'm going to call it an inconsistency, "a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, NEVER for attack." Realistic explanation (compare to lots of modern politics and military ethics vs. reality), but still. We assumed that the Jedi were defensive fighters, who didn't "cheat" by using the Force to attack their opponents like Vader and the Emperor did, and Luke using the Force to attack was him getting dangerously close to the Dark Side (as if the subtle hints of the black clothing, mechanical hand and anger during combat weren't enough). In the Prequels we learn this is no big deal and all the Jedi do it, even Yoda.</p>
<p>If a SWAT member shoots a suspect because the suspect has a gun in his hand and the SWAT member felt as if he was going to shoot, then it's still self-defense. Also, the Jedi aren't really "attacking" because they were provoked - innocent people are dying and they're attacking the enemy to defend those innocent people. You have to look at the big picture.</p>
<p>- Luke does not know anything about his father, however at some point he should have heard of Anakin Skywalker the only human ever to compete (and win) in a Pod Race.</p>
<p>Probably never thought about it. I mean, would you dig through files (which you probably don't even have access to on an outer-rim planet) about this person who just happens (or so you think) to have the same name as you?</p>
<p>- The Sith rule of two, never suggested in the OT, and both Vader and Palpy had plans for Luke to "Join Them" (even if it was a hypocritical plan by them)</p>
<p>Both Vader and the Emperor knew somewhat that once Luke's training was completed, they would backstab each other and one, or perhaps more of them would die - they just never mention it. It's the way of the Sith - eventually either the master, padawan, or the padawan's padawan dies. Everybody is a means to an end.</p>
<p>- Anakin at 9 already deal with the Force, even if he was unware, was capable of using it. His son, at 18/19 only started dealing with the Force after some lessons from Kenoby. (of course we don't know the Midiclorian count of Luke, not even Lucas)</p>
<p>Anakin's use of it was instinctual. In some beings it comes to them naturally and they can use it even before training, and with others it has to be unlocked through training, as is the case with Luke.</p>
<p>- Luke was too old too train at 20 (or something) Since Jedi's start training at 4 (or less) 20 something seems more than too old to train, even Anakin at 9 was "too old."</p>
<p>Yes, but that doesn't keep him from learning about the Force. The Jedi only discourage taking in older force-sensitives because they need to be sheltered from evil at the start of life, before they grow up and start exibiting anger and such. However, Luke can still learn about the force - it's just dangerous, and such Yoda was hesitant to teach him for fear that he'd already developed too much anger.</p>
<p>- Why is Leia a Princess when Bail Organa was never described as anything more than a Senator? This is never explained in the movies.</p>
<p>Bail Organa is the Senator representing Alderann as well as being the King of Alderann.</p>
<p>- "And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople, only Imperial Stormtroopers are so presice." Obi-Wan in ANH. And this isn't the inconsistency you all think it is (that Stormtroopers are lousy shots in the classic trilogy), rather that we see DANGED ACCURATE Sandpeople in TPM, nailing passing pod racers with their rifles! Compare shooting speed pods vs. shooting the tank treads of some big lumbering Sandcrawler. Which shows more shooting prowess? Explain this away with ignorance or the falling standards of Sandperson marksmanship, but I think it stands out as an inconsistency.</p>
<p>It was a lucky shot. Besides, Sand People are still beings - each one has a different amount of skill. The ones shooting at the Pods just happened to be skilled or lucky. Obi-Wan meant for an AVERAGE sand-person.</p>
<p>- Threepio's head is blown off by Imperial Stormtroopers (or it could have been Boba Fett, that sounds more like his voice, but then then he says "Stormtroopers, here?" when he's revived, in any case...) on Bespin in ESB and his head immediately "goes dead" until it's re-activated by Chewbacca later on. In AOTC his head is knocked off by some machines in the Geonosis factory and continues to be aware as he's bolted onto a battledroid body. Later on his head is torn off and dragged around by R2D2 and then welded back on his own body again. Throughout he remained aware, his eyes stayed lit up and he continued to talk as if there was no interruption in function. Likewise his body without his head wandered about with no problems. And before somebody argues that being blown apart by blasters was much more violent, recall that his head didn't show anymore physical damage on it in ESB than it did in AOTC when knocked off.</p>
<p>A droid is a complex thing. C-3P0 was just lucky enough not to be hit so hard or in the right place or in the right circuit for him to deactivate in the prequels. Besides, the stormtroopers were probably actively aiming to destroy.</p>
<p>- Not only do we not know how Obi-Wan and Luke stayed hidden, but how did Yoda stay hidden all those years in exile? And even with the deleted scene of Yoda arriving on Dagobah we aren't told what happened to that ship he used to take there or how he built that stone looking shelter (why wasn't the shelter made of metal if he made it from the craft as the EU suggests?) if he lives in a bog? Loose end: how did the cave become a "domain of evil"? It might have been better to leave this unexplained, then we could theorize he just got dropped off by someone. Edit: Okay, I'm retracting part of this one. Keep the Yoda's ship/shelter inconsistency, disregard the "stay hidden" one. In ROTJ Luke is able to hide his presence from the Emperor somehow ("I have felt him Master." "Strange that I have not."), which is reaffirmed in the prequels with Palpatine somehow hiding his presence from the Jedi who fail to detect him until late in ROTS (and Obi-Wan goes undetected by Vader until the Falcon lands in the Death Star hangar). Yoda's hiding on Dagobah is far less objectionable than Obi-Wan hiding on Tatooine, since at least we don't presume that Anakin knows his way around Dagobah like he knows his way around Tatooine (Obi-Wan lives "somewhere out beyond the Dune Sea" according to ANH, making him much more well hidden than Luke, who is living in the same house that Anakin visited in AOTC). If we disregard deleted scenes (they are DELETED after all), we can ignore this inconsistency. Somehow Yoda got to dagobah and remained undetected the same way Palpatine or Luke could. Being untrained perhaps Luke doesn't give off the same presence. But Vader and the Emperor should know that Tatooine is "a haven for those who don't wish to be found" (Qui Gon knew this, in TPM) and at least do some checking. Vader had reason enough to keep tabs on "his family" as well, since they're his only remaining link to his mother.</p>
<p>While you said to disregard it, I have to adress the hidden point. Respectfully, I recommend you do some research - the EU answers this question. That evil dark side cave Luke went into is choked with dark-side energy, which cancels out the overwhelming light presence of Yoda. Couple that with all the sheer array of life on the planet and it's extremely hard for Yoda to be picked out.</p>
<p>As for the ship thing, I'm not quite sure. Maybe Yoda only used the ship parts for pots and pans and such, and built the rest out of ship parts.</p>
<p>- What was Owen's real motivation for wanting to erase the droids' memories? Did he know what he had uncovered? In purchasing the droids did he recognize them or not? He seems reluctant to purchase them, anxious to erase their memories after hearing Luke mention Obi-Wan Kenobi, but leaves Luke to do the job the next day rather than seeing to it personally. These scenes are rather ambiguous now.</p>
<p>Owen suspected the droids were corrupted or just malfunctioning, and just in case they hadn't been memory-wiped before they got them, told Luke to do it.</p>
<p>- Why are Stormtroopers suddenly different heights with different voices, and lose all color identification marks and extraneous details like binocular visors, skirts, etc. (not just the loss of camo). Not to mention all those ground vehicles they used to have which seemed much more useful and powerful than what they had in the classic trilogy (even if the new technology is superior, why do they not even have the equivalent of LAATs, those carryalls for AT-TE's, etc.)?</p>
<p>After the Clone Wars, the galaxy went into a kind of technological depression. The aftermath of the war was a devastated economy that was only just starting to rebuild even by ANH. Even the Empire, with the top-available technology, wasn't as powerful as the Republic due to this. They also didn't have as many cloning facilities available, and as such many of the "less elite" stormtrooper legions are made up of ordinary humans rather than clones. Only about 50% of Stormtroopers are clones, perhaps 66%.</p>
<p>- Why doesn't the Empire use battledroids, droid fighters or other droid technology? (and only droids in non-combat roles like protocol and astromech droids) This is never explained (even if you consider Lama Su's statement that clones are superior to droids in being able to think creatively, that says nothing about the fact that you can make many times more droids much faster than you can raise clones, and you can make them much more loyal much easier than brainwashing conscripts, and so many other advantages... and we know his statement isn't true, because we've seen Threepio and R2D2 who seem incredibly clever), really. With the Seperatists defeated, the Empire would have access to all their technology, and yet they don't use it. And no, I don't consider hiring IG-88 as a bounty hunter a fix to the problem.</p>
<p>The Empire's tactics focus around group coordination, hard and fast strikes with ground forces and stormtroopers, and individual skill and precision, not mindlessly swarming tons of half-intelligent, fragile battle droids (which are the only characteristics easily-fieldable ones posess, the others being prohibitively expensive) on the enemy. They use stormtroopers because they need each squad to be intelligent and more skilled than a droid, as well as like Lama Su said, they need to be able to think creatively.</p>
<p>Besides, many of the stormtroopers are still clones and already brainwashed. Those ones that are regular humans are actually plucked from Imperial fleet and army regiments (stormtroopers actually are heavy shock troops, and most of the garrisons on worlds consist of ordinary conscripted soldiers with weapons, known as regular Army and Fleet regiments.) and are slowly eased into the role, growing in seniority the longer they've been in service (and during this time they are undergoing further brainwashing). Since the Army and Fleet regiments are already half-brainwashed and fairly loyal, it doesn't take much effort other than slowly easing them in through a regimen of training to make them fanatically loyal and skilled.</p>
<p>- And conversly, why doesn't the Rebel Alliance use droids for combat? They seem able to afford all kinds of other gear and equipment, and it's not as if they are above using astromech droids in their fighters and protocol droids on their larger ships.</p>
<p>Battle droids are expensive, and despite their shortage of troops the Rebels couldn't afford to mass-produce them or anything.</p>
<p>- When first viewing a New Hope and the OT, it appeared that Obi-Wan wore robes to blend in with the locals of Tatoone. Good idea while in hiding. And Yoda lived in a swamp for years and only needed rags. Makes sense. But the prequels start with most Jedi wearing robes everywhere. Is this the Jedi Uniform? Why else where bulky robes and cloaks walking around the Jedi Temple or city life in Coruscant and even in the cockpit of their fighters. And if it is a Jedi uniform, why would Obi-Wan keep wearing it while in hiding and with Storm troopers about on Tatooine and the Death Star?</p>
<p>It's not just a Jedi uniform, it's a standard robe worn by millions of beings in the galaxy. Jedi wear it to blend in, just like Obi-Wan.</p>
<p>Possible- Why doesn't the Empire have/use "Ray Shields" (like in ROTS) to capture the Rebels on the Death Star? You could say ANH itself shows us that "they let us go" in order to find the Rebel base to wipe them all out, but before Vader's plan was put into action it would seem useful for them to use Ray Shields. Obi-Wan could have been captured this way (they're useful for capturing Jedi), although you could say Vader said "escape is not his plan, I must face him alone" and that's why they were not used. Those are the only real opportunities they had to use Ray Shields (assuming it's a technology only present on starships). The Trade Federation didn't use them to capture Qui Gon and Obi-Wan, so (within the prequel continuity) not all ships may have them or we could chalk it up to an internal inconsistency in the Prequel trilogy and not applicable (like the reason why Jedi never use "force speed" ever again after that one instance in TPM).</p>
<p>They're expensive, and to implant them on something as massive as a starship on every deck in every corner would add trillions to the cost of any vessel. ROTS had the Jedi running around in the flagship of a gigantic fleet made up of conglomerations of companies that would have been able to easily afford putting a couple of projectors in key corridors like the ones Obi-Wan and Anakin were moving in when they got trapped.</p>

<p>If you are editing this article and think "wait a second, I just thought of something else that is a plothole in star wars!". Do not add it. This is original research and is forbidden in wikipedia. If you have already put in things like this (which is almost assured for some things in this article) you should remove them. Only if you have heard multiple people make a certain comment about a plothole, or can find a source of a discussion about a particular plothole on the internet, only then should anything be added to this article. This even goes for arguments as to why a thing is not a plothole, which you might be tempted to add to counter a plothole remark in the name of "NPOV".</p>

<p>This has not been made clear; Are 'theatrical inconsistancies' valid? For example, in Revenge of the Sith, Obi-wan continously takes off his robe/cape, and immediately in the next scene the robe is removed from the ground (where he dropped it). Is this valid? -- kanzure 3 Jul 2005</p>

<p>I disagree strongly that Obi Wan was punishing Anakin. Obi Wan warned him NOT to jump, and Anakin jumped. Obi Wan cut off Anakin's limbs in self defense. There was nothing really Obi Wan could do when Anakin gets set on fire. That fire could easily spread. He stayed away in self defense. He was thinking about the babies, and he wanted to live to help take care of them. Mace deciding to kill Palpatine was also NOT punishment!!! Mace simply thought he was too dangerous to be left alive. I strongly disagree that this issue is even an inconsistancy, but if it is, I very much disagree with the answer presented. Karsten 9 Jun 2005</p>
<hr />
<p>I think there are plenty more inconsistencies in star wars that have no sense, for example, why in the star wars II, conde Dooku can't feel the presence of obi-wan kenobi when he's walking in the corridors of the factory talking and obi-wan is just a few steps away? jedis and siths can feel each other. I don't think i have an actual list right now but i can name several other inconsistencies in the film, i think it should be approached further.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>"how did the names Luke and Leia come to her?"</i> Oh come on, a woman giving expecting a child has a name ready for both sexes - not very surprising. How can this be seriously listed as an inconsistency? I suggest it should be removed. --153.1.3.150 10:59, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><i>"R2D2 is not mentioned in the command. Was his memory wiped as well?"</i> This is not an inconsistecy, this is a qustion. Besides, R2D2's memory is not wiped and this is even partly evident in episodes 4-6 where R2D2 seems to be quite aware of what's happening. So there is no inconsistency. --153.1.3.150 11:17, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><i>"Why does Obi-Wan say to Luke "I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since before you were born"? We see no evidence in Episode III of Obi-Wan changing his name."</i> Hardly an inconsistency, as time between Luke's birth and episode 4 is undefined (in the films). If then a claim is made about that time in episode 4, it is naturally consistent narrative because there is nothing to contradict it. Apparently Obi-Wan did change his name after episode 3. --153.1.3.150 11:25, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But in Episode III we see him using the name "Obi-Wan" after Luke is born, when Yoda speaks with him. - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 12:57, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes but when you're talking to someone in a hostile environment you're not going to say "I haven't gone by that name since a short time after you were actually born." Effectively he's paraphrasing it - since his life on Tatoinne has been bound up with Luke's growth since birth he means that Obi-Wan refers to his previous life. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 00:27, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the "<i>Combat</i>" section, Obi-wan was not living in seclusion for twenty years. He was living near Luke to keep an eye on him as he grows older as a part of the plan Kenobi, Yoda, and Organa devised at the end of Episode III. Organa was to adopt Leia as the other part of the plan. Josh J 15:41, 20 Feb 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As more things come to light in the EU, we see other books coming out now that show Obi-Wan wasn't always near/around Luke also. Some of the newer "young adult" books are showing that Vader chased Obi-Wan around the galaxy. Initially, though, there was no intention of Luke or Leia being trained. glyph 07:58 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the following "inconsistency": <i>* Episode V: After <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke</a> leaves Degobah, Obi-Wan Kenobi comments that Luke is "their last hope" and Yoda corrects him, stating there is another.

<dd>This is not an inconsistency. Obi-Wan knows what Yoda is talking about. He knows "there is another". If you watch, he isn't surprised, he doesn't ask Yoda what Yoda is talking about. He gives none of the indications of learning new information. The viewers don't know what Yoda is talking about, but we certainly shouldn't project our ignorance onto Obi-Wan.</dd>
<dd>There are many inconsistencies in the movies that remain legitimate: Padmé dies, but Leia claims to remember her (and if you watch that scene carefully, Luke seems to remember her as well); sometimes lightsabre cuts draw blood, other times they don't; <i>etc</i>. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a></dd>

<p>Your original claim is still false. The film does offer evidence that Obi-Wan doesn't know that Leia is Vader's daughter: he says Luke is their only hope in the first place.

<dd>Fair enough. The point is, even if an inconsistency can be refuted, it still belongs in the article, just like the technological advancement inconsistency, Vader not recognizing Threepio, Artoo's rockets, waterproof lightsabers, and Obi-Wan not remembering Artoo. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 21:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The droids are everywhere. Neither C3P0 or R2D2 are unique droids. Say if you used to drive a Honda Accord 10 years ago and when the same car appears in front of you today, will you recognize it? These R2 droids seem to be standard issue to the fighter jets, just like a plug-in circuit board to a PC. Even if Obi-Wan used a R2 unit before a few decades ago, he would not remember if it was a D4 or D6. I don't think Vader or Obi-Wan would bother to memorize the serial number of a piece of hardware for a few decades. You would not remember the VIN of the car you are driving today.

<dd>The nature of this subject invites the sort of silly ponderisms (why do we drive on the parkway and park on the driveway) that lower its quality. Many perceived inconsistencies come from a lack of imagination on the part of the view, but most of the actual inconsistencies (such as the blood from the severed arm in Mos Eisley) arise from human error on the part of the film makers (due in no small part to the length of time between the making of each movie and the difference in techniques available for the second-made trilogy). The desire to create a real galaxy out of light flickering through fast-moving petroleum by-product is strong in some fans. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 12:56, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My big problem with this article is: the bulk of the content is not about the inconsistencies, but about the fanboy answers to the inconsistencies. My idea for a solution:</p>
<p>Structure things in a <b>Problem:</b> and <b>Fan Response:</b> dialogue format. An example:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Problem:</b> In <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/A_New_Hope_840f.html" title="A New Hope">A New Hope</a></i>, <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_fb34.html" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> seemingly does not recognize <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-D2_552c.html" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> and greets him as though they had never seen each other before, even though Obi-Wan was well acquainted with Artoo during the prequel trilogy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Fan Response:</b> This could be partly explained by the twenty-year timespan between their last encounter as well as Obi-Wan's age. Other interpretations suggest that Obi-Wan is playing dumb, that Artoo's appearance is not distinctive, or that Obi-Wan actually does recognize the droid, but chooses not to make an issue of it. Obi-Wan claims that he doesn't "recall owning a droid", which is consistent with the prohibition on Jedi owning personal property of any substance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then it becomes very clear to the reader which parts are critiques of the film, and which parts are fanboy <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologetics</a>. Then and only then will the true nature of this page be revealed.</p>
<p>It will be forever obvious which pov dominates this page, and we'll be able to control edits accordingly. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaecker_664c.html" title="User:Staecker">Staecker</a> 16:45, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the beginning of ROTJ, C3PO (talking about Jabba's palace) says, "...poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place." Later, however, Leia disguised as Boushh brings Chewbacca into Jabba's palace as her bounty. Several people I know have noticed this independently. I won't add it (yet) because of the "original research" clause (ORC), but I do beleive this particular application of the ORC is not consistent with the spirit of the clause, meant to protect the encylcopedia from amateur theories and made-up facts. I would further contest that anything on this page could even be considered original research at all, as any inconsistency in the films DOES indeed have a source reference - the Star Wars films themselves.

<dd>I've thought about this lately as well. It's likely that 3PO did not know the entire plan. Chewbacca was likely on Tatooine with Leia and the whole gang had it all set up. They would never have told the entire plan to 3PO, and would have avoided speaking about it to him due to his big mouth. That's just my explanation.

<p>Recently, a certain <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Marudubshinki</a> has been tampering with this talk page under the guise of "formatting". In the process he has among other things tampered with my comments, changing the indent and even reformatting the text itself. For one thing, Maru thinks that all comments should indent. While indenting serves to set comments apart, it also looks ugly when it's done to too many levels. A quadruple indent, like he tried to format my comment above to, looks stupid. (He may use quadruple-level indents if he wants to because, unlike him, I don't want to impose my formatting preferences on others—however, they're my comments and as long as they're signed by me, they're written and formatted as I please.) Other people may do as they wish, but for MY comments, I like to alternate between indented and unindented. It looks a lot better. As for emphasis, on talk pages I use capital letters and *asterisks* to emphasize instead of wikimarkup for bold text because people read talk pages in diffs, not in finished form, and when you're reading a diff, capital letters are far easier to recognize as emphasis than wikimarkup. In short, there is a reason my comments are formatted the way they are, and I deserve for that to be respected, not vandalized. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 18:00, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Vandalized"? I take deep offense at that, Welch. Like everybody else, I've spent a lot of time fixing <i>real</i> vandalism on SW articles; I've spent many hours here, working hard on articles, researching new ones, writing them, giving advice to other people. And then you come along, dismissing all of my hard work simply because you don't like how I clean up Talk: pages. Newsflash, Phil: in the eight or so months I've been editing Talk pages, in the exact same manner as this one, you and <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrien_ba7e.html" title="User:Darrien">Darrien</a> are the <i>only</i> people ever to complain. That should tell you something. And I <b>definitely</b> don't appreciate your histrionic cheapening of the term 'vandalism' by applying it to my editing. I have not edited the substance of your comments, nor changed what you said, so that it appeared you said something you did not- no, I merely moved them around, and for that I am attacked by you. And I think your indenting preferences ill-founded, since such a scheme makes it extremely difficult to follow the chronological progression of the conversation, and does not look better; it looks messy. As for emphasizing, I'll grant you that point- but not everybody reads in diffs. What about the people who don't have it on their watchlist? If you took personal offense at my improvements, remember the wise words of the edit box:"If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it." --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> 18:33, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Insofar as my comments are signed by me, they should be written and formatted as I desire so long as I'm making those decisions intentionally. I afford you the same courtesy. I fail to see where I've ever dismissed any of your work, other than your decision to reformat my comments against my will. If you interpret the "edited mercilessly and redistributed at will" phrase literally than obviously you will not object to my changing your user page, no? It appears I do not like the way you format comments, and you do not like the way I format comments. The reasonable, civilized solution here is to simply allow each other to follow our own preferences. I don't try and reformat your comments the way I prefer them; you don't try and reformat my comments either.

<p>That's not really relevant—my comments *don't* contain obscenities, misspellings, personal attacks, and copyrighted material, but even if they did I would prefer if *I* be the one to make corrections (unless there was copyrighted material involved). Removing obscenities and personal attacks isn't a widely accepted practice as you may not be aware, and while I've engaged in that practice, it was only with the consent and agreement of the other editor. i think there's a distinction to be made between formatting the comments of some anon who doesn't know better and reformatting the comments of a user with 5,000 edits and over a year of experience, especially when that user's formatting decisions are deliberate. As I continue to point out, I haven't reformatted your comments even though I find your indenting quite egregious—with a one-on-one dialogue I really prefer to alternate indented and unindented, and let the top-to-bottom flow indicate the chronological flow of the discussion (newer comments are lower—duh). If you want to proceed to reformat anonymous comments on this page I don't really care. But I format my comments a certain way because I like them that way. You leave them that way and I'll leave your comments the way you like them. That's the social contract around here, so to speak. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 19:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was pointing out edge cases in your assertion of supreme sovereignty over your comments. And no, I didn't know it wasn't a common pratice to remove personal attacks and obscenities- the only case where this came into play that I know of was <a href="../../../d/a/r/Talk%7EDarth_Revan_Archive_2_e9af.html" title="Talk:Darth Revan/Archive 2">Talk:Darth Revan/Archive 2</a>, where the other editors took the lead- naturally I assumed it was standard practice. Hmm; learn a new thing every day.</dd>
<dd>And again, your preferred formatting is flawed; while as long as the two editors in your hypothetical case reply only to the other editor's previous reply, then things are hunky-dory. But your linear scheme cannot handle multiple participants replying to arbitrary comments at arbitrary times. You need a tree structure to do that, which an alternating linear format cannot handle in a reasonably compact, intuitively understandable way; you basically need threading, to borrow e-mail terminology. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> 20:29, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The final paragraph in the first section (not the lead) asks, essentialy, <i>How did Anakin become one with the Force?</i>.

<li>Somebody can post an exact transcript from the DVD, but he doesn't say that they resurrected him, only that Anakin learned the secret like they did. He doesn't really elaborate on it. I guess we're supposed to assume that off-camera the spirits talked to Anakin's spirit and brought him back from the netherworld of the Force. Of course one wonders why Qui Gon Jinn's spirit doesn't appear, or why they didn't do this for any other Jedi who died, but oh well, Lucas isn't that great about tying up these loose ends, is he?&#160;;)</li>

<li>Obi-Wan's lightsaber is damaged in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_Menace_9257.html" title="The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i> when it gets wet on <a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboo.html" title="Naboo">Naboo</a>, yet Luke's continues to work despite being plunged into the Dagobah swamps, and Obi-Wan's lightsaber in <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> and <i>A New Hope</i> continues to work even after being submerged during Obi-Wan's swimming escape from clone troopers on <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utapau.html" title="Utapau">Utapau</a>. Apparently, lightsaber waterproofing is an aspect of saber-making that Obi-Wan initially ignored, but corrected with later sabers. Even though Luke was wielding his father's saber until <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, one could assume that Obi-Wan told Anakin to waterproof it.</li>

<ul>
<li>The "lightsaber shorting out from moisture" thing isn't in the movie, it's a cut scene that was never filmed (only one photo exists to indicate it was filmed, and shows obvious signs of bad photoshopping to put a lightsaber into Qui Gon's hand as he gestures towards Obi-Wan in the swamp). It was featured in a comic book, the novelisation and an early version of the script. It was the first time in the Star Wars universe that Lightsabers didn't work when wet (Splinter of the Mind's Eye was the first novel to depict lightsaber interaction with water and they worked just fine). Due to the influence of this Phantom Menace non-filmed scene, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy featured portions of the single player campaigns where you would wade into water and it would automatically shut your lightsaber off until you exited the liquid (in the original Jedi Knight game and the expansion Mysteries of the Sith, which were set a few years earlier, you could use lightsabers in water while swimming). Since the scene was cut from the movie and not included on the DVD I think we can safely erase it from canon, but people insist on explaining it and the silliness in the two Jedi Knight sequels, so there you go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lightsabers only short out if they hit water and the power is on. If it's deactivated and you clean it of water before reactivating it, it'll work fine. -<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.251.80.95.html" title="User:205.251.80.95">205.251.80.95</a> 01:16, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This has bothered me since Ep. 2. It is obvious throughout the prequel trilogy that R2-D2 and Yoda are very much aware of each other, especially given their time together on Polis Massa at the end of Ep. 3. At the end of RotS Bail Organna gives Captain Antilles C3PO and R2D2 for servicing and orders C3PO's mind wiped but not R2D2's. Since this is the case is it not conceivable that the two should have some recolection of each other during TESB? I understand that its been some time but R2D2 had apparently no problem recognizing Obi Wan Kenobi in ANH.

<p>In <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, the Millenium Falcon lands on an asteroid, and is attacked by "Minocs". The crew just open up the door of the spacecraft (Airlock? What's that?) and walk out into the <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/Geoffrey.Landis/vacuum.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sff.net/people/Geoffrey.Landis/vacuum.html" rel="nofollow">vacuum of space</a> with flimsy oxygen masks that look like they got them from General Hospital. This bothered me so much I actually did some research on it. Turns out explosive decompression <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_adaptation_to_space.html#Unprotected_Effects" title="Human adaptation to space">doesn't necessarily happen</a> when going from 1 atmosphere to 0 atmospheres (you need a bigger pressure drop), but that doesn't mean walking around in a vacuum without a pressure suit is a picnic. These articles seem to indicate that you would asphixiate anyway, even with a breathing mask, because of gas exchange through your skin or something. Plus www.apeculture.com/movies/swscienceempire.htm has a very good point about the asteroid's gravity, and the ecology issues: what the heck does this giant worm eat? How did it get there? I'm not even going to entertain the notion that the cave/worm-stomach/asteroid has an atmosphere, that's ridiculous, everyone knows that asteroids do not have atmospheres.</p>
<p>Sheesh. I'm going back to my Heinlein.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's always bothered me as well. Besides, you'd expand and eventually explode, because your skin and organs aren't tough enough to keep their shape under no pressure at all. Also, you'd freeze to death within minutes, as it's lower than -100C out there. Maybe they were wearing forcefield generators or something? -<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.251.80.95.html" title="User:205.251.80.95">205.251.80.95</a> 01:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, you would not explode in space. The human body holds a lot of heat, and it would take a long time to freeze. Have you ever found yourself literally freezing solid when you go outside on a winter's day? No, of course not. You lose heat by transferring it to cold air. In space, there is no way to rapidly transfer the heat...so the body must radiate it way. If it takes a long time in frigid air, it would take even longer in frigid space. There is no air in space. Despite what movies like <b>Outland</b> would have you believe, you wouldn't explode if exposed to space. The air would rush out of your lungs explosively, which could damage your lungs and throat. But your skin and vascular system would contain your blood fairly well, protecting it against the vacuum, so your blood would not boil. After a long time, the cells would freeze, and the expanding ice crystals (water expands when it freezes) would rupture the cells, making you look a pretty good mess. But that would take hours, or longer, not seconds. Oddly though, a human can survive several seconds of pure vacuum. <b>2001: A Space Odyssey</b> had a scene like this; the astronaut had to go from his pod to the airlock without his helmet. I don't think he would look as nicely coiffed after the incident as he did in the movie, but the scene was largely accurate. Ironically, as Arthur C. Clarke has pointed out, in Earth orbit, your biggest problem is sunburn! Exposure to the UV light of the Sun would fry your skin in minutes, giving you a very bad sunburn. I'd be satisfied to live with that, given the alternative! For more info about what happens when a human is exposed to a vacuum, read <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970603.html" class="external text" title="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970603.html" rel="nofollow">NASA'S "Imagine the Universe!" website</a>. They have real-life examples discussed too</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, you are mistaken you thoughts about space being 'cold'. Space has no temperature. Think of it this way: If you opened a pop can in an airlock, then vented the airlock into space, the soda would actually boil because in a vacuum liquids can boil at room temperature (that's why some recipes need to be modified for people at high altitudes; water boils at a lower temperature in the lower air pressure at such heights). The soda would be warm enough initially to actually boil. The boiling would cause it to dissipate pretty rapidly once it hits vacuum. You would see a spray of steam, not the icicles. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The problem is, there are plenty of them: that's what the article is all about.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHereToHelp_1de7.html" title="User:HereToHelp">HereToHelp</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHereToHelp_c207.html" title="User talk:HereToHelp">talk</a>) 13:21, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Exactly. To maintain the illusion that what's happening on the screen is real, people like to adress and find explanations that fit within the reality of the movie, as for some detracts from the experience if you think about the "real" explanation, as for them it spoils the beleif that the movie is real, which is central to the actual enjoyment of the movie. It's central to the whole idea of "canon", which is what this article is about. -<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.251.80.95.html" title="User:205.251.80.95">205.251.80.95</a> 01:23, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, where is it stated that R2 has his memory wiped after the events in Revenge of the Sith? 3PO has his wiped under instructions, but no mention is made of R2. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 08:18, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>They didn't errase R2's memory because he wasn't stupid enough to talk about cartain events,and probably would deleate sensitive memory before anybody would be able to capture him. <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudtz_4295.html" title="User:Dudtz">Dudtz</a> 3/13/06 7:01 PM</p>

<dd>I can't remember where, but I once read something where it was explained that astromechs were usually trusted because they had superior abilities when keeping secrets (not just personalities, but data encryption and whatnot), since they were constantly interacting with computer systems. Protocol droids, however, are traditionally untrustworthy (not really their fault), and so are often wiped.

<p>Another explanation is that the in the original trilogy, you simply don't see a lot of technology. The planets visited are usually desolate:</p>
<p>Tatooine (a desert planet) Hoth (an ice/snow planet) Endor (Forest moon) Dagobah (a swamp planet) Yavin IV (Yavin moon) Cloud City (city in the clouds of Bespin) An often response to this is that the prequel trilogy hosts a number of planets that are just as desolate:</p>
<p>Corusant (a planet that is one big city) Geonosis (a rock planet) Mustafar (a volcano planet) Kamino (an ocean planet) Utapau (a jungle planet filled with huge sinkholes, like the on Clone Commander Cody was in when he found Obi-Wans lightsaber) Naboo (not specific)</p>
<p>How is Coruscant desolate,it is loaded with people and machines,it is the absolute opposite of desolate. <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudtz_4295.html" title="User:Dudtz">Dudtz</a> 3/7/06 5:47 PM EST</p>

<dd>The... that's a whole lot of nonsensical stuff right there. A desolate environment isn't the same as a dearth of technology. Kamino not having technology?

<dd>Considering the relatively low odds that Luke et al <i>walked</i> to the Death Star, it was a reasonable assumption for her to make that he was a pilot of some sort (this is backed up by the fact that all three of them were pilots). <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 22:13, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It serves exactly the same purpose as putting inconsistencies in other movie articles, accept there is a large enough supply of material due to the nature of the 2 trilogies to make its own article. It is encyclopedic as it is of interest to people who would like to know this kind of information.

<p>Hi. I'm the guy that just completely reorganized everything. Maybe that was wrong of me, but hey, we're supposed to "be bold", right? To me, the article seemed to ramble alot. I cut out alot of info to make things clear (I'd like to re-inserting that info in a more formal-sounding, organized form, discounting the small percentage that was completely off-topic). I'd like to edit more (mainly the technology section -- it's way too long) but I don't have the time right now. So please have at it in my presumed absense. And feel free to critize me here.

<p>First of all, although EU is an accepted acronym for Expanded Universe, I don't think we should invent RW fro Real World, unless that acronym is already in use.</p>
<p>Secondly, who had the idea of changing statements like "When George Lucas made Episode IV, he had not yet determined that Obi-wan had known R2-D2 previously" into statements like "There is no authentic RW explanation for this problem"&#160;??? The truth is that Lucas hadn't worked out the backstory; so why isn't that an "authentic" explantion? I'm thinking of changing that back.</p>

<p>Another inconsistency, that may or may not be interesting, is that Vader clearly seems to be subordinate to Tarkin in <i>IV</i>, from things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Are you sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk here Vader, this had better work," or</li>
<li>"This bickering is pointless. Vader, release him."</li>
</ul>
<p>What's the deal with that? It's not like in <i>V</i>, where apparently he can kill his own officers with impunity. In <i>IV</i>, he explicitly obeys, even though it is clear that he has the power to not. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalPi_5c41.html" title="User:RadicalPi">RadicalPi</a> 06:23, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Visor4 replies: The reason behind that is Grand Moff Tarkin and all the other officers shown at the "round table" on the Death Star were either Vader's superior (in Tarkin's case) or Vader's equal in rank. When the Death Star was destroyed, Vader was the only superior officer left, and thus all the officers he tortured or killed without whim in episodes V &amp; VI were of a much lower rank. Since Tarkin was no longer around to keep him in check, Vader let his emotions dictacte his actions.</p>
