	    <p>re: The IS/WF split Claiming the two groups defused is rather odd given that the one with all the power (the IS leadership) wanted Workers Fight gone, and the one without (WF) would like to have stayed. It has all the characteristics off, and has been widely described as, an expulsion. So that's what I've called it. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> 16:27, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here are the facts as can be verified by the internal documents of the day. Cliff met Matgamna in a pub and a deal was done. WF joined IS as a faction the TT. This pissed people off and two conferences were held to defuse the groups. The result was the membership of IS voted to defuse the TT and IS. No one was expelled. Expulsion meaning that an individual or group booted out of a group for disciplinery reasons whether real or imagined in the Trotskyist tradition. This did not happen. A vote was taken and right or wrong a part of the organisation, which had maintained its own internal organisation and never properly fused into IS, was defused. facts. Whether or not the IS exec had all the power is besides the point a vote was taekn and the TT lost it. Certainly the event has been described as an expulsion by opponents of the IS but that does not make it so. There are other inaccuracies which you've introduced contrary to the hsitorical record which is meant to be of paramount importance here.</dd>

<ol>
<li>Sean Matgamna is not the "leader" of the AWL. It doesn't have one.</li>
<li>Workers Liberty Australia has never been an organisation of "ex-pats".</li>
<li>I've removed the stuff about the Ukrainian group. While true, it should be covered in its own article, as it affected any number of different parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've also removed some info which seems insignificant (e.g. the Hackney newsletter), and restored some which you gave no reason for removing (e.g. position on the Falklands War). <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> 19:06, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that it's misleading to list only one organisation in France, so I've expanded it to two and made it those two whose sites link back to the AWL. I've listed the VdT current first, since these seem to be the people with the most interest in the AWL. Listing only the LCR was especially misleading, since the LCR has an other sister organisation in the UK, and since the AWL has closer links to individuals, and tendencies around the LCR like VdT, than to the LCR.</p>
<p>Over the decades, the group has linked to several currents in other countries but obviously these relationships have different strengths. The 'international' listing on the AWL sites can't really reflect that easily. Others might know better... --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanBCS_800c.html" title="User:DuncanBCS">DuncanBCS</a> 09:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was recently added. Myself I don't like the the word "humilation" but perhaps being beaten by a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Future_b894.html" title="Conservative Future">Conservative Future</a> candidate is rare enough to be embarassing.</p>

<dd>I've removed "Last year the group were a lot smaller but chose to run against <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Broad_Left_0282.html" title="Student Broad Left">Student Broad Left</a> in any full time positions where they stood, leading to the humiliation of at one point being beaten by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Future_b894.html" title="Conservative Future">Conservative Future</a> candidate." It's biased to the point that I can't think of how to NPOV it. Humiliation is a poor choice of word, and as someone who took some interest in the NUS elections, I didn't hear anything about one ENFS candidate being beaten by a CF candidate - not to say it didn't happen, but it is hardly notable. I heard ENFS were actually a little larger than the CfE the previous year - certainly their Block of 12 candidate polled better. And the section on running against SBL, if mentioned at all, should be put in the context of the breakdown of the NUS left coalition - it is equally true that SBL decided to run against ENFS wherever they stood. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> 10:42, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Action for Solidarity' actually was established as a broader project, sometime around 1996, with an open editorial board that included John Lister from the ISG. The ISG gave lukewarm support for it, and it was only much later that the AWL formally assimilated it. --81.171.211.66 19:32, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The unsigned comment above makes a good point: the Weekly Worker is published by an opponent group that has an interest in underestimating the AWL's membership. However, that group is also the closest to the AWL on the Brtish left. On <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Socialist_Group_688d.html" title="International Socialist Group">International Socialist Group</a> we do cite the WW as a reference, alongside others. Compared to the other estimates, it does 'lowball' the numbers: It claims 50 while the highest estimate we found is 100 and the actual number is probably right in the middle. However, I think it's useful as a ball-park figure, even if we point out that the WW tends to under-estimate, or perhaps we can say that it's estim,ates tend to number the activist core rather than the formal membership. Any suggestions? --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanBCS_800c.html" title="User:DuncanBCS">Duncan</a> 11:31, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The CPGB who publish the WW have worked closely in the recent past with the AWL, so they probably have a better idea of AWL membership figures than of ISG membership. However, they do have an interest in underestimating the AWL's membership. I'm not sure of the exact figure, but 100 activists isn't far off, I'd have thought perhaps slightly more, but would be happy to include their claim, with a cautionary note. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 23:13, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that's wise. Their estimate of the ISG membership was low but pretty good, and at least correct to 50% pr so; we used until we found a number we could directly cite from the ISG itself. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanBCS_800c.html" title="User:DuncanBCS">Duncan</a> 11:03, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The newspaper is fortnightly. Like many publications, it takes a break over the Christmas/New Year period; like most socialist publications, it operates at a reduced frequency (not usually three-weekly) over midsummer. It's inaccurate to say it is published ever two or three weeks, as it is not published at a three-weekly frequency at any time. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 18:10, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No fortnighly comes out 18 or 19 times a year. How about 'fortnightly during the academic term, and less frequently at other times'. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanBCS_800c.html" title="User:DuncanBCS">Duncan</a> 21:18, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. Generally, it comes out fortnightly - and the academic term note is incorrect, as its frequency is unchanged in September, or over Easter.
