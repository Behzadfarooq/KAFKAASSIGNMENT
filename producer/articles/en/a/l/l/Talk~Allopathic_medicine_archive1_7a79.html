<h2><span class="mw-headline">Using the term</span></h2>
<p>It is essential that this page stays neutral. That means we should not evaluate whether one system of medicine is better than another but we should present the facts as they are.</p>
<p>The term should be defined at the beginning and then expanded upon. The term itself is used by a variety of people. I have heard the term "allopathy" commonly used at Harvard Medical School as well as at medical conferences. It is not just a term used by critics. We should simply define the term at the beginning. Later in the article, it can be discussed who uses the term.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how many references you think is necessary. The point is that there are hundreds of journal articles out there that use the term in a non-derogatory manner. When I did a quick search on Web of Science for journal articles allopath* came up with 325 references, which was more than naturopath* (181) but less than chiroprac*(2301) or homeopath* (1,437).</dd>

<dd>The meaning as per Merriam Webster is "relating to or being a system of medicine that aims to combat disease by using remedies (as drugs or surgery) which produce effects that are different from or incompatible with those of the disease being treated". It doesn't mean "mainstream", especially as "mainstream" medicine has never been based on such a principle. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:12, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Webster's New World Edition</span></h2>
<p>My Webster's New World Edition, gives your definition and then says "loosely applied to the general practice of medicine today." This is the way I have heard it commonly used on many occasions.</p>
<p>I think the term also refers to a general principle for modern medicine as well. For example, to treat high cholesterol, you take a medicine that lowers cholesterol. To treat cancer, you eliminate the cancer. This is different than most other medical frameworks. For example, traditional chinese medicine uses techniques to create energetic balance between organs. The objective is thus balance not elimination of disease.</p>
<p>How about we use the full websters definition to avoid controversy then? - (unsigned)</p>
<p>As long as the accurate meaning is included. We already point out both the loose, inaccurate meaning used by foes of medicine, and the accurate meaning. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:28, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Term is used different outside of the USA</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps you are indicating that the term "allopath" is used very differently in the country you are in compared to the U.S. In which case, this may explain the differing perspectives. In the US, allopathy is commonly used by physicians and medical schools to discuss conventional medicine. Is this different? Where are you writing from? CL</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nunh-huh, where are you writing from as well? CL</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe Geni refers to the "national" in "National Institutes of Health". Both NIH and NCAM are American, not international. Europe, where homeopathy originated and still has appreciable adherents, is not likely to confuse "allopathy" with "medicine". I write from the U.S., where "allopath" is not used by "mainstream" physicians to refer to themselves, except insofar as they are misinformed or extremely informal in their usage. The term is primarily used by those who in some way seek to characterize <i>some</i> unitary thing to which "alternative medicine" is the "alternative". - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:40, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NCAM is certainly worth citing as an example of what those who have professional interests in alternative medicine mean when they say "allopath". It's not a place to cite as an <i>example</i> of "mainstream" physicians calling <i>themselves</i> allopaths. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:10, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

NCCAM is displayed as a center under the authority of the director. This is also reflected in a diagram of the organizational structure that puts NCCAM under the direct authority of the NIH director. If these individual offices are not part of the NIH then the NIH only consists of the director's office and has a very small buudget. - (unsigned)</dd>

<dd>So far, three sources of evidence have been presented that the term is used by mainstream physicians to refer to themselves: (1) A major health institute uses the term on their website, (2) Over a hundred scientific journal articles use the term some of them from prominent journals such as the Archives of Internal Medicine, or the Journal of Geriatrics. (3) Two people in this discussion have stated anecdotal evidence that they have heard it being used by respected physicians. What more evidence do you require to show that it is a common term used by a variety of people that refers to mainstream medical practice? (MR)</dd>

Here is one journal article that uses the term right there in the abstract (Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 53(1):136-140). If doctors and other medical practicioners do not use the term then please tell me why an article with 3 out of 5 authors as M.D.s would use the term to refer to their own medical system, and have it be published in a major peer-reviewed medical journal. - (unsigned)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misusing dictionary definitions</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>I'm disappointed. First, you argue that dictionaries are what "collate" these kind of statistics. Then you quote an entirely out of date definition. If you were arguing it was from the unabridged version, that may in fact, be different. But you are quoting a definition from 1971 from the Compact definition. The online 2005 Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary has the following definition for allopathy:noun "the treatment of disease by conventional means, i.e. with drugs having effects opposite to the symptoms. Often contrasted with HOMEOPATHY." [<a href="http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;field-12668446=allopathy&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;field-12668446=allopathy&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] which is their current definition. They do not have your 1971 definition. CL</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dictionaries are indeed the authorities. But the online dictionary you cite is obviously incomplete, or incompletely cited. The 1971 edition is "compact" because it is photographically reduced, not because it is incomplete. The online "compact" edition states that it defines 145,000 words, which is less than the 1971 edition. Further, words rarely have but one definition, and definitions do not "replace" prior definitions: new meanings are added, old ones are not subtracted. And the 2003 Merriam Webster (as previously cited) contains the meaning, so the issue is not dates or changes but completeness. You are picking and choosing among definitions and declaring those you don't like obsolete, which they are not. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:35, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your response. I also write from the U.S. At Harvard Medical School, which is a prominent conventional US medical school, "allopathy" is a term commonly used among physicians. Although I cannot speak to what the 'average' physician would say in the US (and I don't know at all about in other countries), allopathy has come up again and again by rather well-informed Harvard professors, using the term allopathy. Its origin is strange in that it was coined by someone outside the field. However, it is being used commonly by the physicians I interact with at a very conventional institution in the U.S. CL</p>
<dl>
<dd>When it becomes a common enough usage to supplant the primary definition in dictionaries, we can make what you perceive as the "Harvard" usage our primary definition.

<p>As defined in Webster's New World Dictionary, allopathy is the "treatment of disease by remedies that produce effects different from or opposite to those produced by the disease: loosely applied to the general practice of medicine today, but in strict usage opposed to homeopathy." I think then that this definition is fair. CL</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I read it the first time. The definition you wanted to make primary is not primary, but secondary and "loose".

"The term allopathy, however, is not applicable to the modern practice of "nonhomeopathic" medicine. Whole drug classes, such as antibiotics, do not act in the manner of "opposites." Furthermore, the botanical schools of the 19th century used allopathy as a disagreeable term of contrast. They claimed the captured warmth and life-sustaining properties of the botanicals that they administered, whereas allopathy carried all of the derogatory implications associated with its use of cold minerals from the dark earth (such as mercurial agents) [10,15,16]. This, too, has now lost its applicability in a world that uses agents created by bioengineers and genetic manipulation." - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:18, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can sort of see treating hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting it's synthesis as a treatment in the sense Hahnemann thought, though I'd be surprised if there were any homeopaths that gave homeopathic doses of cholesterol to treat hypercholesterolemia. Hahnemann, however, worked in the domain of symptoms. With hypercholesterolemia not causing symptoms it is outside of Hahnemann's domain. The comment on an antibiotic is precious. It really incorporates scientific discoveries of bacteria causing disease. In homepathy you would look for a substance that simulated the disease symptoms and give it in homeopathic doses. Allopathic would mean to give something that caused opposite symptoms. Of couse, antibiotics given alone don't cause any symptoms. The fact that you give something that doesn't cause symptoms but still cures the disesea is the notable thing here. The guiding priciple is not to use symptom effects of the drugs to guide choices, but the antibacterial effect in choosing the antibiotic. This is why applying the allopathic concept to Western medicine doesn't make sense . That said, a lot of people use allopathic medicine to mean conventional Western medical practice, regardless of the history of the term. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 16:07, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have updated the definition to a more recent and authoritative source. The previous definition was from a NEW WORLD Webster's edition from 1997. The new definition is from the latest edition of the Oxford edition representing the international english usage. The new definition is also consistent with the latest copy of the Webster's Dictionary that says allopathy is "the treatment of a disease by using remedies whose effects differ from those produced by that disease. This is the principle of mainstream medical practice as opposed to that of homeopathy." This suggests that the usage of the term has change significantly in the last 8 years. (MR)</p>

<p>Cisplatin is an anti-neoplastic agent--cancer is an uncontrolled overgrowth of cells, cisplatin induces apoptosis. That is using an opposing form of treatment.</p>
<p>To say that no Western system of medicine has any basis in the principle of allopathy is ignoring the history you so vociferously argue for. Whether modern-day physicians like it or not, we have evolved (thank goodness quite a lot) from the barber-surgeons/regulars/allopaths of the 18th and 19th century. There is nothing in any of the definitions mentioned that speaks of a "magical" nature as the basis of allopathy (simply that it is the treatment of disease by opposites). The treatment model for conventional medicine often takes the form of this "opposing" action. If the immune system is overagressive (e.g. lupus), we suppress it. If the sinuses are overreacting, we give anti-histamines. If the yeast are overwhelming, we killl them. If the cholesterol is high, we lower it. If oxygen supply is inadequate, we provide supplemental oxygen. CL</p>

<dd>No Western system is based on the "principle" of allopathy: such a "principle" is the imagining of Hahneman, not of those who actually practice the medicine he called "allopathic".

<p>If one defines the opposite of health as overreactive histamine release, or an overactive immune sytem, or an overwhelming bacterial infection, and then one uses or designs drugs to counteract that (reduce histamine release or suppress the immune system, or kill bacteria) that is an opposing effect.

There is an attempt to treat by singling out the problem, and negating, reducing, or modifying it in some way. - CL</p>

<p>When I treat a patient, it is with (my) knowledge of the evidence for therapies, my understanding of patho/physiology, and most importantly, the clinical situation that presents itself. Many treatments have benefit for many conditions. However, we need to decide on specific treatments based on our patients needs and desires. If a medication works in 80% of the population, that is wonderful for 80% of the population. If it doesn't work for my patient, I will try to find another medication or therapy, that works for them, that alleviates their symptoms, improves their health, or cures their disease, but decisions can only be made in response to what happens with the patient. If a specific intervention does not produce the desired (opposite or modified effect), others will have to be tried. CL</p>

</dl>
<p>I agree with CL here. There are different ways of treating disease. Homeopathy uses medicines that have similar effects to the disease. For example, if a patient has an allergic reaction, then an allopathic doctor would prescribe a medicine to reduce the inflammatory response. However, a homeopath might actually take the allergic agent and dilute it multiple times in water and administer it to the patient. The idea is that this will stimulate the body to overcome the allergy. That is why allopathic medicine is based on treatments that have opposite effects and homeopathic medicine is based on similar effects. On the other hand, traditonal chinese medicine is based on promoting balance in the body. A chinese medical doctor might prescribe herbs to modulate the immune response so that the patient would no longer have an extreme reaction to the allergen. (MR)</p>

The American Medical Association (AMA) also uses the term in a non-disparaging way: "Mean per capita debt for 2003 allopathic graduates excluding students without loans..."

But the term does not seem to be used only in the US. The Royal College of Physicians uses it in England as well: "Complementary and allopathic schools of medicine share many of the same central values.

<dd>If such usage becomes sufficiently widespread, a reputable dictionary will pick it up and include it in their definitions. In the meantime, Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate includes only the definition "relating to or being a system of medicine that aims to combat disease by using remedies (as drugs or surgery) which produce effects that are different from or incompatible with those of the disease being treated" which of course is not the same as "non-alternative medicine". - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What exactly is wrong with the term allopathy?</span></h2>
<p>I really don't understand here why the term allopathy is so controversial. I see it as a neutral label to refer to mainstream western medical practice. Some people may dislike the term. However, that is how it is commonly used not just by critics of mainstream medicine but also by doctors themselves (see <a href="http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/969989270.html" class="external free" title="http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/969989270.html" rel="nofollow">http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/969989270.html</a> among many others).</p>
<p>The current usage of the term is different than the roots of the term. We can mention both in the article. However, the section on current usage should reflect the fact that it is commonly used in a neutral manner.</p>

<dd>I've looked the word up in the actual current version of the OED, and placed it in the article: as I predicted, the definition has not changed much, and has certainly not been "replaced". "Some people's" belief that the principle of opposites is a tenet of medicine is, unfortunately, baseless, there being no text book of medicine in which such a supposedly fundamental principle is in fact delineated, so these people's belief can't be given equal weight to actual practice. One will look in vain for a major textbook of medicine in which the word "allopath" is even indexed, or allopathy is referenced. Nor do sources concerned with the history of medicine add any support for your view. In the <i>Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine</i>, there is no entry for "allopathy". Under homeopathy we find, on p. 605 ff., "From [Hahnemann's] single experiment with cinchona, he laid down the axiom in this essay [in 1796] that to cure a disease physicians needed to employ a 'medicine which is able to produce another very similar artificial disease'. This he called the principle of <i>similia similibus curantur</i> (like cures like). Thus, once the effect of drugs were tested and recorded, physicians could compare the observable symptoms of a given disease with the consciously reported effects of the drugs, and select the most appropriate one, which Hahnemann would argue, somehow had the effect of both substituting for the natural disease and then disappearing. Not surprisingly, Hahnemann interpreted the introduction of vaccination by Edward Jenner in 1798 as a confirmation of the law of similars." The first time Hahnemann intimated that others practiced an opposite principle was in his Organon of Ration Medicine, 1810. Hahnemann believed "basic scientists were under a delusion in their search for a material cause of disease. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/....html" title="...">...</a> To him, the cause of the disease was immaterial or spiritual and dynamic, and the belief in disease being cause by a thing led to faulty thinking with respect to therapeutics. By conceiving disease a 'morbid matter', physicians had administered depleting remedies on the doctrine of <i>contraria contrariis curantur</i> to 'disencumber' these from the bloodstream through phlebotomies, or from the digestive tract through purging and cathartic medicines, etc. ...<b>Although he differentiated the various accepted competing approaches to drug therapy then extant, Hahnemann gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it 'allopathy'. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers or other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing 'school' of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients."</b> (my emphasis). Your notion that relieving symptoms is "allopathic" is unsupported and ahistorical: Hahnemann's 'sameness' or 'difference' was judged in terms of the effects of medications on the <b>healthy</b> subject, not in terms of their effects on disease or symptoms in <b>unhealthy</b> subjects. Hahnemann's goal, after all, was to relieve disease! The principle under which medicine actuallly operates is to discern and treat underlying causes of disease - a concept that Hahnemann indeed opposed, but which was not the one that he chose to name his foes after. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:48, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In regard to the term "allopathic," it was widely used by the mainstream physicians starting the in the 19th century. Plus, how can you possibly say the term is not being used when we have pointed out its use at a Center of the National Institutes of Health? This term is being used to refer to mainstream medicine. In fact this use of the term is stated explicitly in the Webster's Encarta Edition Dictionary (2004), where allopathy is defined as "the treatment of a disease by using remedies whose effects differ from those produced by that disease. This is the principle of mainstream medical practice as opposed to that of homeopathy." Look it up yourself. It is stated right in the Webster's dictionary (2004 Encarta Edition), therefore quite a few people believe that mainstream medicine uses treatments opposite to the disease. IT IS A Common USAGE! In fact, in your own definition it states that allopathy means the use of opposites and that it is commonly used to refer to mainstream medicine. If the use of opposite treatments tp characterize mainstream medicine is common enough to make it into the dictionary then it should be respected in this article. - (unsigned)</dd>

<dd>I think you will have to consult the current Oxford English Dictionary off-line. The OED is clearly a better source than "Webster's Encarta Edition Dictionary". Unfortunately for Encarta's accuracy, their assertion (as you report it) that allopathy is a "principle" of mainstream medical practice is simply wrong. Fortunately, one can concult a textbook of medicine to determine what principles underlie the practice of medicine, and none of them mention "allopathy" as such as principle. That fact has been added back to the article. And of course "my" (that is, the Oxford English Dictionary's) definition says allopathy means the use of opposites, because that's how Hahnemann defined it when he created the idea. It doesn't, however, say that those labeled "allopaths" by Hahnemann actually practiced by that principle. And no particular meaning has been left out of the article. Your misrepresentation of NCCAM as speaking for the entire NIH is growing tiresome. That a center devoted to "Alternative Medicine" uses the term "allopath" is irrelevant with regard to how often the term is used by conventional physicians to describe themselves. Where's the reference for the "fact" that 19th century pharmacies labelled "all of their products" as "allopathic" or "homeopathic"? . As long as you've added the etymology, I've corrected it: the form "allopathy" is based on form-association with such word pairs as philosophie, philosophe, or astronomie, astronome; the analogy is "merely apparent and opposed to the etymology" - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:55, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All types of medicine (homopathic, allopathic, naturopathic, etc.) use treatments that are designed to cure the illness. The question is what kinds of treatments are chosen. I think in general allopathic medicine chooses treatments that act specifically to counteract the symptoms or root of a disease. I see other types of medicine as acting more indirectly. Your example of rabies treatment is a good example of a conventional treatment that does not act opposite to the disease. However, I wouldn't call it isopathy, because that would imply in acts in the same way as the disease. I see it mediating through the immune system to make the immune system combat the disease.</dd>

I'm not saying it is a unbreakable law of medicine, I'm just saying it is a general rule that is true for the vast majority of cases. I also think a principle of allopathic medicine is choosing treatments based on scientific evidence, but I could point to a number of exceptions to this principle.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Look at Mosby's Medical Dictionary</span></h2>
<p>In regard to the use of the term allopathic in medical textbooks, try looking at Mosby's Medical Dictionary, sixth edition. This is used as a required textbook in medical schools (for example, see <a href="http://www.bookmarc.com/1styear.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.bookmarc.com/1styear.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookmarc.com/1styear.htm</a>). It defines an allopathic physician as "A physician who treats disease and injury with active interventions such as medical and surgical treatments, intended to bring about effects opposite of those produced by the disease or injury. Almost all practicing physicians in the United States are allopathic."</p>
<p>This definition is very similar to the entry in the Complete Medical Encyclopedia published by the American Medical Association. It defines allopathy as "A system of treating disease by inducing a second condition that is incompatible with or antagonistic to the disease being treated. This term was invented by homeopath Samuel Hahnemann to refer to traditional medicine which is practiced by all doctors with the medical degree MD." Keep in mind this is published by the organization that supervises the issuance of the M.D. degree.</p>
<p>Another common medical school textbook, Stedman's Medical Dictionary (27th Edition), defines allopath as "A traditional medical physician as distinguished from eclectic or homeopathic practicioners.</p>
<p>So, now there are three mainstream medical references that refer to allopaths as conventional physicians. - (unsigned)</p>

<dd>Well, I can only speak from personal experience. At Harvard Medical School, the core of the medical curriculum is a problem-based learning system whereby we are given case-studies written by Harvard professors. We discuss the case studies in small groups. No books are required for these discussions. However, many books are recommended for reference books. One of these is Stedman's. In one of the case studies, the term allopath is used in reference to a conventional medical physician. By your definition, I guess Harvard would not use textbooks in their core curriculum. However, it is evident that Harvard Medical School students have required reading that include the term "allopath" in reference to conventional physicians, and they have recommended reference books that define the term in this manner. I suspect that the term is used in more conventional textbooks as well, but I don't have the time to review a variety of textbooks. My copy of Harrison's is in storage at the moment and I can't access it. - (unsigned)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I say that conventional medicine as presented in textbooks has no basis in any "principle of allopathy", which ought to be uncontroversial, because it is certainly correct. All you need do to disprove the statement is to find a single textbook that presents medicine as based on allopathy. Then we could change from "no" to "only one". You are right, handouts are not textbooks, and careless statements by Harvard professors won't alter the fact that medicine which follows an allopathic principle would not be conventional medicine. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 21:42, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that's just plain wrong. Meaning and etymology are not the same, and many words "mean" things not implied by their etymology, just as many other words do <i>not</i> "mean" things implied by their etymology. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:16, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is also the way it is used in the Medical Textbook "Bonica's Management of Pain," which is considered the gold standard textbook for the medical management of pain (see <a href="http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/Book/697.jsp?top=2&amp;mid=3&amp;bottom=7&amp;subsection=11" class="external free" title="http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/Book/697.jsp?top=2&amp;mid=3&amp;bottom=7&amp;subsection=11" rel="nofollow">http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/Book/697.jsp?top=2&amp;mid=3&amp;bottom=7&amp;subsection=11</a>). In the introduction to Chapter 81, the authors state, "The challenge for allopathic physicians is to provide compassionate health care that encompasses not only the search for a structural lesion, but also consideration of the patient as a human being. We believe that this part provides a comprehensive overview of the treatments employed by pain management specialists." That sounds like two principles of allopathic medicine to me - but there are a lot more than just two. - (unsigned)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Playing a word game hunt</span></h2>
<p>You're playing a word hunt game. The fact remains, no textbook of medicine teaches that "conventional" medicine is based on the principle of choosing drugs based on their effects in a healthy person being the opposite of a disease. The reason they do not teach this is because it is not so. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 01:11, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you that medical textbooks do not discuss medicine in terms of a principle of opposites. However, I have pointed out several medical encyclopedias and dictionaries that do use this terminology. So, if you want to say that it this principle is wrong then please give a reference with as much authority as a medical encyclopedia published by the American Medical Association.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really care about whether a principle of opposites enters into this article or not. What I do care about is that the article states that "allopathy" is commonly used to refer to conventional medicine. That is its common usage. I have given a dozen references that use the term in this manner. To me, "principles of allopathy" means the same thing as "principles of conventional medicine." Therefore, when you state that no medical textbook mentions principles of allopathy, you are saying that no medical textbook mentions any medical principles. - unsigned</dd>

<dd>Yes, we know you don't like the dictionary definitions, and prefer those used by the least authoritative sources on language. If you <i>agree</i>, why did you dispute it for so long? Why do you still persist, in the very next sentence, in claiming medical encyclopedias claim that physicians operate by a principle of opposites when they do not? And the "principle of opposites" is the definition and etymology of the word, so you <i>ought</i> to care whether it's in the article. And no, "allopath" is only used commonly as a synonym for conventional medicine by enthusiasts of alternative medicine—like the NCCAM reference you are so fond of. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 01:52, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me address your points one by one. You say I "prefer the least authoritative sources on language." I really don't know where this is coming from. I think the Oxford English Dictionary is the most authoritative source, and the Webster's Encarta Edition is the second best source on international english. I prefer the concise edition or the on-line edition of the OED because these are up to date. The second edition is 16 years old. Several sources have said the usage of the word allopathy has changed significantly in the last decade. Therefore, I see the OED second edition as comprehensive but out of date. Furthermore, the OED lists the website as the most up-to-date source which is in the process of being incorporated into the third edition. What do you think is the most authoritative source on language and why?</p>
<p>I agree that textbooks do not usually discuss medicine in terms of opposites. I do not agree that NO textbook discusses medicine in terms of opposites. Furthermore, the lack of a discussion about a rule of opposites does not prove whether it is or is not a principle of medicine. I have provided three mainstream medical reference books that say allopathy is the same as mainstream medicine and that it uses treatments opposite to the disease. I quoted a medical encyclopedia published by the American Medical Association that stated mainstream medicine uses treatments that are opposite to the disease.</p>
<p>You say that only proponents of alternative medicine use the term. Please tell me then, why the term is defined as mainstream medicine in an encyclopedia published by the American Medical Association. Do you think the AMA is a proponent of alternative medicine?</p>
<p>Regarding the word "allopathy," I believe the common usage of the word is "conventional medicine." I have given a dozen references that use the term in this manner. I haven't seen a single reference by you or someone else who uses the term to refer to a law of opposites other than to discuss the roots of the word. Neither the OED concise edition, nor the Second Edition mentions the principle of opposites. I simply do not believe anyone uses the word in this manner.</p>
<p>It is very common for the etymology of the word to be very different than the common usage, especially in medicine which has changed dramatically since most of the words were defined. The roots of the word are historically interesting but they are different than the way the word is commonly used. - unsigned</p>
<p>Yes, you prefer an online dictionary to a printed one, and an incomplete version of the OED to the full one. Thus you prefer the unauthorative version. You have not supplied any example of any textbook which teaches medicine according to a principle of opposites, and seem to have no basis for your belief that any textbook of medicine does so. I did not say "only" proponents of alternative medicine use the term: however, they are clearly more likely to. Unfortunately for your belief about the "common usage" of "allopathy", the complete versions of the dictionaries you cite mark this as an occasional or substandard use. And yes, the meanings of words change, and when they do, the new meaning will enter the dictionary as a preferred use. This has not yet happened with regard to "allopathy". - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:54, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is clear that the OED 2nd edition is more comprehensive but the OED Concise Edition is more up-to-date. The Concise Edition (11th) is a direct update to the 2nd Edition, and it is published 16 years later (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise_Oxford_Dictionary" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise_Oxford_Dictionary" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise_Oxford_Dictionary</a>). Therefore, it makes sense to me that the concise edition reflects common usage better than the 2nd Edition. Do you have a reference that indicates otherwise?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of which edition you look at, allopathy is defined as referring to conventional medicine. I do not see any mention of the rule of opposites in any edition of the OED. So, based on all the definitions given, "principles of allopathy" refers to "principles of conventional medicine."

<dd>Is it a revelation to you that words have more than one meaning, and that which meaning is intended is implied by context? I agree that "allopathy" is used, as the definition says by some - mostly those who oppose conventional medicine in some way - in a loose sense to mean "conventional medicine". But in the more accurate sense, "allopathy" is a principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce the opposite effect of the disease when given to a healthy human. No school of medicine has ever operated on such a principle: however, that is the way Hahnemann chose to caricature the basis of the practices of his chosen enemies. The phrase "principle of allopathy" will always invoke the meaning imparted to the word when Hahnemann invented it. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 18:15, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h3>
<p>The opening paragraph of the article contains statements asserting the views of a broad class of people not those of the author(s). It alledges that this broad class of people use the term allopathy as a term of disparagement. This is factually inaccurate. The term allopathy is not a term of disparagement. It is a term used to identify a practice and to differentiate it from other practices.</p>
<p>Some members of this broad and ill defined group of other practitioners do speak ill of those who practice allopathic medicine with disdain. That does not make the term a term of disparagement. And it makes the two sentences factually wrong.</p>
<p>Similarly, many people who practice mainstream medicine speak ill of the broad class of people who practice or even who only use alternative medicine and therapies. This does not make the use of the categorization "alternative medicine" disparaging. The disparging is in the act of the persons doing it, not in the category name.</p>
<p>The sole difference between these two examples is that conventionl medical practice did not choose a name for themselves as a class. I believe it was because they did not that the name allopathy was created - to class as a group those who practice conventional medical treatments, from that which was being set off at the time - homeopathy.</p>
<p>The name chosen was not chosen as a name of derision such as was done by some fringe members of the mainstream view in labeling anyone who practices things outside that view as quacks.</p>
<p>The name chosen was respectful.</p>
<p>As written the article is not written in a neutral point of view.</p>
<p>The opening paragraph needs to have the two offending and unsupported assertions removed.</p>
<p>I believe it is important to maintain the idea that there is disagreement and that mainstream medical practitioners feel put upon by having a label applied. That is more than adequately covered later in the entry.Farseer 15:30, 8 January 2006 (UTC)Farseer</p>
<p>On the contrary, intentionally misidentifying the basis of the practices of medicine as "allopathy" is quite clearly a device used by some who practice alternative medicine, and is the actual origin of the term. Don't try to rewrite the history of the term to conform to the history you'd have preferred it to have. Read the references, and stop calling the assertions unsupported.

<p>The term may have historically been pejorative, but it is certainly embraced by the medical community now. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) is the accrediting body for residencies. On their website they use the term allopathic to describe their own programs: "The ACGME is a private, non-profit organization that accredits all the allopathic residency programs in the United States and promotes quality education for residents." (<a href="http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/medStudent/medSt_FAQ.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/medStudent/medSt_FAQ.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/medStudent/medSt_FAQ.asp</a>) The American Association of Medical Colleges also refers to the type of medicine they teach as allopathic: "the American Medical College Application Service, a centralized service thru which a person can apply to almost all of the US Allopathic Medical Schools." (<a href="http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/2004/glossary.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/2004/glossary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/2004/glossary.htm</a>). The American Medical Association (AMA) also uses the term: "Mean per capita debt for 2003 allopathic graduates excluding students without loans..." (<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/5349.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/5349.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/5349.html</a>). But the term does not seem to be used only in the US. The Royal College of Physicians uses it in England as well: "Complementary and allopathic schools of medicine share many of the same central values. " (<a href="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/clinicalmedicine/0206_nov_conf1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/clinicalmedicine/0206_nov_conf1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/clinicalmedicine/0206_nov_conf1.htm</a>). Reguardless of the history of the term or any dictionary editor's opinion on the matter, the word is clearly embraced by the authorities in the profession.</p>
<p>This entire discussion is absurd and completely misleading. Any claims that the term "allopthic" is in any way disparaging to MDs are entirely undermined by the above links. The MDs themselves--and importantly their leadership--use the term regularly. Any discussion of it being pejorative in the main article is misleading to those who have no prior experience with the term, and is retrograde to the goal of wikipedia: dissemination of accurate information. THOSE WHO INSIST OTHERWISE NEED TO ASK THEMSELVES WHY THE AMA, ACGME, AND AAMC ALL USE THE TERM TO DESCRIBE THE KIND OF MEDICINE THEY PRACTICE.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just because some authoritative people use the term without any ill intent doesn't mean others don't. As a somewhat extreme example, take the word <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer.html" title="Queer">queer</a>. It's used as a pejorative by a lot of people, while others use it in a neutral way. I also think that dictionaries are probably the best source for word meaning, so as to avoid inadequate sampling and original research. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 20:31, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like the wording of the opening sentence now. Good job editing it. I think it shows both sides (although I am still not convinced that there is a good case for it being pejorative). Hopefully the new edit will end some of the debate. &lt;not signed&gt;</p>
<p>Really, editing should be on the basis of at least <i>some</i> data rather than pontification. Some problems I'm fixing:</p>
<ul>
<li>start with the dictionary's meaning, which is historical, first.</li>
<li>What alternative treatments are called allopathic anywhere but Wikipedia?</li>
<li>Galen didn't practice, or popularize, allopathy, and it wasn't practiced during the Middle Ages. Allopathy didn't exist until Hahnemann made it up. No system of medicine has <i>ever</i> been based on the principle Hahnemann invented and attributed</li>
</ul>
<p>to his foes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahnemann's use of the term was mistated.</li>
<li>No one believes "the symptoms are the disease"</li>
<li>protractors measure angles.</li>
<li>Frankly, by rejecting the dictionary meaning of the term in favor of citing random uses on the web, the article had become an illiterate mishmosh of opinion. (And an encyclopedia of embarassing misattributions, misconceptions and misspellings). It is hopefully now less so. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:54, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we are making good progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>I hope the current version will meet with approval from both sides of the arguement. Since the article openly discusses the conflict without presenting bias, it doesn't seem like it needs the neutrality flag at the top. What do you think?</li>
<li>I should hardly consider official publications of the AMA, ACGME, and AAMC in the form of digital information citation of "random uses on the web."</li>
<li>There should be no exclusion of a dictionary definition. The OED is appropriate no matter what. Presentation of various uses is not mutually exclusive of dictionary quotation. Are there copyright considerations with quoting the OED? If not I think we should include it.</li>
<li>I think we should come up with some better sources on current antagonistic use. On one hand we have official M.D. regulatory organizations using it in a positive sense, and on the other hand we have only a couple of personal essays discussing its possible negative connotations. There must be some kind of more weighty source for an antagonistic usage--perhaps from a homeopathic or other alternative medicine source.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we are too, but homeopaths will never agree to remove the neutrality tag. (P.S. it helps if you sign your comments with ~~~~ (four tildes) so we know where one person's comments end and another begins). The website quotes are actually quite random... someone scoured their websites looking for them, they are not used in a systematic way. As to whether it's antagonistic, you can see from those who want so desperately to substitute their definitions for the dictionary's here that it's a primarily "alternative medicine" usage - which makes sense as no one else really has any need to make a distinction between "conventional" medicine and medicine.<a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that the dictionary definition is very important, because no matter how good the usage citations are, we are not equipped to do a proper usage survey. The citations show that some people use the term in a certain way, but they do not establish an accepted meaning of the term, because of problems in biased and inadequate sampling.</p>
<p>I don't think there's any problem with quoting the OED as long as it's short and properly cited.</p>

<p>Also, on a personal note, I am rather curious about NickelShoe and Nunh-huh's interest in this article, since we seem (at the moment) to be the most involved. I was actually surprised when I first read it. As a medical student in the hospitals I hear the word used all the time (by doctors, nurses, everyone) so I assumed everyone used it. I did actually know that it was originally used by the homeopaths, but I have honestly never heard of it being used pejoratively. Nunh-Huh in particular seems to take serious issue with the word, which suggests some kind of history with it. I am totally intrigued (and this is coming from actual interest...not antagonism). What experiences have you two (or anyone who wants to chime in) had with it being a negative thing? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 07:13, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Goodness, we have "alternative medical practitioners" using it every day on Wikipedia in application to those who have offended them by espousing an "orthodox" view. Take a look, for example at <a href="../../../m/u/m/Talk%7EMumps_9761.html" title="Talk:Mumps">talk:mumps</a>, or nearly any of the vaccination pages.

<p>Hi Nunh-huh. I just re-read the article and it is still misleading. The problem is that the article over represents antagonism toward M.D.s and underrepresents the use every-day of the term from inside the M.D. world. The article sounds like the term is irrefutably negative, with a couple of minor, incidental, positive uses as a rare exception. Obviously this is misleading. Literally all I do all day is medicine and I was totally unaware that a negative association even exsists. While I registered for the MCAT I had to check the "allopthathic" box to show that I was applying to M.D. schools (other kinds of medicine also use the MCAT...podiatric, osteopathic, etc.). When I filled out my applications, I had to go through the self-descrined "allopathic" MCAS service, as opposed to going through the podiatric or osteopathic services. All the way through the entire process the M.D. world described itself as allopathic. Now that I am in medical school, the M.D.s in the hospitals constatnly use the term allopathic to differentiate themselves from everyone else. In school we had some lectures on the history of medicine, so I knew that the word had been coined by Hahnemann, but until a couple of days ago I had never heard ANY innuendo that the word might be negative. So now imagine yourself in my place. Your entire experience in medicine (which you do all day every day) tells you that there is no such thing as a negative meaning for the term "allopathic." You see it used all the time by the M.D. official sources, and your M.D. teachers. Then suddenly you come across this website where non-M.D. editors are making this arguement that the word "allopathic" is not used in conventional medicine! They are insisting that it is used almost entirely alternative and other spurious sources. Wouldn't you object? Wouldn't you see such claims as absurd? So, Nunh-huh, as one of the main proponents of the antagonistic meaning of the term allopathic, I think you are best equipped to make changes in the article which will more accurately describe its current usage. Definitions from official sources are important (OED, or whoever), and examples of current use by both sides are important. But most of all, neutrality and accuracy (not agenda-pushing) are critical. Having said all this, go back and read the article. Every time any mention is made of allopathic sources using the term, there are lots of disclaimers intended to make it clear that these allopathic sources are an extreme minority and are probably not reliable (which is silly since they are all M.D. organizations). I have no issue with clear demonstration of current pejorative use, and obviously the term's non-M.D. origin is essential, but you have got to show with less bias the use from within the self-described allopathic world. Rather than just insisting that it is bad, show sources. Give examples of pejorative use. Give more examples of M.D. objecting to being called allopathic. In summary here are my requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>make the article be about the definition of the word. Discussion of its disputed neutrality must be secondary.</li>
<li>include a medeical dictionary definition like Steadman's (or Doerling or whatever as long as it is a well-known source). I have the 4th edition of Steadman's, copyrighted 2005 (a gift from the AMA when I joined). Under allopathic, the only thing it says is "Relating to allopahy." The allopathy definition is the very next one (bottom of page 50 in my edition) and reads as follows: "A theraputic system in which a disease is treated by producing a second condition thiat is incompatible with or antagonistic to the first. Cf. homeopathy. SYN heteropathy (2). [allo _ G. pathos, suffering]</li>
<li>just give the dictionary definition--don't comment on how it supports or detracts from either side. (I think it describes conventional medicine just fine but for neutrality's sake I think we should leave all commentary out)</li>
<li>be more neutral--show both sides of the story WITHOUT discaimers</li>
<li>show solid sources that back up arguments of it being antagonistic. Insinsting that it is so does not make it so. Show proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I think that we have been making progress. Let's keep it up.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 18:03, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Steadman corresponds to the current article. I'm all for adding definitions from reputable dictionaries. They've been added before (by me) and removed. All the definitions note that the primary use of the term was by Hahnemann (to denote a school of medicine that has never existed except in his mind) and some note that the term is sometimes applied to non-alternative medicine today. All of which the article also notes. So no, I don't think the article is misleading, and I think the attempts by (usually anonymous) foes of non-alternative medicine to get it to be misleading really ought to be resisted. And, finally, I'm pretty sure, if you're in medical school in 2005, that I have a bit more experience than you&lt;g&gt;. You may also have limited exposure to "alternate" practitioners. So you should keep in mind that your experience may be of limited use here, and skewed toward recent usage, and go with what the sources say. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:04, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi nunh-huh</p>
<ul>
<li>You said I should go with what the sources say. Do you mean sources like the AMA, the ACGME, the AAMC, and my attending physicians at the hospital? I think you are exactly right--I will go with what they say. (I know...I can be a little cheeky sometimes.) One of my best friends is a resident in emergency medicine, and tonight I showed him the article. He laughed.</li>
<li>On a more productive note, do you think the Steadman's definition I quoted earlier would cause a war if inserted into the text? I think it is pretty neutral and should be fine by everyone, but you never know.</li>
<li>Also, I am still interested in your medical background. You don't sound like a doctor but you do sound like you have some kind of medical interest. Do you work in health care? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 05:01, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The source for what a word means is a dictionary. The AMA knows its limits. (As should a resident in emergency medicine...) As for Steadmans, insert it by all means. There's no guarantee it won't provoke a bizarre response, but by all means let's see. I'm a board certified internal medicine physician specializing in infectious diseases, and was in practice before there was such a thing as AIDS, so if you don't think I sound like a doctor, you need to adjust your view of what a doctor sounds like&lt;g&gt;. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 05:35, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm going to agree again that dictionaries are the most important source for word meaning, because that's their job--it's not like they can't Google a term either, but they check usage more extensively. It's a lot more reliable and a lot less original research-y. I agree that we can use these others as examples of non-pejorative use, but not as proof of any kind of signficance of that usage (which requires stats)--that's what dictionaries are for. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 06:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I just added three dictionary definitions: Steadman's (from my print copy), the OED (as quoted by Nunh-huh in Feb 2005), and the on-line edition of the Compact Oxford English Dictionary (which I copied and pasted from their site). I will try to get more definitions. I think inclusion is the only way to get consensus.</li>
<li>I am going to our library today to get definitions from more sources (Dorland's, etc). If we have a list of hard sources showing a range of definitions it will serve to A) demonstrate conflicting definitions/usages and B) make everyone feel like they are being heard. I don't see how the homeopaths can object as long as they get to have a definition (from a reputable source).</li>
<li>Are there any major objections to starting out with such a commentary-free list of definitions?</li>
<li>Nunh-huh, I am particularly astonished at your insistence that the term is not used by conventional physicians given your knowledge of medicine. Have you never noticed its use by the AMA/ACGME/AAMC? (Aside, I wish I could hear about your experience in I.D. through the 80's when HIV/AIDS exploded. You must have been in the middle of everything. I can only imagine how exciting/frightening it must have been.)<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 15:29, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Definitions</span></h3>
<p>The article really needs to lead with a single sentence explanation of what allopathic medicine is, then explain variations in usage. We need to try and find a fairly neutral definition to lead with, and I think the one we had, which now leads the "history" section would be fine. But bare quotes are evil, and so are articles that don't have introductions. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 15:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again. Here are my objections:</p>
<ul>
<li>One neutral definion that everyone likes is going to be impossible to find. The one which now leads the history section is not from a dictionary...it is one we just made up. We must admit that we hardly out-rank the OED.</li>
<li>An introduction would be nice but, again, one that is truly neutral and does not comment on a preferred definition is (again) going to be nearly impossible. I won't allow anything that suggests that it is not in regular use by conventional medicine, and Nunh-huh won't stand for anything that does. So I think the best solution is not to comment. Just let the contrasting definitions from reliable sources speak for themselves. They demonstrate beautifully that the conflict between me and Nunh-huh is (apparantly) a widespread conflict. Even the authorities differ. In particular, having two Oxford definitions side by side that say nearly exactly opposite things is an exquisite example of differing use. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 15:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, including a range of definitions will circumvent the "my dictionary is better than your dictionary" game which has plagued this discussion in the past (see above). <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 16:00, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow...breaking news.</p>
<ul>
<li>I just looked it up in several dictionaries in my med school's library and I was honestly surprised to find so much discord. Tabor's clearly says that the term allopathy is erroniously used to describe conventional medicine to distinguish it from homeopathy. But the 27ed of Steadman's flatly defines it as regular medicine and the traditional form of medical practice. It also calls an allopath a traditional medical physician.</li>
<li>Clearly there is good support for the arguement that it is a questionable term as well as good support for the arguement that it is not. The best way to show this is to show the sources.</li>

<dd>I disagree. What you're calling a "primary meaning" is merely a connotation, and I believe the fact that I used the word "applied to" rather than "describing" is pretty neutral. What you're talking about is the contexts in which the term is used, not the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extension_%28semantics%29.html" title="Extension (semantics)">extension</a> of the word.

<dd>No, you misunderstand me. The primary meaning is historical. All other applications, of the word such as extension to a hypothetically similar group of physicians with an imagined similarity to "regular physicians" of Hahnemann's time are necessarily secondary, regardless of which is currently more prevalent. It is the dogged question of which is more prevalent that is the actual question here, not which is primary. As I haven't actually added the primary meaning to the introduction, perhaps you'll comment more specifically on it. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 01:29, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The OED's 2nd Ed. was 1971. If you feel like a "special project", your medical school library most likely has institutional access to the online OED (it's prohibitively expensive for individuals), which would be an improvement over the "concise" edition.

<p>Here is a copy-and-paste of what the OED-online currently says. It is basically what it said in 1971, and I am pretty sure it is the same thing we would find in a current print edition.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Allopathy - because there's no other alternative</span></h2>
<p>It's no wonder the M.D. establishment has embraced the term "allopathy". There's no other alternative that doesn't imply rejecting all other medical paradigms as quackery. Terms like "conventional", "mainstream" and "orthodox" are fine as far as they go, but they still reflect a POV within the M.D. community that their paradigm is the only valid one. "Allopathy" is more neutral, hence its growing acceptance. So, I would agree that the article as it stands is still over-representive of a particular POV.</p>

I have no idea what the actual usage is, but it <i>has</i> to be based on dictionaries to avoid biased, undersampled original research. And since Donaldal used medical dictionaries, I think that's quite fair to the medical community. However, if you see something in the article that's weasly or something, point it out.</dd>

<p>Good idea. I'd suggest putting the history section first and follow that with a section on current usage. The "Current usage" section could start with a sentence suggesting that current usage is ambiguous. Follow that by citations divided into two categories: for, and against a wider definition.

<p>Hi everyone--I don't mind renaming the definition section at all. However, I think it is important to keep it at the top of the page for a very specific reason: it shows up front the differences of opinion in the most neutral way possible. By citing authorities we make it clear that there is a conflict without the risk of weasly language creeping in (a problem this article has had in the past). Our main problem is that there has been some difficulty describing the two sides of the story without coloring one of them as more accurate. Every time an introduction has been written it has gone through this insane process of agenda-pushing editorial, mostly in the form of very weasly language. To stomp this out, I just looked the word up in a bunch of well recognized dictionaries and presented them without comment. (I certainly support more people looking the term up in other reputable dictionaries.) Because there is no comment, there is no weasly language. And because I have included definitions for and against, there is no agenda pushing. As you can see, some companies produced dictionaries with conflicting definitions, and some present two conflicting definitions within the same entry. In the past we have had a lot of conflict over how to keep things as neutral as possible. I really think that our refraining from commenting too much on the dictionaries, while presenting them at the top of the article is the best way. Having said that, I do like having a little history of the term in the opining line (as it is now). I think everyone agrees that the etimology is important. And I believe everyone agrees (or at least they claim to) that avoiding weasly language is important as well. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 05:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did notice that the article says allopathy "has been used in a deprecatory manner" but I don't see any real-world citations of this usage. Can we just say that without any references to support it?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A new problem with the word</span></h2>
<p>It just occured to me that there is another problem with the word which I have never seen cited anywhere. Suppose you have two neurosurgeons who work in the same hospital and do the same surgeries. This is what we have been arguing that allopathic medicine refers to--orthodox, mainstream medicine. But supopse one of the two surgeons is an MD while the other is a DO. They are not practicing different medicine. They are doing the exact same surgery in the exact same way. How could one of them be more allopathic and one of them be more osteopathic? Since the DO isn't doing some kind of manipuative thing, does that make him an allopath? Or is the MD who is doing the same surgery as the DO practicing osteopathic medicine? DOs ruin the idea that allopathic medicine is what you call mainstream medicine. Either that or osteopaths actually are allopaths... <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 17:53, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Osteopaths practice the same as physicians from medical schools, though they may also use their chiropractic training. The homeopaths may label osteopaths as allopaths.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One form of verbal warfare used in retaliation by irregulars was the word "allopathy." Coined two hundred years ago by Samuel Hahnemann, founder of homeopathy, it was taken from Greek roots meaning "other than the disease" and was intended, among other things, to indicate that regular doctors used methods that were unrelated to the disharmony produced by disease and thus were harmful to their patients. "Allopathy" and "allopathic" were liberally employed as pejoratives by all irregular physicians of the nineteenth century, and the terms were considered highly offensive by those at whom they were directed. The generally uncomplaining acceptance of "allopahic medicine" by today's MDs is an indication of both a lack of awareness of the term's historical use and the recent thawing of relations between irregulars and allopaths. - James C. Whorton, "Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America"</dd>

<p>This may need to be shortened. It is an on-line book (the whole book). Quoting short passages is usually considered fair use, but I'm not sure where the borderline goes.

<p>Quoting short passages is fair use but only when you are writing a review of the work. It was referenced (and it is just amazing how google will bring you right to the source with a few words in quotes from the passage) so it wasn't that big an issue - it is fixable. Do please make the edits you have in mind. The history of this term having been pejorative in the past but not so or less so now is nice to have as a referenced edit. The issue has generated some controversy around here and the article you used had a nice tone to it. You can put the reference here in the talk page or as a ref in the articel as you think best. I'd lean to something in the article. Steve <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 16:05, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I shortened it, since part of it was already covered. Only the essential part remains, together with correct observations as to why the term is used so neutrally by MDs and societies nowadays. I couldn't have paraphrased it as well as the original quote, and it would have amounted to plagiarism anyway. Not sure about formatting of the link, which is also placed in the external links section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The term is still used pejoratively among believers in alternative medicine, but more in the way they always speak negatively of MDs - without an understanding of the historical meaning. To them the word "allopath" is a derogatory label for the evil guys, while "alternative" practitioners and rogue (often delicensed and criminal) MDs are the good guys who are persecuted for their "cutting edge" methods. (Joke: If you're on the cutting edge, you're on the wrong side of the knife!) That their methods are usually nonsensical, disproven, and even dangerous is lost on them. They often live in a world of conspiracy theories, with an "us against them" mentality. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 22:47, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Artifact of Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>It is interesting that the main strength of Wikipedia can also be its main weakness. The fact that anyone can log on and make changes to an article allows for a level of peer review and scrutiny that should result in the most accurate information concievable. But a small, vocal minority--even a single person--can make as many changes as they want. Everyone has equal say--even people who have do idea what they are talking about. I do think that a lot of the potential for conflict comes from wanting to express personal experience, and not really from raw antagonism, but the Wiki system creates the opportunity for some strange things to be said. I have been astonished at how frequently the debate over the use of the term "allopathic" comes up on Wikipedia. Almost any time the word gets used in an article, someone pops up and protests. I am a medical student (this doesn't make me an authority--it just explains my experience). When I registered for the MCAT I had to check the "allopthathic" box to show that I was applying to M.D. schools. When I filled out my applications, I had to go through the MCAS application service which calls itself allopathic. The core MD regulatory and accrediting bodies use it (the AMA, ACGME, and AAMC). Now that I am in medical school, the M.D.s in the hospitals use it. I had never heard of this debate until I started reading Wikipedia. Only later, while I was compiling dictionary definitions, did I find one single source (Tabors) that supports the argument. It is still the only authoritative source we have to demonstrate any current problem with the term. So on one hand I have the AAMC, the AMA, the ACGME, the MCAS, the MCAT, several authoritative dictionaries, my professors, and the attendings at the hospital all using the term freely; on the other hand I have a couple of people on Wikipedia and a single dictionary claiming that the word is inappropriate. Yet every time the word gets used in any article, a scandal pops up...as though everyone in the medical community knew that the word was rediculous and as though this debate were wide-spread. In my entire medical experience this is the only place I have ever heard of this debate (again, I am only a medical student, but all I do all day every day is medicine (and occasionally Wikipedia)). Only one person has to have an opinion to make a big scandal. I think that our article right now is fine. But this whole experience has taught me to take Wikipedia with a grain of salt (well, sometimes tablespoons of salt).<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 16:12, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Donaldal, only two of the dictionaries you cited in the article use a definition which doesn't acknowledge allopathy as being a term made to distinguish from homeopathy. It's not a single dictionary; it's four, and your experience is just as limited as any other person's. People from other situations may have exactly the same opinion of the overrepresentation of your perspective as you have of theirs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, yes, Wikipedia has a slight tendency to overrepresent the opinions of minorities, but I don't see this as a detriment when they're simply reported and not promoted, as has been done in this article. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 18:34, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You made my point exactly...I can only speak from my expience. And everyone is in the same boat. That makes this place like trying to herd cats through a fun-house mirror. Everyone is speaking from their experience--what they think they know--so everyone feels like their experience should be well-represented. Some people on here are convinced--earnestly convinced--of some things that I, from my limited experience, consider to be pretty rediculous (not necessarily in reference to this article...I am thinking more of the "vaccinations are evil" people). Obviously these people are allowed to voice their experience because, as Nunh-huh pointed out, who is to say who is crazy and who isn't? So as a result, patching together an article on here is cat herding. The really amazing advantage to this place is that you get a level of peer review on here that is simply not matched anywhere else. Everything that gets said gets edited by hundreds of people. And the advantage of hearing so many different experiences is obviously that you get a really broad perspective on things. I just feel like that that broad perspective can end up looking like reality in a fun-house mirror. And this article is not the only one with a lot of pushing and pulling...<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 22:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, Nickleshoe, I am certainly not questioning the history of the term. It was absolutely intended to differentiate conventional medicine from homeopathic and, as Nunh-huh has repeatedly (correctly) stated, it was a poorly devised term to begin with because mainstream medicine was never unified by one "allopathic" principle. However, only one dictionary I found suggested that it continues to be inappropriate today for conventional medicine--which is the opinion I am questioning. I am arguing that the term, however historically/etymolocially incorrect it may be, has been adopted by mainstream medicine and has lost many of its former semantic features. Ironically, it seems to me that the only authoritative source we have for the term being a problem today (Tabor's) was a source that I provided. The other sources for it being an incorrect description of mainstream medicine in modern usage are opinion articles. But all of this was not my point. My point was that this is like herding cats. I am fully cognizant of the fact that I am a cat just like everyone else. And therein lies the problem...the cats are trying to herd themselves.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> 23:39, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think it is neat what <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldal_0934.html" title="User:Donaldal">Donaldal</a> has learned in the exchange. History of homeopathy, reaction to the poor results medicine had up to the 1940's. Allopathy as a term and its usage. Hippocrates and how he left people alone with better results. Well, lots of that is what I learned - generally from poking around on Wikipedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Homeopathy, Allopathy &amp; Enantiopathy</span></h2>
<p>"The term "allopath" comes from the Greek roots meaning "opposite" and "disease"-- the form "allopathy" being formed by false analogy with other French word pairs."&#160;??????</p>
<p>"As used by homeopaths, the term "allopathy" has always referred to a principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce the opposite effect of the disease when given to a healthy human."&#160;??????</p>
<p>Some clarification here, from someone who had actually read Hahnemann: <a href="http://www.homeoint.org/books5/clarkehomeo/homeoallo.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.homeoint.org/books5/clarkehomeo/homeoallo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.homeoint.org/books5/clarkehomeo/homeoallo.htm</a> "Hahnemann pointed out there were three principal ways of using drugs - the homœopathic, the allopathic, and the antipathic or enantiopathic. The homœopathic is the like - to - like method, in which a medicine is given to a sick person because it is capable of producing similar state when given to healthy one - similia similibus. The allopathic method is that in which the drug given, being "without any pathological relation to what is naturally diseased in the body, attacks the part most exempt from the disease." The enantiopathic is the opposite of the homœopathic, and is the treatment by contraries. This treatment is palliative merely. When a large dose of opium is given to overcome sleeplessness&#160;; or when an astringent is given to arrest diarrhœa, or a purgative is given to remove constipation - these are examples of antipathic treatment. But many diseases, such as inflammation, for example have no "opposites" except health, and these can not be treated by this method, and must be treated, if at all, in one of the other two ways."</p>
<p>Common treatments from the era of heroic medicine were mercury for syphilis, bleeding for fevers, antimony tartrate for pneumonia. These were not 'opposite' to the disease, hence Hahnemann's term. Only a few 'opposites' were used such as opium for diarrhea, and he termed these 'antipathic', not allopathic.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like someone with a beef about homeopathy is using the article as a platform, not to elucidate the term allopathy. As such it's POV. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedermann_9261.html" title="User:Jedermann">Jedermann</a> 11:57, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
