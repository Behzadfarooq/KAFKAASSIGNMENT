<p>Hi. I'm not overly fussed about those articles listed on VfD. They were added when I was still quite new around here and in an inclusionist state of mind. We'll see how they go. They're probably better suited as redirects anyway.

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_X-play_8d55.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/X-play">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/X-play</a>, I thought I should follow up on your comment regarding <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>. Although normally second and subsequent words in a title are lowercase, an exception is made for proper nouns: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Lowercase_second_and_subsequent_words" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions#Lowercase_second_and_subsequent_words</a>. In the case of X-Play the show's formal name includes the capital P, thus our article title should too.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a particularly good idea to have black text on a black background. You might want to change the color of the text to white or something. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:33, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem here is that some browsers (most versions of IE included) require a six-digit hex colour code for tables but can cope with three-digit ones for divs. The simple solution is to change, for example, #eee to #eeeeee. This fixes the black on black problem and makes the templates look very good. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:26, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have we stopped using 'substub'? I'd marked a one-line article as a substub, and I notice that you've re-marked it a stub.

<ul>
<li>I sorted the two articles you mentioned as stubs based on the fact that both contained enough information to be viable stubs. I have searched any definitions that show a byte count as the basis for differentiating between stubs and substubs and have not found any other than the general phrase "a substub is a short stub". There is however a number of sources that make the defining difference the existence of usable information within the article. If you can point me to a better method of determining the difference between the two categories I will make appropriate changes. --Allen3 talk 19:27, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hiya, you recently closed the vfd <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Matthew_1%7Everses_c7eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matthew 1:verses">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matthew 1:verses</a></p>
<p>In your calculation of votes you state that the votes are</p>
<p>19 Merge votes, 16 Keep votes, and 9 Delete votes</p>
<p>However, this includes 2 votes (the less noticable of which was by Tupsharru) which were "keep or merge" as keep votes, which I feel is quite misleading.</p>
<p>The tally should be either</p>
<ul>
<li>21 Merge votes, 16 Keep votes, and 9 Delete votes,</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>19 Merge votes, 14 Keep votes, 2 "keep or merge" votes, and 9 Delete votes</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that the delete votes are probably equatable to merge votes in this particular vfd, which would make it 28 merge, 14 keep - a 2:1 ratio. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 9 July 2005 14:22 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay - Thanks for looking into it - My only consern with why the page was ever deleated remains the same -The other seperate pages of MOOs are basiclly the same as PythonMOOs was - maybe the mass delete should be considered (Bar LambdaMOO as this does seem worthwhile) - and maybe a section for each of the MOOs listed in Popular MOOs (or were atleast) to provide a reference of the different braches of MOO that exist. Please consider this and have a glance through the approate pages. <a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipper2258_47a0.html" title="User:Kipper2258">Kipper2258</a> 11:50, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Allen, you closed a VfD for this article <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sheepish_Productions_457d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sheepish Productions">here</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RubenWiki_48f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/RubenWiki">User:RubenWiki</a>, who has not made a single other edit to WP, has just placed an article in the namespace. A google search ("Sheepish Productions") returns not a single mention of this supposed company that is not a mirror.</p>
<p>The article is also very deceptive: the author has written <i>"A subsidiary of Sheepish Productions, Sheepish News, has its own regular news bulletin and associated website [1] with up-to-the-minute information on local, national and international events..."</i></p>
<p>The website that is referred to is a ridiculous geocities page; the only things on it are a bunch of goofy photos. There is no news service at all, much less an "up-to-the-minute" one.</p>
<p>I'd like to know how similar the current page is to the original deleted one. If it's similar, it should be speedied.

<p>What is the rule on how often VFDs may be proposed? So far one of the pages I've worked on has been nominated for VFDs twice and survived both and someone is attempting to nominate it for a third VFD in as many months. It survived its last VFD attempt just 22 days ago and now the third VFD attempt appears to be begining. People are nominating the page without checking its history and just use their dislike of the focus of the article as their reason to nominate it. This is the page in question</p>

<p>Another question. Someone removed the content from both the article and the discussion page and redirected them to a bad listing (changed from SD.net to SD.org). While the content has been restored, all the edit histories are gone. The old edit histories show up in the SD.org but not SD.net even with the old content merged. Is there anything that can be done about this? <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 08:38, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Help. You blanked Stardestroyer.net and ereased it's history. Please revert and restore this article as you've left a redirect loop in the article's place.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:31, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some information has come to light. The user who nominated the SD.net entry for VFD nominated it on his 8th edit. This very same user is banned from SD.net and has a clear conflict of interest in this process. Before attempting to nominate the SD.net entry for VFD he attempted to vandalize it. Furthermore, after nominating SD.net for VFD he edited the VFD to remove his name as being the name of the person who started the VFD and placed a non-existant username instead. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Stardestroyer.net2" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Stardestroyer.net2" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Stardestroyer.net2</a> In my book this is a clear case of a bad faith VFD nomination (especialy when you consider SD.net survived two previous VFDs already, one just 3 weeks prior to the newest VFD) on the part of someone carrying out a personal vendetta. Furthermore this very same user ( <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanizaki_5a31.html" title="User:Tanizaki">User:Tanizaki</a> ) then instated a VFD against the Trek BBS entry on Wikipedia citing false reasoning as the grounds for the VFD.

<p>Thanks for noticing. The text instructions weren't that clear so I ended up on a wrong page apparently. I will repost on the correct page. --<a href="../../../k/2E/n/User%7EK.Nevelsteen_38d1.html" title="User:K.Nevelsteen">None-of-the-Above</a> 12:32, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, now I know it wasn't my imagination, just happened again.

<p>I have carefully reviewed your comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/GordonWatts&amp;diff=23170024&amp;oldid=23170012" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/GordonWatts&amp;diff=23170024&amp;oldid=23170012" rel="nofollow">here</a>, in which you say that I should accept concensus of others before thinking to be promoted.</p>
<p>While I think I had explained my actions in my reply on that page, I honestly could have made a mistake in judgment in that case. However, I feel that you and other editors are not treating applicants for admin in the same way you treat current admins:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GordonWatts/RfA&amp;diff=23483823&amp;oldid=23482340#The_recent_Main_Page_Edit_War_between_at_least_seven_Admins_.26_Bureaucrats" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GordonWatts/RfA&amp;diff=23483823&amp;oldid=23482340#The_recent_Main_Page_Edit_War_between_at_least_seven_Admins_.26_Bureaucrats" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, for example, at least seven admins and bureaucrats got into a <i><b>prolonged edit war,</b></i> on the <b>Front Page</b> of Wikipeida, not just some obscure FA-page; and, I did not hear any criticism from you or your friends -while minor questionable judgments by me are reason to deny adminship. Why?</p>
<p>I too am a Christian, and I believe in adhering to the highest principals, and that is why my disappoiintment is exaggerated: Further, these double standards happen not just to me but to others, and that is why we must follow Christ's example (John 13:15) and then go above and <i>beyond</i> and do greater works: John 14:12, with reference to your user page.</p>
<p>Those "greater works" surely included you speaking out about "double standards" for "the privileged." So, while I'm not perfect, I do think I'm at least as qualified as the next person <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonWatts_RfA_a5a9.html" title="User talk:GordonWatts/RfA">User_talk:GordonWatts/RfA</a> to get a few extra tools to help me help my community, since the policy is quite clear that those with my qualifications are permitted these extra tools.</p>

<p>It's very hard to find out how a person is to defend themselves in Wikipedia. This may be the wrong place, and if it is I'm sorry. My name is John D Curnow and I'm not a hoax, as one person suggested. I was one of the first people to record bird songs in the midwest. My tapes were sold by the Audubon Camp here in Wisconsin. The NASCO Corp of Fort Atkins, WI sold my tapes to high schools all over the US and Canada for ten years. A copy of my book "Plavt Communities - Ecological Studies Of The Upper Midwest" was copyrighted and sent to the Library Of Congress. I was also awarded the outstanding alumni award from the University Of Wisconsin-Platteville and I did teach from 1951 - 1999. I may not be important enough to be found in Google and I can accept that, but I'm certainly not a hoax! John D Curnow</p>

<p>Hi there, In the FAC list, I see that a number of nominators have said that they received little feedback on peer review, and 'I wish people had told me about x and y there, before it got to FAC nomination' etc.</p>
<p>I wonder whether it would be appropriate to add a note at the top of the PR page encouraging nominators to (nicely) ask a few contributors in the general area of their article in question to provide feedback. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 05:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that you archived the current peer review of acetic acid. Is this always done after a month, automatically? We are working towards this being an FA article, and although we are getting close, as I understood it the peer review is still going on (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Chemicals_47e5.html#Acetic_acid_to_FAC.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chemicals">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Chemicals#Acetic_acid_to_FAC.3F</a> for some recent discussion). Once the FA status is achieved (hopefully!) then the peer review will become inactive. I recall that with our last FA article on <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrochloric_acid.html" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a> the peer review also lasted about 6 weeks, we fuss over things a lot in chemistry! Should it be "unarchived" until we're finished? Thanks, <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 04:04, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Attempts to recreate the article without showing that the subject is something other than a website may be deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy delete criteria G4</a> (substantially identical copy of previously deleted material). If you have new information that indicates that PythonMOO has achieved a level of importance justifying an article, please submit a request for undeletion at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 12:18, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but as you should know, and I have had to state many times, a MOO is not a website, but there may be a website as a portal to the MOO telnet connection. "...has ongoing MSN and AIM developments to expand connection methods for MOOs..." - That seems a deveopment to me. Other MOOs seem to have no notable reason for being allowed - However the suggestion that all the Sub MOO articles (are lambdamoo) are merged into the main MOO article, was never followed up by yourself or another admin, dispite being asked by myself and RoySmith, therefore please accept this message as a notice of that.</dd>
<dd>And I also ask, why is it possible for people to recreate the article on the PythonMOO site, if it is just destroyed, and told upon request that it should be loged at Deletion Review - why allow people to create it for seeing fit, if you are just going to be facists over the matter.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please also note (whether you choose to ignore me is your choice, I would have to speak to another admin - but since you are the enforcer), inline with recent suggestions, a merge of the seperate MOO articles has been placed foward, if this is completed, and relevent pages are moved and redirected, then I ask that the Python article is unblocked and a redirect put in place to guide usrs to the relevent section for that MOO.</dd>

<dd>Checking <a href="../../../m/o/o/Talk%7EMOO_1063.html" title="Talk:MOO">Talk:MOO</a>, I see that the merge was proposed earlier today. If such a merge does actually take place I will be glad to remove the current page protection and replace the contents of <a href="../../../p/y/t/PythonMOO_df35.html" title="PythonMOO">PythonMOO</a> with redirect. I would even be inclined to perform a history merge of the old versions of PythonMoo into the merged article. It is just the repeated recreation of previously deleted material outside of Wikipedia procedures that I have an objection with. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 16:21, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, but it has been suggested many times, and it prevents all thehuge reams of possible pages, and makes a better overall MOO article. Generally, I think the <a href="../../../m/o/o/MOO_ae17.html" title="MOO">MOO</a> article itself needs a cleanup.</dd>

<p>Merge is now completed, and article is labled for cleanup (probably since I'm nt going to do a good job myself - and I know it). Please feel free to consider addition of a Redirect to PythonMOO directing to <a href="../../../m/o/o/MOO_ae17.html#PythonMOO" title="MOO">MOO#PythonMOO</a>. 172.188.21.72 19:40, 28 October 2005 (UTC) The bold one! (Oh, and the IP shift thing is due to having a very unstable AOL DSL connection, highlighting their rather individual IP assigning system.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../p/y/t/PythonMOO_df35.html" title="PythonMOO">PythonMOO</a> has been unprotected and changed to a redirect.
