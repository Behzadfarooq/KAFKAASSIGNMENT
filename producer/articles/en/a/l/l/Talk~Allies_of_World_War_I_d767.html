<p>Serbia lost many more people in proportion to their size than either Britain or France. Furthermore, Serbia was the first of the Allied powers to declare war. Whether the other major Allied Powers recognized the sacrifice of the Serbian people is irrelevant. Even so, I would argue that Austria-Hungary came to the recognition that Serbia was more than a "minor" as it took her two years (after Bulgarian assistance) to subdue the small Balkan country. Tyler Durgen 03:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would object to moving Romania to the "major Allies" because Romania was an active member of the Allies for only a few months and did not have a significant impact on the war. If anything, Romania's defeat only served to further demonstrate the superiority of the tactics of the Central powers. Tyler Durgen 03:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Serbia as well as Romania were minor allies, because they were minor powers. This is a purely taxonomic classification and has nothing to do with their fighting abilities or percentage of causualties etc. Although one might argue about what exactly constitutes a major power, there was at the time (and now) a clear understanding of who was in the major power club: Russia, Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Britain, and the USA; The Ottomans by tradition and courtesy, and perhaps the Japanese. But no one else. Everyone else is a minor power or less. All the major powers had real battlefleets and large armies and the population and industry to sustain them; all the minor powers did not. The weakest of the major powers were the Ottomans, the Austrians, and the Italians. But the first two fielded large armies on two or three separate fronts, the latter only on one front but in great numbers. The Serbians did not have the military force to do anything of the sort. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it means they were small countries "hitting above their weight". No country which loses soldiers equivalent to more than 30 divisions in a war is a "minor" player. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 09:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Grant65 Allow me to explain why they are minor. Serbia’s 450,000 deaths shows the size and strength of their armies. In a war of attrition, like WW1 was, that counts enormously. If you compare Serbia with other countries like the USA that had only 60,000 deaths, the time involved and the actual battlefield contribution of both countries it will show who the minor and who the major contributors to the war had been. The problem is that the ones in control of the buttons here at Wiki are not Serbian and that there has always been efforts made to over inflate contributions by certain counties and lessen the contributions by other countries in both world wars and there always will be.

<dd>If you look closer, the south western and north eastern edges of the Arabian peninsular are orange, indicating that those areas were part of the Ottoman Empire. The interior was so lacking in people and (so it was believed) resources, that it was under tribal leadership. The Arabs, whom the British promised a pan-Arab state (including present day Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq) rebelled against the Turks.

<p>Good to see someone noticed this message.&#160;:) I thought no one would reply and let this page stay that way for years to come. Now I get to the point: That would make them an ally of Britain, and so the grey part of Arabia, that is the part of Arabia not owned by the Turks, should be green because they were an allied nation, not neutral.--<a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFox_Mccloud_1ddd.html" title="User:Fox Mccloud">Fox Mccloud</a> 02:11, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arabia wasn't a country at that time. It was occupied by Arab nomads who did not participate in the war. The Arabs that fought in the war lived inside the Ottoman Empire.CHSGHSF 00:27, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cite: <i>While Norway was neutral, British pressure and anti-German sentiment in the population enabled the Norwegian government to favour Britain in matters concerning the large Norwegian shipping fleet and food supplies.</i> There are several countries that supported Allies or Central Powers in various ways.

<p>A few points: 1. It is relevant to point out that the Dominions did not have independence at the time and that <i>they did later</i>, a major difference between WW1 and WW2. 2. You have removed the sentence: "However, Dominion governments did withdraw elements of their forces from time to time." Is there a reason for this? 3. If you mention the war cabinet there is no need to mention "British generals", who were also answerable to the war cabinet. If we mention the "British generals" we should mention that, after April 1918, <i>all</i> of the Allies were commanded by <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Foch_3d10.html" title="Ferdinand Foch">Ferdinand Foch</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 09:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thanks for the thoughtful comments. 1) Lots of things happened after 1918. 2) not sure what that sentence means--if it means Canada did X in 1917, then it should day that. 3. The Dominion forces were at all times under the control of British generals, who in turn were controlled by a war cabinet that had dominion representation. (not to mention Foch's role in 1918) <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 09:26, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for the delay in replying.<br /></dd>
<dd>1. "Lots of things" aren't a major difference between the make up of the Allies in WW1 as opposed to WW2.<br /></dd>
<dd>2. It means that while the Dominion governments did not have <i>operational</i> control of the forces, they could and did remove them from front line duties. Which is logical since they also organised recruiting in their own countries.<br /></dd>
<dd>3. Fair enough. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 07:45, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>on #1, it's hard enough to cover ww1 in this article without trying to explain what happened in 1931 (so don't mention it--no one in 1918 knew about the 1931 decision anyway); on #2, I'm not sure what example you have in mind. I can't think of any off hand. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 07:52, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have rewritten the article to keep the list of countries as a list. And we also missed creation of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_War_Cabinet_bcae.html" title="Imperial War Cabinet">Imperial War Cabinet</a> in 1917. Dominion governments did control personnel and their deployment. For example, in spite of British resistance, the New Zealand government insisted on bringing whole units home for leave. Australia resisted British pressure to introduce conscription and use of the death penalty within its forces. No Australian serviceman was executed during WW1. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 08:33, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The article states that Late in the war, Australian and Canadian units were grouped in their own separate army corps. The Canadian Corps was established september 1915.</p>
<p>It also says the Dominions did not have independent foreign or defence policies during World War I. The constitution of the new Dominion of Canada, 1867, gave the federal government control over all aspects of defence.</p>
<p>It also says the Dominions did not have operational control of their personnel. What does this mean?</p>

<dd>It means that at all times Canadian and Australian commanders followed orders issued by senior British generals. But look at the bright side: the were the best FOLLOWERS in the whole war. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 07:18, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brocky, Rjensen is right. But you make a good point about defence and I've removed the statement that Dominions did not control defence policy, which was plainly wrong. The Statute of Westminster (1931) gave the Dominions independence in <i>foreign</i> policy, but did not deal with defence, which was already in their ambit. We shouldn't mistake the Dominions' accession to close cooperation and operational control, prior to 1931, for British control of defence. I mean part of the payoff for Britain in granting Dominion status was savings in expenditure on the defence of colonies. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 07:31, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But seriously, I wonder whether Poland fits into the list or not. Technically speaking Poland announced her independence on the very day the cease fire was signed. On the other hand however, there were no less than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Polish_divisions_in_World_War_I_e2fe.html" title="List of Polish divisions in World War I">10 Polish divisions</a> fighting on both the eastern and western fronts and all were subordinate to the Polish National Committee, itself a member of the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entente.html" title="Entente">Entente</a> (check the article on <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Army_196a.html" title="Blue Army">Blue Army</a> to read up more).

<p>If you want to include Poland as a participant, you should probably paint it orange, as a Polish state was proclaimed in 1916 by the Central Powers. But IMHO Poland participated in the war on neither side as it de facto did not exist as a state. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:07, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Belgium is counted here among the Allies, but it was Belgian neutrality violated that prompted the UK to enter the war.
