<dl>
<dd>I'm a little confused. A few weeks ago I made a "Mr. Horse" article linked to the <i>Ren and Stimpy Show</i> article. The other day I saw that it was being considered for deletion. And therein lies the confusion - I've only been using wikipedia for a few months, and I find it an outstanding source of knowledge. However, not all of the "knowledge" in wikipedia is non-fiction, or, for a lack of a better term, real, i.e., fiction, cartoons, etc., and there are many pages devoted to things that don't, er, actually exist as reality. Since I felt a tiny paragraph on the Ren and Stimpy page didn't do the character justice, I gave the fictional equine his own article, so if anyone had a hankering for some more Mr. Horse, or had something to add, could. I vaguely remember the neologism (to me, anyway) "fancruft" describing the article...in any case, a quick search of wikipedia brought out the following fun fact - <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petunia_Pig_d8aa.html" title="Petunia Pig">Petunia Pig</a> has her own wiki page. Yes, Petunia Pig, fondly remembered by all as <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porky_Pig_2c43.html" title="Porky Pig">Porky Pig</a>'s belle. Now, if the fault here is that Mr. Horse is insignificant, fine - but where do you draw the line on <i>how</i> insignificant? If a third-tier character from an accepted, or "classic" cartoon franchise such as Looney Tunes can get her own page, why not Mr. Horse? If I actually delved further, I'm sure I could come up with pages and pages of such "fancruft" about obscure fiction characters - if wikipedia feels that these pages need to go, then so be it, but I just don't see who they're hurting, or why Mr. Horse was targeted specifically. -- thesmokingmonkey 10JUL05</dd>

<dd>Okay, now I understand. I made a <i>second</i> Mr. Horse page, perhaps, and the previous deletion vote came up on the page I made. I understand your role (I think), and I was just looking to clarify my confusion - nothing personal, not trying to rock boats or misbehave. Just trying to improve the encyclopedia and play by the rules. And, by the way, I've moved the "Mr. Horse" page to a new "Ren and Stimpy Show Characters" page.

<p>Hi - When you get NekoDaemon running again, can you change the time it runs? I think it's currently scheduled for 23:00 GMT (if I'm doing my time coversions right), by which time it is already the next day for nearly half the world. If it ran at 11:00 GMT then the next day's entry would be there shortly before the next day starts for folks in a +11:00 timezone. If the timing is also related to a load lull, then perhaps adding the entry a whole day early would be better. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 14:26, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You replied <i>NekoDaemon is scheduled to create a new page exactly one hour before 0:00 UTC, just like VFD Bot. Then it is scheduled to run again at exactly 5-10 minutes before 0:00 UTC to add the pages. Then it updates and closes out the old pages 10 minutes after 0:00 UTC. However, the thing is that when you add a new entry to the page, the system goes by UTC since everything on the Wikipedia is run accordingly to UTC. It doesn't matter if part of the world is already a day ahead, the autolinker for the date runs by Wikipedia time, not by one's local time. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:54, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>The point is that not all CFD users understand that the relevant time is UTC, nor perhaps how to convert from their local time to UTC, nor necessarily what UTC even is (nor that the date transclude is added automatically, which is actually a separate issue that should be addressed, see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategories_for_deletion_0417.html#Creating_a_new_day.27s_subpage" title="Wikipedia talk:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Categories_for_deletion#Creating_a_new_day.27s_subpage</a>) and occasionally folks east of Greenwich manually add a day file and the transclude. If NekoDaemon were pushed ahead 12 hours (at least the parts creating the day file and the transclude) someone in, say, Tokyo would never be tempted to do this. They might put their CFD entry in the wrong day's section (and, hence, in the wrong day file), but I don't actually think there's any particular harm this causes. Manually creating a day file with the incorrect name or screwing up the transclude mechanism in some other fashion seems like a much more problematic error condition. Are you thinking there's some harm in creating the day file and the transclude 12 hours earlier? -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 13:35, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The standard that the Wikipedia uses is to follow Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), simply because that's the easiest. Greenwich Mean Time is not the same as Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), as Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) is not affected by daylight savings. It is far easier to follow and force everyone on UTC than to follow on everyone's individual timezones. Furthermore, as I said before, the link to <b>add</b> the entry should be using the Wikipedia's server time which <b>is</b> based off UTC. The link is an auto-generated link cooresponding to the UTC day, month, and year. The reason for not creating it 12 hours earlier is just to prevent from anyone wreaking 12 hours of vandalism. I rather have a smaller window to assert that the page is fine rather than a lengthly 12 hour window. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 05:22, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fully understand Wikipedia runs on UTC (and the difference between UTC and GMT) and completely agree that it should. I'm still not understanding what the problem is with adding the link 12 hours earlier. Are you suggesting adding entries under the current "local" day rather than the current "UTC" day is vandalism? IMO this is a very, very minor user error. How about if the "active" day article starts with a header like "Please add new entries in this section" (rather than a date), and the bot changes the header to a date as part of making the next day's article active? Doing this I think there would be a small window where either there are two articles with the "add new entries here" header or there is no article with this header (I think I prefer the latter). In any event, I think we should do something to avoid the current situation where someone in Tokyo might think (incorrectly) s/he should add a new link and day article. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:01, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, AllyUnion! I once again turn to you for advice. In Mind Benders, where Round One just completed, one person (ROYGBIV) got the majority of the questions first. Deryck C., another participant, suggests that I inform all users when the page is going up so that every user has a fairer shot at answering the questions first. However, I feel that either way, the advantage is going to the user who logs in first. How do you prevent this from happening in WikiFun, aside from making the questions (insanely) difficult?

<p>User:AllyUnion - I see where you participated in the matter concerning <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_sexuality_41f5.html" title="Abraham Lincoln's sexuality">Abraham Lincoln's sexuality</a> that was discussed and voted upon on <a href="../../../a/b/r/Talk%7EAbraham_Lincoln_29fa.html" title="Talk:Abraham Lincoln">Talk:Abraham Lincoln</a>. There has been a lengthy and exhausting discussion surrounding this exact same issue at <a href="../../../e/l/v/Talk%7EElvis_Presley_f65c.html" title="Talk:Elvis Presley">Talk:Elvis Presley</a> and the archived Talk pages as well. Because this has the potential to create a new standard for what is acceptable sources, I thought that you might want to be aware of it.</p>
<p>If the policy consensus you and others arrived at on the Abraham Lincoln issue is set aside in the Presley article it will result in new ones for countless others. I think your group discussion that arrived at a determination of what constituted a proper source should be defined by the Wikipedia community and set as firm policy which would go a long way in helping to substantially reduce the tiresome and repeated edit wars.

<p>You know when you complained about the size being messed up? It wasn't due to the template, but the template invocation...there is this vandal 67.32.163.29 who deleted portions of the invocation, such that the last parameter specifying size was no longer the 362th parameter, which meant that it was not parsed, and thus used the default size of the image, which happens to be 400x400 for each tile. I initially tried to assume good faith, but I noticed how the vandal only came again when I reverted his edits, and when I posted a message on his talk page and on the edit summary to ask him to stop, not did he not ignore it, he tried to delete my comments on his talk page. Please keep an eye on this. He has a previous history of vandalism too, but apparently no one bothered to warn him previously. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 21:22, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that makes sense. The name change doesn't change the fact that this box is a dynamic transclusion. It never becomes "static". Including it in the archive pages adds nothing but creates a potential (admittedly very small) for confusion. If it's still easy to remove via the bot, that would be ideal. If not, I'll do them by hand when I notice them.

<p>I fully understand Wikipedia runs on UTC (and the difference between UTC and GMT) and completely agree that it should. I'm still not understanding what the problem is with adding the link 12 hours earlier. Are you suggesting adding entries under the current "local" day rather than the current "UTC" day is vandalism? IMO this is a very, very minor user error. How about if the "active" day article starts with a header like "Please add new entries in this section" (rather than a date), and the bot changes the header to a date as part of making the next day's article active? Doing this I think there would be a small window where either there are two articles with the "add new entries here" header or there is no article with this header (I think I prefer the latter). In any event, I think we should do something to avoid the current situation where someone in Tokyo might think (incorrectly) s/he should add a new link and day article. -- Rick Block (talk) 17:01, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize for this late reply. I started work and my Wikipedia activity just dropped. The server variables control how something is added to a page. Meaning that it is always auto-linked according to UTC time. It doesn't matter if the other half of the world is a day ahead, the automatic link will always follow UTC time. The concept is illustrated on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>, where it has "Follow <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Log_2007_March_29_6cf0.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Log_2007_March_29_6cf0.html" rel="nofollow"><big>this edit link</big></a></b>" The page uses these variables: {{CURRENTYEAR}}, {{CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN}}, {{CURRENTDAY}}. These variables ALWAYS follow the server settings of UTC time. The full link in wiki text is:</dd>
<dd>[{{SERVER}}{{localurl:Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/{{CURRENTYEAR}}_{{CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN}}_{{CURRENTDAY}}|action=edit}} this edit link]</dd>
<dd>Although CFD does not have this particular link, it should since everything on the Wikipedia should follow UTC time. The reason that it is harmful to add the page 12 hours ahead is due to the confusion over timezones. We won't have any method to clearly judge the order of an entry without UTC time. Entries are always placed with newest at the top. But if someone signs their signature with UTC time, then the entries should be lined up according to UTC time. Placing an entry into one day ahead of the Wikipedia may cause the entries to go out of order. Because then you might have people adding to day after the Wikipedia, when they shouldn't. (They add into August 21st, when the Wikipedia is August 22nd... then you have a confusion over where the entry is placed.) Furthermore, it is not that adding entries into a page 12 hours before is vandalism, it's just that you create a window of opportunity of 12 hours for vandalism... rather than just one hour. I can see the reasoning behind your request for <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> but I strongly believe the project should follow UTC despite any date confusion. It would be, actually, more useful adding the automatic link that says, "Add new entries following this link" or something like that. That would force everyone on the same page and on the correct date. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:08, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I very much would like to write everything in Perl for all my bots, in particular, for VFD Bot. It's just that I haven't found any Perl code that easily gets the data from the Wikipedia and parses the wiki code. What I've found is that there is something, but it requires a lot different modules of perl to install for it to function properly. (I gave up in frustration, and stopped using it.) The Python pywikipedia framework gave me a set of nice features to use, but the Perl implementation I've seen hasn't come even close to the features that the Python implementation has.</dd>

<dd>I would like to very much work with you in writing the code together for VFD Bot, as the stats you place on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_Old_dcc1.html" title="WP:VFD/Old">WP:VFD/Old</a> follows much of the work required to do <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_VFD_List_4e50.html" title="User:AllyUnion/VFD List">User:AllyUnion/VFD List</a>. I would very much like to try to keep the maintainance from <a href="../../../v/f/d/User%7EVFD_Bot_4e8f.html" title="User:VFD Bot">VFD Bot</a> and have your bot account separated from that work. What do you think? Please reply at my talk page. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:44, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a lot of stuff to reply to. Let us start with the Perl vs Python thing. I use the Perl module <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WWW::Mediawiki::Client" class="extiw" title="meta:WWW::Mediawiki::Client">Meta:WWW::Mediawiki::Client</a> which indeed needs around six other Perl modules to install. but it is not that bad, I did it several times, on Linux. You are right that the Perl package has only upload/download features, and even those are rather limited.</dd>

<dd>I don't know how much I could help with the VfD bot if that needs Python programming. Python is a really clean language, but I know it little, and anyway from what I saw it is a bit clumsy to use for text processing, which is all the bots do.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, if there is anything I could help with while doing Perl programming, just let me know. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 22:51, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I wrote a small Python script to read in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_499a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old</a>, and add a link to the VfD page five days ago. It uses regular expressions, so it will not introduce duplicates, and also it will not get confused by my statistics. Could you try out the following script? Before doing that, one would need to have <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_499a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old</a> saved to disk as a file called 'data.txt'. This because I was to lazy for the moment to integrate the pywikipedia framework.</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python

from time import gmtime, strftime, time
import re

# read the file [[Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Old]] (for now, call it 'data.txt')
fileHandle = open ( 'data.txt' )
vfdold= fileHandle.read()
fileHandle.close()

# define the five days ago and six days ago links (first is not a regular expression, others are)
day = 60*60*24  # one day 
fivedaysago_vfdtag  = '* [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/' + strftime('%Y %B %d', gmtime(time() - 5*day )) + ']]'
fivedaysago_vfdtag_re  = '\* \[\[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/' + strftime('%Y %B %d', gmtime(time() - 5*day )) + '\]\]'
sixdaysago_vfdtag_re = '(\* \[\[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/' + strftime('%Y %B %d', gmtime(time() - 6*day )) + '\]\].*\n)'

# add the line fivedaysago_vfdtag to vfdold unless this already exists
if not re.search(fivedaysago_vfdtag_re, vfdold):
    pattern = re.compile(sixdaysago_vfdtag_re)
    result=  pattern.search(vfdold).group()
    vfdold = vfdold.replace(result, result + fivedaysago_vfdtag + '\n')

print vfdold

<dd>I was under the impression you have to compile the regex in Python before using it...

<p>OK, your new code does not get confused by anything. It works as long as the &lt;!-- Place latest vote day above - Do not remove this line --&gt; tag is present. Nice. I will add the stats today then, and will see if your bot gets indeed confused or not.</p>
<p>About compiling Python regexps before using them, I did for one of then, and not for the other. Seems to work. :) <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 15:24, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to bother you about this, but the following events occurred last night:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncle G's bot created the VfD page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_26&amp;oldid=21843927" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_26&amp;oldid=21843927" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li>I added a VfD entry to that page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_26&amp;diff=21843967&amp;oldid=21843927" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_26&amp;diff=21843967&amp;oldid=21843927" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>Seven minutes later, VFD Bot wiped it out: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_26&amp;diff=21844350&amp;oldid=21843967" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_26&amp;diff=21844350&amp;oldid=21843967" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>

<p>Hi there! A gradual renaming process has started to move "votes for deletion" to "pages for deletion". Would it be possible to modify VFDBot to create the daily page accordingly? Thanks. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:36, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion</a>. There's still some discussion going on so feel free to join. I'm not asking that you make changes to the bot immediately, I would simply like to know if it's feasible or a lot of work or anything. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:37, August 27, 2005 (UTC)
