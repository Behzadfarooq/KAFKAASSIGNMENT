	    <p>The <b>All-America Football Conference</b> (AAFC) was a professional <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> league that challenged the established <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> (NFL) from <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_in_sports.html" title="1946 in sports">1946</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949_in_sports.html" title="1949 in sports">1949</a>. One of the NFL’s most formidable challengers, the AAFC attracted many of the nation’s best players, produced one of pro football’s greatest teams, and introduced many lasting innovations to the game. However, the AAFC was ultimately unable to sustain itself in competition with the NFL. Three of its teams were admitted to the NFL, of which two survive today.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p><a name="Founding" id="Founding"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: Founding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Founding</span></h3>
<p>The AAFC was founded by <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_3abd.html" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> sports editor Arch Ward on June 4, 1944. Ward was also the originator of baseball’s <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Star_Game_3f18.html" title="All-Star Game">All-Star Game</a> and football’s <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_All-Star_Game_be2f.html" title="College All-Star Game">College All-Star Game</a>.</p>
<p>At the AAFC’s founding meeting, Ward brought together a number of wealthy pro football enthusiasts, some of whom had previously attempted to purchase NFL franchises. Ward had previously encouraged the NFL to expand, but now he hoped to bring about a permanent second league and a championship game with the NFL, similar to baseball’s <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>.</p>
<p>On November 21, 1944 the AAFC chose <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crowley_cff3.html" title="Jim Crowley">Jim Crowley</a> as its commissioner. Crowley was famed as one of the "<a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Horsemen_%28football%29_12eb.html" title="Four Horsemen (football)">Four Horsemen of Notre Dame</a>", <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knute_Rockne_a2d7.html" title="Knute Rockne">Knute Rockne</a>'s legendary <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_in_sports.html" title="1924 in sports">1924</a> backfield. Not coincidentally, the NFL commissioner at this time was another Horseman, <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmer_Layden_321a.html" title="Elmer Layden">Elmer Layden</a>.</p>
<p>During the next months, the AAFC’s plans solidified. The league initially issued franchises for Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. Brooklyn and Miami were later added. A group representing Baltimore was considered for admission, but could not secure a stadium. The league initially planned to begin play in 1945. However, with World War II still raging, the AAFC postponed its opening for a year.</p>
<p>In a move with far-reaching consequences, in 1945 the Cleveland franchise hired <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Brown_bd1e.html" title="Paul Brown">Paul Brown</a> as its head coach. Brown had won six Ohio state championships in nine years at Massillon High School and the 1942 <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythical_national_championship.html" title="Mythical national championship">national championship</a> at <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_f1c0.html" title="Ohio State">Ohio State</a>, and had also coached successfully at the military’s Great Lakes Naval Station. In Cleveland, Brown would recruit an outstanding roster and revolutionize the game with numerous innovations.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: NFL Reaction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NFL Reaction</span></h3>
<p>As might be expected, the NFL did not welcome its new rival. In 1945, Layden remarked that the AAFC, still a year from playing its first game, should “first get a ball, then make a schedule, and then play a game.”<sup id="_ref-Official-AAFC_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-AAFC" title="">[1]</a></sup> This insult would be long remembered.</p>
<p>Washington Redskins owner <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Preston_Marshall_c1d2.html" title="George Preston Marshall">George Preston Marshall</a> was especially insulting regarding the AAFC. In 1945, he commented “I did not realize there was another league, although I did receive some literature telling about a WPA project”.<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge13_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge13" title="">[2]</a></sup> Later he declared, “The worst team in our league could beat the best team in theirs.”<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge64_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge64" title="">[3]</a></sup> After the AAFC put a franchise in Baltimore, Marshall’s opposition to it would be a major obstacle to interleague peace. Not coincidentally, his Redskins were badly hurt by the AAFC on the field. A top team from 1936 to 1945, the Redskins began a decades-long title drought after their coach and many key players defected to the AAFC in 1946.</p>
<p>For years, the NFL refused to officially recognize the existence of the AAFC. Layden’s successor, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Bell_fff1.html" title="Bert Bell">Bert Bell</a>, generally answered “no comment” to queries about the other league. In 1947, <i>Pro Football Illustrated</i> previewed both leagues in its annual publication and was banned from NFL stadiums.<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge50_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge50" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Prospects" id="Prospects"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: Prospects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prospects</span></h3>
<p>Notwithstanding this condescension, the AAFC posed a formidable challenge. In most interleague sports wars, the established league has major advantages over the challenger in prestige, finance, size, and public awareness. The NFL-AAFC war differed in several respects.</p>
<p>The NFL was in a far-from-ideal position to face competition, having struggled to survive World War II. The Cleveland Rams had suspended operations for 1943, and there were three instances of teams merging for a season.<sup id="_ref-merged_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-merged" title="">[5]</a></sup> One NFL team, the Boston Yanks, had played only one season as an independent entity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the AAFC had advantages not enjoyed by many challengers. It was founded by a key figure at one of the nation’s great newspapers, so it enjoyed ample attention in the press. The AAFC owners were wealthier than their NFL counterparts. Among them were Cleveland’s Mickey McBride (a real estate and taxi magnate), San Francisco’s Anthony Morabito (lumber), Chicago’s John L. Keeshin (trucking), and Los Angeles’ consortium of Benjamin Lindheimer (a racetrack owner), actor <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Ameche_c40e.html" title="Don Ameche">Don Ameche</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_B._Mayer_65ac.html" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> (of <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a>). The NFL owners were generally men whose primary assets were their teams.</p>
<p>The war’s end created an opening for a rival league. Many pro and college players, some of whom had played on base teams, were now leaving the military, so there was no shortage of talent available. Also, many of these collegians' original freshman classes had graduated, so they could be signed despite their remaining college eligibility.<sup id="_ref-Show16_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show16" title="">[6]</a></sup> The AAFC immediately attracted many of the best players in the country, including 40 of the 66 1946 College All-Stars, two recent Heisman Trophy winners (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinkwich_d54d.html" title="Frank Sinkwich">Frank Sinkwich</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelo_Bertelli_bc12.html" title="Angelo Bertelli">Angelo Bertelli</a>), and more than 100 players with NFL experience.<sup id="_ref-Total27_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Total27" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>This was also the time when air travel became viable. Like major league baseball, all of the NFL’s teams still played in the Northeast and Midwest, but the AAFC seized the opportunity to establish itself in open cities in Florida and California.</p>
<p>Yet it remained to be seen whether there was a market for this much pro football. Since achieving stability in the early 1930s, the NFL had never fielded more than 10 teams,<sup id="_ref-teams_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-teams" title="">[8]</a></sup> and none of its competitors had endured for more than two years. In 1946, there would be 18 teams in two leagues, including three in Chicago, three in New York, and two in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Baseball and college football were both substantially more popular. Longtime NFL president Joe Carr had said, "No owner has made money from pro football, but a lot have gone broke thinking they could."<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge53_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge53" title="">[9]</a></sup> At a time when the World Series had long been a national institution, and the Rose Bowl drew crowds of 90,000, the NFL's title game typically drew about 35,000 fans. Most pro teams played in baseball stadiums, some shared names with their city's baseball teams, and both leagues saw fit to chose college football legends as their commissioners.</p>
<p>There was even a sense that the college game's quality was better than that of the pros. The highlight of the 1946 season would be the famous Army-Notre Dame scoreless tie in Yankee Stadium. After the season, Arch Ward (the AAFC founder!) opined that these teams were each superior to either pro football champion.<sup id="_ref-Show222_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show222" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was in this sports landscape that the AAFC prepared to compete with the NFL.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: Maneuvers and intrigue">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Maneuvers and intrigue</span></h3>
<p>Early events in the NFL-AAFC war favored the AAFC.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Topping_86e7.html" title="Dan Topping">Dan Topping</a>, owner of the NFL’s <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Dodgers_%28NFL%29_4855.html" title="Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, wished to move his team from Ebbets Field into Yankee Stadium. New York Giants owner <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Mara_fbd7.html" title="Tim Mara">Tim Mara</a> had reason to be allergic to the idea: the Yankees had displaced the Giants as New York’s premier baseball team after moving into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_House_That_Ruth_Built_cb4d.html" title="The House That Ruth Built">The House That Ruth Built</a>, and no less than three rival football leagues had attempted to duplicate that feat by planting teams there. Mara had no desire to see the wealthier Topping, of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaconda_Copper_c6eb.html" title="Anaconda Copper">Anaconda Copper</a>, move into the crown jewel of American sport one mile away, and used his NFL territorial rights to block the move.</p>
<p>Not to be denied, Topping bought into the baseball Yankees, withdrew his football team from the NFL, and joined the AAFC. As a reward Topping’s rechristened AAFC New York Yankees received from each of the other seven teams $75,000, a pledge of $25,000, and one player.<sup id="_ref-Official-AAFC_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-AAFC" title="">[1]</a></sup> (Topping's team was never associated with either the AAFC's initial New York investor, who withdrew, or the AAFC's separate Brooklyn Dodgers franchise.)</p>
<p>Shortly after Topping defected, the NFL owners fired Commissioner Layden, replacing him with Bert Bell, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bell had already made a major contribution to the league: the NFL draft, first held in 1935, was his brainchild.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Rams_4b57.html" title="Cleveland Rams">Cleveland Rams</a> owner <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Reeves_%28NFL_owner%29_1639.html" title="Dan Reeves (NFL owner)">Dan Reeves</a> was tired of losing money in Cleveland, despite winning the 1945 NFL title. With competition from the AAFC Browns looming (already expected to be formidable thanks to coach Brown's prestige and relentless marketing by owner McBride), Reeves proposed to solve his problems by moving his franchise to Los Angeles. The NFL was very unenthusiastic about this move because of the resulting travel expenses, and permitted it only when Reeves threatened to withdraw from the league.<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge16_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge16" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was decidedly unprestigious for the NFL's champion to move at all, let alone partly to avoid a rival who had not yet played a game. On the other hand, this move established the NFL on the West Coast for the first time and contested the AAFC presence there.</p>

<p>The AAFC had made some ambitious choices, selecting stadiums in Chicago, New York, and Cleveland which were all larger than those used by the NFL. (In Cleveland, the Rams had played in League Park.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: 1946">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1946</span></h3>
<p>In the first-ever AAFC game, on September 6, 1946, the Cleveland Browns defeated the Miami Seahawks in Cleveland 44-0, before a pro record crowd of more than 60,000 fans. This historically significant game would prove a microcosm of much about the league:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to Paul Brown's superior organization and coaching methods, the Browns were on their way to setting a new standard of excellence for all of pro football.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Other teams would have significant problems on and off the field, but the Seahawks would become the AAFC’s most spectacular fiasco. The Seahawks finished with league’s worst record, never drew more than 10,000 for any of their home games, saw two games postponed due to hurricanes, ran up $80,000 in unpaid debts, and were ejected from the league after the season.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The crowd was the first of many large gates in the next four years that the AAFC’s most popular teams – Cleveland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York – would attract, surpassing the NFL.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The score, however, was the earliest sign of the AAFC’s greatest problem. The league would have some very good teams and some very poor teams, and the standings would be remarkably consistent from year to year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, this game marked the fall of pro football’s color line. The Browns had signed two black players, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion_Motley_854d.html" title="Marion Motley">Marion Motley</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Willis_36c0.html" title="Bill Willis">Bill Willis</a>, both of whom are today enshrined in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_81fe.html" title="Pro Football Hall of Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>. The NFL Rams, who opened several weeks later, had also signed two black players, UCLA great <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Washington_0353.html" title="Kenny Washington">Kenny Washington</a> and the future actor <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Strode_ad45.html" title="Woody Strode">Woody Strode</a>. The AAFC would be more willing to tap this talent pool than the NFL, employing 20 black players compared with the NFL’s 7 in 1949.<sup id="_ref-Show131_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show131" title="">[13]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the fiasco in Miami and some disorganization in Chicago, the AAFC enjoyed a successful first season. The Browns, Yankees, Dons, and 49ers were exciting teams and attracted big crowds. The Browns and Yankees both won their divisions decisively. The title game was a tight affair, with the Browns coming from behind late in the fourth quarter to defeat the Yankees 14-9.</p>
<p>With two leagues competing for players, salaries shot up. Both leagues’ did well at the gate (the NFL surpassing its prewar high for both the season and its title game), but the only teams to make a profit were the two champions, the Browns and the NFL Bears.<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge50_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge50" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="1947"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: 1947">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1947</span></h3>
<p>Commissioner Crowley stepped down to operate and coach the troubled Chicago Rockets. As it turned out, he would only serve one year in these capacities, although he had previously coached successfully at the college level. Admiral <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonas_H._Ingram_335e.html" title="Jonas H. Ingram">Jonas H. Ingram</a> was named to replace him as commissioner.</p>
<p>To replace the Seahawks, the Baltimore group turned down in 1945 was now issued a franchise. The new Baltimore Colts would play in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal_Stadium_%28Baltimore%29_1ab5.html" title="Municipal Stadium (Baltimore)">Municipal Stadium</a>. The Bisons were renamed the Bills. Meanwhile, the NFL added a 12th game to its schedule.</p>
<p>The AAFC enjoyed its most successful season in 1947. The Browns had attracted national attention, and in fact the entire coaching staff of the 1946 NFL champion Chicago Bears attended the Browns’ opening game. <sup id="_ref-Official-AAFC_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-AAFC" title="">[1]</a></sup> The 49ers obtained the rights to Army’s legendary Heisman-winning pair <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Blanchard_b1dd.html" title="Felix Blanchard">Felix Blanchard</a> ("Mr. Inside") and <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Woodward_Davis_be8e.html" title="Glenn Woodward Davis">Glenn Davis</a> ("Mr. Outside"), and amid great publicity attempted to get permission from the military to allow them to play during their post-graduation furloughs. (It was ultimately denied.) In September, a Yankees-Dons game in the Los Angeles Coliseum drew a new pro record of more than 82,000. On November 23, more than 70,000 in Yankee Stadium watched the Browns recover from a 28-0 deficit to tie the Yankees 28-28 in the most famous game in AAFC history. Once again, these two teams won their divisions decisively, and once again the Browns won the title game, this time 14-3.</p>
<p>By this time a pattern had emerged among the franchises. The Browns, Yankees, 49ers, Dons, and Bills had stable ownership and had all had at least one winning season. The champion Browns were the league’s attendance leader by a wide margin. The runner-up Yankees (playing in Yankee Stadium), Dons (playing in the huge Los Angeles Coliseum), 49ers and Bills (facing no major league competition) also were doing well at the gate.</p>
<p>However, the Dodgers, Rockets, and to a lesser extent the Colts were having serious problems. Playing near the Yankees and the NFL Giants, the Dodgers were drawing less than 12,000 fans per game, the least in either league. The Rockets, competing with the NFL's flagship Bears and the uncharacteristically successful Cardinals, were playing before tens of thousands of empty seats in huge Soldier Field. The first-year Colts, having Baltimore to themselves, did reasonably well at the gate but finished last. All of these teams were at the bottom of the standings and all were sold after the 1947 season, the Rockets for the second time.</p>
<p><a name="1948"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: 1948">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1948</span></h3>
<p>By 1948, the AAFC’s fortunes were starting to decline. The competitive imbalance between the league’s best and worst teams were affecting attendance, dropping this year even in Cleveland. Commissioner Ingram attempted to get the strongest teams to distribute some players to the weakest. The Yankees were overly generous and fell into mediocrity. Although Baltimore enjoyed its first good season, competitive imbalance peaked this year despite Ingram’s efforts. Cleveland won every game to finish 14-0. San Francisco won every game except for two close losses to Cleveland to finish 12-2. Meanwhile, Brooklyn went 2-12 and Chicago went 1-13 for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the AAFC, the Browns and 49ers were in the same division, while the other race was an embarrassment, ending in a tie between two 7-7 teams, Buffalo and Baltimore, just ahead of 6-8 New York. Instead of a classic Cleveland-San Francisco battle, the title game was a 49-7 mismatch between Cleveland and Buffalo.</p>
<p>With their victory in the title game, the Browns completed pro football's first perfect season. To this day, only the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_sports.html" title="1972 in sports">1972</a> <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_fba7.html" title="Miami Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> have done likewise. The Browns were also in the midst of an 18-game winning streak (unsurpassed until 2004) and a 29-game unbeaten streak.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, things were very different in the NFL.</p>
<p>The NFL had also had a problem with imbalance. Nearly every title game from 1933 to 1946 featured either the Giants or Redskins from the East against either the Bears or Packers from the West.</p>
<p>But in the late 1940s new powers rose in the NFL, as the Cardinals, Eagles, and Rams all won titles. The Steelers reached a tie-breaker playoff in 1947. All these teams had either merged or suspended operations during the war, and all had long histories of futility. (In fact, the Cardinals were winless from mid-1942 to mid-1945, including an 0-10 merged season with the Steelers.)</p>
<p>Adding to the drama, the division races were often tight, aided by Commissioner’s Bell’s policy of purposely matching strong teams early in the season to keep them from getting far ahead in the standings.<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge46_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge46" title="">[14]</a></sup> All this presented a sharp contrast to the AAFC.</p>
<p>By this time, thanks to the rise in player salaries, many teams in both leagues were suffering financially. Losses were enough by December 1948 to force the NFL to officially recognize the AAFC and begin peace talks. They broke down because the NFL was willing to admit only two teams: the Browns and 49ers.</p>
<p><a name="1949"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: 1949">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1949</span></h3>
<p>Commissioner Ingram stepped down, and another admiral, Oliver O. Kessing, was named to head the league.</p>
<p>As the war entered its fourth season, the financial problems forced some reorganization in both leagues. In the NFL, the champion Philadelphia Eagles lost money and were sold. Plagued by league-low attendance, the Boston Yanks moved to New York in a curious move. Yanks owner Ted Collins (like Dan Topping) had long desired a franchise in Yankee Stadium (thus his team’s name), and expected the AAFC and its Yankees to be gone in 1949. Instead, neither Yankee Stadium nor the Yanks name was available, so Collins had to change his team’s name (to the Bulldogs), accept a subordinate role in sharing the Polo Grounds with the Giants, and compete with two quality rivals for attendance.<sup id="_ref-Show126_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show126" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dodgers, the AAFC's least-drawing team, merged with the Yankees. The Rockets and Colts were both sold and continued their streaks of annual ownership changes. The Rockets were renamed the Hornets.</p>
<p>With the AAFC now down to 7 teams, it realigned into a single division and reduced its schedule to 12 games, still a double round-robin. The league also changed its postseason, with the top four teams now qualifying for the playoffs. With the second-best team in the league now guaranteed a postseason berth, the problem with the 1948 49ers and Bills would not recur. Also of note: for the first time in pro football, playoff <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home-field_advantage.html" title="Home-field advantage">home-field advantage</a> would be based on win-loss record, rather than rotating annually between divisions.</p>
<p>The lineup of the rival leagues was now:</p>

<p>Since 1934, the College All-Star Game had matched the defending NFL champions against an all-star team of graduated college seniors. The game was a major event on the sports calendar, as Rose Bowl-sized crowds (more than 105,000 in 1947)<sup id="_ref-ESPN_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN" title="">[16]</a></sup> watched college football’s best often hold their own with the pros. Held in late August at Soldier Field, the game was sponsored by the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> under the direction of sports editor Arch Ward.</p>
<p>Ward, of course, was also the founder of the AAFC. The game's contract between the <i>Tribune</i> and the NFL expired after the 1948 season. Ward refused to renew it, and attempted to share the All-Star Game's prestige with the AAFC by putting the Browns rather than the Eagles into his newspaper’s game. However, the NFL was able to convince the <i>Tribune’s</i> board to override Ward and force him to re-sign with the NFL, handing the AAFC an embarrassing defeat.<sup id="_ref-Official-AAFC_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-AAFC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The red ink on both sides continued to flow. Los Angeles Dons owner Ben Lindheimer was subsidizing the Colts and Hornets.<sup id="_ref-Coffin2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coffin2" title="">[17]</a></sup> The Green Bay Packers, then as now owned by a local civic group, had to issue new stock to remain solvent. <sup id="_ref-Official-GB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-GB" title="">[18]</a></sup> Now facing two cross-town rivals, the Bulldogs predictably had even lower attendance in New York than in Boston.</p>
<p>The 1949 season had a familiar story. Once again, the Browns led the way, threatened by one major rival. In early October, the 49ers handed the Browns their first loss in nearly two full years. This was the Browns’ least dominating season, finishing “only” 9-1-2. The 49ers stumbled, however, finishing second to the Browns for the fourth consecutive year. Both teams won their initial playoff game, so the two best teams in AAFC history finally met with the title at stake. In the league’s final game, the Browns defeated the 49ers 21-7.</p>
<p>With this victory, the Browns now owned a staggering 52-4-3 record and all four AAFC titles. Soon, the NFL would learn exactly how good they were.</p>

<p>On December 9, 1949, two days before the AAFC's last title game, the NFL and AAFC finally agreed to peace teams. Three AAFC teams were admitted to the older league: the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts. The Buffalo Bills, Brooklyn-New York Yankees, Chicago Hornets, and Los Angeles Dons folded. The enlarged league was renamed the National-American Football League.</p>
<p>The Browns and 49ers were obvious choices. Not so the Colts, an unlikely choice over the Bills as the third addition to the NFL. The playoff Bills had outperformed the last-place Colts on the field and at the gate. The Colts also played near the NFL Redskins, partly accounting for George Preston Marshall’s hawkishness. However, Buffalo’s small size (only Green Bay was smaller) and harsh winters were seen as problems,<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge76_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge76" title="">[19]</a></sup> while Marshall reversed himself and decided that the Colts could build an excellent rivalry with his Redskins, a decision aided by a $150,000 fee to waive his territorial rights.</p>
<p>Buffalo’s fans attempted to save their team, producing a petition drive<sup id="_ref-Show144_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show144" title="">[20]</a></sup> and more than 15,000 season ticket pledges and raising $175,000 in a stock offering.<sup id="_ref-Coffin19_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coffin19" title="">[21]</a></sup> However, Buffalo owner James Breuil was content to accept a minority share of the Browns, and the NFL was not inclined to add a fourth team. Although Buffalo would have priority in the NFL's almost non-existent expansion intentions in the late 1950s,<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge121_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge121" title="">[22]</a></sup> the city would have to wait until the 1960 advent of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a> to again have a pro team.</p>
<p>The players on the Yankees were divided between the NFL's two New York teams, with the Giants receiving their choice of any six players and the Bulldogs receiving the rest. Three players on the Bills were awarded to the Browns. The remaining players on the Bills, Dons, and Hornets entered a dispersal draft.</p>
<p>With the AAFC Yankees gone, Bulldogs owner Ted Collins now could finally call his team the New York Yanks and move into Yankee Stadium. This arrangement lasted only two years before Collins sold the team to Dallas interests.<sup id="_ref-Official-Defunct_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-Defunct" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In March 1950, the 13-team National-American Football League, ten of whom were NFL holdovers, voted to restore the league's former name. "National" and "American" would instead be the names of the league's new conferences. (These conferences did not evolve into the current NFL conferences, which were formed after the 1970 NFL-AFL merger). Three years later, the conferences were renamed Eastern and Western, eliminating the reminder of the NFL's defunct rival.</p>
<p>The enlarged NFL was aligned as follows:</p>

<p>Remarkably, although the AAFC was defeated, it actually outdrew its senior rival in terms of attendance. <sup id="_ref-Official-AAFC_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-AAFC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Why_did_the_AAFC_fail.3F" id="Why_did_the_AAFC_fail.3F"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: Why did the AAFC fail?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why did the AAFC fail?</span></h3>
<p>The AAFC began with better backing, larger stadiums, excellent press, and comparable talent. The AAFC surpassed the NFL at the gate. The AAFC’s champion was the best team in the country. Yet, in the end, the AAFC failed.</p>
<p>It is difficult to avoid concluding that the league failed because fans became bored with the Browns’ endless winning. Attendance dropped sharply during the AAFC’s later seasons, even in Cleveland. However, the league’s imbalance was not limited to Cleveland’s invincibility. San Francisco was strong every year. New York had three postseason appearances, Buffalo had two. Los Angeles was average but had some memorable moments. On the other hand, Chicago, Brooklyn, Miami, and Baltimore never had a winning season. Chicago went 1-13 twice, and had four owners in four years. Baltimore had three owners in three years. Miami swiftly went bankrupt.</p>
<p>One reason the Browns emerged as such a dominant team is that the AAFC did not hold a player draft before its first season. The AAFC instead encouraged its owners to sign as many good players as possible to compete with the NFL. However, because Paul Brown built the most systematic organization in either league, he had a head start in recruiting top players coming out of the colleges and the military. Jim Crowley, the AAFC’s commissioner at the time, later acknowledged this decision was a fatal mistake.<sup id="_ref-Total2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Total2" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>A less obvious conclusion is that the NFL won because of superior leadership. The AAFC played four seasons and had three commissioners. The NFL replaced Elmer Layden with Bert Bell as the war began. Bell, who served from 1946 until his death in 1959, proved to be an outstanding commissioner. Under his leadership, the NFL restored confidence after a gambling scandal in 1946, defeated the AAFC challenge, achieved lasting franchise stability, established an effective television policy, and entered a new era of prosperity climaxing in the famous 1958 title game.</p>
<p>Also, the NFL owners, while less wealthy than their AAFC counterparts, had a greater tolerance for losses, having operated during many lean years, including World War II.<sup id="_ref-Total2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Total2" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Had these factors been different, the AAFC might have achieved Arch Ward’s goal of an interleague championship. It would be another league, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a>, that would succeed in this in 1966.</p>

<p>After winning each of their four AAFC titles, the Browns challenged the NFL champion to an interleague championship. Unfortunately for fans, each year the NFL refused.<sup id="_ref-Show147_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show147" title="">[25]</a></sup> (Of course, the established NFL had nothing to gain in such a game.) Remarkably, even in December 1949 the Browns’ challenge was rejected, although they were now slated to face NFL competition the following year, as Commissioner Bert Bell maintained that the NFL constitution precluded such a game.<sup id="_ref-Coffin2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Coffin2" title="">[17]</a></sup> The football world had to wait to find out how they matched up against the NFL's best.</p>
<p>Although there never was an official AAFC-NFL playoff, an unofficial one took place on September 16, 1950. Bell appreciated that the Browns were now an important asset to the NFL, and scheduled a special Saturday night game between them and the NFL’s two-time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles to open the season. Although a regular-season game, and although the teams’ rosters were not identical to those nine months earlier, in many ways this showdown amounted to an interleague championship in all but name.</p>
<p>As with <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_I_2d19.html" title="Super Bowl I">Super Bowl I</a>, champions from two leagues that had never played an interleague game were about to meet. There was tremendous anticipation from fans and the press, which called the game “The World Series of Pro Football”.<sup id="_ref-MacCambridge64_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge64" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although the game was played in the Eagles’ home city, it was not played on their home field: because of the huge crowd expected, the game was moved from <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibe_Park_ac6c.html" title="Shibe Park">Shibe Park</a> to the site of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army-Navy_game_e959.html" title="Army-Navy game">Army-Navy game</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Municipal_Stadium_274b.html" title="Philadelphia Municipal Stadium">Philadelphia Municipal Stadium</a> (later renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium). Attendance was more than 71,000, one of the largest pro football crowds ever, surpassing all previous NFL and AAFC championship games. (This figure even tops the attendance of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_I_2d19.html" title="Super Bowl I">Super Bowl I</a> and nearly matches that of Super Bowls II and III.) There was even a most valuable player award, unheard of for a regular-season game.</p>
<p>As it turned out, “The World Series of Pro Football” resembled <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_III_d832.html" title="Super Bowl III">Super Bowl III</a> nearly two decades later. As with the 1968 <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Colts_4d7d.html" title="Baltimore Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a>, the 1948-49 Eagles were widely considered one of the NFL’s strongest-ever champions, while many discounted the Browns’ success in their “inferior” league. The result was just as shocking: the Eagles severely underestimated the highly motivated Browns (coach <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greasy_Neale_00cd.html" title="Greasy Neale">Greasy Neale</a> did not even scout the Browns’ preseason games),<sup id="_ref-Show162_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show162" title="">[26]</a></sup> while <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Brown_bd1e.html" title="Paul Brown">Paul Brown</a> found some previously unknown weaknesses in the widely imitated “Eagle Defense”. The Browns led 14-3 at halftime and dominated the rest of the game to win decisively, 35-10. Quarterback <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Graham_c274.html" title="Otto Graham">Otto Graham</a> was named the game’s MVP.</p>

<p>After the opening night drama, the Browns went on to go 10-2 to finish in a first-place tie with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a>. They then won the playoff 8-3 to qualify for the NFL championship game. Their opponent was a formidable <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Rams_42e3.html" title="Los Angeles Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> team that averaged nearly 39 points per game, a record that still stands. Ironically, this was the Rams’ first game in Cleveland since winning the 1945 NFL title as the Cleveland Rams. In a classic seesaw game, the Browns ultimately prevailed on a last-minute field goal, 30-28, to win their fifth consecutive league title.</p>
<p>The Browns’ 1950 championship season and particularly their victories over the Eagles and Rams confirmed the quality of their AAFC achievements as nothing else could. Five years after Commissioner Layden had told the Browns and the AAFC to get a football, Commissioner Bell called the Browns "the greatest team to ever play football.”<sup id="_ref-Show182_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Show182" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the Rams denied the Browns a sixth consecutive title in a 1951 title game rematch, the Browns played in every NFL title game from 1950 to 1955 and won three of them, for a grand total of seven titles in ten years.</p>
<p>The other ex-AAFC teams did not fare nearly as well.</p>
<p>The 49ers, the AAFC's second-best team, struggled in 1950 and finished 3-9. However, starting the next year they emerged as one of the better teams in the NFL’s Western Conference, reaching the postseason in 1957 after some near-misses.</p>
<p>The Colts' prospects were not promising: they had finished 1-11 and last in the AAFC in 1949 and also faced the handicap of playing near the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. In 1950, the Colts went 1-11 again and disbanded. Their legacy lived on, however: three years later, a new Baltimore Colts franchise was established and became one of the NFL’s storied teams.</p>

<p>One notable difference between the All-America Football Conference and the American Football League (AFL), which merged with the NFL two decades later, is that the records and statistics of AAFC players and teams are not included in the NFL record book, while those of their AFL counterparts are. For example, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Namath_dedd.html" title="Joe Namath">Joe Namath</a>'s pre-1970 statistics with the AFL <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> are considered official NFL statistics, while <a href="../../../y/2E/a/Y.A._Tittle_ab65.html" title="Y.A. Tittle">Y.A. Tittle</a>'s pre-1950 statistics with the AAFC Baltimore Colts are not.</p>
<p>According to the NFL, this is because official scoresheets of AAFC games were not made available to the NFL after the merger. Without official scoresheets, the NFL could not verify the authenticity of any AAFC statistics or records and so chose to ignore them. However, in the case of the NFL-AFL merger completed in 1970, the AFL gave all of its official scoresheets to the NFL making it possible for the NFL to accept the AFL's statistics and records.</p>
<p>Another explanation is the fact that although the AAFC achieved the admission of three of its teams, the final merger was not an agreement between equals. The AFL, on the other hand, was able to force the NFL to accept every one of its teams into a new enlarged league and to play an interleague title game on a neutral field. The general attitude of superiority expressed throughout the war by NFL figures such as Marshall and commissioners Layden and Bell is also suggestive, as is the disappearance of "American" from the merged league's name. From this perspective, it is not surprising that the AFL's statistics were recognized and the AAFC's were not.</p>
<p>Despite this, however, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_81fe.html" title="Pro Football Hall of Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> does recognize AAFC statistics,<sup id="_ref-Official-Introduction_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-Introduction" title="">[28]</a></sup> and the defunct but significant conference is memorialized in Canton.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="Edit section: The AAFC legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The AAFC legacy</span></h3>
<p>Although the AAFC played only four years, it had a major, lasting impact on pro football. Of all the leagues that challenged the NFL, only the American Football League of the 1960s influenced the NFL more than the AAFC.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and original Baltimore Colts began in the AAFC.</p>
<p>Fifteen AAFC alumni (thirteen players and two coaches) are enshrined in pro football’s Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>The AAFC played a 14-game schedule more than a decade before the NFL adopted it, and played a major role in popularizing zone defenses in pro football.<sup id="_ref-Official-AAFC_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Official-AAFC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AAFC put the first pro football teams in Baltimore, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami. Indeed, the AAFC was a coast-to-coast league more than a decade before major league baseball. This brought about another innovation: AAFC teams traveled by air while NFL teams still traveled by train.</p>
<p>Black players were excluded from the NFL from 1934 to 1945. The AAFC helped reintegrate the pro game in 1946 when Cleveland signed <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion_Motley_854d.html" title="Marion Motley">Marion Motley</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Willis_36c0.html" title="Bill Willis">Bill Willis</a> while the NFL Rams signed <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Washington_%28American_football%29_16f1.html" title="Kenny Washington (American football)">Kenny Washington</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Strode_ad45.html" title="Woody Strode">Woody Strode</a>. Not coincidentally, by decades' end these two teams were the best in pro football.</p>
<p>The AAFC’s Paul Brown produced numerous innovations to the game on and off the field. Among them were year-round coaching staffs, precision pass patterns, the face mask, and the practice of coaches’ calling plays via “messenger guards”. His success with the Browns forced the rest of both leagues to adopt his methods. Many of his players and assistants eventually coached champions. Brown declined efforts to draft him to succeed Bert Bell as NFL commissioner, <sup id="_ref-MacCambridge137_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MacCambridge137" title="">[29]</a></sup> later founded the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bengals_5178.html" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, and served on the NFL’s key Competition Committee until his death in 1991.<sup id="_ref-Total2_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Total2" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>These and other AAFC innovations and personalities helped lay the groundwork for the NFL’s great success.</p>
