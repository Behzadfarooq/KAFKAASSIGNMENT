<p>Ginsberg was born into a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> family in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark%2C_New_Jersey_17a7.html" title="Newark, New Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>. He grew up in nearby <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paterson%2C_New_Jersey_6d06.html" title="Paterson, New Jersey">Paterson</a>. His father <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Ginsberg_d488.html" title="Louis Ginsberg">Louis Ginsberg</a> was a poet and a high school teacher. Ginsberg's mother, Naomi Levy Ginsberg (who was affected by <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epileptic_seizures.html" title="Epileptic seizures">epileptic seizures</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_illness.html" title="Mental illness">mental illnesses</a> such as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a><sup id="_ref-Modern_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern" title="">[1]</a></sup>) was an active member of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_USA_850c.html" title="Communist Party USA">Communist Party USA</a> and often took Ginsberg and his brother Eugene to party meetings. Ginsberg later said that his mother "Made up bedtime stories that all went something like: 'The good king rode forth from his castle, saw the suffering workers and healed them.'"<sup id="_ref-BioProject_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BioProject" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a teenager, Ginsberg began to write letters to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> about political issues such as <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and workers' rights.<sup id="_ref-BioProject_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BioProject" title="">[2]</a></sup> When he was a junior in high school, he accompanied his mother by bus to her therapist. The trip disturbed Ginsberg and he mentioned it in his long autobiographical poem "<a href="../../../k/a/d/Kaddish_%28poem%29.html" title="Kaddish (poem)">Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894-1956)</a>."<sup id="_ref-Modern_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern" title="">[1]</a></sup> This and other moments from his childhood dealing with his paranoid mother end up in the poem. While in high school, Ginsberg began reading <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Whitman_fc20.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>; he said he was inspired by his teacher's passion in reading.</p>
<p>In 1943 Ginsberg graduated from <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastside_High_School_%28Paterson%2C_New_Jersey%29_df52.html" title="Eastside High School (Paterson, New Jersey)">Eastside High School</a> and briefly attended <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montclair_State_University_05ef.html" title="Montclair State University">Montclair State University</a> before entering <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> on a scholarship from the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Men%27s_Hebrew_Association_047e.html" title="Young Men's Hebrew Association">Young Men's Hebrew Association</a> of Paterson, (1949).<sup id="_ref-obit_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-obit" title="">[3]</a></sup> While at Columbia, Ginsberg contributed to the <i>Columbia Review</i> literary journal, the <i><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jester_of_Columbia_19b1.html" title="Jester of Columbia">Jester</a></i> humour magazine, won the Woodberry Poetry Prize and served as President of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philolexian_Society_1113.html" title="Philolexian Society">Philolexian Society</a> debate club.</p>
<p><a name="New_York_Beats" id="New_York_Beats"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Edit section: New York Beats">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New York Beats</span></h3>
<p>In Ginsberg's freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucien_Carr_468f.html" title="Lucien Carr">Lucien Carr</a>, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers including <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_S._Burroughs_4c27.html" title="William S. Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Clellon_Holmes_253d.html" title="John Clellon Holmes">John Clellon Holmes</a>. They bonded because they saw in one another excitement about the potential of the youth of America, a potential which existed outside the strict conformist confines of post-WWII McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a "New Vision" (a phrase adapted from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rimbaud_4c24.html" title="Arthur Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a>) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a>, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup> Kerouac later described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady in the first chapter of his 1957 novel <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Road_e0ec.html" title="On the Road">On the Road</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Modern_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern" title="">[1]</a></sup> Kerouac saw them then as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their "New Vision." Kerouac's perception had to do partly with Ginsberg's association with Communism (though Ginsberg himself was never a Communist); Kerouac called Ginsberg "Carlo Marx" in <i>On the Road</i>. This was a source of strain in their relationship since Kerouac grew increasingly distrustful of Communism.</p>
<p>In 1948 in an apartment in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlem.html" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">William Blake</a> reading his poems "<a href="../../../a/h/%2C/Ah%2C_Sunflower_a1af.html" title="Ah, Sunflower">Ah, Sunflower</a>," "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sick_Rose_412f.html" title="The Sick Rose">The Sick Rose</a>," and "Little Girl Lost" (later referred to as his "Blake vision"). Ginsberg was reading these poems at the time, and he said he was very familiar with them; at one point he claimed he heard them being read by what sounded like the voice of God but what he interpreted as the voice of Blake himself. He had at that moment what he claimed to be pivotal revelations that defined his understanding of the universe. He believed that he witnessed then the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and concluded some hand had crafted that, or rather the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He claimed that this "vision" was not inspired by drug use, but he said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs.</p>
<p>Also in New York, Ginsberg met <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a> in a bar and introduced him to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting Corso said he'd been fantasizing about a woman who lived across the street from him. The woman just happened to be Ginsberg's girlfriend during one of his sporadic forays into heterosexuality. It was also during this period that Ginsberg was romantically involved with <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elise_Cowen_c1c9.html" title="Elise Cowen">Elise Cowen</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Edit section: San Francisco Renaissance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">San Francisco Renaissance</span></h3>
<p>In 1954 in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, Ginsberg met <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Orlovsky_3f36.html" title="Peter Orlovsky">Peter Orlovsky</a>, a young man of 21 with whom he fell in love and who remained his life-long lover, and with whom he eventually shared his interest in <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_Buddhism_3b98.html" title="Tibetan Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</a>.</p>
<p>Also in San Francisco Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg's mentor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carlos_Williams_dd5e.html" title="William Carlos Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figure head <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Rexroth_0f2c.html" title="Kenneth Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a> who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. Ginsberg also met there three accomplished poets and <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen</a> enthusiasts who were friends at <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_College_ce98.html" title="Reed College">Reed College</a>: <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Whalen_c5f0.html" title="Philip Whalen">Philip Whalen</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Welch_9f93.html" title="Lew Welch">Lew Welch</a>.</p>
<p>He met <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McClure_8fef.html" title="Michael McClure">Michael McClure</a> at a <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._H._Auden_5ce7.html" title="W. H. Auden">W. H. Auden</a> reading where they struck up a conversation about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">Blake</a>. McClure was planning a poetry reading at the Six Gallery where <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Duncan_4f59.html" title="Robert Duncan">Robert Duncan</a>'s play "Faust Foutu" had previously been performed. But McClure handed the duties off to Ginsberg. Ginsberg advertised the event as "Six Poets at the Six Gallery." One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as "The <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Gallery_reading_fb24.html" title="Six Gallery reading">Six Gallery reading</a>" took place on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">October 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>.<sup id="_ref-npr_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npr" title="">[5]</a></sup> The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg: that night was the first public reading of "Howl", a poem that brought world-wide fame to Ginsberg and many of the poets associated with him.</p>
<p>Ginsberg's principal work, "<a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a>", is well-known to many for its opening line: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked." "Howl" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication due to the rawness of its language, which is frequently explicit. Shortly after its 1956 publication by <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Lights_Bookstore_3e0b.html" title="City Lights Bookstore">City Lights Bookstore</a>, it was banned for obscenity.

<p>Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac's <i>Duluoz Legend</i>). <i>Howl</i> is not only a biography of Ginsberg's experiences before 1955, but a history of the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a>. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of <i>Howl</i> was his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though <i>Kaddish</i> deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a similar line-by-line analysis would be both overly-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), <i>Howl</i> in many ways is driven by that same emotion. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, <i>Howl</i>, his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start. <i>See <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html#Specific_References_in_.22Howl.22" title="Howl">Howl</a></i></p>

<p>Though "Beat" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term "Beat Generation" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. (Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name "Beat Generation") Part of the dissatisfaction with the term "Beat Generation" came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader. He did, however, claim many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kaufman_3a3b.html" title="Bob Kaufman">Bob Kaufman</a>; <a href="../../../l/e/r/LeRoi_Jones_b808.html" title="LeRoi Jones">LeRoi Jones</a> before he became <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiri_Baraka_5316.html" title="Amiri Baraka">Amiri Baraka</a>, who, after reading "Howl", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper; <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_DiPrima_af51.html" title="Diane DiPrima">Diane DiPrima</a>; poets associated with the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mountain_College_8aac.html" title="Black Mountain College">Black Mountain College</a> such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Creeley_5801.html" title="Robert Creeley">Robert Creeley</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denise_Levertov_b38f.html" title="Denise Levertov">Denise Levertov</a>; poets associated with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_School_3622.html" title="New York School">New York School</a> such as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_O%27Hara_27bf.html" title="Frank O'Hara">Frank O'Hara</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Koch_1471.html" title="Kenneth Koch">Kenneth Koch</a>.</p>

He succumbed to liver cancer via complications of <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepatitis.html" title="Hepatitis">hepatitis</a>. He was 70 years old. Ginsberg continued to write through his final illness, with his last poem "Things I'll Not Do (Nostalgias)" written on March 30.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ginsberg is buried in his family plot in Gomel Chesed Cemetery, one of a cluster of Jewish cemeteries at the corner of McClellan Street and Mt. Olivet Avenue near the city lines of Elizabeth and Newark, New Jersey. The family plot, located toward the western edge of the cemetery at the far end of the walk from the third gate along Mt. Olivet Avenue, is marked by a large Ginsberg and Litzky stone, and Ginsberg himself and each family member have smaller markers. Though the grave itself and the cemetery are neither picturesque nor otherwise notable (Ginsberg's grave is located near the rear fence of the flat cemetery, which is in the midst of an industrial area), and it has not become a major place of pilgrimage, there is a steady trickle of visitors as indicated by a handful of stones always on his marker and the occasional book or other item left by other poets and admirers.</p>
<p>It would be unfair to Ginsberg and history to omit mention of his involvement with <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. Ginsberg befriended <a href="../../../a/2E/c/A.C._Bhaktivedanta_Swami_Prabhupada_dd13.html" title="A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada">A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hare_Krishna_734d.html" title="Hare Krishna">Hare Krishna</a> movement in the Western world, a relationship that is documented by Satsvarupa Gosvami in his biographical account based on oral history, Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta. Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and subsequently toured with him to promote his cause. Ginsberg also claimed to be the first person on the North American continent to chant the Hare Krsna mantra, several years before the Swami's arrival in New York. Ginsberg was mourned by the Hare Krsnas upon his passing in 1997.</p>

<p>Ginsberg's willingness to talk about taboo subjects is what made him a controversial figure in the conservative 1950s and a significant figure in the 1960s. But Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Huncke_39ae.html" title="Herbert Huncke">Herbert Huncke</a>: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction.

<p>Likewise, he continuously attempted to force the world into a dialogue about controversial subjects because he thought that no change could be made in a polite silence.</p>

<p>Ginsberg also played a key role in ensuring that a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> protest of the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_war.html" title="Vietnam war">Vietnam war</a> which took place at the Oakland-Berkeley city line and drew several thousand marchers, was not violently interrupted by the California chapter of the notorious motorcycle gang — the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell%27s_Angels_00c3.html" title="Hell's Angels">Hell's Angels</a> — and their leader, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Barger_187b.html" title="Sonny Barger">Sonny Barger</a>.</p>
<p>The day prior to the scheduled march, the Hell's Angels attacked the front line of a smaller scale protest where a confrontation between police and demonstrators was brewing. The Hell's Angels came in on motocycles and slashed banners while yelling "Go back to Russia, you fucking communists!" at the protesters. The Hell's Angels then vowed to disrupt the larger protest the next day.</p>
<p>Ginsberg traveled to Barger's home in <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland</a> to talk the situation through. It is rumored that he offered Barger and other members of the Hell's Angels <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a> as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. In the end, Barger and the other Hell's Angels that were present came away deeply impressed by the courage of Ginsberg and his companion Kesey. They vowed not to attack the next day's protest march and furthermore deemed Ginsberg a man who was worth helping out.</p>

<p>One contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, including his love of youths. Ginsberg was an early proponents of freedom for men who loved other men, having already in 1943 discovered within himself "mountains of homosexuality." He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry. He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Orlovsky_3f36.html" title="Peter Orlovsky">Peter Orlovsky</a>, his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his Who’s Who entry. Later homosexual writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor.</p>
<p>Also, in writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent he challenged — and ultimately changed — obscenity laws.

<p>Ginsberg also spoke out in defense of the freedom of expression of <a href="../../../n/a/m/NAMBLA_7d55.html" title="NAMBLA">NAMBLA</a>. He saw that organization's right to exist as a civil liberties issue and joined to make a statement. According to Ginsberg in "Thoughts on NAMBLA" published in <i>Deliberate Prose</i>: "NAMBLA's a forum for reform of those laws on youthful sexuality which members deem oppressive, a discussion society not a sex club. I joined NAMBLA in defense of free speech."

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Edit section: Inspiration from friends">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inspiration from friends</span></h3>
<p>Since Ginsberg's poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">beat generation</a> comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg's friends.</p>
<p>Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac's concept of Spontaneous Prose. He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. However, Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of "Howl" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing "negro" and "angry" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry.</p>
<p>An important figure when considering inspiration for "Howl" is Carl Solomon. The full title is "Howl for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Solomon_0f21.html" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a>." Solomon was a <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dada</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artaud.html" title="Artaud">Artaud</a>) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">therapy</a>, including <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroconvulsive_therapy.html" title="Electroconvulsive therapy">electroshock therapy</a>. Much of the final section of the first part of "Howl" is a description of this.</p>
<p>Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of "<a href="../../../m/o/l/Moloch.html" title="Moloch">Moloch</a>." Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_gods.html" title="Semitic gods">Levantine god</a> to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Rexroth_0f2c.html" title="Kenneth Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a> poem "Thou Shalt Not Kill," a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, <a href="../../../d/y/l/Dylan_Thomas_e0bc.html" title="Dylan Thomas">Dylan Thomas</a>. But <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moloch.html" title="Moloch">Moloch</a> is mentioned a few times in the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by the Francis <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drake_Hotel_3fdc.html" title="Drake Hotel">Drake Hotel</a> in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> America focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms.</p>
<p>He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to <i>defy</i> socially created systems of control — and therefore go against Moloch — is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in "Howl", such as <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Huncke_39ae.html" title="Herbert Huncke">Herbert Huncke</a>, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of "Howl" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Solomon_0f21.html" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a>, the prime example of a "best mind" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line "with mother finally ******" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says "I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother." Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write "Howl" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly.

<p>Ginsberg's <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> was strongly influenced by <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernism.html" title="Modernism">Modernism</a> (specifically <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Pound_79cc.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._S._Eliot_4975.html" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hart_Crane_5156.html" title="Hart Crane">Hart Crane</a>, and most importantly <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carlos_Williams_dd5e.html" title="William Carlos Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>), <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> (specifically <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Shelley_2952.html" title="Percy Shelley">Percy Shelley</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keats_3200.html" title="John Keats">John Keats</a>), the beat and cadence of <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> (specifically that of <a href="../../../b/o/p/Bop.html" title="Bop">bop</a> musicians such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a>), and his <a href="../../../k/a/g/Kagyu.html" title="Kagyu">Kagyu</a> <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> practice and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">William Blake</a>, and the American poet <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Whitman_fc20.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>. The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration which he claimed.</p>
<p>He studied poetry under <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carlos_Williams_dd5e.html" title="William Carlos Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paterson_%28poem%29.html" title="Paterson (poem)">Paterson</a> about the industrial city near his home. Ginsberg, after attending a reading by Williams, sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like "Thee." Williams hated the poems. He told Ginsberg later, "In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect."</p>
<p>Though he hated the early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg's letter. He included the letter in a later part of <i>Paterson</i>. He taught Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. Williams taught him to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams' own motto "No ideas but in things." His time studying under Williams led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to the brilliance of his later work. Early breakthrough poems include "Bricklayer's Lunch Hour" and "Dream Record."</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Solomon_0f21.html" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a> introduced him to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonin_Artaud_5c9d.html" title="Antonin Artaud">Antonin Artaud</a> ("To Have Done with the Judgement of God" and "Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society"), and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Genet_ee64.html" title="Jean Genet">Jean Genet</a> (<i>Our Lady of the Flowers</i>). <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Lamantia_5e3a.html" title="Philip Lamantia">Philip Lamantia</a> introduced him to other <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealists.html" title="Surrealists">Surrealists</a> and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of <i>Kaddish</i> were inspired by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Breton_0241.html" title="Andre Breton">Andre Breton</a>'s "Free Union"). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of "Howl" and other poems was inspired by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Smart_20b7.html" title="Christopher Smart">Christopher Smart</a> in such poems as <i>Jubilate Agno</i>. Ginsberg claims other more traditional influences, such as: <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Kafka_d4e6.html" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a>, <a href="../../../f/y/o/Fyodor_Dostoevsky_0fbb.html" title="Fyodor Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, and even <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Dickinson_0e72.html" title="Emily Dickinson">Emily Dickinson</a>.</p>
<p>Ginsberg also made an intense study of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiku.html" title="Haiku">haiku</a> and the paintings of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cezanne_df88.html" title="Paul Cezanne">Paul Cezanne</a> from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the "Eyeball Kick." He noticed in viewing Cezanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would <a href="../../../s/a/c/Saccade.html" title="Saccade">spasm</a>, or "kick." Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiku.html" title="Haiku">haiku</a>. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was "hydrogen jukebox" (which later became the title of an opera he wrote with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Glass_45ef.html" title="Philip Glass">Philip Glass</a>). The phrases "eyeball kick" and "hydrogen jukebox" both show up in "Howl" as well as a direct quote from Cezanne: "Pater Omnipitens Aeterna Deus."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Edit section: Style and technique">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Style and technique</span></h3>
<p>From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friends — not to mention his own experiments — Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that's easily identified as Ginsbergian. <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a></i> came out during a potentially hostile literary environment less welcoming to poetry outside of tradition; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Criticism_ed66.html" title="New Criticism">New Criticism</a> (see "Open Form vs. Closed Form" in the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a> section). Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to break away from traditional poetic structure, often citing Williams, Pound, and Whitman as precursors. Ginsberg's style may have seemed to critics chaotic or unpoetic, but to Ginsberg it was an open, ecstatic expression of his thoughts and feelings. He believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and didn't apply to reality. Though some, Diana Trilling for example, have pointed to Ginsberg's occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of "who came back to Denver and waited in vain"), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that meter follows the natural poetic voice, not the other way around; he said, as he learned from Williams, that natural speech is occasionally dactylic, so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only ever accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg's line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in <i>Howl</i>, for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths (saying perhaps it was because he talked fast, or he did yoga, or he was Jewish). The long line could also be traced back to his study of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Whitman_fc20.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>; Ginsberg claimed Whitman's long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further. Whitman is often compared to Ginsberg because they both had sexual interests in men, although there is no hard evidence to suggest that Whitman ever consummated his same-sex attraction. Despite this oft-quoted affinity, they had very different politics, Whitman being a nationalist and Ginsberg demonstratively anti-nationalist.</p>
<p>Many of his early long line experiments contain some sort of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaphoric.html" title="Anaphoric">anaphoric</a> repetition or repetition of a "fixed base" (for example "who" in <i>Howl</i>, "America" in "America"), and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg's style. However, he claimed later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence in his style; he didn't yet trust "free flight." In the 60s, after employing it in some sections of <i>Kaddish</i> ("caw" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric repetition.</p>
<p>Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole become regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of <i>Howl</i> each line is in a "stepped triadic" format reminiscent of Williams (see "Ivy Leaves," for example). He abandoned the "stepped triadic" when he developed his long line, but the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of <i>The Fall of America</i>. <i>Howl</i> and <i>Kaddish</i>, arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In "America" he experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines.</p>
<p>Ginsberg called one of his favorite techniques the "eyeball kick" or the "ellipse"; it is a paratactical juxtaposition of two starkly dissimilar images. The line in <i>Howl</i> starting "who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue" contains several examples of eyeball kicks, such as "mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors." The eyeball kick is not only a way to describe the juxtaposition of words, but the structure of poems as a whole and the flow of ideas within poems, the shift between each section of <i>Howl</i> for example. In the following selection "yellow shadow" is an example of an eyeball kick, and the last line of the selection is an example of the haiku-like paratactical shift common in Ginsberg's poetry.</p>
<p><i>"Lightning's blue glare fills Oklahoma plains,</i> <i>the train rolls east</i> <i>casting yellow shadow on grass</i> <i>Twenty years ago</i> <i>approaching Texas,</i> <i>I saw</i> <i>sheet lightning</i> <i>cover Heaven's corners...</i> <i>An old man catching fireflies on the porch at night</i> <i>watched the Herd Boy cross the Milky Way</i> <i>to meet the Weaving Girl...</i> <i>How can we war against that?"</i> (From Iron Horse, 1972)</p>
<p>Ginsberg also commonly employed <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catachresis.html" title="Catachresis">catachresis</a>. For example, from <i>Howl</i>: "secret gas station solipsisms of johns" is perhaps designed to make <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solipsism.html" title="Solipsism">solipsism</a> (a noun used as a verb here) sound like a sexual act. Another example is "what peaches and what penumbra" from "Supermarket in California" is perhaps designed to make <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penumbra.html" title="Penumbra">penumbra</a> seem like a fruit or like something you can buy in a supermarket.</p>
