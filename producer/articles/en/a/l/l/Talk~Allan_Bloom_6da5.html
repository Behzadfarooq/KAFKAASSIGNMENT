<p>This article isn't NPOV, particularly the summaries of his work. I mean, "demagogic radicals as exemplified by 60's student leaders could leap"? Yeah, the 60s student leaders agitating against segregation were "demagogic radicals." The article's not hagiographic, but it's way too pro-Bloom to be neutral.

This is NPOV in that it is a neutral account of his thought. His book makes that analogy over and over and over again. To critique it on the main page would not be NPOV, but we always have the discussion pages, so feel free. --Rexrexilius 06:34, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Trimmed some points about the <i>Closing of the American Mind</i>, since they seemed to be in violation of the POV goal. Whoever wrote the new material, added to the article quite a bit, but it seemed to cross the line into personal assessment too much.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks to mikerussell for his contributions. I disagree that my edits went too far into "POV"-- the only part that I would agree could be seen that way was the part about "Closing of the American Mind" being filled with "doom and foreboding." Part of what I edited removed POV as well, I should add. While the sections properly noted Allan Bloom's esotericism (see, for example, the article on his mentor <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Strauss_3b93.html" title="Leo Strauss">Leo Strauss</a>), it would be wrong to suggest that his "right-wing" readers simply misunderstood him. His "political" message was important (Why did he choose that political message in a liberal society?). I also disagree with mikerussell's comments in "history" about "culture" being a word not used by Bloom. I quote from pages 185-186:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The interesting response to the nature-society tension, much more fertile than the return to, or nostalgia for, nature, can be summed up by the word "culture". It seems to mean something high, profound, respectable--a thing before which we bow. <i>It joins nature as a standard for the judgment of men and their deeds but has even greater dignity.</i> It is almost never used perjoratively, as are "society," "state," "nation," or even "civilization," terms for which culture is gradually substituted, or whose legitimacy is underwritten by culture. Culture is the unity of man's brutish nature and all the arts and sciences he acquired in his movement from the state of nature to civil society. Culture restores the lost wholeness of first man <i>on a higher level, where his faculties can be fully developed without contradiction between the desires of nature and the moral imperatives of social life.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the next page, he writes: "The progress of culture provides the link between inclination and duty. Kant uses the education of sexual desire as an example. Naturally man has the desire to have sexual intercourse and hence to procreate. But he has no desire to care for his children or educate them, even though the growth of their faculties requires prolonged maintenance and training. So the family is necessary." After suggesting that the family sublimates nature, he then writes: "<i>The free choice of marriage and the capacity to stick to it, not merely outwardly but inwardly, is a proof of culture, of desire informed by civility.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, understanding the role of "culture" in Bloom's work is absolutely critical to understanding his philosophy. When Bloom talks of culture, he means in part "high culture" like Beethoven. Rock music, for Bloom, is not "culture" at all. user: 209.89.229.30 (<b>this is me, rexrexilius, before my account was set up</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are right, I think I was not doing the word 'culture'; justice in Bloom's thought. My own personal distaste for using the word as a 'catch-all' for everything from <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> culture (thousands of years old, sacred to many) to<a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_culture.html" title="Drug culture">Drug culture</a> (people who use narcotics share certain characteristics, i.e. <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a>, attire, poverty, etc) made me loose sight of the point you correctly make. Namely- what is culture? or what is <i>real</i> culture? personally, i just think when you use it too much, it can mutilate very significant differences, as in the example above.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 06:57, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There appear to be several references to Bloom's own sexuality, and 'interesting' absence of its mention in his works. Recommend that the primacy of this point is removed as it is irrelevant to his philosophical outlook and commentaries on society.--<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.254.0.38.html" title="User:62.254.0.38">62.254.0.38</a> 14:21, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not sure I understand your point exactly. I hope you return and give a fuller statement on the concern. Pardon my daftness, but what do you mean by 'primacy of this point' and 'irrelevant to his philosophical outlook and commentaries on society'. How so is it relevant or irrelevant, and do you, or anybody, really know what type of impact it had on his thought? i would almost think that question is worthy of masters, or Ph.D. thesis. I wonder how or if it affected his thought positively or negatively? Maybe being an 'outsider' sort of speak made him a unique thinker, but maybe not? It might have had no effect. Is that what you believe/suggest?--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 06:57, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are a number of factors that make it of topical interest. 1. Few people who follow Bloom (or "Straussianism") have not made the connection between Saul Bellow's <i>Ravelstein</i> and Bloom (Bellow was a close friend of Bloom's, who apparently was "recruited" by Bloom to write a book about Bloom's personal life); 2. It isn't just "conservatives" (like me) who have shown an interest in Bloom, but people interested in Gay Studies as well: <a href="http://www.indegayforum.org/authors/sullivan/sullivan3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.indegayforum.org/authors/sullivan/sullivan3.html" rel="nofollow">Obituary in Independent Gay Forum</a>--no one can "own" a writer--does anyone "own" Plato? 3. It is of academic interest (as a political science student, Bloom's homosexuality was drawn to my attention by my professors/his former students a decade before <i>Ravelstein</i> came out). 4. On some level, it could be argued that his style of writing, his views on morality etc. compel a closer look at his personal life. So, while it would be mistaken to assume that you can interpret everything Bloom wrote in light of his sexuality, it would also be a mistake to dismiss it entirely. The issue is a complex one precisely because of the complexity of his writing. --Rexrexilius 07:27, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>[Original posting] I think my problem with the point was partly one of taste. One may access this page for a summary of the philosophical thoughts of such a brilliant mind, and instead be fed private details (I myself had no knowledge nor desire to know of Bloom's sexuality prior to reading it), with the excuse that they are 'interesting' specifically because he did not mention them. It seemed to reflect society's obsession with celebrity more than it was a serious intellectual point. Bloom appears not to consider his own sexuality important to his philosophy. Furthermore, a psychoanalytical analysis of the effect of his sexuality on his works that you advocate seems to me to have a profound irony about it, in that it adheres to the pseudo-scientific Freudian approach that he himself argues so strongly against. Having said that, I accept your interesting responses and withdraw the criticism. The issue is indeed complex the more I think about it - better included than excluded seems to be the Wikipedia mentality.--Ojas 01:45, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that two reverts were done recently on this page, and I'd like to find out why. The article has had two paragraphs making a comparison to romeo and juliet for quite a while, but they were edited out, then reverted back in, and then reverted back out again. While I am in no position to judge whether the paragraphs are worthy of being in the article, I do know that they have been in the article for a while now, and this is enough to warrant either a modification of the paragraphs to make them acceptable, or else a justification <i>must</i> be given for why they were summarily removed. Remember, on Wikipedia, the burden of proof is on the person removing information from an article, and <i>not</i> on the person adding information to an article. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 20:54, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was not the first person to get rid of that passage (I did read your message on my talk page) . I reverted to the first person who did. I just thought that the passage went abit beyond an encyclopaedic summary and into analysis. But, I have reverted it back, as you are right, it was present for a long time. --Rexrexilius 03:49, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. This does not make sense to me- why not just subtract it from the HTML code and place it on the TALK page as I have done right now, instead of leaving the comments embedded in the text. These comments in the body of the text seem rather sub terrain and esoteric- meaning newcomers may not understand what it is doing in the HTML edit box. perhaps it is more common in Wikipedia than I know, but I don't think it is good standard practice.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 04:42, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</p>
<p>2. I wrote the above quote, and if 'Pagan Platonism' needs no further explanation then so be it, but I suspect many readers will not understand the context in which 'pagan' is used as a simple adjective which defines Platonism in contra distinction to Platonism or the much more widely accepted 'Christian Platonism'; furthermore, it may be very erroneously interpreted as being synonymous with Jewish thought, which it was never meant to suggest. (At least by me, who wrote the section originally). Thus, the article is made worse by its total exclusion. I may try to rewrite the section, but right now I will leave it open for comment. The phrasing should be better, I agree with that, the "I" first person statement is not proper for an (semi-)anonyomous encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 04:42, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 04:42, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>It is worthwhile to look at Shakespeare’s Romeo &amp; Juliet for an example of this philosophic capability. The tragedy of the play, which could be interpreted varyingly, is normally thought to be something that would produce sadness. Yet, from Bloom's point of view, a philosopher would laugh at this play, because the philosopher would see the mechanisms of the play's tragedy as artificial divisions between characters.</i> (more or less JPX7 restructured edit)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above passage I have removed from the article. The sentences are the last vestiges of a commentary I wrote about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socratic_irony.html" title="Socratic irony">Socratic irony</a>. I tried to include an example out of my opinion/understanding, while also choosing a piece of literature Bloom wrote about, namely <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> (see <i>Love &amp; Friendship</i> p.273-296). The passage stood in the article from Dec 20th 2004 to about Jan 31st 2005.</p>
<p>Personally, I was kind of amazed it lasted that long- and I wrote the section. (The entire section is below this comment in italics). Right now, I think it has really lost any value because it has been so badly emasculated by multiple <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> editors that it falls rather flaccid and silent upon a reader. When I read it now, I just shrug- what is the point?</p>
<p>For instance what does <b>‘interpreted varyingly’</b> really mean- isn’t everything open to varying interpretation? Or <b>"mechanisms of the play's tragedy as artificial divisions between characters"</b>- this passage is so entropic, it is unnecessary, if not almost comical, a kind of self-ironical ironic statement about irony so common to preternatural academics and their wannabes. (At least that is my point of view).</p>
<p>Finally, it is not true that <b>"Yet, from Bloom's point of view, a philosopher would laugh at this play</b>. Who said that? It is factually incorrect to suggest Bloom would only, or primarily, laugh at such a timeless, beatifully written tradegy (Again see<i>Love &amp; Friendship</i> p.273-296). The entire point I was trying make in the section below is distorted by so many edits that it has become fundementally fraudulent. My original section was trying, and maybe I failed, to raise the possibility a philosopher <i>may</i> see the comic as tragic in the story, or that only a philosopher could have this additional vantage point to measure the story by. It's a grotesque fabrication to suggest a philosopher or Allan Bloom would laugh at the tragic ending and circumstance like a bunch of dim-witted grade 10 school boys so thick a brick hitting them across the skull is more entertaining/comprehensible to them than <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>.</p>
<p>There is such a thing on Wikipedia of a “too many cooks” syndrome.

I suspect the real challenge would be to craft a section which offers similar meaning/illumination, but without it appearing so unilateral. I can’t do that, at least right now, so the whole <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> Socratic <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a> example should be mothballed, in my opinion, and I did write the section originally as well as most of the remaining stuff under <i>Philosophy</i> and Plato’s Republic. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 04:50, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Strauss took this insight and applied it eventually to Plato’s writings themselves. Bloom's translation and essay of the Republic takes this stance; therefore, it is radically different in many important aspects than the previous translations and interpretations of the Republic. Most notable is Bloom's discussion of Socratic irony. In fact, irony is the key to Bloom’s take on the Republic. (see his discussion of Books II-VI of the Republic.) But what is this irony? Allan Bloom says a philosopher is immune to irony because they can see the tragic as comic and comic as tragic. It is worthwhile to look at Shakespeare’s Romeo &amp; Juliet for an example of this philosophic capability; otherwise, it is just empty words. The tragedy of the play is not about dumb kids killing themselves because they are so wrapped up in first love that they lack commonsense, or the long-range view that they will go off to college and find other lovers. Sadly, the tragedy of Romeo &amp; Juliet is seen in a much diminished light today because contemporary society does not understand the role of the warring families. The families represent the political- they represent the Serb and Croat, the Palestinian and Israeli, they represent political entities at war. The play is akin to President Bush's daughter walking across a college campus and falling in love with a handsome, gallant, kind and considerate foreign exchange student. This young student sees Bush's daughter as perfection and fulfillment. They meet and fall in love, only to discover that Romeo is Usama Bin Laden's son. They commit suicide together because they think the world has no place for their love.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Yet a philosopher would laugh at this play, when everyone else cries, the philosopher would see that these divisions, between Americans and terrorists, are just artificial, they are not natural, and the fact that Jenna and Usama Jr. can fall in love is proof of this. A philosopher is fearless where others are terrified. Bloom refers to Socrates, the philosopher par excellence, in his Interpretative Essay stating, "Socrates can go naked where others go clothed; he is not afraid of ridicule. He can also contemplate sexual intercourse where others are stricken with terror; he is not afraid of moral indignation. In other words he treats the comic seriously and the tragic lightly." (Plato’s Republic, Interpretative Essay, p.387). Thus irony in the Republic refers to the 'Just City in Speech'. Bloom looks at it not as a model for future society, nor as a template for the human soul; rather, it is an ironic city, an example of the distance between philosophy and every potential philosopher. Bloom follows Strauss in suggesting that the 'Just City in Speech' is not natural; it is man-made, thus ironic''</i>--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 04:50, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)--&gt;</dd>

<p>It's been a while since I read it, but as I recall, Bloom said something about the children of divorced parents being too psychologically damaged to benefit from University education, and further, that the children of divorced parents were so screwed-up that they poisoned the intellectual atmosphere of University to such a degree that it would be better (though admittedly impossible in liberal society) to bar them from attending. It stuck in my mind as the most nutbar things I ever read, have I recalled this point correctly? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 21:29, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Your comment is an example of why Bloom is often deprived of a fair reading by those who are easily impressed with cheap and dull witted thinkers. Just to be plain, here is the direct quote from which you may have gotten your second hand news.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>I do not have the slightest doubt that they</b> [children of divorced parents] <b>do as well as others in all kinds of specialized subjects, but I find they are not as open to the serious study of philosophy and literature as some other students are</b>. <i>Closing of the American Mind</i> (p. 120)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bloom remarks that in his considered opinion- as liberal arts teacher- the ‘psychological’ harm done to students of divorced parents may impair their longing for completeness. He offers this comment in light of the need for present society to strictly enforce a ‘no-fault’ divorce mantra. The banishment of blame for a divorce, and thus any guilt in the parents for getting one, inadvertently and perhaps unknowingly places the children of divorce in an intolerable double bind. Children are told that their parents love them, but no longer love each other, while the child loves each parent equally and cannot simply ‘divorce’ themselves from the parental unit. They see in practice that love is conditional- “I once loved your mom/dad, but things have changed and it is nobody’s fault” type tune, while being unable to express their anger at either parent for betraying the parent they also love, but who has lost favor with the other parent. Anger is the correct word because children in divorce are really quite powerless in Bloom’s analysis- the parents have all the power, they can decided when to ‘start’ or ‘stop’ a family, and the kids must be trained to go along with the new arrangements. This is profoundly different than just twenty years ago and for centuries hence, where there were heavy and real institutionalized social, legal, and ‘moral’ consequences to divorce, and society felt justified in characterizing divorced persons as ‘failures’, ‘selfish’ or ‘irresponsible’; while at the same time extending pity or sympathy for kids of ‘broken homes’.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bloom makes reference to all the money currently spent on ‘therapists’ who are paid, in effect, to rationalize away blame from the parents, thus leaving the kid in a rather helpless confusion. (It is not unreasonable or unethical for therapists to do this, percisely becuase the children are so powerless, and thus need to contend with the 'reality' that their parents are no longer one unit.) This burden leaves them emotionally stunted, compared to a child of married parents in his experience. Instead of righteous outrage at the parents who have deprived the child of the thing they most love- their parents and family unit- the kid is rationalized into a dead calm or ‘crippled Eros’. Docile and accepting of their fate, Bloom senses in them an inability to connect deeply with the great tradition of philosophy and literature he teaches because the books no longer speak to them, or their experience in the world, since the greatest writers were creating out of an erotic wholeness. So as pretensious as that may sound to you, he is saying that the children of divorce are lied to by their parents, whose behavior says one thing – “I am doing this for me- I need to be free”, but they tell the kid to do the opposite- the child has to become less selfish and become the responsible one- become the parent. The child has to go “yes, yes, I understand, mommy/dad need to be happy, they need to be what they want to be, and I must play along although I would really want them to remain as one.” So the child must convince themselves to be less selfish at the very moment their parent(s) is exercising acute selfishness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This effects every student at university because children of divorced parents are assumed to be no different than children of married parents. There is almost a moral indigation reaction for bringing up or even suggesting there are these very real problems for children of divorce- a dictatorship of ignorance supresses freedom of thought in the name of 'openness' or acceptance of differences among 'lifestyle' choices.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bloom's analysis is very complex and thoughtful, and may shock and upset people- even threaten them and their core self-identity, so instead of actually suspending judgment for a few moments and trying to squarely evaluate his deep contention, they spit up some assine remark about banning children of divorce to another school system like they used to do in Little Rock. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 07:34, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>This might be true, but I'm reading <i>Closing</i> this summer, and I haven't found anything in it which <b>champions</b> the idea of using the Great Books in education. So far as I understand him Bloom is calling attention to a Great Paradox: openmindedness (i.e., <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativism.html" title="Relativism">relativism</a>) leads to a suicidal closedmindedness.</p>

<dd>You raise a great point, there is much that can be added to this article, and how Bloom used Great Books in education is a valid addition. Nevertheless, I disagree with your deletion completely, and since all you seem to be saying is you cannot see how he champions, or uses, Great Books, therefore it must not be true, smacks of folly. In fact, he was very much criticized for using "great books" like Plato, Aristotle, Nietszche etc. by critics. Read feminist <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Faludi_7add.html" title="Susan Faludi">Susan Faludi</a>'s <i>Backlash</i> (1992? maybe), which has a whole section on Bloom and <i>Closing</i>. She seems to be very upset he doesn't use any statistics to back up his opinions. She wants to "drain the swamp" (her words) of all the great thinkers and books. It is a telling comment, and shows what type of mind Faludi has, and what type of mind Bloom has. My point, he does use Great Books in <i>Closing</i> even if you don't see it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a> is a curriculum and Bloom does champion the spirit of this movement. Although the "required reading list", he may not completely condone. It is one of the least controversial or unique aspects of his thought, and is really just a reasserting of the traditional University of Chicago's liberal arts tradition under Robert Maynard Hutchins. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 05:58, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope that with the arrival of autumn whoever made the Great Books edit has finished <i>Closing</i> and discovered that near the end Bloom explicitly advocates for the Great Books program. --<a href="../../../j/d/i/User%7EJdinolt_0364.html" title="User:Jdinolt">jayinbmore</a> 02:26, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some anonymous editor added a quote to the Quotes section about Bloom's picture of the effect of rock music on young people- the 13 year old boy quote 'throbbing' which got a lot of people upset- and is thus pretty famous. I removed it only because the quote used a paraphase of the preceding sentences that made it appear Bloom was talking about technology, as opposed to primarily the music and its omnipresence; he does mention technology as a means that increases the availability of rock music and videos, but it is misleading to say it is primarily about that. If the person wants to re-add it without the paraphase, that would be fine as far as I am concerned. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 00:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
