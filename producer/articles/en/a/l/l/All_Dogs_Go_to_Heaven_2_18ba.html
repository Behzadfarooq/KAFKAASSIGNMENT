<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>In the sequel to All Dogs Go to Heaven, the loveable <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Shepherd_5cb5.html" title="German Shepherd">German Shepherd</a>, Charlie welcomes Itchy the <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dachshund.html" title="Dachshund">Dachshund</a> into Heaven. While Itchy is beginning to enjoy all that Heaven has to offer, Charlie finds Heaven too boring and is longing for some excitement (<b>It's Too Heavely Here</b>).</p>
<p>Carface is conspiring with Red, a large, hellish cat who is plotting to imprison all the dogs of Heaven. In order to do that he needs Gabriel's Horn, a magical golden brass horn that opens Heaven's <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearly_Gates_6cb1.html" title="Pearly Gates">Pearly Gates</a> so newly deceased dogs are able to enter. In an attempt to steal the horn, Carface accidentally knocks the horn down the hole to Earth where it lands somewhere in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Carface dives after it but misses his chance to catch it. Annabelle, the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whippet.html" title="Whippet">Whippet</a> angel, appears to explain that the magical horn has been stolen and without it no dogs can enter Heaven. Charlie convinces her to let him return to Earth to bring it back. Annabelle sends Itchy along with him for assistance, despite Itchy's reluctance to leave Heaven, as well as a miracle which he can only use in an emergency.</p>
<p>When Charlie arrives back on Earth, he decides to have fun instead of looking for Gabriel's Horn, so he and Itchy travel to a nightclub. But when Charlie tries to order a drink, the bartender acts as though he can't even see or hear them. This is when Charlie realises that they are spirits and thus cannot interact with the physical world. As Charlie starts feeling depressed he hears the sound of singing (<b>Count Me Out</b>). The dog he hears is Sasha la Fleur, a very pretty <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Setter_c1f0.html#History" title="Irish Setter">Red Setter</a> who is entering a talent contest. He immediately falls in love with her but, like the other dogs in the nightclub, she cannot see or hear Charlie. However, Charlie is able to see and hear Carface, who is now pure flesh and blood; he can be both seen and heard by the other dogs in the nightclub. Carface tells them its because of his friend's special collars. Charlie wants to impress Sasha badly, so he lets Carface take him to see Red, disguised as an elderly dog, who gives both Charlie and Itchy collars but says they will only last one day. Charlie and Itchy leave unaware that the collars have put them in Red's power (<b>It Feels So Good To Be Bad</b>).</p>
<p>Back at the "club" Charlie fails to impress Sasha. She runs away, leaving a blanket of food behind. Charlie and Itchy follow her to return it. Sasha says she has a kid and when she nudges open a shed they find a small boy named David. He ran away from home because his stepmother was having a baby, and as a result, feels rejected. He plans to live on the street and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busking.html" title="Busking">busk</a> at Kennedy Square, where he has a talent for magic tricks. David can understand Charlie and Itchy because they are still angels. Charlie used the miracle Annabelle gave him to allow Sasha to be understood as well by kissing her. David suddenly begins to think Charlie is his guardian angel. Charlie likes David's idea of Kennedy Square, but Sasha has no intention of doing so. They all head to Kennedy Square, despite Sasha's reluctance. Carface shows Red around <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcatraz_Island_b07a.html" title="Alcatraz Island">Alcatraz Island</a>, where Red plans to keep the dogs. Red sends Carface out to fetch the horn.</p>
<p>Charlie and Itchy hear the tone of the horn outside the police station and then notice a policeman bringing it in. Charlie sneaks inside the police station to retrieve it but can't get the horn out. At that point, Charlie, Itchy, Sasha and David raid the station, retrieve the horn and escape on a police motorcycle. They are chased by a police car but when the car crashes they speed away to the docks. Carface however finds out that Charlie has the horn. Charlie, however, does not want to return to Heaven, despite Itchy's insistence. Charlie wants to take care of David and spend some more time with Sasha. He stores the horn in a crab trap and kicks it into the water. David is still insisting on going to Kennedy Square so the gang heads there. David stands at a fountain to perform his magic tricks (<b>On Easy Street</b>). At first all goes well for David as the crowd claps and cheers. Then it all goes downhill as David falls into the fountain and ends up with no money. They end up at the dock again. Sasha and Charlie tell David that he should really go home. David agrees to go home if Charlie takes him. Then David wants to take all the dogs home to live with him. Charlie says that he can't promise that and walks away sadly. Sasha finds him staring at the water looking depressed. Charlie explains he has to go back and feels bad because he has finally found someone special (<b>I Will Always Be With You</b>). Sasha fall in love with Charlie and is about to kiss him when sundown arrives and Charlie and Itchy disappear. Charlie needs another collar so he runs off to find Red.</p>
<p>When Charlie explains to Red that he needs another collar Red says Charlie must pay for one. Red starts hobbling off to a back room when Carface says that Red might make a trade. Desperate, Charlie claims he has the horn. Red seems uninterested and says he'll sleep on it. When Charlie explains he does not have time Red comes back out and tells him if Charlie brings him the horn he can receive the collar. Charlie says he needs the collar to get the horn. Itchy runs into the room just as Red makes a deal with Charlie and they shake on it. Red reveals himself as a monstrous cat. Charlie tries to lunge at Red but he can click his claws together and shock him. Charlie and Itchy run out. Itchy, however, is still a spirit.</p>
<p>Charlie gets back to the docks to find Sasha and David but finds out they left for the train station. At the train station David does not know what train to get on and is wondering where Charlie went. He is grabbed by Carface and pulled onto the tracks. Carface pulls David onto a train just as Charlie and Itchy arrive. Carface tells Charlie to bring the horn to Alcatraz in one hour or David will be killed. Charlie arrives at Alcatraz with the horn in the crab trap. Red grabs the horn while Charlie and David run out. Red runs up some stairs and blows the horn numerous times. A gateway appears and all the dogs from Heaven are sucked to Earth to Alcatraz Island. As the dogs arrive they are zapped into the numerous cells in the prison. Charlie leads David to a waiting rowboat with Sasha and Itchy inside. Charlie gets David in the boat but when he sees the dogs being sucked into the prison he tells Sasha and Itchy to get David home and runs back into the prison. Red grows even bigger until he becomes a giant red cat and creates a storm. Charlie is flung across the floor and is about to be killed when David, Sasha, and Itchy step in. Itchy gets the horn back and it is given to Charlie. Charlie runs up to the roof to play the horn but Red notices. Charlie jumps around trying to dodge Red and find a spot to blow the horn. Charlie jumps off the roof as the water comes in and because he can dog paddle and Red can't he is swept into the building. Charlie blows the horn and all the dogs in Heaven are brought back, the storm dies, and Red is sucked down a hole in the ground. Carface gets sucked down the same hole because Carface had, unknowingly, sold his soul for his collar.</p>
<p>Charlie convinces David to let Sasha take him home and he and Itchy leave for Heaven with the horn. Halfway Annabelle takes the horn and tells Charlie for what he did he deserves a second chance. He can return to Earth. Itchy decides to stay in Heaven, knowing he will be happier, but at the same time feeling he might not see Charlie again. Charlie returns to Earth and he and Sasha decide to live with David and his family (<b>It's Too Heavenly Here Reprise</b>).</p>

<ul>
<li>This film seems to be set in modern-day <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> as opposed to the original film's setting of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a>. Itchy arrives in heaven in the beginning of this film. This creates a +55 year time span between the two films. In reality, a dog can only live upmost to 20 years. Still, this <i>is</i> a cartoon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the scene where Carface shows Charlie and Itchy his special collar that allows him to be flesh and blood, Charlie is briefly shown to be already wearing one. In the widescreen version of the film, Charlie's neck is matted out of frame to avoid his collar being seen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Carface's name is actually an obvious play on the title of the famous <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> mafia movie classic <i><a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarface_%281983_film%29.html" title="Scarface (1983 film)">Scarface</a></i> with <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pacino_b483.html" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, which in turn took its name from <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capone_36a3.html" title="Al Capone">Al "Scarface" Capone</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In this movie, Charlie's missing the two black spots on his face.</li>
