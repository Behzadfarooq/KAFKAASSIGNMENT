<p>OK, I promised I would put something forward, and here it is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Israel has been accused by various critics of conducting policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza that are reminiscent of those perpetrated by the South African apartheid regime. Though the accusations vary in their severity and scope, they are largely based on the separation of Palestinian communities from each other and from Israeli infrastructure. Others, including critics of Israeli policy, reject the comparison with apartheid as unfair given Israel's defense needs and possibly motivated by a desire to demonize Israel. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 16:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Anyway I think this is an improvement, as it just gives a rough outline for both sides, leaving further detail to later paragraphs. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 19:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I agree it's an improvement. It's briefer, but what's up there now is already pretty brief for a lead. And in this case brevity ≠ concision; this newly suggested paragraph is rather wordy for how little it communicates. There is nothing alluding to the categorically different arguments for the West Bank and Israel proper (even though some major writers deplore the use of the term "apartheid" for the latter but use it themselves for the former). And there is a serious if subtle NPOV problem, in that the critics' case is summarized in their own terms ("Israel's defense needs," "possibly motivated by a desire to demonize Israel"), while the proponents' case is made in awkward, inert, weirdly abstract and passive language: no one talks about Palestinians being "separated...from Israeli infrastructure." Lastly, the "including critics of Israeli policy" clause is POV-massaging. I'd accede to it only if it's matched by a similar (and equally true) clause in the previous sentence about proponents (e.g., "including longtime supporters of Israel"). Better yet would be to leave it to readers (and reliable sources) to say who's a critic and who's a supporter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, I think what's up there on the article page right now is a better template. If "cantons" is the problem, then someone should suggest a synonym. But that's the commonly accepted word, <i>pace</i> Zeq, for the carved-up Palestinian sections of the post-Oslo West Bank; it's used by Haaretz, the New York Times, etc. and mainstream commentators all over the political map. As long as the substitute isn't some weird coinage or circumlocution, however, I'd be fine with it.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 22:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Including longtime supporters of Israel," is a) original research, and b) prejudicial. At the same time, you insist that the term "Israeli infrastructure" is a novel interpretation. The only conclusion I can draw from this is that you will accept no other lead than one that treats as a premise - against feeble protestations - that Israel is an apartheid state. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 00:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How is "including longtime supporters of Israel" original research and prejudicial, but "including critics of Israeli policy" is not? I'd say to have neither such statement. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>argues against arguments that have not yet been made. We should either include what they are intended to rebut, or save both sides for the body of the article. I tend to agree with john k, above. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 00:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Reset indent). The lead I proposed seeks to summarize the basic positions of both sides. I'm sure - like everything else - it can improved. It does not get into the whys and why nots of the allegation, as this belongs in the article itself. "Critics of Israeli policy" refers to the particular policies that give rise/pretext to the comparison. The phrasing is very careful not to say, for example, "critics of Israel," or "anti-Zionists," etc. It is reasonable to say that those who are critical to the relevant policies are those who compare it to apartheid, isn't it? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree with john k above, that it would be best to include neither the phrase <i>"including longtime supporters of Israel"</i> nor <i>"including critics of Israeli policy"</i>. Not because they constitute OR (in fact neither does) but because each seems to be urging an argument, and is therefore inappropriate for a lead. But these are symmetrical facts, so NPOV requires that we include both or neither.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Leifern, I didn't say and don't think "Israeli infrastructure" is a "novel interpretation." I said and think that the phrase about Palestinians being "separated...from Israeli infrastructure" is euphemistic to the point of obscurity. Let's summarize the positions both of proponents and critics with clarity and fairness, in terms that accurately represent them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm happy to work with Leifern's template instead of mine, but my concerns are the above.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 02:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Cross-posted there. Along your lines, I don't think Leifern's approach is totally unworkable, but I guess my sentiment remains that it seems a bit more circuitous than would be ideal. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 03:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could see this being turned into something generally agreeable; I'm simply having a hard time with the form. According to <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELead_b989.html" title="WP:Lead">WP:Lead</a>, a first sentence is supposed to be a definition. Granted, the situation is a bit odd here, since we're talking about something fairly abstract (an allegation of apartheid), but starting with a defining sentence still seems like the right approach. Starting with a sort of background sentence is an interesting idea, but I think goes a bit too far toward trying to make people comfortable. Shouldn't a premium be placed on clear and direct? To me, G-Dett's approach above of 1.) Definition, 2.) Proponents, 3.) Opponents 4.) Summary, if we can simply then agree on what kind of detail is then appropriate, would seem like the more promising framework. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 03:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can we go back to the original proposal as our template, for the sake of its verbal clarity and normative structure (definition, proponents, opponents, summary)? Again, it goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allegations of Israeli apartheid draw a controversial analogy between South Africa's treatment of non-whites during the apartheid era and Israel's treatment of Arabs living in the West Bank and Israel. Proponents of the analogy liken the cantons of the West Bank to the Bantustans of South Africa, draw parallels between the system of separate roads, infrastructure, rights and privileges for Arab and Jewish residents of the West Bank on the one hand, and the policies of racial separation in apartheid South Africa on the other, and in some cases point to allegedly second-class citizenship of Arabs living within Israel proper. Critics of the analogy call it inaccurate and illegitimate, arguing that Arab citizens of Israel enjoy democratic rights and equality under the law, that the cited policies and practices in the West Bank are based on security needs[1], and that the practices of many other countries, to which the comparison is not made, more closely resemble South African apartheid.[2] In recent years, the analogy has become a contentious component of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can people itemize their concerns, or better yet suggest concrete modifications?</p>
<p>If people want to add language to the opponents' sentence (regarding "demonization," alleged antisemitism, etc.), I'd have no objection.</p>
<p>A couple of editors have mentioned reservations about the word "canton." I chose it because it's the only word I've ever heard used for the separate and semi-autonomous zones of Palestinian territory portioned out in the wake of Oslo. It seems to be the default word in the mainstream media, as well as pundits everywhere from William Safire to Josh Marshall to Noam Chomsky. I thought it was one of those rare words that everyone uses, a sliver of neutral semantic territory – indeed, if anything, one rather Swiss in its connotations. If someone objects, can they say why and suggest a synonym?--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 19:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>G-Dett, how about combining them into an article entitled Israeli aparthied that reads:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a term often used by those who make political arguments that draw <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogies</a> between <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s treatment of non-whites during the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid era</a> to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s treatment of Arabs living in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and Israel. As with many other issues in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, the term and the surrounding debate, is deeply contentious.</p>
<p>Proponents of such analogies liken the cantons of the West Bank to the Bantustans of South Africa, draw parallels between the system of separate roads, infrastructure, rights and privileges for Arab and Jewish residents of the West Bank on the one hand, and the policies of racial separation in apartheid South Africa on the other, and in some cases point to allegedly second-class citizenship of Arabs living within Israel proper. Critics call such analogies inaccurate and illegitimate, arguing that Arab citizens of Israel enjoy democratic rights and equality under the law, that the cited policies and practices in the West Bank are based on security needs[1], and that the practices of many other countries, to which the comparison is not made, more closely resemble South African apartheid.[2]</p>

<p>Re my attempted compromise: On second thought, I guess what we have now is somewhat redundant. Perhaps a better option would be to mention the cantons, separate roads, etc. in the second half of the sentence, to make it more palatable. "Proponents of the analogy draw parallels between the limited rights and privileges of Arab and Jewish residents of the West Bank and the policies of racial separation in apartheid South Africa, pointing specifically to the ..." or something like that. Then we'd just need to combine the statements re: Israel and the West Bank in some way.

<p><b>Allegations of Israeli apartheid</b> is a term used by some Wikipedia editors to prima facie marginalize and undermine the legitimacy of political arguments that make <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogies</a> between <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s treatment of non-whites during the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid era</a> to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s treatment of Arabs living in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and Israel, based on their strong belief that these kinds of analogies are inaccurate and illegitimate.

<p>Let's be honest folks. This is totally unencyclopedic. There are a number of people with respected academic and professional backgrounds and relevant life experiences who have characterized the system in Israel as apartheid. It has even been called “Israeli apartheid” (It gets 281,000 hits on google as opposed to 664 for Allegations of Israeli Apartheid”). Wikipedia should not be allowing the contentious nature surrounding the legitimacy of such an analogy, distort how it is titled to favor a particular POV. Further, titling this article “Allegations of Israeli apartheid” begs the kind of introduction I supplied you with above, because if we honestly want to describe where that phrase comes from and what it means, that is probably how we should write it.</p>
<p>Now how about we write an article entitled “Israeli apartheid” that begins along these lines:</p>
<p><b><i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a term often used by those who make political arguments that draw <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogies</a> between <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s treatment of non-whites during the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid era</a> to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s treatment of Arabs living in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and Israel. As with many other issues in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, the term and the surrounding debate, is deeply contentious.</b></p>

<dl>
<dd>Tiamut, I have a problem with your suggestion. The problem is that the vast majority of uses of the term "Israeli Apartheid" are not by "respected scholars", but are by known racists and seriously biased individuals who use it as a pejorative in the writing of propaganda. Counting google hits is also misleading, as these writings and the term are parroted over and over on anti-semitic and fundamentalist islamic forums and pages all over the web, creating a false dichotomy. The term has been debunked at least as often as it has been used, and as such, I feel the title is better here as-is. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 19:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that you feel strongly that the term itself is illegitimate, but I believe this is something that can be covered and expressed in the article defining the term, rather than in an article title that slants the POV of the debate to one side from the outset. The reader should be able to judge the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the term based on the article content, which would cover all sigificant POVs as per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Also, it would prevent us from a circuitous definition and discussion of the subject at hand. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 19:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Tiamut, I have read through a number of the references provided in this article, and they fall into two categories: the first are people who worry about the effects of the current policy, fearing that it will create a system that has elements similar to those seen during the apartheid era; the other is people who use it entirely for polemical purposes. The assertion that the "system in Israel ... is apartheid" falls squarely into the second category and should be treated as such. Even Jimmy Carter goes to great lengths to say that whatever it is, it's not racism, and that it only is like apartheid in one narrow sense. As far as I'm concerned, the comparison would be funny if it didn't do so much damage to the prospects for peace and security in the area. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 20:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Even if everything you have said is true, the article should still be entitled "Israeli apartheid". And it should deal with the points you've raised as well, reliably sourced and attributed of course. Adding "Allegations of" before every term that is viewed as poelmical is a ridiculous way of organizing information and a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I've noticed articles around here discussing much less notable polemical terms like <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" title="Pallywood">Pallywood</a>, without putting the disclaimer "Allegations of" before it. We should be consistent, but not in setting and using bad precedents. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 20:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>No, because "Israeli apartheid" as a title is hijacking the premise. To create a parallel: several people think Henry Kissinger is a war criminal. We can undoubtedly find several articles from notable individuals, etc., that make that assertion. We still couldn't write an article called "War crimes committed by Henry Kissinger," could we? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 12:40, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I love the way I go away for a couple of months and return to discover that the same people are arguing against a name change that they have made for a year while the ground has rapidly shifted under them. When the article was first created, it was speedily moved without sufficient discussion; and since then the sequence of votes have consisted of scrabbling rationalisation of what people wanted anyway.

<dd>As I have said earlier, and have been saying in the context of this article since week one: if the term itself has reached notability (I used to say if the term ever reaches a certain notability) then the title of the article should be about the use of the term; consider <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, which everyone agreed sometime last year was a benchmark - an agreement that some seem to have since found reason to forget. A discussion of the introduction of the term, of the increasing use and popularity of the term, and a brief discussion of the reasons people advance as to why use of the term is illegitimate or justified. This is so blindingly obvious to a neutral that my head actually hurts considering the sort of mental exercise intelligent people must undertake in order to avoid seeing it. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 17:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think those wanting to keep the article have really shown a lot of willingness to compromise. At the same time, there seems to be a seriously flawed premise here, that if a topic relates to a negative aspect of something, the content should then strongly support that something in order to create some kind of cosmic balance.

<dd>What we need here, as Ashley suggests, is to focus on the WP guidelines: Notability, Attribution, NPOV, etc. Specifically, that means "representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source." That means if there's a view that this allegation is reprehensible, then we represent that view "fairly and without bias." Nobody here is contesting this. If there is also a view which makes the allegation, however, then we also present that view "fairly and without bias." If we'd all simply work from these policies, I think the process would be a lot smoother. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 12:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hornplease, you are so absolutely right. The bar for notability on this term has been met. It need a new name "Israeli apartheid" and then we need to faithfully represent the usage, and the debate. Can somebody please put their foot down here? <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 18:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's the other side that's put its foot down, Tiamut. Wikipedia works by consensus, and there have been several votes on the article title. Usually consensus has a healthy Habermasian quality to it; other times it descends into groupthink or worse. I've voted for the title to be changed, and will do so again, but to be honest I'm not terribly passionate about it. Those who've demanded that "allegations" be kept in the title imagine that it throws the whole subject into doubt, like scare quotes or the adjective "so-called" or something, but they're just confused about the term. "Allegations" doesn't just mean something dubious or debatable. It means assertions of <i>fact</i>, which could conceivably be proven beyond doubt but have yet to be. You don't use it for metaphors, or comparisons, or hyperbolic insults or epithets or whatever. Which is why "Allegations of Islamofascism" would sound ridiculous, as would "allegations that so-and-so is a wanker."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only reason "allegations of Israeli Apartheid" doesn't sound similarly ridiculous is that "apartheid," in addition to being an iconic metaphor for ethnic separation and systemic domination, is also a legal term referring to a crime under international law. All that those insisting on retaining this solecism in the title have succeeded in doing is making it look like it's an article about formal criminal charges brought against the state of Israel. Of course anyone who happens on this article will quickly see that's not the case, and figure out soon enough that the title is just a clumsy attempt to stamp "taboo" on the topic.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 22:18, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But on the other hand, the title cannot be <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>, because there is no such thing, and besides, it will never get a consensus. I don't think the word "apartheid" should be in the title at all, but I was willing to compromise. However much you object to the current title, most likely it is the best, or worst (depending on your perspective) that it is ever going to get. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:12, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>6SJ7, like I said I'm not terribly concerned about the violation of NPOV in the title, partly because of the way it backfires (making it sound if anything <i>more</i> serious, a legal imbroglio rather than a merely provocative metaphor), and partly because smart readers tipped off by the solecism will quickly figure out the special pleading, double standards, etc. that require such disclaimer words in titles of articles unflattering to Israel. So that quaint old canards like "Zionism and Racism" have to be retitled "Zionist and Racism Allegations," whereas the orgy of plagiarism, propaganda and hate stored under "Islam and Antisemitism" will keep that title.</dd>

<dd>So I have no intention of putting up a big fight over this title, amateurishly biased as it is. But I have to take issue with you saying <b>a)</b> this article can't be called "Israeli Apartheid" because "there's no such thing," and <b>b)</b> that the precedent for the titling of other articles on subjects the real-world existence of which is dubious or disputed "has nothing to do with what <i>this</i> article should be named." These are serious matters of principle, and you're wrong on both counts. Regarding <b>(a)</b>, the reliable sources are divided about the truth of "Israeli Apartheid." For you to say that your own judgment resolves the matter definitively is a violation of basic Wikipedia principles. Regarding <b>(b)</b>, there is no precedent in Wikipedia for putting disclaimer-words in the titles of articles with controversial subjects, and precedent indeed does matter. If you ignore precedent you get special pleading, double standards, etc., as well as a amateurish, bloggy sort of online encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 16:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the reason for that is very simple: there is no Israeli apartheid, and no reasonable person could possibly conclude there is. The term itself is a malicious libel that would be met with ridicule and scorn if it were about any country besides Israel. Now, I could propose with considerably more substance that the article be moved to Libel of Israeli apartheid, but that would clearly be a POV title. So we can either get into an argument that surely won't (nor shouldn't) be resolved in Wikipedia, or we can try to make this article as NPOV as possible. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 15:28, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, the term "Israeli apartheid" is even more POV-pushing. Apartheid is a specific crime in international law with specific criteria.

As you'll see if you read the various threads here, you'll see that a large portion claim that there is Israeli apartheid.

<p>Domitius, you are totally right. Hornplease, G-Dett and many others have pointed out the double-standard being employed here. Unfortunately, there are a couple of admins who have had a history of turning a blind eye to policy when it comes to this article, and who have allowed opponents to the listing of this article under its proper title "Israeli apartheid", to persist in setting a bad precedent for the discussion of controversial topics. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> (as pointed out in the discussion somewhere above) has less currency as a concept and yet it is presented under its proper name despite the controversy associated. There are many other such examples. The exception being made for this article is really indefensible. I wish that more editors without a stake in the debate (in other words, neither pro or con about the aptness of apartheid analogies in discussing Israel) would step in and offer their opinions too, as you have done. But even though there have been requests for peer review here, most people seem to run away scared due to heat the debate tends to generate. Putting all political debate aside however, the title does need to be changed though if Wikipedia wants to hang onto its reputation as a credible encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 16:38, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fundamental difference between the two article being that the Islamofascism article doesn't actually discuss the allegations itself; that radical Islam is fascistic. Instead, it just discusses the <i>term</i>, when it was coined, its uses, objections, etc. If this article merely discussed the <i>term</i> "Israeli apartheid", its uses, objections, etc., then it might be an appropriate title, but since it also spends a great deal of time discussing the <i>allegation</i> that Israel practices a form of apartheid, it obviously has to stay here. So, rather than an double-standard being employed here, you are actually <i>proposing</i> a double-standard. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Alleged (along with allegedly) and purported (along with purportedly) are different from the foregoing in that they are generally used by those who genuinely have no predisposition as to whether the statement being cited is true or not.

However, there may be a problem of ambiguity—they should only be used where the identity of the alleger is clear.</p>

<p>In other words, "allegations of" shoudl not be in the title of a Wikipedia article entry, particularly since it is unattributed.

<dd>Hey, Jayjg. As pointed out above, the issue is about consistency in naming articles and not allowing the controversial subject matter to distort how an article is titled. I find no basis in fact for the phenomena described as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" title="Pallywood">Pallywood</a> and yet I don't go around appending "Allegations of..." as prefixes to the discussion of those issues. I think if you step back and reflect here, you will find that while the notion of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> might seem totally absurb to you, it is the proper descriptive title for the phenomenon being discussed in this page. And while <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> might be only a <i>guideline</i>, it is certainly a more respectable basis for an argument than claiming that "two new editors and a sockpuppet of a banned user" aren't going to make a difference. There is a lot of substance in the arguments being put forward here by many different editors (See sections sbove). Let's try to keep it substantive.

That it is not under the sub-title "Allegations" anywhere there, only further goes to prove the point that such article or sub-section labelling is without precedent at Wikipedia.

<dd>It depends what the article includes, and how it is defined. If it includes all armed activity carried out by Palestinians, then the current title is fine. Palestinian have a right to resist the occupation under international law, so even though all such activity might be viewed as terrorism by some, "political violence" is a more apt term. If strictly limited to those acts carried out against specifically against civilians to kill and to instill terror to achieve political aims, then perhaps it needs to be renamed. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 16:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We will get nowhere trying to change the article to Palestinian violence, even if we should agree here. But it's interesting that you once again enter your own opinions as premises for what the article should and shouldn't be - others will argue that there is no occupation, and certainly not one that is illegal, and if there is a right to "resist" against it, then there surely is an equal right to fight that resistance.

<dd>I don't think he's trying to resolve any controversy. It's just that terrorism is defined as violence against civilians.

So if <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Political_Violence_d22c.html" title="Palestinian Political Violence">Palestinian Political Violence</a> covers these things as well as suicide bombings, then it can't be moved (in its current form at least) to "Palestinian Terrorism". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> (<a href="../../../g/-/d/User_talk%7EG-Dett_c67e.html" title="User talk:G-Dett">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_G-Dett_c53c.html" title="Special:Contributions/G-Dett">contribs</a>) 16:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Jayjg, you're confusing the issues. That Israel has a separation policy called hafrada is a fact the Israeli government does not deny. You asked for a source making the link between this and apartheid. I gave you a source. That it is partisan is unsurprising given that many of those who use the term "Israeli apartheid" are.

<dd>I think you're right, Jay. If it's going to go in the lead, it should be clear that reference to it forms part of the proponents' case. Of course there are RS's who use it in this way, but it has yet to be demonstrated that it's a key component of their argument. I think Mackan's right that if it's going to stay, it needs to be rephrased in compliance with WP:ATT and almost certainly moved out of the lead and into the body of the article. --<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 20:31, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I may try to strike a balance here, I think the Hafrada sentence, at least without context, does probably upset the balance of the lead. Considering the controversiality of this issue, I think it's important to put things in context as much as possible. My suggestion would be that the Hafrada point should be moved lower (first section, maybe) if the hope is any sort of concensus on intro. Otherwise, I think the continued reversions of the "proponents" sentence in the lead is clearly unjustified, as it leaves the paragraph overwhelmingly negative on the concept, against <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELead_b989.html" title="WP:Lead">WP:Lead</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The version I offered could possibly be more concise and informative, but that shouldn't happen by deleting one point of view. As far as I can see, the sentence is unquestionably fair and uninflammatory. Please, I think everyone needs to try to look for solutions here if we want this to go somewhere (as some are certainly doing). <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 20:09, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd be glad to see a reliable source showing me such a policy even exists, or that it uses the name "Hafrada". The only thing I'm aware of, or could find, was "Geder Haafrada" ("Separation fence") which separates Israel from the territories, mostly along the green line, but also sometimes deviating from it to protect settlements built in the territories. The fence's construction was begun a few years ago (after a lot of public pressure), in response to Palestinian terrorism - to keep the suicide bombers out. There are claims that it's also being used to determine a de facto border, and annex (small) parts of the territories. See <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> for more details on that.</p>

<p>Jay, you say above that <i>"the fundamental difference"</i> between <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_Apartheid_1f8f.html" title="Allegations of Israeli Apartheid">Allegations of Israeli Apartheid</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is <i>"that the Islamofascism article doesn't actually discuss the allegations itself; that radical Islam is fascistic. Instead, it just discusses the term."</i> Tiamut rejects this distinction. I'll go further and say I don't even understand it. Discussing the "term" means discussing why, how, and with what stated justifications it's used. How does this differ from a discussion of "allegations"[<i>sic</i>]? Here's a sample from the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provocation by modern Islamists of Holocaust denial[9] strengthens the comparison between Islamists and neo-Nazi movements. Two of the most influential Islamists of the twentieth century, Ayatollah Khomeini and Sayyid Qutb, asserted repeatedly in their writings that foreigners, especially Jews, were conspiring to destroy Islam and persecute the Muslim community.[8][9] Other attributes shared by historical fascism and these Islamists[10] include * inspiration from what is believed to be an earlier golden age (the first few Caliphates in the case of Islamism) * a desire to restore the perceived glory of this age with an all-encompassing (totalitarian) social, political, economic system, [10] [11] * violent revolution to expel the perceived malicious, predatory influence of the alien forces from the nation/community [12][13] * belief in the decadence and weakness of the malicious, predatory enemy forces (this applies to bin Laden and Qutb, though Khomeini did not mention it) [14] * and offensive military or quasi-military campaign to reestablish the power and international domination of the nation/community [15] [16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you tell me a) in what sense this <i>"doesn't actually discuss the allegation</i> [sic] <i>itself?"</i>; and b) how is this different from the kind of substantive material you've suggested we'd need to remove from this article in order for it to be appropriately titled "Israeli Apartheid"?

<dd>A few clarifications. <b>1.</b> Yes, I did just recently concede your point, but do look at the edit history and take note that I had already done that <i>before</i> you posted saying I hadn't. My point is not to take you to task for the oversight – there was only a minute window and the concession was in a different section – but I do want it to be very clear that this wasn't some sort of calculated concession. Clear? <b>2.</b> No, you're not responsible for anything over at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. But you are responsible for the comparison you're making, and the conclusions you draw from that comparison. Your comparison says that that article addresses only the term and not the allegations [<i>sic</i>], whereas this one deals with both – hence the different titles. What's your evidence for that? Your evidence can't be that you have "no doubt" that something I quoted from that article won't last – <i>especially</i> if the material in question looks for all the world like original research. Is there RS-material on the links and resemblances between Islamism and Fascism that's being kept out of that article? Are the editors over there insisting that the article can quote someone using the term but it can't quote them justifying it? If so, then that's good evidence for what you're saying, as well as being a problem in its own right. But if not, then I think the distinction you're drawing between treatment of a controversial term, on the one hand, and treatment of "allegations" [<i>sic</i>] that are an intrinsic part of that term, on the other – is imaginary.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 21:02, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Jay, the diff you've directed me to clearly doesn't support your point. In it, someone rightly removes from the lead the following chunk of badly written POV-pushing original research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While some movements self-describe themselves as "Islamist", few today will refer to themselves publicly as "fascist", even if their views fit with the meaning of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-fascism.html" title="Neo-fascism">neo-fascism</a> because of the associations with the term in modern times with groups such as the former <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Party_3bfc.html" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Communism</a> and modern <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazism</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor replaced this and other related junk with an intro that – in its brevity and balance – would serve well as a model for <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_Apartheid_1f8f.html" title="Allegations of Israeli Apartheid">Allegations [<i>sic</i>] of Israeli Apartheid</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>"Islamofascism"</b> is a controversial political term. It is used by some journalists, politicians, and academics who perceive some <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamist</a> movements as having <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism.html" title="Neofascism">neofascist</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> characteristics.

</blockquote>

<dd>Jay, you're basing all of this on the wording of the edit summary: "This is an article about the term Islamofascism." The edit was a good edit – an excellent edit in fact, but with a rather vague edit summary that appears to have confused you. The "huge amounts of text" I failed to mention consisted of two clunky, verbose phrases – <i>"It has come to be used by some non-Muslim journalists, politicians and academics to refer to those Islamist movements that are perceived to have neofascist or totalitarian characteristics, particularly groups of Islamic fundamentalists" etc. etc.</i> – the modification of which reflect the editor's good taste and ear for decent prose, not his ideological inclinations.</dd>

<p>Thought I'd make a subsection here that people can keep adding to of reliable sources discussing the link between hafrada and apartheid (and more on the origins of hafrada and its confirmed meaning as separation and as Israeli government policy):</p>

<p>Barak explained hafrada — separation — this way in 1998: “We should separate ourselves from the Palestinians physically, following the recommendation of the American poet Robert Frost, who once wrote that good fences make good neighbors. Leave them behind [outside] the borders that will be agreed upon, and build Israel.”</p>

<p>Known by many names—security fence, separation barrier, hafrada wall, or simply “the Wall”—the $1 billion construction project undertaken by the Israeli government through the West Bank is a combination of razor-tipped fencing and concrete wall that will snake across 450 miles of the Holy Land when it is completed next year. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/a/User_talk%7ETiamut_400f.html" title="User talk:Tiamut">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tiamut_a9d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tiamut">contribs</a>) 19:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>For one thing, they aren't even talking about the same thing. The first is about a disengagement policy, the second about finalizing borders, the third about the barrier - if anything, that would link them to the articles on the disengagement policy and the barriers, not this one. On top of that, who is saying these things? You can't just take any internet source with the words "hafrada" and "apartheid" in them, and assert that they are talking about the same thing, and that they are reliable sources. And, on top of that, even if you insisted that the article was related, why on earth would you remove a "See also" to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_5243.html" title="Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba">Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba</a> article?

<dd>You seem to be missing the point, Jayjg, so let me spell it out for you slowly. These sources are saying that they are all the same thing. Barak used hafrada to describe his new policy for dealing with the Palestinians as early as 1998 - which was separation in the form of unilteral disengagement. The "disengagement" is actually referred to as hafrada in Hebrew, or the Hebrew transliteration of unilateral disengagement plan is "Tochnit Ha-Hafrada Ha-Had-Tzedadit" (this is not in a source listed here but it is in a footnote here:<a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/English-Nativ/06-issue/Klein-6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acpr.org.il/English-Nativ/06-issue/Klein-6.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

<p>There seems to be some misinformation here. As a Hebrew speaker, who reads the newspapers, the websites, listens and watches the news, I can tell you this - there no widespread usage of the word "Hafrada" in this context. It just isn't used, and certainly isn't "government policy". I have yet to see any source for this claim.</p>
<p>The only widespread usage is in "Geder Hahafrada", "The separation fence", regarding the barrier. It's meant to be a tool against terrorism, but it's also extremely important (though somehow many people miss it) - it's Israel's concession of the "Whole Israel" dream. Unless I'm horribly wrong, the whole idea of the peace process was to reach a two state solution, and that barrier means Israel actually sees the Green Line as the basis for a future international border. So, sure, there are deviations for various reasons, but anyone looking at the map can see it's built along the green line. The two state solution, which is the stated purpose of the whole process, and most likely outcome, means there will be a border between the states. Considering reality, it will not be an open, european-style border, but a well guarded one. The fence has absolutely nothing to do with so-called apartheid. It's meant to separates Israelis from Palestinians, not Arabs from Jews (is there a fence between Shfar'am and Haifa? Abu-Gosh and Jerusalem?). It can only be connected to the apartheid claims if one says the Palestinians should be Israelis, i.e., a one state solution, which most people are against (the Palestinians have accepted the two state solution).</p>
<p>The Disengagement plan, despite Tiamut's claims, was not called "Hafrada" in any way, but "Hitnatkut" (which can also be translated as "Disconnection"). Again, with the point of leaving the Gaza Strip, to make way for a future Palestinian state (unfortunately, the Palestinians, as usual, failed to understand the huge importance of Israel evacuating settlers, and intensified their attack from Gaza, causing public opinion in Israel to change and oppose future concessions). <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 22:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your interpretation of the intentions of the Israeli government in pursuing its policy of "disengagement" or "separation" is interesting, but not exactly relevant. Some people who accuse Israel of apartheid see the disengagment plan as apartheid, whereas you see it as moving towards a two-state solution. Each is entitled to their opinion on the matter, but in this article we are representing their view, and not yours. Now, I'm sure you can find sources that contend that the separation wall and its associated policies are designed to make peace (every Israeli hasbara organization has a nice long list on their pages for their advocates). So, when we include the arguments that make this link, you can add your own sources that argue as to why it is inappropriate, for the sake of NPOV. Until then, please don't accuse me of lying about what words are used for the disengagement plan in Hebrew. While Hitnatkut may be used in some circles, Hafrada was the original formulation as put forward by Barak, and adopted by Sharon. Perhaps the change was designed to avoid the negative PR backlash from such a poor choice of words originally. But the fact remains that that is what is has been called and continues to be called in some circles. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calling the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">barrier</a> "apartheid" is absurd. Both parties (Israel and the Palestinians) have agreed to a separate future. Attaching claims of apartheid to the barrier means going towards a one-state solution, which no party wants. So it's not my "interpretation", but the reality here. I say again, while one can claim Israel is using the barrier for land grabs (heck, even I say that), it's obvious to anyone that the barrier is based on the green line. Now, this isn't an article about the barrier, but about Apartheid claims. Can you explain how building a fence along (mostly) what both sides agree should be a future international border can be seen as apartheid?</dd>
<dd>You seem to be confusing two very different things - first, "Geder Hahafrada" (the barrier). Second, the "Hitnatkut" (the disengagement plan). The second was not called "Hafrada" at any stage, and had nothing to do with Barak. The Hitnatkut was first raised by Sharon in 2004 (read <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan.html" title="Israel's unilateral disengagement plan">here</a>). The Hitnatkut cleared out settlers living in the Gaza Strip and northern samaria, and gave back the land to the Palestinians. If you can explain to me how that's apartheid, I'll be very impressed. Now, some people might say that the Hitnatkut's is to separate between Palestinians and Israelis (true enough, and seems to be an obvious step to peace, no? Evacuating settlers and giving land back), and they might have used the word "Hafrada", being a completely ordinary word in the Hebrew language, meaning "separation". But the claim the "Israeli government has an official policy called Hafrada" is fallacious, and I challenge you to bring sources (respectable sources) for that claim, or withdraw it. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 14:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Okedem. You seem to be misinterpreting what it is that I am trying to say, which could be because I did not explain myself clearly. So let me try again. We are talking about a policy that has gone by many different names which makes it difficult to discuss the issues at hand. When Barak first inauguarated this shift in policy in 1998, he termed it <i>hafrada</i> or separation policy (as evidenced in this reliable source I already provided above: <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3478092.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3478092.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). This source also explains that Sharon continued with the implementation of this policy and that part of this policy’s implementation included the building of the <i>Geder Ha-Hafrada</i> or "separation wall" (as you pointed out). Another part of this policy was the "unilateral disengagement" or "unilateral separation". Now, either you are being disingenuous (which if you live in Israel must be the case) or else you are simply unaware of the fact that this plan is has many different names used by many different people at many different times. Some call it the unilateral "disengagement" (or <i>hitnakut</i>) plan, some (particularly on the right) call it a "retreat" plan (or <i>nesiga</i>: <a href="http://info.jpost.com/C004/QandA/qa.horovitz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://info.jpost.com/C004/QandA/qa.horovitz.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>), and some like Aluf Benn from Ha’aretz call it <i>Tochnit Ha-Hafrada Ha-Had-Tzedadit</i>, or the "unilateral separation plan" (See: footnote here that cites Aluf Benn’s article and translates and tranlisterates the titles between English and Hebrew: <a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/English-Nativ/06-issue/Klein-6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acpr.org.il/English-Nativ/06-issue/Klein-6.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). Now, critics of the separation wall and the unilateral separation plan characterize this policy as apartheid, as did former President Jimmy Carter. In other words, to some of those who claim that Israel is an apartheid state, their assessment is based on an understanding of the separation wall and the unilateral separation plan as part of a separation policy: <a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:pDgzm2bT7P4J:www.sipa.columbia.edu/REGIONAL/IAS/documents/apartheid.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:pDgzm2bT7P4J:www.sipa.columbia.edu/REGIONAL/IAS/documents/apartheid.doc" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Given further that <i>apartheid</i> means separation when translated from Afrikaans into English, it seems that it is the Israeli government that has since played "linguistic gymnastics" in an attempt to correct an earlier tactical error that gave their critics a clear case in alleging a policy of separation or <i>apartheid</i> in Israel. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 15:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again you evade my request to bring sources for the claim such a government policy exists. I can only conclude you have no such sources, and such a policy does not exist. Your source says "Barak explained hafrada — separation — this way..." - it doesn't say "Hafrada" is or was government policy, or that he even used the term "Hafrada".</dd>
<dd>I've already said that one can refer to the Hitnatkut using the word "Hafrada", being a regular word in Hebrew. However, that was not its name, and was not widely used at all. In fact, googling the term "תכנית ההפרדה החד צדדית" (Tochnit Ha-Hafrada Ha-Had-Tzedadit) found 3 results. Googling the words תכנית ההפרדה ("Tochnit Ha-hafrada") found 155 results (but only 50 actual hits), some of which refer to the barrier (oh, please translate accurately - <i>Geder Ha-Hafrada</i> means "separation <b>fence</b>", not wall), some to the Hitnatkut (a few), and some to separating between road and railroad by building bridges and tunnels. Non-notable.</dd>
<dd>Again I ask you, how can building a fence along what both sides agree should be an international border be considered apartheid? <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 15:50, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The barrier (which is generally translated as "wall" in English, though the Hebrew word may literally mean "fence") does not follow an agreed-upon international border. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 16:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did you read what I wrote above? It mostly follows it. It uses the Green line as a basis for its route. And both sides agree the Green line will be the basis for the border, possibly with small changes.</dd>
<dd>I was referring to what Tiamut wrote, which made it seem as though "Geder Hahafrada" translates to english as "Separation Wall", which is untrue. The word "Wall" is used for political purposes only, and is untrue, as the barrier is almost completely a fence, with a wall in only very short parts of it. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 16:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Okedem, you've made some important points here, especially about how these words are used in Hebrew. But I think Jd2718's point stands. Even if the wall "mostly follows" the Green line, it does deviate from it in order to include settlement blocs, as well as desirable land and resources, while excluding the Palestinian communities who live on this land, and in the midst of whose inhabitants the settlements have been strategically placed. These deviations have profound consequences, both for the lives of Palestinians and for the legitimacy of the wall in international eyes. This sense of a supple, moving boundary defined, as Golda Meir once said, "by wherever Jews are living, not a line on the map” – so that wherever Jews decide to live in the West Bank, they take a virtual border with them, and enjoy different rights and privileges from the Arabs in their midst, who are by definition "outside" of that border (even if they're living on the same street, as in Hebron) – this is what animates, rightly or wrongly, the comparison with South African apartheid.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 17:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand your meaning, and as I said before, I oppose such deviations for settlements. Do note, that the barrier's route (around Jerusalem) was changed after an appeal to the supreme court, so Israel is taking into consideration the Palestinians' needs, though certainly not enough. However, the claims of "Apartheid wall" are false - Palestinians are not Israeli citizens, nor do they want to be. The obvious future of the region is two states, which means separation. Many settlements are not within the wall, and several have been evacuated in the Hitnatkut. Of course the wall is used for grabbing land, but it has nothing to do with apartheid.</dd>
<dd>My point is this - it may be a land grab, it may be wrong, but it has nothing to do with apartheid. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 18:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and my other point remains - calling a barrier composed of more than 95% fence, and less than 5% wall - "the wall" is misleading and political. It's a barrier, or a fence. It's like calling Finland a lake, because it has some lakes in it. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 18:06, 17 March 2007 (UTC) (or a better example - the US, which has 4.87% water area - should it be known as "Lake USA"? <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 18:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I see Okedem. The problem is not that I am not explaining myself clearly, it's that you are refusing to understand, or even to admit that I have provided you with evidence, throughout this discussion, and that I continue to do so. In response to your latest request, here are four more sources that prove there is a '<i>separation policy</i> in Israel:</p>
<ul>
<li>B’tselem: "Israel implements its <b>separation policy</b> in a patently arbitrary and indiscriminate manner. Almost all restrictions are imposed on entire groups of people, based on sweeping criteria, without examining the threat that the individual person poses." <a href="http://www.btselem.org/english/Publications/Summaries/200503_Gaza_Prison.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btselem.org/english/Publications/Summaries/200503_Gaza_Prison.asp" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
<li>Ha’aretz: "Unlike Sharon, the master of ambiguity, Olmert is crystal clear on what he means to do. He has no choice. He was forced to clarify his commitment to the <b>separation policy</b> - the "Sharon Way," the first step of which was his path-blazing withdrawal from Gaza last year, ending 38 years of Israeli occupation there. He had no choice because Olmert is not Sharon, there is no way he could be Sharon." <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=699267&amp;contrassID=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=699267&amp;contrassID=2" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></li>
<li>Business Week: "But Sharon is also moving ahead with another radical plan that is widely popular in Israel and could well scuttle the Saudis' regionwide push. The Israeli Prime Minister announced on Feb. 21 that steps are under way to impose "buffer zones" in the West Bank to protect Israelis from Palestinian militants. <b>The policy, known as "unilateral separation,"</b> could cost up to $400 million and would involve the construction of elaborate fences, checkpoints, and military patrols along the 240-mile 1967 border with the West Bank." <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_10/b3773086.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_10/b3773086.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></li>
<li>The Jaffa Center for Strategic Studies: "The Oslo process has been deadlocked since attempts to reach a permanent settlement fell through, and were followed by the violence that has raged since September 2000. This deadlock has triggered thinking on possible unilateral policy steps that could improve Israel's strategic and political situation. <b>These ideas, which are generally referred to as "unilateral disengagement" or "unilateral separation," are based on two fundamental assumptions.</b> <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/sa/v4n3p3Bro.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/sa/v4n3p3Bro.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And as for my translation of Hafrada Ha-Geder as Separation Wall, I don't really care if you think it's inaccurate. I've seen the wall as it cuts through houses in a neighborhood in Baqa al-Gharbiyya and in Qalqilya and in Ramallah at Kalandia and Bethlehem and Jerusalem and its a wall alright <a href="http://stopthewall.org/photos/1078.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://stopthewall.org/photos/1078.shtml" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, so spare me your faux indignation.

<dd>Yet again, you provide no evidence of a government policy called "Hafrada". Your sources only nickname actions with the word "separation", not "Hafrada". You also fail to respond to the evidence I brought that the word "Hafrada" doesn't seem to be widely used with regards to the Hitnatkut.</dd>
<dd>And spare me the heartbreaking examples. I was protesting the way you wrote the words, making it seem, to the non-hebrew speaking reader, as though the word "Geder" means "Wall". It doesn't. Also, your example are completely superfluous - I did not claim there is no wall, but that to refer to the barrier as "the wall" is political and demagogy - less than 5% of it is walls (Oh, and building a wall along the green line to prevent the people of Qalqilya from firing at Israelis, which they often did, really makes me teary-eyed). I don't think that deviating from the green line for all those settlements is right, but I do want accurate terms, and not false names like "the wall", used to fool people unaware of the facts. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 17:44, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okedem, if hafrada is the Hebrew word for separation, then "separation policy" in English mean "hafrada policy" when we are talking about Israel. This is clear because the two seem to be used interchangeably in many of the examples cited above. This is common sense. Not original research. In any case, having noticed that there is no article discussing the "separation policy", I created one: <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_policy_%28Israel%29_3d83.html" title="Separation policy (Israel)">Separation policy (Israel)</a>. It's a separate but related issue whose existence is rather beyond dispute, despite your ongoing equivocations. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 18:24, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, no, no. You can't translate back from separation to Hafrada. If you claim there is a policy called "Hafrada", you have to prove its existence as such. You have still not shown that there is a even a "separation policy", only that some, limited, steps have been made to separate between Israel and the Palestinians, in accordance with the agreed two-state solution. In the end, no matter how you spin it, both parties do agree the part ways, they only argue over the how, not the what.</dd>
<dd>Can you show a source which ties all the components you listed together, and says they are a part of a whole "separation policy", or is it your own OR?</dd>

<dd>The Palestinians have been working for years to get their own state, free of Israel's occupation, with the support of many Israelis. Now that Israel is finally taking steps towards that end, like the Hitnatkut, you call it apartheid.

You and I usually enjoy quite a good give-and-take despite our differing views, but it doesn't seem to be happening today. You are ignoring the links I provided to you and you are definitely not reading them or else you wouldn't be saying the things you are saying.

<dd>Do as you wish, but believe this - I have read all your links. To my understanding, none of them support the claim of "Hafrada" as government policy, and the whole "separation" thing doesn't seem to go beyond the barrier and the Hitnatkut. Given that there is no separation between Israeli Arabs and Jews (though there is some discrimination, that is a different issue), to call such apartheid is just... untrue. The steps Israel has taken are mostly along the lines of the two state solution. On a personal note - I was greatly discouraged by the Palestinians response to the Hitnatkut. Instead of realizing what an enormous step it was for Israel, and encouraging the evacuation of settlers, they chose to respond with violence, setting us back. I hope they realize it some day.

I now realize that it should be merged with <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafrada.html" title="Hafrada">Hafrada</a> and it thoroughly establishes that there is a separation policy, it is called hafrada, and its origins find inpiration in a book by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Schueftan_858d.html" title="Daniel Schueftan">Daniel Schueftan</a> entitled "Disengagement, Israel and the Palestinian Entity" (in Hebrew, <i>Korah Ha<a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafrada.html" title="Hafrada">hafrada</a>: Yisrael Ve Harashut Hafalestinit</i>)<a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/1488" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/1488" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and it was officially adopted as Israeli government policy.

<p>It is also loaded with language of a uneducated anti-Islamic individual.

<p>Before someone claims that this is original research</p>
<p>"Israel is not alone in being accused of apartheid. Australia, Brazil, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, France, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Malysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, the Former Soviet Union, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, and the United States have all been accused of this crime as well."</p>
<p>I would argue that such background information does not make an argument, but puts the issue in neutral context, and therefore cannot be considered original research, as original research is either an analysis or a synthesis or an argument.

<p>This is <b>madness</b> now, i am happy to see it deleted. This is not about sharring, this article has a name Allegations of Israeli Apartheid. and that is what is under discussion not who else got fingered. Furthermore if discussing stalin you would run a list saying "it was only Stalin that killed people, Hitler and POl Pot did it 2." Doesnt put anything into context it is original research at best at worst it is whitewashing. THe article reflects the accusation you dont feed the reader useless info.

<dd>Hold on one second there Urthogie. This is not an article about "allegations of oppression". Palestinians are oppressed by Israeli policies and there are few people who dispute that - though they might provide equivocations as to why. The article is about "Israeli apartheid" (a term and acocmpanying concepts) and it's only called "Allegations of" said subject because of a refusal to treat the concept on its own merits and discuss the controversy surrounding the designation in the article, rather than in the title. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 20:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On the contrary, this is an article about allegations that Israeli policies towards Palestinians resemble those of South African apartheid. People on one side argue they do, people on the other side argue they don't. This is a political debate about terminology, not an article which shows the "fact" of "Israeli apartheid", and then lists the views of some people who make excuses for it. The only reason people want to remove the word "Allegations" from the title is because they refuse to treat the subject as controversial, and discuss the controversy around those allegations, but instead feel the title and article should state the "fact" of "Israeli apartheid", and then afterwards have the article throw in some weasely defenses of the practice of "Israeli apartheid" from various barely credible bigots and ethnocentrists. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here are sources which makes clear that possible "apartheid" of other countries is relevant to many, and that other countries, for comparison are part of the debate.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly, Israeli Arabs are not always treated well, though not nearly as badly as the Egyptian Copts, or the few Jews left in the Muslim world. Israeli Arab towns are neglected and, particularly since the latest intifada, public suspicion has led to social discrimination. To make things worse, some politicians make no secret of their desire to remove the Arabs from Israel altogether. But apartheid, however satisfying it is for the morally outraged to think so, it is not.([<a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/comment/story/0,9828,761784,00.html" class="external text" title="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/comment/story/0,9828,761784,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian Opinion piece</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the American Anti-Slavery Group (www.iabolish.com): "Though slavery was legally abolished [in Mauritania] in 1980, today 90,000 slaves continue to serve the Muslim Berber ruling class. Similarly, in Sudan, Arab northerners are known to raid the villages in the South - killing all the men and taking the women and children to be auctioned off and sold into slavery." Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries deny equal rights to women, Christians, Jews, Hindus and others. Where are the protests against Saudi apartheid? Anyone who cares about human rights should support countries where they are respected and protest against those which don't. Israel, like other democracies, does not have a perfect human rights record. But the Orwellian attempt to lump Israel among odious regimes, while ignoring real abusers, employs a double standard so blatant as to fit international definitions of anti-Semitism. Such libelous campaigns are themselves an abuse of the lofty cause of human rights and, in the context of calls to "wipe Israel off the map," contribute to the ultimate human rights abuse, incitement to genocide.(<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860111&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter" class="external text" title="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860111&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter" rel="nofollow">Jerusalem Post Editorial</a>)</p>

<dd>The lead changes very fast. But we have to admit that it tend to list arguments against the use of the term, rather than actually explaining why some people draw parallels between Israeli policy and the apartheid regime. Right now the article does even not mention that there is an official Israeli policy named hafrada, which means separation in Hebrew. There are thousands of articles of Wikipedia that I cannot explain, including <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_the_Ancient_egyptians_5e36.html" title="Race and the Ancient egyptians">race and the Ancient egyptians</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 18:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please back up that claim. I've looked hard, and been unable to come up with evidence for such policy. The word "Hafrada" is not even used in that context in Israel.

<p>You are completely ignoring my question by bringing up Hafrada. I never commented on Hafrada. The question here is this sentence I added that was removed, not hafrada. Please start a seperate talk section to discuss Hafrada, if necessary. You have still not answered my questions:</p>

<dl>
<dd>Jossi, I don't have any POV-related issues with "political." I removed it because I think it isn't stylistically or encyclopedically appropriate in the sense you're using it. Though I agree with Jd2718 that it's a bit ambiguous, you seem to be using "political" in its casual, conversational sense, meaning controversial, disputed, loaded, etc. But the stricter, more formal and encyclopedic meaning of "political" is actually a neutral description, designating something to do with the forms and structures of governments, civic life, demography and electorates, etc. "Bicameral legislature" is a political term. So is "soccer mom," "plausible deniability," "rump parliament," and so on. It's sort of confusing to say "Allegations of Israeli Apartheid" is a political term in this sense. This article is by and large about a controversial category of moral rhetoric; it's not really about a point-by-point comparison of governmental policies in Israel and South Africa. I suppose that's debatable, but in any case it doesn't seem like this is what you intend by "political." You mean that the subject's loaded and disputed. Be assured that "controversial" takes care of that, not to mention the rest of the lead. "Political" in the sense you're using it is not only too informal for an encyclopedia, but also redundant, even tautological. --<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 21:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point, but by <i>not</i> asserting that is it a politically loaded argument, and using instead "controversial", the lead is already leaning in the direction of giving an unwarranted weight to the term itself. A way to resolve this, would be to start the article framing the controversy, rather than asserting these allegations as facts. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 21:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since "political" in this sense <i>means</i> controversial, I don't see how eliminating the redundancy would throw off the ideological balance of the lead. The lead makes very clear that the article's subject is thoroughly disputed; it doesn't need the volume turned up with superfluous adjectives, which just make the article sound unprofessionally written.

<p>I changed it slightly to read as follows:</p>
<p><i>The term Israeli apartheid is used to make a controversial analogy between Israeli policies of those of apartheid era South Africa.</i></p>
<p>Proponents of the analogy point to the separate rights and privileges of Arab and Jewish residents of the West Bank, and/or further allege second-class citizenship of Arabs living in Israel proper.</p>
<p>I think the first sentence is just much simpler and clearer this way. It retains "controversial", minus "political" and doesn't ascribe it to anyone. The next two paragraphs then outline proponents and opponents. I changed "and", in the second sentence above to read and/or, since not all who use the term use it the same way. I hope this is okay.

<p>There's actually another ambiguity, though, which might be fixed: Is the second sentence alleging that all residents of the West Bank have less rights, or that Palestinian residents have less rights than Israelis? I think it's the latter, though both might be alleged; in any case, it should probably be clarified. One solution might be moving "in the West Bank" to the earlier position "separate rights and privileges in the West Bank of Palestinian and Israeli residents." I'll make the change if someone agrees, or maybe I'm missing something. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 20:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>this is actually correct because Arabs - as long as they have an israeli ID - can drive on every road, pass every checkpoint in the west bank. This means that there is nothing racial here and it is based on Nationality: The people under occupation have less free movment than the occupaying power.

<dd>I thought that might have had to do with the choice of language. Well, I'll try a different option -- "difference in rights between" -- which I hope is ok.

<p>It has to do with what kind of ID a person has: i.e. is he a citizen or resdient of israel&#160;? If a Person is palestinian by origin and even by citizenship but he lives in Jerusalem or otherwise got an israeli residency he can move freely as any other israeli. In fact some towns are closed to israelis and such a person is forbeeden to enter those towns (like any other israeli - jewish or arab) Confusing&#160;? it should be - nothing is simple in this area.<a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 21:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, well just to ask first, how about "Proponents of the analogy point to the difference in rights and privileges between Palestinian and Israeli residents of the West Bank, or allege second-class citizenship of Arabs citizens in Israel proper."

<dd>The relevancy of what; your claim that Palestinians suffer from "differential treatment" because they can't buy land in Israeli settlements or live there? It seems that that's not differential treatment, but standard treatment in the West Bank, Palestinians can't live in Israeli areas, and Israelis can't live in Palestinian areas. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:49, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>G-Dett engages in extensive talk so as to build consensus. This is a wise practice considering that she edits at articles where such an approach defuses tensions and helps to reach amicable compromises. That you cite her editing article to talk page ratio as "evidence" that she is a troll is a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.

<dd>Jay, can people not ask you to be consistent? One minute you say not even the slightest bit of synthesis is allowed; the next minute you say a comparison between apartheid in two places doesn't require a source of any kind comparing them, and that asking for one is "disruptive trolling." Was it disruptive trolling for you to suggest that two discussions of whether or not opposing Israel is antisemitic can't be used together unless they were both specifically talking about Anti-Zionism by name? By your analysis, unless the source on Cuban apartheid is talking about Israeli apartheid, we can't include it, end of story. If you want to say you were mistaken, feel free, but I don't think you can accuse others of trolling for asking you to be consistent.

<dd>Regarding the <i>arguably</i> important link between "tourist apartheid" and the subject of this article: I didn't say it didn't exist, I said it wasn't self-evident. If reliable sources were to make the argument that "apartheid" is a word cheapened by overuse, and point to so-called "tourist apartheid" in Cuba as an example of this, then it would make sense for us to mention that argument and link to the relevant article. But it appears that it's only Wikipedians making that argument, and they wants to bolster it by insisting on the link.</dd>

<p>The result of the proposal was <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> → <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> — As per my comments on the talk, writing an introduction in the line with Wiki policies for the article as it is currently titled, should read: "<b>Allegations of Israeli apartheid</b> is a term used by some Wikipedia editors to prima facie marginalize and undermine the legitimacy of political arguments that make <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogies</a> between <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s treatment of non-whites during the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid era</a> to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s treatment of Arabs living in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and Israel, based on their strong belief that these kinds of analogies are inaccurate and illegitimate. The “alleged” analogies and how to write about them have become a contentious component of the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> both in the real world and in Wikipedia." If we want an encyclopedic entry, however, we must acknowledge that there are a number of people with respected academic and professional backgrounds and relevant life experiences who have characterized the system in Israel as "apartheid". It has even been called "Israeli apartheid" (getting some 281,000 hits on Google as opposed to 664 for Wikipedia’s naming of the phenomenon as “Allegations of Israeli Apartheid”). If we write an article entitled “Israeli apartheid” that begins along these lines: "<i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a term often used by those who make political arguments that draw <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogies</a> between <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s treatment of non-whites during the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid era</a> to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s treatment of Arabs living in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and Israel. As with many other issues in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, the term and the surrounding debate, is deeply contentious." - and further follow the rough format of articles like <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Anti-Semitism_4332.html" title="New Anti-Semitism">New Anti-Semitism</a>, we can write an informative article that represents the term and its associated phenomenon without unnecessary prefixes that are going to get tagged to a lot of other contentious concepts if we don’t set very strict and particular limits of the use. The reader should be able to judge the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the term based on the article content, which would cover all sigificant POVs as per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>/<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. —<a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 15:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you always have to make personal attacks when contributing your opinion? I made the proposal on the recommendation of User:MinderBinder, in the sub-section above. There was no ulterior motive. I just think "allegations of <i>(bllank)</i>" is a ridiculous way to title encyclopedia entires. And if you notice, the first sentence now reads simply "Israeli apartheid" because it <i>is</i> awkward (not to mention <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) to write "Allegations of Israeli apartheid draw a controversial analogy between" etc, etc. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 04:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These do not support a precedent for a redirect, and it's important to understand why. The term "Israeli apartheid" at least implicitly and arguably explicitly accepts the premise that Israel practices apartheid. State terrorism by the United States and <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism_in_Sri_Lanka_3891.html" title="State terrorism in Sri Lanka">State terrorism in Sri Lanka</a> also do that, and I certainly think the same standard should applied to those articles. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_antisemitism.html" title="Christianity and antisemitism">Christianity and antisemitism</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_antisemitism.html" title="Islam and antisemitism">Islam and antisemitism</a> are problematic terms, because the words "Christianity" and "Islam" conflate the faiths' theology with the individuals who practice it, but the term "and" serves to make the title merely a topical description without claiming or implying that Christianity and/or Islam are guilty of antisemitism; in other words, as far as the title is concerned, the underlying article might conclude that there is no antisemitism associated with either of these. <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> refers to a specific historical event that is beyond any reasonable dispute, but in any event doesn't attribute it to a specific group. ("Genocide of Jews by Germany" might be more descriptive and just as accurate, but that's not what the title says). <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a>, again, does not attribute guilt to any given party, and in fact the whole topic is so complex that the guilt part remains elusive. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" title="Pallywood">Pallywood</a> is flip but doesn't on its face make an allegation. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual_agenda.html" title="Homosexual agenda">Homosexual agenda</a> causes a visceral reaction for those who are familiar with it, but there's no question it's a euphemism. I am not crazy about <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> and would probably be inclined to rename it, precisely because it attributes a bad thing (fascism) to something we should be neutral about (Islam). Islamophobia I have no problems with as a term. As a phenomenon, it's complicated, but that's what the article is supposed to cover. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 20:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Leifern is right about the Holocaust, but the reasoning of most of the rest of his post eludes me. The word "and" in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_Antisemitism_ee03.html" title="Islam and Antisemitism">Islam and Antisemitism</a> does not somehow neutralize its topic; "New Antisemitism" makes the same ontological assumption about its subject as "Israeli Apartheid" would make about ours, neither more nor less; the flipness of "Pallywood" is indeed in what it alleges (trumped-up human suffering), and since in that case we're talking about <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiable</a> assertions of fact then "allegations" is indeed the right word; "homosexual agenda"....isn't a euphemism, whatever else it might be.</dd>

<dd>This is – or should be – a very simple matter. <b>1)</b> Article titles in Wikipedia don't presuppose the fairness or rightness – or even, strictly speaking, the actual existence – of their subject matter. <b>2)</b> "Allegations" means assertions of fact which could conceivably be proven or disproven beyond a doubt, but have yet to be; it isn't used with controversies involving irreconcilable differences of opinion and interpretation, or shades of moral rhetoric. If we can get past our own visceral reactions and moral hysterias, then <b>1)</b> and <b>2)</b> lead to a pretty obvious conclusion about what the title of this article should be.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 21:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC) <b>Addendum</b>: Leifern's last two sentences hit the bullseye.

<dd>My question is whether we've given enough thought to the idea of moving the primary substantive discussion somewhere else. If we did that, it would still be linked to here, but would be discussed under a neutral heading, such as "Rights of Palestinians and Israelis in Israel" or something similar. This may be one way to appease both camps, since it seems clear what the one group here primarily opposes is an in depth discussion of rights in Israel under the banner of "Israeli Apartheid," which frankly, I can understand. At the same time, deleting the material seems like the wrong approach as well. Is there anything along these lines we could do? It might be difficult, since a discussion of the accusation necessarily implicates the facts on the ground, but I feel like that's one productive direction things might move. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 21:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's sensible as well, but devising a title for the new article – and demarcating its terrain – may prove comparable challenges to riding herd over this page. (In the majority of instances, it should be stressed, the apartheid comparison has been applied to the occupied territories, not to Israel.) In principle I think the suggestion is a good one; perhaps we should hash out what it would look like in greater detail.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 16:00, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It contains the information the reader needs.</dd>
<dd>The problem with the "apartheid" claim, is that it's skin-deep. People just shout "apartheid", but never bother backing it up with specifics. They just hope the word "apartheid" would sound scary enough to turn people against Israel, much as is being done with "the wall", which is actually 95% fence.</dd>
<dd>That's why there are few specific claims of proponents here. That's why the claims are also all muddled up, mixing together the situation of Israeli-Arabs and Palestinians, doing neither of them justice. Because the thing is, once you start a point by point comparison of Israel and South Africa, you find there are practically no similarities. The proponents seem to use the word "apartheid" as a generally "bad word", much as many people use the word "racism" to describe any sort of discrimination, regardless of actual race issues.</dd>
<dd>The proponents seem to contradict themselves, on the one hand demanding the end of the occupation and the establishment of a Palestinians state, and on the other condemning Israel for trying to separate itself from the Palestinians. The lack of well defined claims leads to absurdities like describing the Disengagement plan as a form of apartheid, when it is, in fact, required for the two state solution, and basically consisted of giving back land to the Palestinians - an obviously positive step in the peace process. This is why the article looks like it does. The proponents shout "Apartheid", a word which contains a load of accusations, and the critics address those accusations point by point. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 10:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, not strawman, these claims do exist, and I've had to argue with them often enough. Not soapboxing either, since I'm trying to clarify why the article looks like it does - with "too much criticism" - it's because the proponents seem to think that their accusations are summed up in the word "Apartheid", and rarely make more specific claims, and that's why we don't list many of them. Since the word apartheid is a claim by itself, critics need to address it point by point, leading to what looks like an unbalanced article. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 14:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The condition for peace as far as Israel and the US are concerned is that both Hamas and Fatah recognise and be committed to <i><b>Israel’s right to be an apartheid state</b></i> inside the Green Line as well as its imposition of apartheid in the West Bank and Gaza. Short of this, there will be no deal…</p>
<p>It should be clear then that in this international context, all existing solutions to what is called the Palestinian-Israeli “conflict” guarantee Israel’s need to maintain its racist laws and its racist character and <i><b>ensure its right to impose apartheid in the West Bank and Gaza</b></i>. What Abbas and the Palestinians are allowed to negotiate on, and what the Palestinian people and other Arabs are being invited to partake of, in these projected negotiations is the political and economic (but not the geographic) character of the <i><b>Bantustans</b></i> that Israel is carving up for them in the West Bank, and the conditions of the siege around the Big Prison called Gaza and the smaller ones in the West Bank. Make no mistake about it, Israel will not negotiate about anything else, as to do so would be tantamount to giving up its racist rule.</p>

<p>The decision to abandon or modify such a powerful and useful term as “Apartheid” is a strategic, not semantic, one. <i><b>“Apartheid” highlights some of the most salient elements of the system of domination, control and displacement that has been constructed by the Jews in Palestine over the past century</b></i>, a system close to completion. It identifies “separation” based on national/religious grounds as the basis of Israel’s policies towards the Palestinians. <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafrada.html" title="Hafrada">Hafrada</a> (Apartheid in Afrikaans) is the official Hebrew term for Israel’s vision and policy towards the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories – and, it could be argued (with qualifications), within Israel itself.</p>

<p>University of Massachusetts at Boston Professor Leila Farsakh described the differences between apartheid in South Africa and the Zionist movement. Whereas Afrikaaners were a demographic minority dependent on indigenous South African labor, she explained, Zionists seek a demographic majority and attempted from the beginning to employ only Jewish workers. “Although they started differently,” she said, “they converge similarly” with Israel’s post-1967 “Bantustan reality.”</p>

<dd>To the contrary, it looks like an attempt to make this article less POV. However, in looking at the sources quickly, I am not sure that the stuff about the one-state solution really belongs. I need to take the time to read them carefully. The sources do, however, support the contention that the "IA" analogy is used to justify boycotts, as well as terrorist attacks on Israel, though I realize that this needs to be written carefully. I think it also needs to be remembered that this entire article is about opinions, and not even opinions about facts, but opinions about how to analogize one situation to a different situation, and how words in three different languages equate to each other. It is all very shaky and beneath the standards of Wikipedia, but unfortunately the article is not going anywhere, so we need to try to make the best of it and try to balance the anti-Israeli propaganda in this article with some facts. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:57, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Some proponents support the one-state solution; some don't. Some proponents support Palestinian right-of-return absolutely; some support it only within the borders of what will be a Palestinian state; some support it as a "right" that should be honored in theory but not practice, etc. Some proponents think the green line is absolute; some are interested in land swaps. Some call the barrier an "apartheid wall"; others don't. Some proponents think the situation is trending towards apartheid; some think apartheid is and always has been the de facto situation while the occupation is in place. Some proponents have blond hair and are outdoorsy types; others are bookish brunettes. Some of them in all likelihood this very moment have a finger resting pensively on the side of their nose.</dd>

The reason we're inserting this non-sequitur paragraph about the <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binational_solution.html" title="Binational solution">binational solution</a> is because the binational solution, though a completely different topic than the apartheid analogy, is, like the apartheid analogy, controversial.

<dd>Other than syaing "it is POV" you did not provide any justification. Sure providing each POV is actually NPOV and this is what wikipedia is about. The addition to the lead arepart of the subject 9and are already in the article itself. Those who call Israeli policies "apartheid" are using that word as a weapon. The goals toward which the weapon is used are definitely an important part of the topic - all this has tio be in the lead.

<li>Let'sadd this to the discussion: Those who call Israel an apartheid state wants to make a change that would give Palestinians equal rights. Among these rights (as in SA) is the right to vote. As such who is the majoority and who control the country is an important part of the subject. Wikipedia readers deserve to know that. Clearly those who remove this NPOV description from the lead are pushing their OWN POV which is to simplify and hide the real issues.

<dd>Zeq, we've been trying very hard to create a NPOV lead, which gives some sort of equal treatment to both sides. You're now adding a long section on the motives of the people who use the analogy. This is the primary problem. Also, you may have sources saying there is a goal, but this is one POV. I do not believe we have sources establishing that every person who uses this phrase has the same tactical purpose. The lead isn't for arguments of individuals, but for summaries, with particular care for NPOV, per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELead_b989.html" title="WP:Lead">WP:Lead</a>. If you want to include the material, I think we should consider where else to put it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 12:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The lead should include: What, Who , Where , How and Why . I tried to add to the "why" and "who" the best NPOV I can.</dd>
<dd>NPOV <b>is</b> providing two POVs: POV of one side and POV of the other side.</dd>

<dd>I think you're right that it doesn't, but it's the compromise we've currently reached. What you seem to have, though, is one questionable sentence about the political motives of proponents, followed by another extended sentence with reasons why these motives are misguided. I don't think that works. For a discussion like this to work, I think we'd need a more significant expansion of the lead, to discuss more of what this claim is actually about. G-Dett suggested something of that nature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid/Archive_19#Lead" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid/Archive_19#Lead" rel="nofollow">here</a>, though it so far hasn't achieved consensus. I'll say your intention here actually sounds fine to me, but I think we would need to find a better way to do it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 13:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
