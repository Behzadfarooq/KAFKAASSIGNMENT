<p>I'm not sure whether you're going to read this reply if you have indeed quit, but I thought I'd reply anyway to your points regarding the Star Trek article:<br />
1. Comprehensiveness issues. Unfortunately this level of detail simply cannot be accommodated in Wikipedia's 32K limit. That's why issues like Star Trek vs. Star Wars need to have their own articles. This was a bone of contention for me regarding the failed feature nomination for <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>. Once we included everything that people wanted, the article was more than 50K and that was before images were added; we had to cut it back to 32K and the nomination failed. This is a failing of Wikipedia, I'm afraid. I personally would like to see entire sets of articles nominated as feature articles. The Star Trek articles - of which there are probably hundreds - and the dozens of James Bond articles I have personally worked on add up to far more than the single overview article. Maybe this is why most feature articles are on simple, single-subject topics. In terms of other matters in this section, no Wikipedia article is stable, especially one dealing with a current issue. Star Trek, IMO, comes to an end as a viable franchise on May 13, 2005 when <i>Enterprise</i> ends. So the article should stabilize in due course after that date; the only alternative is locking the article. As far as the well-written issue, there is always room for improvement, but you'll always end up with newbies and those whose English skills are lacking wanting to contribute.<br />
2. Uncontroversial. I hardly call the Voyager POV issue controversial. And if you check the recent edit, it has been resolved to my satisfaction anyway.<br />
3. Images. Cutting down the <i>Enterprise</i> section added quite a bit of free K. I'm sure image tags don't take up much space and the images themselves don't add to the amount of K on a page, so I can't see any reason why you can't. I did note, however, some concern noted regarding copyright. But if the images fit the Wikipedia policy, go for it.<br />
4. Heading reorganization. There can be some subheads added, certainly. Feel free.<br />
5. Reference. Again, feel free to add. But Wikipedia is not a book - we don't need bibliographies with every article. In the case of Star Trek, it would need an article on its own and I bet there is one.<br /></p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully your stress meter isn't an indication that you're gone for good, as you do have good ideas for the main Trek article. Cheers! <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:58, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Followup</b>. Welcome back! Just a further point to the above, if you want an example of an article where instability and controversy go hand in hand, check out the revert war that has been raging over at <a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a> for days now.

<dd>I really wish you hadn't nominated it for removal as a featured article. Who really cares? Personally I think you should have "been bold" and tried to fix the thing rather than just do something that is going to get people upset. Plus there is an "anti-Star Trek" agenda by some people here - who would like to see all Trek articles removed - and I feel something like this just gives them ammunition. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:21, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I happened to see your proposal on the talk pages of User:Circeus. I don't know if this is such a good idea. There must be millions of them. The real problem is that each year many species and genera, even whole families, are renamed or reclassified. This would mean that Wikipedia would get stuck with a great number of names which are no longer accepted names. Nobody is able to control such a large number of out-of-date data. The editors of the Tree of Life project are grappling with this problem on the basis of genus per genus as we advance. There is enough work left for the next couple of decades, even if our number increases considerably. On the other hand, your other proposal to take photos at the university garden is excellent. I work on the botany pages and I know how hard it is sometimes to obtain the right photo. We have to rely most of the time on www.plants.usda.gov where the majority of the photos has a non-commercial restriction. Therefore, go ahead, take the pictures and put them in the Commons. A few recommendations&#160;: note the scientific name and take photos of the flower, the leaves, and the habit of the plant. Macro photos would also be very welcome. I wish we could find more photographic enthusiasts on all continents. Only then our photographic database would be truly cosmopolitan.

If the intent is to quickly get a list of discussions that still need to be closed, this can be accomplished with putting a <code>.vfd { display:none; }</code> into your css, which will hide closed discussions. (This is especially easy with Opera, since it can be toggled on and off with one key; I haven't used Firefox for about six months, though I seem to recall it has similar functionality.) If it's meant to help keep track of discussions closed by non-administrators (especially relevant at the moment - I've noticed several discussions closed with the edit summary "<i>consensus to DELETE; admin: please delete</i>" over the past few days), it's already in the instructions to doublecheck all discussions for a day before removing it from /Old. Are there any benefits to the extra step that I'm missing? —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 00:28, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, as long as I'm here, could I trouble you to tweak Vfdbot to add a &lt;!-- Please do not add new vfds here. Put it on the appropriate day's page instead. --&gt; or something similar to the previous day's page when updating the list of days currently transcluded into <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>? I catch two or three vfds a week being added to the <i>first</i> day listed on vfd instead of the current day, and sometimes two or three a day where they're added to yesterday's page just after midnight UTC. The latter aren't a problem if they're missed (and I don't bother to correct them even when I see them), but the former certainly are. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 00:28, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's no immediate need to update it actually. You could put a notice saying that this page may be out of date, and may be useful. It's not required for anyone to strike out or anything.

<p>You are my hero, thank you for descending into the murky world of gay porn to rid us of the notorious Autofellatio.jpg. I would award you with the purple heart for the mental scars you have doubtlessly carried away from that enterprise, but as that seems too US-centric, how about I award you with something more useful, should you ever find yourself in a similar situation again. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 18:13, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>While I appreciate your view of a need for an amendment of this sort, it shouldn't be pitched on a page which has been designated for voting and not for new proposals, and where time limits and quorum requirements apply. It also necessiates that previous voters return to keep track of the vote to potentially vote on late additions to the proposal such as this one. As such, I have removed the proposal; I direct you (and other supporters of this proposal) to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_Proposals_2c20.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Proposals">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Proposals</a> which is being used to hold new proposals while this vote is underway.

<dd>Yes, its more grainy than your .png version. I stitched it at full resolution, but it still ends up with fewer pixels than the png version. I'll tinker some more.</dd>
