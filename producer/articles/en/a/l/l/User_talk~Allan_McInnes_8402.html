<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>i wonder why you keep trying to delete the "Structural engineering" as a main branch of engineering. Do you really understand what is structural engineering&#160;? I think you are just simply follow the listed provided by the ASEE. In reality, structural engineering is not really similar and also not really a sub-discipline of civil engineering. It covers the structural design and analysis of all civil, mechanical, aerospace, material, architectural, naval architecture and even biomedical's structures. I am a structural engineer, I don't agree structural engineering is belong to any other engineering branch, it is an independent engineering disciplince. The design and analysis of buildings and bridges, we called it civil structures but not structural engineering. Structural engineering means anything related to the design and analysis for structural compenents and systems. This is the point i need to clarify with you. Besides, although the ASEE does not list out structural engineering as main branch of engineering, this doesn't mean that structural engineering is not a main branch of engineering. In many U.S. states, structural engineer requires different license to civil engineer in order to practice as a structural engineer and the license for structural engineer does not really require undergraudate degree in civil engineering as the minimum education requirement, but with architecutral engineering background also can sit for the structural engineer licensing exam. We are here to help to editing the wikipedia, ASEE standard is only for American people but not for the whole world. --Hwachang82</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am sure that you believe that structural engineering is a separate branch of engineering. I even agree with you - I've worked with a number of structural engineers on spacecraft design projects. As such, I think it is perfectly valid to list structural engineering in the <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_of_engineering.html" title="Fields of engineering">Fields of engineering</a> article. However, in order to support the claim that structural engineering is a <i>major</i> branch of engineering it is necessary to provide some kind of reference for the claim (personally, I would include software engineering as a major branch of engineering, but my opinion doesn't matter, only what I can provide a reference for). See Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> for more information. The current version of the list in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">Engineering</a> article contains the 19 branches of engineering <i>explicitly</i> identified by the National Society of Professional Engineers as "major branches of engineering" (feel free to check the reference - that's the point of having references). As I said before, if you can provide an alternate reference which lists structural engineering as one of the "major branches of engineering", then by all means do so. But please stop adding unreferenced items to the list. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small></dd>

<p>Thanks for cleaning up FBP! I note that Visual programming languages have been removed, but this is implied by Data flow languages, so I guess it was redundant. Is it OK to mix footnote references in with References - could you take a look? It looks a bit odd to me!</p>
<p>I wasn't sure about the companies, but I wanted to convey a sense of the maturity of the technology - any suggestions? Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 18:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed "visual programming language" from the "See also" section because there is already a wikilink to it in the leader section. Typically the "See also" section should only contain relevant wikilinks that don't appear elsewhere in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that mixing notes and references looks a little odd. My personal preference is to make every reference a footnote - that makes it clear which references were used as a resource in the creation of a specific piece of text, and ensures that the reference list doesn't become cluttered with references that weren't actually used in preparing the current incarnation of an article. In the interim, I have created a separate "Notes" section to hold the footnotes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the conveyance of a "sense of the maturity of the technology", you might try adding something to the history section that discusses current use of FBP. That would be a reasonable place to mention the companies that implement FBP-based tools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is my attempt OK? I am not sure if "current" is right - should I specify a month and year, or just assume that, if things change, an editor will pick it up? <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 20:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Beautiful! However, this leads to the question whether my other web site references should use "cite web", including accessdates? I suppose the difference is that a company may change its products, whereas a research paper is unlikely to change the foundations it is built on... <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 00:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "cite web" template is a good idea IMO. As for the use of access date: although it's true that a paper won't change its foundations, where a research paper has been published as html I personally prefer to include an access date as well, simply because websites have a habit of being revised. But that's just personal preference, rather than Wikipedia policy. It's up to you whether or not you want to include access dates. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 05:22, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an aside, I just took a look at your userage, and realized who you are. First of all, allow me to welcome you to Wikipedia! I have no doubt that you can make some great contributions here. Secondly, I want to caution you to be careful that your contributions are not seen as self-promotion (a danger when you are the one responsible for the work you are writing about). You may want to review the arbitration case at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Carl_Hewitt_3765.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Carl Hewitt">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Carl Hewitt</a>, which was sparked by the problems arising out of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hewitt_103a.html" title="Carl Hewitt">Carl Hewitt</a>'s editing on topics involving the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a>, and should give you some idea of the kind of concerns that have been raised in the past. Please note that I am not suggesting that what you have contributed so far is problematic. I simply want to make sure that you aware of the potential pitfalls, and can avoid them. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 19:23, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, Allan! Yes, since I posed the question, I realized that I should try to make every reference a footnote, as you suggest. I'll look at the Hewitt thing - I am aware of some of the pitfalls, and have been working hard at NPOV, so an actual case study should be useful... PS It seems that there is a real problem on Wikipedia with stuff that a person knows, but is not in published documents - I have run into this one on a totally different topic.

<dd>The problem with things people know, but that are not published, is that Wikipedia has policies of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">avoiding "original research"</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">ensuring that articles are verifiably correct</a>. Both of these policies exist for very good reasons, which are described on the respective policy pages. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 20:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After much wheel-spinning I finally used a "cite journal" for one of the articles, and used Citeseer references for some others. a) Did I do that right?, and b) the Citeseer tag doesn't seem to have an accessdate - is that because it's not needed, or can/should it be added? And, if so, how? And, by the way, can you give me a definition (or place to look) for the difference between "functional" and "applicative"? TIA <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 17:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow! The references section in FBP looks much better. Nice work! The use of {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">cite journal</a>}} looks fine (although I did tweak it to use "lastname, firstname" for the first author.</dd>
<dd>I'm not really familiar with the Citeseer template. From a quick glance at the template definition it doesn't appear to include fields for anything other than the title and Citeseer-level URL. If you prefer a more fleshed-out reference (with authors and other info), you might consider using the relevant Citeseer bibliographic info to construct a {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">cite journal</a>}} citation that has provides the full Citeseer URL in the "url" field.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure there <i>is</i> a difference between functional and applicative programming. I've seen the two terms used interchangeably in a number of venues. <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/793" class="external text" title="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/793" rel="nofollow">This</a> (albeit brief) thread on the excellent Lambda the Ultimate programming language weblog may be helpful. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 20:38, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks, Allan! I thought maybe "applicative" was a purer form of "functional" - bdenckla seems to be saying something like that too... So it looks like I don't have to worry. Also, I thought maybe Citeseer conferred a higher degree of "confidence", but if it's interchangeable with {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">cite journal</a>}}, maybe I'll go back to that...? <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 00:01, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The advantage of using {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">cite journal</a>}} (perhaps with a citeseer url) is that it provides readers of the article with more information than just a link to citeseer. It gives them a full citation that they can , for example, use to find the cited article in their library. Providing full citations is also a good idea because Wikipedia <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html#Think_about_print" title="WP:ASR">isn't intended to be an online-only encyclopaedia</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 00:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks again! This is quite a learning experience! I am still undecided about which articles to reference, but, when I decide, I will follow your advice! Does Citeseer confer any more confidence? I find its search mechanism unreliable... I am also trying the "ref name=..." convention - I would appreciate it if you could look at the section I have just added to FBP, and see what you think...

<dd>The use of "ref name=" looks good to me. As for Citeseer, I don't really have any opinion one way or the other. I personally use Citeseer quite a bit, but not as my only source of papers. One advantage that Citeseer does have (unlike say the ACM portal) is that it is freely accessible to all. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 22:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried going the GA route as Peer review didn't get any feedback, and I failed miserably! (I also tried GA/R and got a bit more feedback.) In a way this result does not surprise me as I haven't had much success over the years in getting articles published - not academic enough, I guess! Could we get some kind of collaboration going to improve the article - perhaps via the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_science_e186.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer science">Wikiproject on Computer Science</a>...?

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, it's been my experience that the Peer Review process doesn't tend to generate all that much useful feedback. Glad to hear that the GA/R netted you some comments though. WPCS would certainly be a good venue to solicit for help with the article. I'm afraid that I don't personally have the time to help out with the FBP article right now, although I may stop by and try to do some copy-editing and style tweaks from time to time. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 19:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Allan, I know you're pretty busy! I am trying WPCS - maybe that will net some keener who can spot what the fundamental problem is!

<dd>Nobody has stepped up to WPCS - yet! There is an area that I could really use some help or direction in, and it's fairly specific: I am confused about references, links, etc. FBP is being referenced fairly extensively in blogs and wikis, and also, as I said in the article, on the web sites of 3 companies that I know of. I tried to convey a sense of this in the list of articles, but <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a> removed what I viewed as a key sentence explaining this. <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a> seems to imply that references are either to support the concepts or for further reading, but I want to show how people are building on FBP. Could you give me some tips, or suggest a structure and wording. Or maybe I'm totally off base vis a vis WP.

<dd>The paragraph that Ideogram removed was pretty vague. I think you'd be better off having a paragraph or section that explicitly discusses different implementations of FBP ideas, and makes reference to the relevant company websites. As for links to blogs and wikis, these are generally discouraged on Wikipedia. And trying to use a range of blog and wiki references to infer something about the popularity of FBP ideas would, IMHO, amount to original research. If you want to discuss opinions about the value or popularity of FBP you really need to be able to provide some kind of external reference (such as an article that discusses such things). AS for WPCS, you might have better luck posting something on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Computer_science_f7cb.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science">project talk page</a>, which I think more people track than the "articles needing attention" page.

<p>I've been listening in on the Functional Programming entry for the past couple months now. You'll probably see more contributions in the future. Just to fill you in on my own background. I've been working with the storage and analysis of time series data for the past 15 years or so. My interest in functional program stems from my initial attempts to learn K about four years ago. I found the language incredibly hard and completely alien to the way I'd been programming. That's when I began to do research into Lisp, APL and later functional programming in general, which was essential to gaining a clear understanding of what K was about. More recently I've been creating materials for teaching a course in K and consequently been doing more extensive research into functional programming.</p>
<p>I have some strong opinions which I'm guessing differ a bit from your own take as well as LotLE, but I think it will be productive all around. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">Abcarter</a> 19:17, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No doubt&#160;:-) That's the beauty of the Wikipedia system - we all get to contribute (and as a result, we all get to learn as well). I've never had cause to use K, since it's application domain is pretty far outside the scope of my activities (both in research and in industry). But I'm looking forward to learning the K perspective from you. So welcome aboard! the FP article&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 19:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit confused at the process. I explained what my proposed changes were, answers objections and waited for replies. After getting none I went ahead. Six minutes later LotLE complete reverts. He objects to my intro sentence. He may well have a point, but I did give an explanation in the discussion section and wondering why he doesn't simply make a change rather than revert the entire set of changes I made.

<dd>Well, I can't speak for LotLE. However, there is some difference between making some general pronouncements about what kind of changes you wish to make, and actually implementing specific changes. It's not uncommon to find that other editors will agree with the general approach you wish to take, but object to the specifics. I've often seen the cycle: large change; reversion; discussion about specific changes; consensus. I couldn't say whether or not it's "the usual procedure" - I'm not sure Wikipedia has one. But it is common enough to have it's own <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">guideline</a>. I wouldn't get too concerned about it. Now that everyone can see exactly what it is you had in mind we should be able to reach some kind of consensus version that everyone's happy with. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 19:32, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a few objections to your <a href="../../../w/s/n/WSN_0163.html" title="WSN">WSN</a> page edits. It seems like you have cleared up the external links (which is a good thing), but i think that you have cleared up a bit too much. The commercial companies links had to go - i agree. But why are the following links removed?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tinyos.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.tinyos.net/" rel="nofollow">TinyOS Website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.btnode.ethz.ch/Projects/SensorNetworkMuseum" class="external text" title="http://www.btnode.ethz.ch/Projects/SensorNetworkMuseum" rel="nofollow">The Sensor Network Museum</a> (Resource on Sensor Network Hardware)</li>

</ul>
<p>The reason you are giving is "rm commercial links, blogs, foreign language links:"</p>
<p>TinyOS is a non-commercial open-source operating system and that website is NOT a blog. TinyOS is the basic building block of sensor networks. tinyos.net is the FIRST website that a person not familiar with sensor networks is reffered to and it has a lot of very helpful resources.</p>
<p>The Sensor Network Museum is an effort to collect information about various sensor node hardware platforms. Its the most extensive resource available on sensor network hardwares (not pertaining to any one specific platform but doing a nice breadth and depth wise search of ALL platforms proposed so far). There is a section on "hardware" in the WSN article and this resource is the natural next step for readers interested in further links on sensor network hardware.</p>
<p>MAC Protocol Soup: Again, the most comprehensive listings of MAC protocols in sensor networks. There are a *lot* of MAC protocols for sensor networks outthere and this is the most extensive study done on MAC protocols in "trying to make sense out of it all".</p>
<p>I am a sensor networks researcher and been working in the field for around 3 years now. All the above three links are the most important, impartial, and very useful links which are compiled after years of efforts from various research groups. I am of the opinion that the wikipedia readers should be given links to them (if they want to look for further information).</p>
<p>Please reply on MY talk page as I am sure that I would forget to check this talk page. and thanks for your clearing up effort on the WSN page.</p>

I will be working actively to update the software architecture page over the next few weeks. Then I'll work on updating other relevant software architectures sub-topics.

I agree that it's in a very primitive form. I've tried to do a little work on it but (a) I don't have time for in-depth work on the article, and (b) while I have an interest in software architecture, my knowledge of it is mostly limited to having studied Allen's work on the Wright ADL and my background in systems architecture in general. So it's great to see someone knowledgeable in software arhcitecture making significant contributions. I'm certainly more than happy to help out with formatting and any other questions you might have.

<p>wvbailey here: I don't know what to make of what has been going on relative to that article. Probably in response to "anonymous", "Krauss" created the page yesterday, then I corrected the English and added to it -- all of the in-line citations, plus the syntax, the justification for the mnemonic-choice etc. (RE the article history). But all of this has been going on because of "anonymous"'s insistence. Go to the discussion on the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Register_machine.html" title="Register machine">Register machine</a> discussion page to see what a mess this has been since "anonymous" appeared. (Recently I split the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_machine.html" title="Counter machine">Counter machine</a> page off from <a href="../../../r/e/g/Register_machine.html" title="Register machine">Register machine</a> so most of the talk appears on the reg-mach discussion page.) Some of what "anonymous" suggested is a good idea -- to define a simple syntax so a comparison of the models is easier. But, for example, the creation of the "RefLib" strikes me as (maybe) going too far in the NOR direction, I can't tell. Because of his persistence it feels like "anon" is having me write chapters in his wiki-book, or something. I need a bit of perspective here: any advice or suggestions would be welcome. Thanks, wvbailey<a href="../../../w/v/b/User%7EWvbailey_8349.html" title="User:Wvbailey">Wvbailey</a> 13:51, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"RefLib", sans any kind of reference, strikes me as being very much original research. Other text in the article comes across more as an essay rather than an encyclopedia article. Having some conventions for presentation makes sense to me. Trying to use those conventions to make comparisons that haven't already been made in the literature starts to get into OR terriitory in my opinion. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 03:34, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is my worry too. But the syntax thing has been very helpful, i.e the stuff that looks like:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[ r ] + 1 â†’ r</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is verbatim from the text Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) and very close to Minsky (1967). But whether we can use this syntax to explain, for comparison purposes, the models on <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_machine_models.html" title="Counter machine models">Counter machine models</a>, I dunno, would the use of this syntax be OR? And also helpful has been Krauss's insistence on a standardized use of mnemonics as functions such as INC(r) or JZ(r,z). Please comment.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see a problem with using some kind of standardized syntax for presentation. Where I see problems arising is in the transition from standardized presentation to presenting some kind of comparative <i>analysis</i>, if that comparison or analysis has not been previously presented in the literature. That's when the use of the "reference model" starts to seem like OR to me.--<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 18:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>For sure it is true that many examples in the two texts are there -- how to build new functions from the base functions, in a manner similar to the table. But I am uncomfortable with the RefLib. Krauss will put up a fight and be disappointed, I think. Is there some way around this? I know in the past other wiki-folk have tried to come up with a standardized computer "language" (some sort or other), and failed. If you know of a "successful article" in this regard, please point me there. Or if you know of some other advisors who can render opinions, please do. (I don't know of any). We could vote, for example. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know of any successes. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">User:Deco</a> proposed something called <i>WikiCode</i> a while back, as a kind of standardized pseudocode. It was strongly opposed from some quarters. The approach eventually taken by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_science_e186.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer science">WikiProject Computer science</a> was to provide some <i>style guidelines</i> (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_science_Manual_of_style_%28computer_science%29_a8c5.html#Algorithms" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer science/Manual of style (computer science)">here</a>) for describing algorithms and writing pseudocode, but to leave things fairly flexible (necessary in part because of the differing levels of abstraction in different algorithm presentations). You could try asking at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Computer_science_f7cb.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science</a> to see if anyone else has ideas on how to handle this issue. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 18:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This OR thing is hard: we can never know all "the literature", often what I think is OR turns out to be out there somewhere. But I've had a lot of experience with patent law, and there is a similar problem there too -- lawyers make fortunes off the disputes.</p>
<p>Also, given that the article survives, how do we fix its name? Thanks, wvbailey<a href="../../../w/v/b/User%7EWvbailey_8349.html" title="User:Wvbailey">Wvbailey</a> 15:21, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, what it boils down to is that if something <i>isn't</i> OR, then the editor submitting the material should be able to provide a reference. Just saying "there's probably some literature on this out there somewhere" doesn't cut it, because we have no way of knowing if (a) that's actually true, or (b) whether or not what the editor is submitting is in agreement with the literature. Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">policy of verifiability</a> for good reason. If material looks useful, but doesn't come with references, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. WP is simply the wrong venue for material that hasn't been previously published elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for fixing the name, probably the easiest thing to do is to move the article to something like Wikipedia:Counter machine reference model (analogous to <a href="../../../a/l/g/Wikipedia%7EAlgorithms_b646.html" title="Wikipedia:Algorithms">Wikipedia:Algorithms</a>), and then get Counter Machine:Reference Model deleted (the colon in the name is definitely a problem, since colons are supposed to identify namespaces, which "Counter Machine" is not). --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 18:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Allen, I've been doing some work on the K language entry. Based on a suggestion I've merged the entry on KDB into the K entry. No problem with any of this, and in general have a fairly clear idea of what I want to add in regards to KDB. Here's my problem. Is KDB a relational database? I have two opposing arguments and I consider both problematic. Kx Systems and Arthur Whitney say that it is. I think this is mostly marketing and think that it is not. I have my reasons which I can articulate, the core point being that KDB has no data model, there is no distinction made between a logical description of the data and the way it's physical stored. I know this is my opinion, even if I'm right it's more original research than reference. That's fine, I don't have a lot invested in this, but do I simply take the vendor's word? Understand that I don't think I can simply duck the decision here. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">Abcarter</a> 22:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmmm... I don't really know anything about KDB. From a cursory glance at the Kx website I see that they decribe it as a "relational database". Without digging further, it's hard to know how valid that claim is. The best approach is probably to avoid stating what KDB is directly, but rather to rely on vendor quotes. Statements like
<dl>
<dd><i>Kx Systems describes KDB as a "...relational database architected for scalable high performance as data volumes grow..."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>are totally factual. The reader can choose to take them at face value, or to dig deeper on the Kx website. But unless you can find some kind of published analysis indicating that KDB <i>isn't</i> a database I don't think you can justifiably add anything that explicitly states that KDB doesn't meet the criteria to be a database - you're correct that doing so would cross in to original research. Anyway, that's my opinion of the matter, for what it's worth. Hope it's helpful. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 02:39, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A minor correction: KDB is most definitely a database, just not a relational database. But your suggestion is clearly the way to go. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">Abcarter</a> 12:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>You were very helpful in the area of WP conventions before - I am wondering if you could give some guidance: I have been told that I can improve this article by adding citing articles to <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Paul_Morrison_e1ab.html" title="Talk:John Paul Morrison">Talk:John_Paul_Morrison</a>, so I have added quite a few there (my hand got tired!). There are also several on <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flow-based_programming.html" title="Flow-based programming">Flow-based programming</a>. My question is how to tie them together...? My other question is whether you would be willing to add a section on how FBP relates to Actor theory. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 19:17, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your vote, Allan. I understand and agree that I should not edit the article myself - do you have any ideas about what should be done with the references in <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Paul_Morrison_e1ab.html" title="Talk:John Paul Morrison">Talk:John_Paul_Morrison</a>... and who might do it? Also, my request about Actor theory still stands! <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 02:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're welcome. I'd suggest leaving the references on the talk page for now, and perhaps asking some of the users who voted in favor of keeping the article to take soem time to review the reference and add any they think are appropriate to the body of the article. I'll try to make a little time myself, but I'm kind of swamped at work right now, so my WP activities are somewhat limited.
<dl>
<dd>Thanks - I'll do that... and if you do have the time later, that would be just great!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As for Actor theory, I'm afraid that I may not be the best person to contribute such a section. Although I've edited the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> some (and argued with Carl Hewitt a lot :-) I'm far from an expert on Actor theory and the relevant literature. I have no idea if anyone has written anything on the relationship between FBP and Actors. I do recall seeing some traffic on one of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communicating_Sequential_Processes_6018.html" title="Communicating Sequential Processes">Communicating Sequential Processes</a> mailing lists discussing FBP. But I'm not sure if it ever got beyond an email exchange. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</small> 02:27, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I've seen some stuff on the blogs - maybe I can entice one of the authors to contribute some words:-) All the best for the season! <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpaulm_8b88.html" title="User:Jpaulm">Jpaulm</a> 17:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Take for instance, this entry: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=0.999...&amp;diff=103344522&amp;oldid=103116194" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=0.999...&amp;diff=103344522&amp;oldid=103116194" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=0.999...&amp;diff=103344522&amp;oldid=103116194</a> by USER:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/204.52.215.96" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/204.52.215.96" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/204.52.215.96</a></dd>
<dd>Would you say that justifies blocking? I read the policy, and it's kind of vague. It seems to me that once someone does a blatant vandalism that they should probably be blocked.

Assuming that doesn't stop the vandalism (which I suspect it won't) then I'd say it's probably worth bringing this up on the noticeboard.
