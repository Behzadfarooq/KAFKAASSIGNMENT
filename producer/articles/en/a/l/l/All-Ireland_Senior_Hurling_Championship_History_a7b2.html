<p>Tracing the history of the Hurling Championship over the last fifty years or so, it is possible to easily pick out periods when specific teams or <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Ireland_391f.html" title="Counties of Ireland">counties</a> dominated the competition, only to find themselves rapidly superseded by another dominant team or teams. With that in mind, it is easy to view the last fifty years by era:</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a> <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a> team of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> is remembered as one of the most successful and physically intimidating of all time. Of the eight All-Ireland finals to take place during this period Tipp reached six of them. Having lost out in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Tipperary_285e.html" title="County Tipperary">Premier County</a> returned in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> taking on the first "native" <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_GAA_b43a.html" title="Dublin GAA">Dublin</a> <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a> team. The contest was a close one with the Dubs missing a point in the dying seconds which allowed Tipp to win by a single point. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> Tipperary rturned once again, this time taking on old rivals <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a>. Two goals for Tipp in the opening minute gave them a huge boost, however, the match wan't settled until the final ten minutes when Tom Ryan scored a goal which meant Tipp won by 3-10 to 2-11.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> the Tipperary dominance was broken when <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterford_GAA_9463.html" title="Waterford GAA">Waterford</a> contested the All-Ireland final. Waterford were losing by 11 points at one stage, however, they managed to bridge the gap to 2 points. In the end, however, the young <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Keher_fba5.html" title="Eddie Keher">Eddie Keher</a> secured victory for "the Cats" by finishing with a personal tally of 14 points. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> Kilkenny were back in the final for a second year and were red hot favourites to win the title. However, they faced a rejuvenated <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a> who scored 5 goals, the sixth one being disallowed. Tipp won by 5-13 to 2-8 and were champions once again. <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> saw Tipperary take on old rivals <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a> in the final. Tipp scored 7 points without reply in the second half and won comfortably in the end.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> saw a respite in the Tipperary dominance of the era with <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> contesting the All-Ireland final. Cork were playing in their first final since <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> and fielded one of the youngest team's ever. There was even speculation that 45-years old <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christy_Ring_c854.html" title="Christy Ring">Christy Ring</a> would be redrafted back onto the panel. In the final itself Cork defeated "the Cats" by 3-9 to 1-10. Kilkenny returned for a second consecutive final appearance in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, this time taking on <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a>. A victory for "the Cats" by 3-8 to 2-7 ended a 45-year Tipperary bogey for the Kilkenny hurlers. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> Tipperary played once again against rivals <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a>. 8 points down at half time, Wexford came back to win the game by 2 points.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> started their domination of the competetition that would last for the entire <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. Up until then Cork and <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a> were considered the "hurling superpowers", with Kilkenny being the distant cousin in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a>. This all changed during the 1970s. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> Kilkenny took on Cork in the All-Ireland Final, a repeat of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> clash. This time, however, the result was different with Kilkenny claiming victory. Cork returned in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, taking on <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a> in the first 80-minute final. A hat-trick og goals by Cork's <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_O%27Brien_%28hurling%29_8181.html" title="Eddie O'Brien (hurling)">Eddie O'Brien</a> sealed victory for the Rebels by 6-21 to 5-10.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> saw Kilkenny play in the first of five consecutive All-Ireland Finals. Their opponents in this classic match were <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a>. The game was noted for Kilkenny's <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Keher_fba5.html" title="Eddie Keher">Eddie Keher</a> scoring a record 2-11 (in spite of ending up on the losing side), and for Tipperary's <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babs_Keating_99d1.html" title="Babs Keating">Michael "Babs" Keating</a> playing in his bare feet. Tipp won by three points. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> Kilkenny played in their second final of the decade, taking on Cork. Kilkenny came back from 8 points down to win the <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_McCarthy_Cup_da0a.html" title="Liam McCarthy Cup">Liam McCarthy Cup</a> once again. A third final appearance for Kilkenny saw them take on <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> champions <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick_GAA_92c5.html" title="Limerick GAA">Limerick</a> who were playing in their first All-Ireland final since <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. A vital goal in the second half rejuvenated the Limerick attack who went on to win their first title in 33 years.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> final was an action replay of the previous year's but with Kilkenny claiming victory instead. A penalty by <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Keher_fba5.html" title="Eddie Keher">Eddie Keher</a> and a freak goal that trickled under the Limerick goalkeeper's legs secured victory for "the Cats." In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> Kilkenny played in their fifth consecutive All-Ireland final. Their opponents <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a> had stunned Cork in the semi-final and lead Kilkenny at half-time. However, Kilkenny scored vital goals and secured the coveted two-in-a-row. This "double" victory brought an end to Kilkenny's dominance in the era. It has been said that had it not been for injury problems Kilkenny could have easily won three or maybe four All-Ireland's in a row, however, it was not to be. In spite of this the 1971-75 team is considered one of the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>While Kilkenny dominated the early 1970s, the second part of the decade belongs to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> their opponents were <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a>. Cork were 2 points down with ten minutes to go but 8 quick points in successions ecured victory for the Leesiders. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> Cork played Wexford in the final for a second year in a row, with the result being the same. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> Cork reached their third All-Ireland final in as many years, taking on old rivals <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> in the game. Much was at stake with Cork looking to win their first three-in-a-row since the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>. A goal by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Barry-Murphy_3828.html" title="Jimmy Barry-Murphy">Jimmy Barry-Murphy</a> in the final fifteen minutes secured victory for Cork and an historic treble.</p>

<p>The ten All-Ireland Finals between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> saw a different team emerge every year almost. <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a> were undoubtedly the luckiest team of the decade as they managed to reach seven of the ten finals. However, they only managed to win on three occasions. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> they were easily defeated by <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a>, however, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> Galway got the upper-hand over the Munster champions <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick_GAA_92c5.html" title="Limerick GAA">Limerick</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> The "Tribesmen" made their third consecutive appearance in the final. However, they were defeated by <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offaly_GAA_fc7f.html" title="Offaly GAA">Offaly</a> who were playing in their very first final. <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> saw <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> pitted against <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a> faced <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> in both finals.

<p><a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> was a special year for the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a>, as the organisation was celebrating its centenary. Having nearly been knocked out of the competition in the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> final Cork managed to reach the final to take on Offaly in a special final at <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semple_Stadium_1d6e.html" title="Semple Stadium">Semple Stadium</a>. The Rebels easily defeated Offaly and were crowned centenary champions. Offaly returned however in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to take on Galway who were making a return to the big time. Offaly avenged the previous year's defeat by narrowly defeating the Tribesmen, however, Galway returned in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> to take on Cork in the final. A second consecutive All-Ireland defeat didn't dishearten Galway as they returned in victory in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, defeating Kilkenny in the final. Galway made it two-in-a-row in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> as the Tribesmen defeated the Munster champions <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> final saw a unique event. While <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a> were playing in their second final in two years, their opponents, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antrim_GAA_3659.html" title="Antrim GAA">Antrim</a>, were playing in their second final ever. The result was predictable as Tipp easily defeated the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulstermen</a> by 18 points, the legendary <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicky_English_11e0.html" title="Nicky English">Nicky English</a> scoring 2-12, a record for the final. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> final was one of the highest scoring finals ever. In what was the beginning of the end of a great <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a> team <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a> defeated the Tribesmen by a massive scoreline of 5-15 to 2-21.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> Tipperary once again returned to the final, this time taking on <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a>. It was to be Tipp's last final appearance for ten years while it was tie beginning of a winning streak for Kilkenny. Tipperary were champions in 1991 but Kilkenny returned in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> to win the double, defeating Cork and Galway respectively.</p>

<p>The mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990s</a> saw the emergence of some of the so-called "underdogs" of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a>. From <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> the Championship was won by teams who would not be considered major hurling powers. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> All-Ireland Championship produced the legendary "5 minute final" between <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offaly_GAA_fc7f.html" title="Offaly GAA">Offaly</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick_GAA_92c5.html" title="Limerick GAA">Limerick</a>. Limerick were set for victory, however, with five minutes left in the game a resurgent Offaly scored two goals within two minutes and most of their points to secure their first title since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> Championship saw Offaly reach the final again, however, this time they were defending their All-Ireland title against <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_GAA_cf86.html" title="Clare GAA">Clare</a>. The omens pointed towards an Offaly "double" as Clare hadn't appeared in a final since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>. At half time Offaly were in the lead, however, in an interview at half time, an exasperated Clare manager, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Ger_Loughnane_2d48.html" title="Ger Loughnane">Ger Loughnane</a>, confidently predicted "We're going to do it." A goal by Clare in the second half, followed by the collapse of the Offaly defence lead to the "<a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Clare_1390.html" title="County Clare">Banner County</a>" winning their first All-Ireland title since <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> All-Ireland Final was contested by <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford_GAA_a8d0.html" title="Wexford GAA">Wexford</a> and Limerick. While Limerick were looking to avenge their 1994 defeat the win went to Wexford who had their first victory since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> Championship saw the introduction of the "back door" system for the defeated <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> finalists. As a result of this new format the All-Ireland final was a repeat of the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> final between Clare and Tipperary. The result was the same however as Clare defeated the "<a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Tipperary_285e.html" title="County Tipperary">Premier County</a>" for a second time in the first All-Munster All-Ireland final.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> Championship saw a return to the old order as the "traditional" hurling counties began to make a comeback. The final that year was contested by Offaly and <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a>. In a repeat of the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> final Offaly were the dominant team of the game and captured their second title of the decade. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> Championship brought an end of the underdogs era as the new millennium saw a return to the old order that was to be dominated by the traditional <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a> counties.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship_History_a7b2.html" title="Edit section: 1999 to 2006: Cork-Kilkenny Dominance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1999 to 2006: Cork-Kilkenny Dominance</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> normal service was resumed as the superpowers broke back once again. Like the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> of the seven All-Ireland Finals that were to take place between 1999 and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, all but one of them were not contested by either <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_GAA_8720.html" title="Cork GAA">Cork</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilkenny_GAA_9937.html" title="Kilkenny GAA">Kilkenny</a> or both. In 1999 Kilkenny were contesting their second consecutive final, however, after a loss the previous year, nothing but a win was on their mind. Victory wasn't theirs as Cork snatched victory by a single point. The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> final was an all <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> affair as <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offaly_GAA_fc7f.html" title="Offaly GAA">Offaly</a> took on Kilkenny who were playing in their third consecutive final. The sides were evenly matched, however, the game ultimately proved to be a walkover for Kilkenny who won by a margin of 13 points. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> saw <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary_GAA_ab53.html" title="Tipperary GAA">Tipperary</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a> re-emerged in an All-Ireland final after several years of absence. The battle was closer than people had anticipated, but Tipperary pulled away in the end to win by 3 points and claim their 25th All-Ireland title, their first since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> Kilkenny were back in the final after an absence of two years. Their opponents were <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_GAA_cf86.html" title="Clare GAA">Clare</a>, however, the Banner men were unable to beat "the Kilkenny Cats" on that occasion. Another final appearance and another victory for Kilkenny in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> final cemented their dominance in <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a> and made it clear that they were one of the best teams in recent years. The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> final was a replay of the previous year's with Cork and Kilkenny battling it out again. Much was at stake in this game. Kilkenny were looking to make history by completing their first outright "three-in-a-row". Cork were looking for revenge for the previous year. With both teams claiming 28 titles each they were both looking to go one up on the other in the "Roll of Honour." Also, neither team had one their respective <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Ireland_090b.html" title="Provinces of Ireland">provincial</a> championships. The game was a very tense affair with tight hurling and low scoring. However, in the second half Cork only allowed Kilkenny to score 2 points, while the Rebels pulled away to almost double scores.</p>
<p>The final of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship_2005_6aae.html" title="All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 2005">2005 Championship</a> looked set to be another battle between Kilkenny and Cork; however, a semi-final defeat for the Cats set up a final meeting between Cork and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway_GAA_011c.html" title="Galway GAA">Galway</a>. Cork led from the start with Galway unable to catch up to their opponents in spite of excellent hurling by both teams. Cork were victorious and secured their 30th All-Ireland title.</p>
<p>The trend continued in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> with another final contested between the two dominant powers. Cork were pre-match favourites, but Kilkenny upset the odds with a 3-point victory in what was a closely contested match. By denying Cork the holy grail of three consecutive titles, Kilkenny gained a measure of revenge for the final of two years previously.</p>
