<p>I don't know if this show is that good. I mean, when young children see another kid at their age acting like a teenager, they will act like teenagers too.</p>

<p>The criticism section is totally off base. First of all "twisting characters personalities too far"? And then the example cited is Susie as a <i>baby</i> had a different life goal from Suzie as a teenager? Of course she does! People change their life goals hundreds of times in their lifetime. Not to mention the fact that almost no one remembers their life as a baby, so she probably doesn't remember her original goal was to be a doctor. I for one can't rememember anything from before I was 5.</p>
<p>Next off the social themes are spot on. That's exactly how kids are these days. And then once again, the example cited is totally off base. Tommy getting his first kiss is not unusual for his age group (and being 10/11 somehow make him "underage"? I've got news for you, there's no set age for your first kiss). Kids have their first kiss on average, around the age of 11-ish (give or take). And 13 year olds have their own cell phones, piercings, and talk about sex and whatnot on a regular basis. This is how kids are these days, you don't have to like it, but it's a fact of life.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that this show isn't just aimed at kids, it's also aimed at the people who grew up with Rugrats, a show that was on for (give or take) 13 years. So if you were 1 when you started watching the Rugrats series, and you grew up as a fan, you're just the right age to appreciate the show <i>now</i>. --<a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenomaru_a6d0.html" title="User:Venomaru">Venomaru</a> 22:06, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I still think the show is premoting a liberal lifestyle among children. Familyguyfan1990 June 9 2006</p>
<p>I grew up watching the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugrats.html" title="Rugrats">rugrats</a> (I'm 23 and I still find it entertaining now), I think the lifestyle they lead All Grown Up is fairly accurate compared to today's youth (kids act a lot more grown up than people remember). The dialogue is very inaccurate though. For example, I watched the episode <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Aptitude_6fa9.html" title="Bad Aptitude">Bad Aptitude</a> this morning and they were far too articulated for 11 year olds. Another thing that hits me as odd is that Chucky at least (Kimi too possibly) seems to be employed at the Java Lava. It's a fairly entertaining show but I think that It'd be more realistic (in terms of the dialogue and storylines) if they were a couple of years older. <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saving_Cynthia_45f1.html" title="Saving Cynthia">Saving Cynthia</a> is probably my favourite episode that I've seen because it covers the issue of letting go of your childhood.. That's another thing that frustrates me, the show could be addressing issues that are much more psychological rather than actual events and trends that preteens deal with (which I think <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Told_By_Ginger_55bf.html" title="As Told By Ginger">As Told By Ginger</a> handles much better). The episode Seperate but Equal the twins idea was covered well and <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Reptar_460b.html" title="Curse of Reptar">Curse of Reptar</a> is another "let go of your childhood" story although I think that episode was ruined by the rest of the storyline. I just think All Grown Up would be better (and less generic) if they wrote shows in the same way that the early episodes of Rugrats were written, eg. in the Rugrats episode Baseball, Tommy's main interest is the balloon and not the baseball game. I know this would be very hard to recreate with AGU because of the age difference, but they could simplify the issues that the show covers. An episode about procrastination when studying for an exam would be a good example. A <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procrastination_%28SpongeBob_SquarePants_episode%29_4ff0.html" title="Procrastination (SpongeBob SquarePants episode)">Spongebob episode</a> covered that story once pretty well (funny too). anyway I'm rambling on.. that's my main criticism of the show, that it over complicates the stories and the characters are distanced from the issues that are covered by the episodes. It may be accurate to say that kids start acting grown up at that age and have cell phones and want to go to the mall, but the show doesn't have the closeness that once existed with Rugrats. Also, Phil's voice is wrong in the show, it's too high compared to when he was a baby and he sounds too much like Lucien Cramp's character in the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cramp_Twins_8224.html" title="Cramp Twins">Cramp Twins</a>. I'll still be watching All Grown Up, but I'll always miss the delightful originality that Rugrats had, and be frustrated that the oppertunity to revive that wasn't taken with AGU. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillPP_fdec.html" title="User:BillPP">BillPP</a> 02:13, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regardless of the merits of the criticism section, it is entirely unreferenced, and therefore could well be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<p>I have tagged the "Airings" section as a disputed section, as I feel the info is suspect. If someone can give a source, please do. Otherwise, this section should be changed or deleted.
