<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/ALLMEP_de7b.html" title="Edit section: Alliance for Middle East Peace -  ALLMEP">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alliance for Middle East Peace - <b><a href="http://www.allmep.org" class="external text" title="http://www.allmep.org" rel="nofollow">ALLMEP</a></b></span></h2>
<p>The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of over 40 non-governmental organizations (<a href="../../../n/g/o/NGO_9dc2.html" title="NGO">NGOs</a>) - see list below -, who promote people-to-people coexistence between Arabs and Jews, Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. ALLMEP's aim is to increase awareness and funding opportunities in the USA for grassroots peace initiatives in Israel and Palestine. ALLMEP’s goal is to seek significant funding for reconciliation and coexistence work from the US Government and major foundations. ALLMEP does not take positions on political issues. Many of the organizations in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_peace_camp.html" title="Israeli peace camp">Israeli peace camp</a> are ALLMEP members.</p>
<p>ALLMEP works by:</p>
<p><b>* Opening dialogue to policymakers</b></p>
<p>Working to open and sustain a dialogue between ALLMEP member NGOs and U.S. agencies that can support coexistence work. These efforts have included meetings with USAID and State Department officials, an event in Jerusalem in 2006 including NGO representatives and U.S. diplomats, and ongoing contact with appropriate U.S. officials responsible for NGO funding.</p>
<p><b>* Public events to support Middle East coexistence</b></p>
<p>ALLMEP hosts an annual event in Washington. In June 2005, for the first time, Middle East ambassadors, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders, members of Congress and staff, State Department officials, Middle East scholars, leading pro-Israel and pro-Arab activists, the media, private funders, students, and Middle East NGO peacemakers gathered together in support of coexistence.</p>
<p>ALLMEP’s fourth annual event is taking place in March 2007. Like the 2006 event, the event will include a reception and meetings with stakeholders in Washington.</p>
<p><b>* Increasing public and private resources for coexistence</b></p>
<p>ALLMEP encourages both public U.S. funding of coexistence efforts, as well as funding by private foundations. Each year, bipartisan groups of 35 - 40 members of Congress have supported ALLMEP’s letter in support of coexistence funding, in addition to 7 senators in 2006. As a result, U.S. funding for reconciliation programs worldwide has grown and attempts to create a dedicated fund for coexistence programs in the Middle East have begun to bear fruit.</p>
