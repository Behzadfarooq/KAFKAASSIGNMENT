<p>What would have to be done to the article to make it compliant without stripping it down to the bone or screwing it up royally? I think to help maintain the NPOV, any reference of the " <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_%28metaphor%29_8e31.html" title="Golden Age (metaphor)">Golden Age</a>" of the show should be converted into references to the first generation of the show. However, you can still call them the old All That and the new All That. Does that sound good, or not? <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.97.47.88.html" title="User:68.97.47.88">68.97.47.88</a> 21:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the heading from "Golden Age of All That" to "First Generation of All That" to reflect NPOV. Let me know if my edit was unnecessary. Thanks! <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.97.47.88.html" title="User:68.97.47.88">68.97.47.88</a> 22:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To whomever added the POV tag, will you please explain you're reasoning behind this? Many of the opinions about <i>All That</i> can be easily found in the external links section down below. <a href="../../../t/m/c/User%7ETMC1982_1023.html" title="User:TMC1982">User:TMC1982</a></p>

<p>You're kidding, right? This article is a fanboy feeding frenzy. The explanations of the seasons after the "Golden Age" (A POV statement in itself) ended are just insult after insult. I'll admit that they were very, very bad, but the article offers almost no solid information about it other than your opinions. Just because you put "Most fans believe" or "Some think" before a statement, that doesn't mean it's automatically free from any criticism. I'm readding the tag.--<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_Aquamarine_37f0.html" title="User:Agent Aquamarine">Agent Aquamarine</a> 05:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm the anon that added a cite needed tag to "<i><b>All That</b></i> is an" because I simply couldn't determine if it is running or not running. I just randomly came to this page, never having heard of All That, and saw a contradiction with the "is" and the tense used later in the sentence, together with the cancellation section below. My guess would be that it is not running now, but maybe reruns are showing somewhere? Anyway I've since added two references, one to the imdb entry, another to the soundtrack listing. I've also commented out two inline links after the urban legend paragraph. I followed both links but they yield nothing resembling to citation. -<a href="../../../2/1/3/User%7E213.219.161.27.html" title="User:213.219.161.27">213.219.161.27</a> 00:40, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed "Schneider was supposedly absent from the 100th episode special while and Kopelow was supposedly absent from the 10th anniversery special." to "Schneider was supposedly absent from the 100th episode special, and Kopelow was supposedly absent from the 10th anniversery special." I think that makes more sense, but not sure it's what the original intentions were.

<p>I just did another update, but I'm not quite finished yet. I left off on citing sources for the section on Kevin returning had the show come back for an 11th season.

<p>That's the best I could do to clean this article up a bit. Stil don't know why I have A's and B's in the references; I have all the references unique names, even though it was pretty tough to think of names that weren't already occupied. But I think overall I did a pretty good job. I fixed the NPOV, the facts, and fixed the footnotes (to the best of my ability).

<p>You should've at least let someone else take a look at the article before you removed the POV tag. It's slightly better, but still bad. I mean, most of the references are posts from fan forums.

<p>Sorry about that. Anyway, I've removed some claims that were only backed up by IMDb and fan sites and stuff that couldn't be verified.

<p>The tag is still up, so in addition to removing the section on the return of Good Burger, I also added a source for the claim that Action League Now originated on All That, which it did. I also decided to remove the claim that <a href="../../../n/e/d/Ned%27s_Declassified_School_Survival_Guide_2ff2.html" title="Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a> used Channel 6 and a Half in its episodes, since I've never seen it mentioned on the show, although I don't watch it very often.

<p>I deleted the section on the return of Good Burger until further notice. That will help make the article a little bit shorter, and I wasn't sure how notable it was. I mean, if the recent discovery of the complete unused footage from <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">John Carpenter's Halloween</a> isn't notable enough to be included in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween (film)</a> article, then Good Burger's return probably isn't notable enough for this article. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.97.47.88.html" title="User:68.97.47.88">68.97.47.88</a> 21:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Good Burger</i> is arguably the most recognizable and/or popular sketch in <i>All That</i> history (they did after all, turn it into a full-length movie). The fact that they tried to revive the with somebody else in the lead role instead of Kel Mitchell (as the same character mind you), should be noticable. <a href="../../../t/m/c/User%7ETMC1982_1023.html" title="User:TMC1982">TMC1982</a> 2006 4 September (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, wasn't exactly sure. I didn't want to change anything without saying anything on here about it. By the way, I had a great edit planned for this aticle yesterday to settle the accuracy disputes and NPOV disputes, but it looks like editing is restricted now. I'm sorry if my editing this article has caused any trouble, but I was trying to prevent this kind of thing (or worse, deletion) from happening.

<p>Don't worry, I have nominated this article for peer review to see what can be improved. And I also changed that the first episode of the "New" All That prenmiered in 2002, and changed it to 2001; that was my mistake. Season 7 was in 2001, and <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_1e3b.html" title="Jamie Lynn Spears">Jamie Lynn Spears</a> joined the next season, which was in 2002.

<p>The seventh season of <i>All That</i> premiered in January 2002. So technically, it premiered in the mid-way point of the 2001-2002 television season.

<p>My first inclination is to fail this article for GA status, but in the interest of fairness (since the wait for a new review would be lengthy), I'm going to put this on hold for 7 days. The following are my suggestions (some minor, some not-so-minor):</p>
<ol>
<li>Image layout - at least on my browser, some of the images are covering article text, particularly in the smaller sections. Consider either changing the placement of some of the images, or simply removing some. Frankly my suggestion would be the latter - this article isn't so large that the amount of images you have is necessary.</li>
<li>Image captions - When including cast images, it's standard to identify everyone in the picture. Since some of the images are so small, this may not be practical. Therefore my suggestion is to choose one or two cast photos (preferably with the most well-known people) and caption those, then get rid of the others.</li>
<li>Make sure every image used has a fair use rationale provided. <a href="../../../i/3/7/Image%7EI37897777_99207.jpg_ff60.html" title="Image:I37897777 99207.jpg">Image:I37897777 99207.jpg</a> could be problematic, as it appears to be a combination of screen shots and copyrighted publicity photos.</li>
<li>See <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Sections_and_headings" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> for the proper way to capitalize section headings.</li>
<li>Per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, your opening paragraphs should provide a concise summary of the article. But the 3rd paragraph contains information on spinoffs that isn't referenced anywhere in the main article. In addition, the lead makes no mention of the show's popularity or cultural impact. It was on for 10 years, so I assume it was popular. The lead also makes no mention of when the show was canceled.</li>
<li>Reading the article, I got no sense of the actual style of the show, or of its sketches. What kind of humor was it? Was it all original material, or did they do some parodies? Did the style of humor change over time? Consider creating a "Format" section and including information about the opening, sketches, and musical acts. Currently this information seems to be sprinkled throughout the article.</li>
<li>Don't assume anyone reading the article is familiar with the most well-known sketches. <i>Good Burger</i> is mentioned multiple times, but is never once described. You don't have to go in-depth, but a few sentences would be helpful. Similarly, there's an entire paragraph about the return of <i>Vital Information</i>, but it's not introduced anywhere else in the article.</li>
<li>Move the soundtrack section near the bottom of the article. The fact that it was released in 1996 doesn't mean it has to go in the middle of the article, as it interrupts the flow.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, try to avoid single sentences standing on their own. Try to incorporate them into other paragraphs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 17:44, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll do what I can. I have moved the soundtrack to the end of the article. I am currently writing better captions and providing fair use rationale for each image. I might get remove the image of <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Bynes_6844.html" title="Amanda Bynes">Amanda Bynes</a> as Ashley, because it might just be taking up space.

<p>I have been editing all day, and I like the looks of it so far. I have added a Format section with a Notable sketches subsection. I will probably add more sketches to it, including Ask Ashley, Repairman, 2gether 4ever, Tilt a Hurl, and Know Your Stars. I guess this section was a good idea after all, because the sketches weren't described anywhere else in the article. But I hope to get this article polished off once and for all by the end of the seven days. <a href="../../../p/f/4/User%7EPF4Eva_8d72.html" title="User:PF4Eva">PF4Eva</a> 00:17, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have completed my enxtensive edits, and I feel that the article is ready to be voted as a Good Article. What do you think? <a href="../../../p/f/4/User%7EPF4Eva_8d72.html" title="User:PF4Eva">PF4Eva</a> 23:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A definite improvement. A few thoughts:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I like the Format section. Consider moving it closer to the top, before you go into the show history.</li>
<li>In the Format section, you mention that the later seasons relied more on gross-out humor, but also state that one of the teen-oriented jokes shows someone eating their own dandruff. I would consider that gross-out humor.</li>
<li>Did the return of <i>Vital Information</i> occur during the 10th anniversary? It's not made very clear. If not, it shouldn't go in that section.</li>
<li>Some stats backing up the popularity of the show would be great (ratings, articles proclaiming its popularity). You have the viewership figures for the 10th anniversary, which is great.</li>
<li>Make sure to use the proper tense when stating things. For instance, the article says "All That would debut as a weekly series on December 24, 1994." If it happened in the past, it should say "All That debuted as a weekly series on December 24, 1994." There are other instances of this. Basically, if something already happened, state it that way. Don't use terms like "would do this."</li>
<li>In the castmembers section, date ranges should be formatted with an <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dash.html" title="Dash">en dash</a>. Instead of 1994-97, it should be 1994–97.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think once these things are addressed, you will have a Good Article on your hands. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 21:29, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That didn't take me too long. How does it look now, is it ready to pass as a GA? <a href="../../../p/f/4/User%7EPF4Eva_8d72.html" title="User:PF4Eva">PF4Eva</a> 23:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel what the only major section that this article is missing is one on "cultural impact." Besides the history, format and cast, there needs to be this section in an article about a television show. Otherwise, well done with the recent edits. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 04:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I feel that with the most recent edits, this article has been brought up to Good Article standards so I have passed it. As for the suggestion by Wikipedical - I'm not certain that this show has had much of a cultural impact (not all TV shows do). In any case, congrats! --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 16:29, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I had to remove a few things that were taking up space, and this included things like unnecassary templates, large templates, long lists, etc. I think I have finally gotten this page up to FA status.

<p>Why are Zoey 101 and Just Jordan listed as All That spin-offs? They merely contain actors who appeared on All That before getting their own shows. Spin-offs imply the character leaves and gets their own show playing the same characters, which these two do not do. Zoey would have to have been a character on All That for it to properly qualify as a spin-off. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.224.243.78_c007.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.224.243.78">71.224.243.78</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.224.243.78.html" title="User talk:71.224.243.78">talk</a>) 18:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>It actually is subjective. But it is my opinion that both shows qualify as spin-offs in that:</p>
<ol>
<li>they star former All That cast members.</li>
<li>the shows are produced by Nickelodeon.</li>
<li>the shows are written, produced, directed, etc., by the same people who did so on All That.</li>
</ol>

I did not include <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What_I_Like_About_You_%28TV_series%29_5b0d.html" title="What I Like About You (TV series)">What I Like About You</a></i> because it was produced by the <a href="../../../w/b/_/WB_Network_190b.html" title="WB Network">WB Network</a> instead of Nickelodeon. I feel that as long as it stars a current or former All That cast member, is produced by the All That producers, and is a Nickelodeon show, it is a spin-off. Besides, if Zoey 101 and Just Jordan are not spin-offs, neither are <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenan_and_Kel_8c90.html" title="Kenan and Kel">Kenan and Kel</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Amanda_Show_0632.html" title="The Amanda Show">The Amanda Show</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nick_Cannon_Show_6c61.html" title="The Nick Cannon Show">The Nick Cannon Show</a>. <a href="../../../p/f/4/User%7EPF4Eva_8d72.html" title="User:PF4Eva">PF4Eva</a> 21:43, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am trying to add info on season 6. Though it is still included in the source box, any info I add will not write to the page. It acts as if no info was written at all or like I wrote it with hidden tags. This Season 6 information is crucial to the article, and I can't even have it show up on the page, it skips parts, and the article really isn't that long. I don't know what to do. I'm trying for FA consideration, and information is getting cutt off inexplicably. Can somebody please help?

<p>The lead section is not as bad as some I've been reading today. I can see you're trying. I don't think it's going to make it this time around though.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The theme song for All That was performed by TLC."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The theme song for <i>All That</i> was performed by the American R&amp;B group, TLC."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"The show first aired on April 16, 1994 as a "special preview" and debuted as a regular series on December 24, 1994.[2] All That originally featured mainly young adults, but from Season 7 onward, <b>it made a big switch to feature only preteens</b>."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Was there some reason for this big switch?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"The show was very popular during its run.[3] In fact, some of the cast members got their own spin-off shows"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not particularly compelling prose, imo. "The show maintained high popularity during its 7 years on Nickleodian" or whatever. There's no problem with simple sentences, but these are almost sterile, they're so simple. I will look over the whole article, and post my opinion. However, as it has been under FAC a number of times without passing, if it doesn't pass this time, I will personally work with the editors to get it to FA quality--so stick with it. This may take time, though. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:37, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
