<p>Hume was born at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Mary_Cray_120e.html" title="St Mary Cray">St Mary Cray</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, the son of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Hume_eab8.html" title="Joseph Hume">Joseph Hume</a>, the Radical MP. He was educated at <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_India_Company_College_0139.html" title="East India Company College">Haileybury Training College</a> and then <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_Hospital_51ce.html" title="University College Hospital">University College Hospital</a>, studying <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>. In 1849 he sailed to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and the following year joined the Bengal Civil Service at <a href="../../../e/t/a/Etawah.html" title="Etawah">Etawah</a> in the North-Western Provinces, in what is now <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>. He soon rose to become District Officer, introducing free primary education and creating a local vernacular newspaper, <i>Lokmitra</i> (<i>The People's Friend</i>). He married Mary Anne Grindall in 1853.</p>
<p>He took up the cause of education and founded scholarships for higher education. He wrote in 1859:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p><i>a free and civilized government must look for its stability and permanence to the enlightenment of the people and their moral and intellectual capacity to appreciate its blessings.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1860 Hume was made <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Bath_2ec6.html" title="Order of the Bath">Companion of the Bath</a> for his services during the rebellion or <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_rebellion_of_1857.html" title="Indian rebellion of 1857">Indian rebellion of 1857</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>The system of departmental examinations introduced soon after (<i>Hume joined the civil services</i>) enabled Hume so to outdistance his seniors that when the Mutiny broke out he was officiating Collector of Etawah, which lies between Agra and Cawnpur. Rebel troops were constantly passing through the district, and for a time it was necessary to abandon headquarters&#160;; but both before and after the removal of the women and children to Agra, Hume acted with vigour and judgment. The steadfast loyalty of many native officials and landowners, and the people generally, was largely due to his influence, and enabled him to raise a local brigade of horse. In a daring attack on a body of rebels at Jaswantnagar he carried away the wounded joint magistrate, Mr. Clearmont Daniel, under a heavy fire, and many months later he engaged in a desperate action against Firoz Shah and his Oudh freebooters at Hurchandpur. Company rule had come to an end before the ravines of the Jumna and the Chambul in the district had been cleared of fugitive rebels. Hume richly merited the C.B. (Civil division) awarded him in 1860. He remained in charge of the district for ten years or so and did good work.</p>

<p>In 1863 he moved for separate schools for Juvenile delinquents rathern than imprisonment. His efforts led to a Juvenile Reformatory not far from <a href="../../../e/t/a/Etawah.html" title="Etawah">Etawah</a>. He also started free schools in Etawah and by 1857 he established 181 schools with 5186 students including two girls. In 1867 he became Commissioner of Customs for the North West Province, and in 1870 he became attached to the central government as Director-General of Agriculture. In 1879 he returned to provincial government at <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allahabad.html" title="Allahabad">Allahabad</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Hume's appointment, in 1867, to be Commissioner of Customs in Upper India gave him charge of the huge physical barrier<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>which stretched across the country for 2,500 miles from Attock, on the Indus, to the confines of the Madras Presidency. He carried out the first negotiations with Rajputana Chiefs, leading to the abolition of this barrier, and Lord Mayo rewarded him with the Secretaryship to Government in the Home, and afterwards, from 1871, in the Revenue and Agricultural Departments. Leaving Simla, he returned to the North-West Provinces in October, 1879, as a member of the Board of Revenue, and retired from the service in 1882.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was against the revenue earned through liquor traffic and described it as "The wages of sin". With his progressive ideas about social reform, he advocated women's education, was against infanticide and enforced widowhood. Hume laid out in Etawah a neatly gridded commercial district that is now known as Humeganj but often pronounced <i>Homeganj</i>. The high school that he helped build with his own money is still in operation, now as a junior college, and it has a floor plan resembling the letter H. This, according to some is an indication of Hume's imperial ego, although the form can easily be missed.</p>
<p>Hume proposed to develop fuelwood plantations "in every village in the drier portions of the country" and thereby provide a substitute heating and cooking fuel so that manure could be returned to the land. Such plantations, he wrote, were "a thing that is entirely in accord with the traditions of the country-a thing that the people would understand, appreciate, and, with a little judicious pressure, cooperate in."</p>
<p>He also took note of rural indebtedness, chiefly caused by the use of land as security, a practice the British themselves had introduced. Hume denounced it as another of "the cruel blunders into which our narrow-minded, though wholly benevolent, desire to reproduce England in India has led us." Hume also wanted government-run banks, at least until cooperative banks could be established.</p>
<p>He was very outspoken and never feared to criticise when he thought the Government was in the wrong. In 1861, he objected to the concentration of police and judicial functions in the hands of the police superintendent. He criticized the administration of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bulwer-Lytton%2C_1st_Earl_of_Lytton_a1e5.html" title="Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton">Lord Lytton</a> (before 1879) which according to him cared little for the welfare and aspiration of the people of India. Lord Lytton's foreign policy according to him had led to the waste of "millions and millions of Indian money".</p>
<p>In 1879 the Government made their disapproval of his criticism and frankness known and summarily removed him from the Secretariat. <i>The Englishman</i> in an article dated <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">27 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>, commenting on the event stated, "There is no security or safety now for officers in Government employment."</p>
<p>Hume retired from the civil service in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of Calcutta University, calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>. Hume served as its General Secretary until 1908. Along with Sir William Wedderburn (1838-1918) they made it possible for Indians to organize themselves in preparation of self government.</p>
<p>Mary Anne Grindall died in 1890, and their only daughter was the widow of Mr. Ross Scott who was sometime Judicial Commissioner of Oudh. Hume left India in 1894 and settled at The Chalet, 4, Kingswood Road, Upper Norwood in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. He died at the age of eighty-three on July 31st, 1912. His ashes are buried in Brookwood Cemetery.</p>
<p>In 1973, the Indian postal department released a commemorative stamp.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Octavian_Hume_c8d7.html" title="Edit section: Theosophy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theosophy</span></h2>
<p>Hume wanted to become a <i>chela</i> (student) of the Tibetan spiritual gurus. During the few years of his connection with the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theosophical_Society_0cb8.html" title="Theosophical Society">Theosophical Society</a> Hume wrote three articles on <i>Fragments of Occult Truth</i> under the pseudonym "H. X." published in <i>The Theosophist</i>. These were written in response to questions from Mr. Terry, an Australian Theosophist. He also privately printed several Theosophical pamphlets titled <i>Hints on Esoteric Theosophy</i>. The later numbers of the Fragments, in answer to the same enquirer, were written by <a href="../../../a/2E/p/A.P._Sinnett_85df.html" title="A.P. Sinnett">A.P. Sinnett</a> and signed by him, as authorized by Mahatma K. H., <i>A Lay-Chela.</i></p>
<p>A long story, about Hume and his wife appears in A.P. Sinnett's book <i>Occult World</i>, and the synopsis was published in a local paper of India. The story relates how at a dinner party, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Petrovna_Blavatsky_d3a1.html" title="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky">Madame Blavatsky</a> asked Mrs Hume if there was anything she wanted. She replied that there was a brooch, her mother had given her, that had gone out of her possession some time ago. Blavatsky said she would try to recover it through occult means. After some interlude, later that evening, the brooch was found in a garden, where the party was directed by Blavatsky.</p>
<p>Madame Blavatsky was a regular visitor at Hume's Rothney castle at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simla.html" title="Simla">Simla</a> and an account of her visit may be found in <i>Simla, Past and Present</i> by Edward John Buck (who succeeded Mr. Hume in charge of the Agricultural Department). Later, Hume privately expressed grave doubts on certain powers attributed to Madame Blavatsky and due to this, soon fell out of favour with the Theosophists.</p>
<p>Hume lost all interest in theosophy when he got involved with the creation of the Indian National Congress.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Octavian_Hume_c8d7.html" title="Edit section: Contribution to ornithology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contribution to ornithology</span></h2>
<p>From early days, Hume had a special interest in science. Science, he wrote</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>...teaches men to take an interest in things outside and beyond… The gratification of the animal instinct and the sordid and selfish cares of worldly advancement; it teaches a love of truth for its own sake and leads to a purely disinterested exercise of intellectual faculties</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and of natural history he wrote in 1867</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>... alike to young and old, the study of Natural History in all its branches offers, next to religion, the most powerful safeguard against those worldly temptations to which all ages are exposed. There is no department of natural science the faithful study of which does not leave us with juster and loftier views of the greatness, goodness, and wisdom of the Creator, that does not leave us less selfish and less worldly, less spiritually choked up with those devil’s thorns, the love of dissipation, wealth, power, and place, that does not, in a word, leave us wiser, better and more useful to our fellow-men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During his career in Etawah, he built a personal collection of bird specimens, however it was destroyed during the 1857 mutiny. Subsequently he started afresh with a systematic plan to survey and document the birds of the Indian Subcontinent and in the process he accumulated the largest collection of Asiatic birds in the world, which he housed in a museum and library at his home in Rothney Castle on Jakko Hill, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simla.html" title="Simla">Simla</a>. Rothney castle originally belonged to P. Mitchell, C.I.E and after Hume bought it, he tried to convert the house into a veritable palace, which he expected would be bought by the Government as a Viceregal residence in view of the fact that the Governor-General then occupied ‘Peterhoff’, which was too small for Viceregal entertainments. Hume spent over two hundred thousand pounds on the grounds and buildings. He added enormous reception rooms suitable for large dinner parties and balls, as well as a magnificent conservatory and spacious hall with walls displaying his superb collection of Indian horns. He hired a European gardener, and made the grounds and conservatory a perpetual horticultural exhibition, to which he courteously admitted all visitors.</p>
<p>Rothney Castle could only be reached by a troublesome climb, and was never purchased by the British Government and he himself did not use the larger rooms except for one that he converted into a museum for his wonderful collection of birds, and for occasional dances.</p>
<p>He made many expeditions to collect birds both on health leaves and as and where his work took him. He was Collector and Magistrate of Etawah from 1856 to 1867 during which time he studied the birds of that area. He later became Commissioner of Inland Customs which made him responsible for the control of 2500 miles of coast from near Peshawar in the northwest to Cuttack on the Bay of Bengal. He travelled on horseback and camel in areas of Rajasthan and negotiated treaties with various local maharajas to control the export of natural resources such as salt. During these travels he made a number of notes on various bird species</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>The nests are placed indifferently on all kinds of trees (I have notes of finding them on mango, plum, orange, tamarind, toon, etc.), never at any great elevation from the ground, and usually in small trees, be the kind chosen what it may. Sometimes a high hedgerow, such as our great <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Hedge_of_India_9018.html" title="Great Hedge of India">Customs hedge</a>, is chosen, and occasionally a solitary caper or stunted acacia-bush.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>His expedition to the Indus area was one of the largest and it started in late November 1871 and continued until the end of February 1872. In March 1873, he visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. In 1875 he visited the Laccadive Islands. And in 1881 he made his last ornithological expedition to Manipur. This was made on special leave following his demotion from the Central Government to a junior position on the Board of Revenue of the North Western Provinces.</p>
<p>He used this vast bird collection to produce a massive publication on all the birds of India. Unfortunately this work was lost in 1885 when all Hume's manuscripts were sold by a servant as waste paper. Hume's interest in ornithology reduced due to this theft as well as a landslip caused by heavy rains in Simla which damaged his personal museum and specimens. He wrote to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> wishing to donate his collection on certain conditions. One of the conditions was that the collection was to be examined by Dr. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bowdler_Sharpe_28d6.html" title="Richard Bowdler Sharpe">R. Bowdler Sharpe</a> and personally packed by him, apart from raising Dr. Sharpe's rank and salary due to the additional burden on his work caused by his collection. The British Museum was unable to heed to his conditions. It was only after the destruction of nearly 20000 specimens, that alarm bells were raised by Dr. Sharpe and the Museum authorities let him visit India to supervise the transfer of the specimens to the British Museum.</p>
<p>Sharpe provides the following account of Hume's impressive private ornithological museum:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>I arrived at Rothney Castle about 10 am on the 19th of May, and was warmly welcomed by Mr Hume, who lives in a most picturesque situation high up on Jakko…From my bedroom window, I had a fine view of the snowy range. Although somewhat tired by my jolt in the Tonga from Solun, I gladly accompanied Mr. Hume at once into the museum…I had heard so much from my friends, who knew the collection intimately,…that I was not so much surprised when at last I stood in the celebrated museum and gazed at the dozens upon dozens of tin cases which filled the room. Before the landslip occurred, which carried away one end of the museum, It must have been an admirably arranged building, quite three times as large as our meeting-room at the Zoological Society, and…much more lofty. Throughout this large room went three rows of table cases with glass tops, in which were arranged a series of the birds of India sufficient for the identification of each species, while underneath these table- cases where enormous cabinets made of tin, with trays inside, containing species of birds in the table cases above. All of the rooms were racks reaching up to the ceiling, and containing immense cases full of birds… On the western side of the museum was the library, reached by a descent of three steps, a cheerful room, furnished with large tables, and containing besides the egg-cabinets, a well-chosen set of working-volumes. One ceases to wonder at the amount of work its owner got through when the excellent plan of his museum is considered. In a few minutes an immense series of specimens could be spread out on the tables, while all the books were at hand for immediate reference…After explaining to me the contents of the museum, we went below into the basement, which consisted of eight great rooms, six of them full, from floor to ceiling, of cases of birds, while at the back of the house two large verandahs were piled high with cases full of large birds, such as Pelicans, Cranes, Vultures, &amp;c. An inspection of a great cabinet containing a further series of about 5000 eggs completed our survey. Mr. Hume gave me the keys of the museum, and I was free to commence my task at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharpe also noted</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Mr. Hume was a naturalist of no ordinary calibre, and this great collection will remain a monument of his genius and energy of its founder long after he who formed it has passed away...Such a private collection as Mr. Hume's is not likely to be formed again; for it is doubtful if such a combination of genius for organisation with energy for the completion of so great a scheme, and the scientific knowledge requisite for its proper development will again be combined in a single individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hume collection as it went to the British museum in 1874 consisted of 82,000 specimens of which 75,577 were finally placed in the Museum. A breakup of that collection is as follows (old names retained).</p>

<p>An additional species, the Large-billed Reed-Warbler <i><a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrocephalus_orinus.html" title="Acrocephalus orinus">Acrocephalus orinus</a></i> was known from just one specimen collected by him in 1869.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The status of the species was contested for long and DNA comparisons with similar species in 2002 suggested that it was a valid species.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> It was only in 2006 that the species was seen again in Thailand.</p>
<p>Hume made several expeditions solely to study ornithology and in March 1873 he made one to the Andaman, Nicobar and other islands in the Bay of Bengal along with geologists Dr. <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Stoliczka_0747.html" title="Ferdinand Stoliczka">Ferdinand Stoliczka</a> and Dr. Dougall of the Geological Survey of India and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wood-Mason_779c.html" title="James Wood-Mason">James Wood-Mason</a> of the Indian Museum in Calcutta.</p>
<p>Hume employed William R. Davidson as a curator of his personal bird collection and also sent him out on collection trips to various parts of India, when he was held up with official responsibilities.</p>

<p>Hume started the quarterly journal <i>Stray Feathers - A journal of ornithology for India and dependencies</i> in 1872. He used the journal to publish descriptions of his new discoveries, such as Hume's Owl, Hume's Wheatear and Hume's Whitethroat. He wrote extensively on his own observation as well as critical reviews of all the ornithological works of the time and earned himself the nickname of <i>Pope of Indian ornithology</i>.</p>

<p>Hume built up a network of ornithologists reporting from various parts of India. A list based on the correspondents mentioned in Stray Feathers and in his Game Birds is as follows. This is probably only a small fraction of the subscribers of Stray Feathers.</p>

<p>This work was co-authored by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Henry_Tilson_Marshall_d99b.html" title="Charles Henry Tilson Marshall">C. H. T. Marshall</a>. The three volume work on the game birds was made using contributions and notes from a network of 200 or more correspondents. Hume delegated the task of getting the plates made to Marshall. The chromolithographs of the birds were drawn by W. Foster, E. Neale, M. Herbert, Stanley Wilson and others and the plates were produced by F. Waller in London. Hume had sent specific notes on colours of soft parts and instructions to the artists. He was unsatisfied with many of the plates and included additional notes on the plates in the book.</p>
<p>In the preface Hume wrote</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>In the second place, we have had great disappointment in artists. Some have proved careless, some have subordinated accuracy of delineation to pictorial effect, and though we have, at some loss, rejected many, we have yet been compelled to retain some plates which are far from satisfactory to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while his co-author Marshall, wrote</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>I have performed my portion of the work to the very best of my abilities, and yet personally felt almost as if I were sailing under false colors in appearing before the world as one of the authors of this book; but I allow my name to appear as such, partly because Mr. Hume strongly wishes it, partly because I do believe that as Mr. Hume says this work, which has been for years called for, would never have appeared had I not proceeded to England, and arranged for the preparation of the plates, and partly because with the explanation thus afforded no one can justly misconstrue my action.</p>

<p>This was another major work by Hume and in it he covered descriptions of the nests, eggs and the breeding seasons of most Indian bird species. It makes use of notes from contributors to his journals as well as other correspondents and works of the time.</p>
<p>A second edition of this book was made in 1889 which was edited by Eugene Oates. This was published when he had himself given up all interest in ornithology. An event precipitated by the loss of his manuscripts through the actions of a servant. He wrote in the preface:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>I have long regretted my inability to issue a revised edition of 'Nests and Eggs'. For many years after the first Rough Draft appeared, I went on laboriously accumulating materials for a re-issue, but subsequently circumstances prevented my undertaking the work. Now, fortunately, my friend Mr. Eugene Oates has taken the matter up, and much as I may personally regret having to hand over to another a task, the performance of which I should so much have enjoyed, it is some consolation to feel that the readers, at any rate, of this work will have no cause for regret, but rather of rejoicing that the work has passed into younger and stronger hands. One thing seems necessary to explain. The present Edition does not include quite all the materials I had accumulated for this work. Many years ago, during my absence from Simla, a servant broke into my museum and stole thence several cwts. of manuscript, which he sold as waste paper. This manuscript included more or less complete life-histories of some 700 species of birds, and also a certain number of detailed accounts of nidification. All small notes on slips of paper were left, but almost every article written on full-sized foolscap sheets was abstracted. It was not for many months that the theft was discovered, and then very little of the MSS. could be recovered.</p>
<p style="line-height:1em;text-align:left;padding-left:2em;"><small>—<cite style="font-style:normal;">Rothney Castle, Simla, October 19th, 1889</cite></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eugene Oates wrote his own editorial note</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Mr. Hume has sufficiently explained the circumstances under which this edition of his popular work has been brought about. I have merely to add that, as I was engaged on a work on the Birds of India, I thought it would be easier for me than for anyone else to assist Mr. Hume. I was also in England, and knew that my labour would be very much lightened by passing the work through the press in this country. Another reason, perhaps the most important, was the fear that, as Mr. Hume had given up entirely and absolutely the study of birds, the valuable material he had taken such pains to accumulate for this edition might be irretrievably lost or further injured by lapse of time unless early steps were taken to utilize it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This nearly marked the end of Hume's interest in ornithology. Hume's last piece of ornithological writing was done in 1891 as part of an <i>Introduction to the Scientific Results of the Second Yarkand Mission</i> an official publication on the contributions of Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka, who died during the return journey on this mission. Stoliczka in a dying request had asked that Hume should edit the volume on the ornithological results.</p>

<p>Shortly after Hume's return to London he took up an interest in <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">botany</a>, and founded and endowed the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_London_Botanical_Institute_5068.html" title="South London Botanical Institute">South London Botanical Institute</a> which continues to promote the study of plants to the present day. It was intended as a sort of local alternative to Kew. The SLBI has a herbarium containing approximately 100,000 specimens mostly of flowering plants from the British Isles and Europe including many collected by Hume. The collection has been augmented by the addition of other herbaria over the years, and has significant collections of <i>Rubus</i> (bramble) species and of the Shetland flora, the latter including a major gift from the late Richard Palmer, joint author of the standard work on Shetland plants. Other resources include a very good library originally containing Hume's own books. There are classroom facilities, a small botanical garden, and an ongoing programme of talks and courses. In the years leading up to the establishment of the Institute, Hume built up links with many of the leading botanists of his day. He worked with F. H. Davey and in the <i>Flora of Cornwall</i> (1909), Davey thanks Hume as his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for helping in the compilation of that Flora, publication of which was financed by him.</p>
