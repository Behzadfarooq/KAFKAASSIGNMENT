<p>The All-Ohio Youth Choir was founded in 1963 by Glenville D. Thomas. He created the group after directing the Greater Zanesville Youth Choir from 1959-1962 and using that group as a basis for the first All-Ohio Youth Choir, which performed for the first time at the 1963 Ohio State Fair. This gave high school vocalists the opportunity to share a musical experience that rivals that of the All-Ohio State Fair Band.</p>

<p>Assembling for the first time, the All-Ohio Youth Choir performed at their first Ohio State Fair. Performing without audio assistance, the choir through the formulative year of the 60's was comprised of 325 voices from all 88 counties of the Great State of Ohio.</p>

<p>Following the success of 1963, the Choir is formed again in 1964 with some returnees from the 1963 Choir. The '64 choir recorded a total of two records; one in a private recording session while at the fair and one just before leaving on the first All-Ohio Youth Choir European Tour. This tour was the group that revived the call to entertaining people by recoining the phrase the "Red Coats Are Coming" After this group's success, the European Community looked forward to annual visits from Ohio's talented teenagers.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1965, 122 members of the 64 choir embarked on its first European tour after a day of performances at the New York World's Fair. Performing to packed houses in both the British Isles and on the continent, the groundwork was set for European tours in years to come with the proceeds from the concerts going to the benefit of cancer research. This was the first time that the choir was called "Ohio's Singing Ambassadors of Goodwill" by then Governor James A Rhodes, who championed the choir through all four of his terms as governor and was one of the choir's biggest fans.</p>

<p>The following is the contents of the very first letter sent to alumni members:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alliance,Oh<br />
March 17, 1967<br />
Dear All-Ohio Youth Choir Members:<br />
This letter is to acquaint you with a new organization....<br />
THE ALL-OHIO YOUTH CHOIR ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.<br />
It is open to all members who have sung in the All-Ohio Youth Choir.<br />
If enough interest is shown in the organization, you will be hearing from us concerning the activities of the Choirs, and interesting bits of news about past members. At present, Mr. Thomas plans two publications a year.<br />
It will be up to you to keep the mailing addresses correct, so please fill out the enclosed card and return to the SECRETARY, with a lone dollar, check or money order. This is a non-profit organization, but we need a few supplies to get started.<br />
The 1967 European Tour Choir sang at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago Dec. 2, 1966 for the International Fair Managers Association. One thousand Fair Managers from all over the world were in attendance, and this program brought an invitation to sing in York, England during the tour next summer.<br />
Mr. E.J. Keirns, Manager of the Ohio Expositions Commission, received a citation in Chicago for having the largest and best Junior Fair in the world. He requested the appearance of our Ohio Youth Choir to demonstrate one of the reasons why he was given the award.<br />
On Friday, Jan. 13, 1967 we presented a short concert for the Ohio State Fair Manager Association at Columbus Sheraton Ball Room. We were happy to see some of our past members there.<br />
The 1967 European Tour Choir is working very hard at rehearsal, in preparation for the take-off on July 11th... to England, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and Portugal. We have been immensely proud of each of you during the State Fairs and the European Tours. Mr. Thomas and I look forward to seeing you again in Columbus or at one of the concerts. At this writing, we have a concert scheduled for Solon on April 29 and for Marion on April 30. If we have missed anyone, please let us know about them, and we will send along this information.<br />
Alumni Day at the Fair will always be the Saturday before Labor Day. Save the date now (Sept. 2, 1967) and plan to attend.<br />
This is your Association, we can't do anything without your help, so LET'S GO. Best Wishes from both of us, and keep singing.<br />
Glenville Thomas, Director<br />
Vance O'Donnell, Alumni Secretary<br /></p>

<p>The 1969 European Tour is stranded in Italy by an airline pilots strike. For the next few years the choir flies on private charter jets to eliminate any travel problems.</p>
<p>The 1969 Fair Choir purchase the Reserve Grand Champion Lamb at the Sale of Champions. During their stint at the Fair, they appeared on the then locally broadcast "Phil Donahue Show", which was filmed live on the Fairgrounds. Eddie Arnold joined them on one number. After the close of the Fair, the members were joined by the 1969 European Tour Choir to travel to Wapakoneta, Ohio for the homecoming celebration of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. They taped an hour-long television special for the Christmas season. Once during the year, the Hollywood comedian/actor, Bob Hope, acted as a guest conductor and honorary Choir member for the singing on the "Battle Hymn of the Republic." The 1970 European Tour included Wales, England, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Portugal.</p>

<p>In 1974, the Alumni Association was incorporated and the Choir was invited to perform in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. With the custom-made portable amplification systems for each singer, known as "Voice-Paks", this allowed the choir to become the first known marching choir. This tour included not only marching in the parade, but a performance on the Today pre-parade show, from the rooftop of Tower 1 of the just-opened World Trade Center. Also, as part of that trip, was an appearance on the Tomorrow Show, hosted by Tom Snyder. When leaving the taping of this show at 30 Rockefeller Center, the choir gave an impromptu parade appearance stepping off down Broadway as all of the Thanksgiving eve theater goers were exiting the shows.</p>

<p>Three weeks after the Fair, the 1976 Fair Choir performs a concert at Public Hall in Cleveland.<br /></p>
<p>The Choir Alumni march in the Mid-America Thanksgiving Day Parade in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p>The Alumni perform the Messiah in Mt. Orab, Ohio and Coburn United Methodist Church (Mr. Thomas' Church) in Zanesville.</p>
<p>As a tune-up for their European Tour, the 1976/77 Choir gives concerts at the State Theater in Lima, Ohio, Colonel Crawford High School in North Robinson, Ohio, the Great Lakes Shopping Mall in Mentor, Ohio, and for the Ohio Commission on Aging in Columbus.<br /></p>
<p>The 1976/77 Choir then rehearses for a week at Muskingum College in New Concord and perform two final concerts before departing for Europe, one at West Jefferson High School, in West Jefferson, Ohio and at Brown Chapel on the campus of Muskingum College. In between those two concerts, 1976/77 edition of the Choir marches in the Zane Grey Days Parade in Zanesville, Ohio prior to departing for Europe.<br /></p>
<p>The choir flies out of Port Columbus on private charter jet, at 6 PM, on Monday June 26, 1977 and land at Glasgow, Scotland at 7 AM the following day. After a much needed rest at Edinburgh Univesity, the Choir performed a sold-out concert Edinburgh Playhouse. The following day, the Choir travels to York and after another day of sightseeing the Choir sings to a SRO crowd at the York Town Hall. The next day, the Choir pulled up stakes at York University and spent their first night in a hotel, in Birmingham. The next night the Choir participated in a joint concert with the Norwegian National Youth Orchestra, in the Birmingham Town Hall. From Birmingham, it was on to Mr. Thomas' motherland of Wales.<br /></p>
<p>After three sold out concerts in cradle of choral singing, the 1976/77 headed for London and their triumphant Queen's Silver Jubilee Command Performance at Fairfield Hall in Croydon. After a much needed Independence Day break from performing the trip was made to the coastal resort of Brighton for the final peformance in the British Isle. With this final show, the 1976/77 choir raised 40,000 British Sterling and performed before over 10,000 adoring fans.</p>
<p>Following a rugged crossing of the English Channel, the Choir landed in the Hague and went on to Amsterdam and a performance at a small church outside city in one of the remote villages. Following a day of sightseeing in the Dutch capital, the Choir moved on to Brussels and an impromptu concert (Mr. Thomas was famous for these)in the city square. Next stop, Paris...</p>
<p>Paris and Bastille Day, what a combination. More impromptu concerts, Notre Dame (Jesus I Live to Thee), Arc D'Triumph (Every Valley), the Eiffel Tower during on night's fireworks. From here, on to Switzerland. In Lucerne, we had a beautiful outdoor concert to a small but enthusiastic crowd. After the final night soiree, we get ready for the long plane flight home, which was interupted but an emergency landing in Gander, Newfoundland where we blew a tire on the right landing gear. This was probably the closest a Choir came to an air disaster.<br /></p>
<p>The 1976/77 Choir is the only Choir to record two live albums, one at their Parents Concert at the Fair, the other at a concert after their return from Europe in the Auditorium at Lancaster Methodist Campgrounds.</p>

<p>The Choir begins performing their now famous arrangement of the hymn "How Great Thou Art".<br /></p>
<p>This arrangement was given to the Choir by the country music group the Statler Brothers, after they heard the Choir perform in the Grandstand. This arrangement was never charted and the piano accompanment was written and performed outstandingly for years by the late Dr. David Place.</p>

<p>The Choir returns for their second appearance in the Tournament of Roses parade. This trip includes marching in the daily parade at Disneyland and performing in the pre-parade show for NBC with Lucille Ball. The 1976 Alumni, who marched in parade, performed a concert for the Tournament of Roses committee, also in the audience was 1978 Parade Grand Marshall, former President Gerald R. Ford.<br /></p>
<p>The Choir performed three songs while marching the 7 1/2 mile (they told you it was five)</p>
<ul>
<li>I Believe in Music - Mac Davis</li>
<li>Daybreak - Barry Manilow</li>
<li>Joy to the World - Three Dog Night (who said the Choir couldn't rock)<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>The 1978 Fair Choir is instrumental in an October re-election commercial to help the Choir's biggest cheerleader, James A. Rhodes, get elected to a fourth term, by performing the Battle Hymn of the Republic throughout the commercial.<br /></p>
<p>The 1978 Fair Choir was the first to have an electronic key board. During the fair Mr. Thomas tried out the newest of electric keyboards the YAMAHA electric grand. This was new technology. Mr Thomas asked the choir if they would all chip in to buy this for the choir and before the end of the fair the choir had a new piano purchased by Wendy's. This was the end of the hauling around an organ and two pianos.</p>

<p>The Choir battles the elements as the remnants of Hurricane Fredrick drop over four inches of rain on the Fairgrounds over a five day period and one of the Choir's golf carts is discovered floating down High St.<br />
The Choir actually leaves the Fairgrounds during the Fair to go up High St. and perform at Whetstone Park (aka the Park of Roses) in Clintonville to dedicate the opening of the new gazebo.</p>

<p>For the final time, the Choir Alumni perform the Handel's Messiah at Christmas time, with concerts in Zanesville and Etna.<br /></p>
<p>The 1980 choir performs at Cardington High School on Friday, June 12, 1981 on their annual pre-European tour. The event was hosted by Susanna McClelland, Robin Meyer and Rod Thill. The next night, a category 3 (max. wind speeds 158-206 mph) tornado 0.4 miles away from the Cardington city center killed 4 people and injured 56 people and caused between $5,000,000 and $50,000,000 in damages.<br /></p>
<p>The Choir performs for Ronald Reagan's Campaign stop in Columbus. Mr. and Mrs. Reagan, and Robert Conrad sing Battle Hymn of the Republic nearly getting hit by "THE FLAG".</p>

<p>Rumors abound on Alumni Day that the Choir may possibly tour China. The 1981 Ohio State Fair was lengthened to 17 days (running from August 14th through the 30th), allowing the Choir to give a then-record 117 performances during the Fair. Notices of acceptance were sent out to choir members in Late April/Early May. Letters informed members of cost of participation in the choir. The music, which included 30 vocal numbers, cost $32.82. Uniforms: shirt (one polo type with blue State of Ohio outline with All-Ohio State Fair choir in print) shorts (red coaches shorts), scarf (for girls), tie (for boys), and windbreaker jacket cost $46.04. Check in was from 6 to 8 pm on Tuesday, August 11th.</p>
<p><br />
On the night before opening day, the fair turns into a media frenzy. The choir performs at the Wendy's restaurant under the blue and white canopy. Wendy's has the world's largest salad bar, workers used rakes and shovels to mix the giant salad. The choir performs Wendy's national advertising jingle:</p>
<p>Wendy's... Ain't no reason to go anyplace else. We give you individual attention that's one reason we could mention We give you exactly what you want that's why you go to Wendy's Restaurant.</p>
<p>Wendy's... Ain't no reason to go anyplace else. You get your hamburger hot off the grill That's another reason if you will you get exactly what you want that's why you go to Wendy's Restaurant</p>
<p>Wendy's... Ain't no reason to go anyplace else (Repeat)</p>

Opening Day story from the Friday, August 14th edition of the Columbus Dispatch: James Rhodes stole the show at the 6 a.m. opening Friday of the 1981 Ohio State Fair, billed as the biggest ever in the Buckeye state.<br />
Gov. Rhodes was not the attention getter, however. His 21-month old grandson, James Rhodes Markham, was the star of the proceedings as he entertained dignitaries with his enthusiastic clapping and smiling at the ribbon cutting.<br />
As in recent years, Mrs. Helen Rhodes cut the ribbon while the governor held his grandson, the son of Rhodes' daughter, Sherry, and her husband, William Markham, of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. James Markham then wriggled loose and held up a piece of the red ribbon while the delighted crown applauded.<br />
Cassie Shorer, 10, of Powell, Ohio, was presented with a large stuffed bear as the first official visitor to the fair. She won the honor when her number was picked in a 5 a.m. drawing on the fairgrounds.<br />
Cassie has participated in the drawing for several years. Her niece, Chrissie Weymouth, 2, also of Powell, was the first official visitor to the fair last year.<br />
"I'm kind of nervous," she said several minutes before the presentation. She is the daughter of Paul Shorer.<br />
She and her family were admitted for free.<br />
Fair Manager John Evans announced during the opening program he expects more than 3 million people to attend the fair, which at 17 days is the longest ever for Ohio.<br />
As he was introducing the governor, Evans commented on how he and his wife, Ruth had spent part of their honeymoon on the fairgrounds sleeping with the cattle they were showing.<br />
"I want to say that John Evans is gettin' up in the world," Rhodes joked. "He's sleeping in a trailer now."<br />
Rhodes called the 1981 fair one for the entire family, and introduced the 13 members of his clan at the opening.<br />
As in previous years, the opening ceremony included some peppy selections by the All-Ohio State Fair Band and Choir as the American and the Ohio flags were raised over the sprawling fairgrounds.<br />
A 12-foot tall Uncle Sam on stilts waved another flag. Uncle Sam, actually Geze Gerer, an Akron, Ohio resident formerly from Budapest, Hungary, has livened up the opening for the past four years.<br />
The 52-year old former circus performer, who came to the United States in 1957, said he comes to the fair opening because, "I love to do it."<br />
A crowd of about 50 people waited outside the 11th Ave. OHIO gate to listen to the opening ceremonies. There were complaints from crowd members who hoped to see the actual ribbon cutting, because the ceremony is held inside the gate and dignitaries and press members surrounded the area. "I think we should have been able to at least see it," commented Jackie Meek, of 4033 Riceknbacker Ave., Whitehall. "That's why I got up at 4:30 a.m.<br /></p>
<p>On Sunday, August 30th from 2 to 4 pm the 1981 sang for the last time at the fair for the parents' concert.</p>
<p><br />
Under the Great Seal of Ohio in the State House rotunda on November 19, 1981, approximately 125 other members of the All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir, sang songs of praise and thanksgiving for the Legislative Thanksgiving Prayer Breakfast. The breakfast was attended by over 200 people., including, then Governor James Rhodes, who honored former Governors Frank Lausche and John Bricker.<br /></p>
<p>Following the breakfast, Governor Rhodes and the former governors presented the Choir with a check for $1000 to be used however needed.</p>

Choir carries banner by Ginger S. Rutter, Publicity Director The 1982 All ohio State Fair Youth Choir carried the OYC banner with pride and professionalism on its July/July trip to Wales, Great Britain, Holland, Belgium, France and Switzerland. The 14 concerts in Wales, England, Holland and Switzerland were cheered by large audiences. Teas introduced the 71 members to a variety of different foods-including the famous sausage rolls. Sausage rolls and the choir made the headlines in England - No Sausage Rolls, Please! We're Americans! greeted the choir prior to one English concert. Tours of castles- Cardiff, Castle Coch, Warwick, etc. was one of the many highlights of the trip. For all former European tour members, this year was HOT. Rumor has it that most groups found that a sweater, red jacket and raincoat were not enough to keep warm. This year, such was not the case. The nurse, Karen Smith, found it necessary to take four showers a day because of the heat and accompanist Tom Tompkins found Shower to Shower a lifesaver. Ice cream became a favorite food for everyone. ] Dan Roe was a real fast-talker on the tour. Several times during concerts, he "SOLD" records using his professional auction skills. Audiences were surprised to hear someone who could talk so fast. Women's lib found its way into this year's group as a girl was added to the riser crew. Tammy Stockert did an outstanding job as did all the other members (along them Russ Mayer). Given the choice, most of the choir would have no doubt stayed in Switzerland. The cool weather, beautiful mountains and Nurse Smith's waterfalls were too magnificant to believe. After the three week tour, however, it was home again with memories which will never be forgotten.</p>
