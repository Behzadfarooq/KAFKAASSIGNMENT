<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_C._Thompson_7d4c.html" title="Edit section: Family and childhood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family and childhood</span></h2>
<p>Thompson was born to Allen and Mattie Thompson. His father was an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">attorney</a>, city prosecutor and city judge prior to his death in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. Allen, his brother and mother all had to work to help support the family.</p>
<p>Since owning cattle was prohibited inside the city limits, Mattie moved her family to the country where she could keep a milk cow and chickens to help feed the family. The house she owned, less the farm animals, still stands today and is no longer “in the country” but is located on Fairview Street in Belhaven. His mother worked as head <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutritionist.html" title="Nutritionist">dietician</a> for a college while Allen and his brother performed odd jobs to help out.</p>
<p>When Allen was a teenager he was hired by a local doctor to drive him to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> each summer. The doctor would avoid the oppressive Mississippi heat by spending the summers in Colorado Springs. The trips were long and difficult considering there were no major interstate highways at the time and most of the drive was on two-lane dirt roads. Since the Doctor only paid Allen to drive him there and back it was up to Allen to support himself while in Colorado. Allen was a natural athlete and before long was the tennis and golf teacher at the Broadmore Hotel in Colorado Springs.</p>

<p>Upon graduating from Central High School, Allen enrolled at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Of_Mississippi_67ef.html" title="University Of Mississippi">University Of Mississippi</a>. During his time at "Ole Miss" he remained very active in sports and was the state tennis champion for three consecutive years. His education never suffered and he became an assistant to the Greek Language Professor during his senior year. It was during this time he met the girl who would become his wife, Evana Shelby.</p>

<p>Thompson began his career in politics when he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. He served until he resigned to join the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_military_8c68.html" title="United States military">U.S. Navy</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. He attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was assigned to Naval Intelligence. He was honorably discharged on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">January 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> at which time he returned to Jackson and resumed his law practice.</p>
<p>Soon after his return he was appointed by Governor Bailey to be legislative liaison to the Governor. During this time he became President of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, President of the Exchange Club, State Excise Tax Commissioner, and served on the board of Stewards at Galloway Methodist Church.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_C._Thompson_7d4c.html" title="Edit section: Mayor Of Jackson">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mayor Of Jackson</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> he was elected mayor of the city of Jackson. At the time he took office, the city was on the edge of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>, owing nearly $300,000 to local banks while having only $11,000 cash in the city coffers to pay these debts. Considering the average earnings of a citizen of Jackson was only $25.00 a week, this appeared to be a hurdle the Mayor could not jump but he quickly passed a sales tax to stabilize the city's finances.</p>
<p>The city's infrastructure was also not up to Mayor Thompson's standards so he introduced the “Slum Clearance Program” which required landlords to improve health and safety standards of all rental properties. This met with great resistance since the landlords had to spend money to upgrade the living conditions of rental houses. Over the next few years more than 3,200 substandard homes were rehabilitated and nearly 1,000 others were demolished.</p>
<p>For Allen Thompson, being Mayor was a true labor of love. Mayor Thompson and his wife would ride around the City after supper each night surveying the city. Mrs. Thompson would take notes as the Mayor drove around looking for everything that needed fixing or improving the next day. Not only did he love the city but he also appreciated the city employees who served with him.</p>
<p>The <i>Clarion Ledger</i> quoted David McGowen, a life-long city employee, as saying “Right before Christmas, he [Thompson] would have me go to the bank and get several hundred dollars of money from [the mayor's] own account to give as presents” to city employees as bonuses.</p>
<p>Jackson had never before or since experienced such rapid growth and financial success as it did under Thompson's leadership. The area's population grew from 55,000 to 250,000. The number of public schools went from just 18 to 58, the number of fire stations increased from 6 to 17, and 350 people were added to the police force. The city had but 1 <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> but the mayor built a new modern facility and added 5 branches so people could have more access. He was instrumental in the construction of the Memorial Stadium, the Mississippi Coliseum, the Ross Barnett Reservoir, the Municipal Auditorium, the location of the University Medical center, Interstate I-55 and the development of the Jackson Airport.</p>
<p>During his time as mayor, he was elected twice as President of the 1,000 member American Municipal Association. He was the United States Southern Representative to the International Union of Cities, which was held in Brighton, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> where 350 cities and 30 nations were represented. He was involved with <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Eisenhower_055c.html" title="President Eisenhower">President Eisenhower</a>, his cabinet, and heads of select Federal and State Agencies in developing a national atomic civil defense program.</p>

<p>Mayor Allen Thompson was also known for the famous "Thompson Tank" in which a $15,000 armoured car was purchased during the height of the Civil Rights Movement in 1964. The vehicle was an intimidation ploy against Civil Rights supporters of desegregation and voting rights. <i>Newsweek Magazine</i> published an article describing how the city of Jackson mobilized a police force known as "Allen's Army". The city stengthened its police force and was supplied with gas masks, helmets and shotguns. The Civil Rights Movement and the Freedom Riders were publicly referred to as "practices of racial agitation." The vehicle is still owned and operated by the City of Jackson as a police SWAT vehicle.</p>
<p>Working with Civil Rights leader <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medgar_Evers_60ab.html" title="Medgar Evers">Medgar Evers</a>, Mayor Thompson appointed the first black police officer, Joe Land. Land who was the first black ever appointed to police department in the City of Jackson would be just one of several minority officers appointed by Mayor Thompson.</p>
<p>In 1963, after the city exhausted adequate jail space, buildings on the state fairgounds were transformed into hogwire-enclosed compounds entrapping peaceful protesters who were arrested. One of the Mayor's actions included closing all city swimming pools after the District's Court granted a judgement entitling blacks use of the pools.</p>

<p>After 20 years as mayor of the city of Jackson, Allen Thompson announced his retirement in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. After retiring, he practiced law and farmed until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>
