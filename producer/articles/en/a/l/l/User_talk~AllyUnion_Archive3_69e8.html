<p>Do you know any of the history of Template:Importantstub. There apparently was a TfD that it survived, but there is no copy of the discussion in the archives. I recently looked in on <a href="../../../i/m/p/Category%7EImportant_stub_7dcd.html" title="Category:Important stub">Category:Important stub</a> and found that some newbies had placed the template on some rather dubvious choices, such as <a href="../../../j/a/n/JanSport_befe.html" title="JanSport">JanSport</a> (which probably doesn't even deserve a "needs attention" notice). I can't see the template being of any use at all unless there is a WikiProject or Collaboration of the Week that is going to "own" it, but the most likely choice, <a href="../../../c/s/b/Wikipedia%7ECSB_Collaboration_of_the_Week_6f6d.html" title="Wikipedia:CSB Collaboration of the Week">Wikipedia:CSB Collaboration of the Week</a>, seems to be moribund. This is another stub, like the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Template%7EPub-stub_5d6e.html" title="Template:Pub-stub">Template:pub-stub</a>, that probably should be deleted, but like I suggested before, we should probably gather a whole group of them before we start the TfD process.

It was up for only a week, where the vote was 3-3 and then <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">User:Eloquence</a> deleted everything without anything going into the "official" archives.

<p>As an administrator, before jumping to conclusions I'd suggest you to look into the issue first, even if there is no special policy for this. It my last edit I incorporated the text the anon insisted, namely, the mentioning of "common wormwood". Also, protecting the page without reason is hardly among the policies. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:31, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe the blocking policy requires an attempt to talk to the parties suspected in the edit war first. You cannot go and block pages at first requests of anonymous users. Just imagine how quickly the vandals will get an idea how to disrupt the normal work. There have already been vandal's requests for deletion of normal pages. And unfortunately we had to go thru all normal procedure. Fortunately, for the vfd case the only harm was this vfd notice hanging for a week on a good article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 17:00, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am aware of the 3RR and please note that I kept to it except for once where I miscalculated by 50 minutes (20 Jan). And even in that case, I had kept to 3RR in what I call a day (9:00 AM to 21:00 PM).</p>
<p>Now since the 21, I have made more than three edits a day, but please examine the edits. You'll find that only two a day were reinsertions of the AL/CD b'day factoid. If you ban someone for violating the 3RR, then you do owe it to that person to examine the actual edits. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 00:12, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, if you do choose to remain as mediator, then I'd like to remind you of your responsibilites. You should not take sides, and you should not take for granted that I am wrong. Before taking action, you should read the whole story and review the evidence. For example, do you realize that the factoid was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Charles_Darwin&amp;diff=4716358&amp;oldid=4715348" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Charles_Darwin&amp;diff=4716358&amp;oldid=4715348" rel="nofollow">added by someone else four months before</a>the war started? Do you realize that there is no similar controversy about having the factoid on the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> article? I realize that this is a lot of work. If on the other hand you do want to take sides and go with the opposition, then you should unblock the page and let someone else mediate, otherwise, it's willful abuse of admin privileges.

<p>Thank you for your recent comments on the WP:RFPP regarding the protection of a couple of articles. May I ask you to elaborate on your comment, <i>"Besides, if we did let you edit or continue your edit war, one of you, or both of you will likely be blocked for violation of WP:3RR."</i> Do you feel it is appropriate to protect pages as a preemptive strike against possible future violations? Is there a precedent set for such preemptive protective measures, and if so, can you point me to documentation of such precedents? It just seems a little off to me, regardless of how likely future transgressions might seem based on historical record. -Rob</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is at the administrator's discretion within their own powers to act against or to stop violations. Given acknowledgement from two administrators who have seemed to dealt with both articles, both who have seemed to protected them before, I concur on both of their decision. It seems, regardless, both of you seem to have a habit of returning back to the same pattern anyway. I highly doubt that you would want to be banned from editing because of a 3RR violation, due to an edit war caused on now said protected articles. Of course, we can unprotect the articles, and let you try. There is, of course, no rule against preemptive protective measures, however there are rules which justify what seems to be a continuation of an edit war. My statement, slightly inapproprate, was a jest that if we were to allow you to continue editing on those articles, it would be likely you would be reported for a 3RR violation, and subsequently blocked from editing for a 24 hour period. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 10:40, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you again for your comments both here, and at WP:RFPP. I agree with your assessment that the reverts would continue, even if the 3RR is not specifically violated. User TDC seems unwilling to discuss his vandalism -- he just reverts indefinitely. <s>Your suggestion that a case be made at WP:RFM has merit.</s> Your suggestion that a case be made at WP:RFA as a resolution to this problem must be another jest. -Rob
<dl>
<dd>I did not know whether or not you tried to take your case to WP:RFM. If WP:RFM fails, then you can take it to WP:RFA. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 11:20, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I see now that you were referring to "Request for Arbitration" and not "Request for Adminship." The WP:RFA link you provided links to the Request for Adminship page, so I thought you must be joking. You might wish to fix that. Also, I just noticed that your suggestion of mediation doesn't have as much merit as I first thought. From the WP:RFM page:
<dl>
<dd><i>As mediation seems to be at the crux of this, I'd just like to note that, as a member of the MC and apparently its future Chair (unless someone decides they want the job), we don't have our act together right now and are unlikely to in the next several weeks. While certainly mediation can occur outside of the MC, I think it's fair to say that right now Wikipedia doesn't have a fully functioning formal mediation process, though it certainly should by this time next month. I don't know if that impacts your decision, but thought you'd want to be aware, at least. Jwrosenzweig 22:35, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>With mediation broken, do you have any other suggestions? Your statement, <b>"A request has been made by the anonymous user to unprotect both of these articles, which I find highly inappropriate"</b> is a bit odd. Exactly what is inappropriate about a user requesting that the protections be lifted from articles that were protected without reason or violation? -Rob

<dd>You shouldn't find "established patterns" inappropriate. I have the <i>established pattern</i> of reverting vandalized articles to their previous state, as recommended in the Wikipedia guidelines. It still seems odd to me that you would find the <i>established pattern</i> of following Wiki-guidelines to be inappropriate.

<p>No need to apologize to me. The page-per-day process has been working well in my opinion.

<p>Sure, hope I didn't step on any of your edits (thought you were done). Did you want to delete my "leave a message" <a href="../../../k/l/u/Kludge.html" title="Kludge">kludge</a>, which is sort of replaced by that pseudo-template thingy you added? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 08:59, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm not sure I totally understand how it works. I mean, I do understand what the format is that you want to see in reports, and that looks really good. However, I'm not sure how the pseudo-template works to help people stay in that format. E.g. what's to stop people who get confused from simply editing your sample text, and gumming it it? (Although I suppose someone will quickly put it right, if that happens.) Also, the {{SERVER}}{{localurl:ARTICLE|action=history}} stuff may confuse less advanced users - heck, <b>I</b> don't completely understand how localurl works!</dd>

<p>The bot has a class 'PageLink', which represents Wikipedia pages. The important methods here are get(), which gets the text of the page and put(), which saves a new version. In general, to have the bot edit a single page, you can use code such as the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>thispage = wikipedia.PageLink('en','pagetitle')</dd>
<dd>text = thispage.get()</dd>
<dd>Some piece of Python code to change text to what you want it to be</dd>
<dd>thispage.put(text,"intended edit summary")</dd>

<p>Hello AllyUnion, I'm responding to your comments on the grammar project on my talk page. It looks like a cool idea and I would definitely be interested in some sort of role. It seems you started this project and I'd be happy to help with setting things up so things run more smoothly (and of course help fix grammar!). I'll be somewhat busy till the weekend but leave me a message on my talk page and hopefully we can get things working. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelso_ce03.html" title="User:Telso">Telso</a> 09:43, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
