<h2><span class="mw-headline">Saudi Arabia</span></h2>
<p>"Saudi Arabia denies citizenship not only to Jews and Christians but also to other non-Muslims and they are all not permitted to reside permanently in the country." The problem with this statement is that it is misleading. Saudi Arabia denies citizenship to everyone not originally from a Saudi Arabia, Jewish, Christian, Moslem, Arab, non-Arab. Secondly, the saudiinstitute link doesn't work. Saudi Arabia's discriminatory citizenship laws are comparable to many other countries in the region such as U.A.E. but all over the world. Japan for example. A more NPOV statement about discriminatory citizenship laws all over the world should replace the misleading statement above. "Saudi Arabia's discriminatory practices against women and non-Muslim minorities can also be described as forms of apartheid" Does apartheid include discrimination against women? If that is the case then that should be clearly stated somewhere defining what apartheid is. Discrimination against women is a world-wide problem. I don't think its relevant to this article.

<dd>Thanks for the links. I think "gender apartheid" or "sexual apartheid" should be explained in the article. About Saudi Arabia's discriminatory laws, they also include residency rights. Many non-Arab, non-Moslems live and work in Saudi Arabia. Their permits and their childrens' and spouses' have residency permits so long as they are working in the country. They are denied permanent residency just as Arab, Moslem immigrants are denied it. After the first Gulf war many non-Saudi families with children born and raised in that country were forced to leave when they lost their jobs.<a href="../../../y/o/d/User%7EYodakii_63f2.html" title="User:Yodakii">Yodakii</a> 04:28, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Until recently, the official goverment website stated that Jews were forbidden from entering the country. Now, I suppose, the policy is unoffical. In any event, this seems relevant.<a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41731.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41731.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:15, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time to fix this article</span></h2>
<p>OK. I thoroughly supported removing this stuff from the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> article, but it's just been sitting here gathering dust pretty much ever since. Thanks, Yodakii, for bringing it to my attention. &#160;:-) I've alphabetized the countries mentioned in the article, which, as much as I might dislike it, puts Israel prominently on the top of the list. I also reduced the prominence of the US, since having its own section as opposed to "the rest of the world" seemed like inappropriate emphasis. I would have used H2 style text, but that would have ended up making the individual sections sometimes ridiculously short, so I went with H3 (3 equal signs on each end of the subsection titles, for those who didn't catch the HTML speak there.&#160;:-p)</p>
<p>That said, I've slapped an {{<a href="../../../a/c/c/Template%7EAccuracy_b181.html" title="Template:Accuracy">accuracy</a>}} tag on this article, and probably should have thrown on a {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}} for good measure, but these are my gripes, most of which are actually in the article as HTML comments as well.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Controversially, arguments are sometimes made that the past or present actions of other nations are analogous to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_Apartheid_Era_188d.html" title="History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era">apartheid in South Africa</a>, or constitute apartheid under the definition adopted in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a>.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Where is apartheid defined in international law? Could we get a brief description of it, as well as a citation for this? It would be really helpful for our readers if we could present them with that description so that they can decide for themselves how accurate the allegations people are making of apartheid elsewhere really are.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>Critics of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> argue that its treatment of Palestinians is discriminatory and a form of apartheid, and refer to it as as a <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> and/or an Apartheid state. Israel and its supporters argue that this comparison is ungrounded and unfair. The <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> is often referred to by critics as the "<a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_wall.html" title="Apartheid wall">Apartheid wall</a>".</i>
<dl>
<dd>Who are these critics? Where do they say this? <i>Why</i> do they say this. What reasons do Israel and "its supporters" (which just sounds all wrong, but we can worry about style fixing after we get some facts together) have for saying these allegations are ungrounded? Any ... unfair? Who calls that stupid fence "the Apartheid wall", and why? Any citations to go with this?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>The State of <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>'s Constitution denies <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> citizenship. (note: I keep correcting this and someone keeps putting it back. The Jordanian constitution doesn't define citizenship standards. The Law of Nationality of 1954 granted citizenship to everyone living in certain territories, but with regard to the West Bank, excluded Jews on the basis that they were all granted citizenship in the new Israeli state. There is no other exclusion of Jews from Jordanian nationality law.)</i>
<dl>
<dd>This section has been commented out for far too long. If it's not true, it should be excised from the article, or clarification should be made that the allegation is simply untrue.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yodakii makes a good point here about the inequality of women being "gender apartheid". As nonsensical as that qualification of the term sounds, it <i>should</i> be made clear, as well as why the allegations are made. In this respect, Saudi Arabia is not alone. Afghanistan under the Taliban was even more strict in its oppression of women (although that's not mentioned in this article at all). The thing about non-muslims being not permitted to reside permanently in the country should also be qualified and clarified.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>Some <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque.html" title="Basque">Basques</a> in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> have argued that the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navarre.html" title="Navarre">Navarrese</a> laws that do not grant official status to the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_language.html" title="Basque language">Basque language</a> are a form of apartheid. Supporters of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batasuna.html" title="Batasuna">Batasuna</a> also call its illegalization "apartheid".</i>
<dl>
<dd>Could we possibly get someone to do an article on the Navarrese laws so that the link can be sent there instead of to Navarre, which is just <i>not</i> the right place to be sending it. That's like having <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_7557.html" title="Jim Crow">Jim Crow</a> point to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Could we possibly get a citation for supporters of Batasuna calling its illegalization "apartheid"? I changed "outlaw" to "illegalization" there, since I assume that's what it was supposed to mean... OK... I'm going to just go ahead and change that link. It'll turn it the horrible <span style="color:red">RED</span>, but at least it won't send people to Navarra anymore, and perhaps will induce someone to actually write an article for it.</dd>

<li>The US section is such a mess I felt nauseous reading it. It discusses a not-so-incredibly-pretty part of US history, but it does so in a <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_journalism.html" title="Yellow journalism">yellow journalistic</a> style that just--has to go:<br />

<dd>As far as I'm aware, Jim Crow laws made it so that <i>all</i> illiterates were denied voting rights, were they not? whether or not it was done "systematically" to prevent blacks from voting is a legitimate point, but this bullet makes it sound like there was some sort of LEGAL obstacle specifically denying blacks the right to vote, which was not, AFAIK, the case.

<dd>This seems to be what I was saying earlier...but also contradicts the assertion made above that there was a system in place--lynching is not a system, and from what I understand of those days, was done so willy-nilly that, as a voting deterrent, it would have hardly been effective. As for poll taxes, I'm quite certain that's illegal in the US, and always has been, so if that's the case, a citation would be nice. And no, Louis Farrakhan is not a reliable source. The "selective enforcement of literacy requirements" thing, was a real phenomenon, but a citation would be nice.</dd>

<li><i>In a completely different analogy, based on the newly coined term "genocide" used to describe the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Rights_Congress_07dd.html" title="Civil Rights Congress">Civil Rights Congress</a> (CRC) made a 1951 presentation on <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching_in_the_United_States_0822.html" title="Lynching in the United States">lynching in the United States</a> to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> entitled "We Charge Genocide," which argued that the federal government, by its failure to act to curb the lynchings, was guilty of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> under Article II of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide_2f25.html" title="Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide">UN Genocide Convention</a>.</i>

<dd>OK... What? Why is this in this article? Even with some expansion on this, which would be nice (<i>e.g.</i>, what was the outcome of the presentation?, etc.), this has nothing to do with apartheid so far as I can tell...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes to intro</span></h2>
<p>I have made several changes to the intro to make it more NPOV and remove less important and extranous material. From the first sentence, I removed the phrase "once referred only to", which implies that it is correct to use it to refer to other things now. It is better to say that it "commonly" refers to South African apartheid. The word "only" is unnecessary and most likely inaccurate as well, since "apartheid" was a word in Afrikaans (and possibly Dutch as well?) before it was ever used to refer to racial separation and discrimination. I also removed the second sentence, which refers to the "crime of apartheid." There is no indication in this article (or any other) than any nation has been formally charged with this crime, so it seems to be of secondary importance, and any event it is fully covered in the first section after the intro. I also have removed the third sentence: <i>The term has also come into general use to refer to any policy or practice involving the discriminatory separation of different groups.</i> The statement about "general use" is POV and unverified, and I think, is contrary to the facts. It is not in "general use". It is in use by some people, which is made clear in what remains of the intro. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 18:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">don't merge with "racial segregation"</span></h2>
<p>On the article page it says: "It has been suggested that this article or section be merged with Racial segregation." The problem with this suggestion is that in South Africa, segregation and apartheid refer to two different phenomena marked by different ideologies, policies, and historical contexts. Using the term "apartheid" as synonymous with "segregation" is historically inaccurate and smacks of agenda-pushing, which has no place in an ostensibly objective encyclopedia. <small>(unsigned comment by User:71.0.88.219)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, this statement is uninformed at best, dishonest at worst. The only difference between apartheid and segregation is that the former was official national governmental policy, and an rge tafrikaans word, whereas the latter was done sneakily in order to circumvent official national governmental policy that specifically prohibited it, and is an English word of Latin origin. Both refer to the practice of forceful separation of people based exclusively on the color of their skin (or that of their ancestors). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:28, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems to me this is the "uninformed at best" statement - segregation was in fact the "official national government policy" that preceded apartheid in South Africa and was based on a fundamentally different racial ideology from that which informed the apartheid program. The differences between "segregation" and "apartheid" are well documented in the historical literature on South African political development. <a href="../../../s/m/g/User%7ESmg9y_82eb.html" title="User:Smg9y">Smg9y</a> 18:24, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Israel, which is so often held up as the worst offender of all, for its treatment of...people living outside its borders. The Palestinian Authority, of course, is never mentioned, eventhough their policies have caused the exodus of over half the Christian population in the past 12 years, and they insist that Jews cannot own land (upon penalty of death to anyone who sells land to a Jew, even unwittingly), much less live in the areas they control. Believe it or not, this list is <i>far</i> from complete. The point I'm making with all of this is that there's no way this discussion belongs all in a single article which details the accusations against each individual country. If this article is going to remain, it should remain as a discussion of the fact that the term is used, and then links to the appropriate sections in the "Politics of Foo" articles where such controversy is discussed. These allegations, however, categorically, should <i>not</i> be discussed in this article, since doing so indicates an explicit acceptance of the "correctness" of the accusation by the WP community, which is a violation of both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:57, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

That said, what you're calling "government-enforced segregation" should be discussed in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">Racial segregation</a>. Also, care must be taken to differentiate between allegations of segregation based on the outcome of government policies, and government policies <i>designed to effect racial segregation as a specific outcome</i>. It's possible that merging the information you've added to the article will, upon merging into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html#USA" title="Racial segregation">Racial segregation#USA</a>, unduly unbalance that article, which might require spinning that section off to Racial segregation in the USA, which could be linked to from this article, should we see fit to rewrite it according to my proposal. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 20:44, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would support a vote to move this article to the list of political epithets. When using the word in its original sense, namely to refer to a specific legal system in a specific time and place, it is rightfully capitalized. But when used as an adjective to effectively compare other things, places or people with <i>the</i> Apartheid, it is my understanding that it is de-capitalized or possibly used with an explanatory suffix, typically using "Apartheid-like" (or even "-oid" for those with a word-fetich). The same appears to be true when using other words referring to something named after a specific historical occurrence (compare Fascism and fascism; Boycott and boycott; Holocaust and holocaust; Vandal and vandal; see also [[Talk:Racial segregation|Proposal to merge <i><b>Apartheid outside South Africa</b></i> with <i><b>Racial segregation</b></i>). --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 00:15, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

The article is written mainly from a US perspective and with the mental baggage of someone well aware of recent US history. <i>Apartheid outside South Africa</i> has an article of its own that deals specifically with legislation based on racial discrimination, even though the term "Apartheid" is a historical term used officially only in South Africa and Namibia during the Cold War years. "Apartheid" when applied elsewhere is merely a political epithet; it is not the proper official term in those regimes whose legal and political systems are currently based on racial divisions within their <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">societies</a>. In other words, these countries never refer to such laws as "Apartheid laws"; it is an anacgronistic misnomer used for the effect of drawing parallels and perhaps to draw on the negative connotations of the word "Apartheid" even before the reader has had a chance to reflect for him or herself on the effects of racially discriminatory laws. Therefore, I propose moving the content of the <i><b>Apartheid outside South Africa</b></i> article to the redirect page <i><b>Racial discrimination</b></i>. <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 16:23, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>&lt;moved left&gt;Firstly: What I find facinating here is the difference in standards: look at the other countries and see the sources, and see how many are based on "scholars who are experts on racial segregation ".</p>
<p>Secondly: What is even more interesting is what is left in under "Israel": a ref. to <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Islam_d7b5.html" title="Radio Islam">Radio Islam</a>,(!!!) which is, to put it <i>very</i> diplomatically, not exactly my definition of "scholars who are experts on racial segregation". In short: they are a totally disreputable bunch of loonies. While Desmond Tutu, while one can disagree with him, nobody (or very few) would not respect him. Sooooooo: WP-editors remove critizism of Israel IF it comes from decent people (like Tutu), and leave it in IF it comes from a completely insane &amp; nasty &amp; disreputable source, like <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Islam_d7b5.html" title="Radio Islam">Radio Islam</a>......Hmmm......How <i>very</i> interesting.<br />

<p>Please do find better sources. But it would have to be someone who actively upholds the accusation. Or would you prefer something like "Desmond Tutu once claimed once that situation in the occupied territories is a lot like the situation was under Apartheid. Israel dismissed charges upholding, among other things, that its Arab citizens were given equal rights, but Radio Islam disagrees with that?"</p>
<p>My impression is that the claim that Israel is an Apartheid state is mostly a populist one. I don't think you will find many respectable people actually involved in the conflict repeat it, but if you do, feel free to include it. <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 08:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, yes the segregation article you've redirected to indeed covers more than race. But it can be argued that apartheid can also include separation and discrimination by other factors, such as class or language. Earlier edits of this article have indicated this as well. Those factors aren't listed in the segregation article and therefore I don't think it's an appropriate redirect. SWalter 20:27, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Can be argued" doesn't sound particularly convincing. Apartheid is a term used in a very specific context, i.e. racial segregation in South Africa. Modern politicians occasionally stretch it too far, emptying it of any meaning, and that is why the term is on the List of political epithets.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Global renaming/merger proposal</span></h2>
<p>A meag has been placed here and on "Israeli apartheid," both of which direct to this talk page. So, I would like to make a proposal in response to this tag. In light of the existence of this article, "Israeli apartheid," the apartheid-disambiguation page and the global/gender/sexual apartheid articles (I think that's all of them), here is what I propose: Rename this article to something like "Allegations of apartheid outside South Africa," then merge <b>all</b> of the above-mentioned articles into it. (I realize that in effect this would result in deletion of the "disambiguation" page, but in light of this article it is really duplicative anyway.) This would greatly streamline the whole ridiculous mess that has been created in the last week, and still allow some small, lonely corner of Wikipedia for the allegation of apartheid by Israel -- but clearly labeled as "epithets" in an article about "allegations." <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 03:46, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nonsensical. Global apartheid, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_apartheid.html" title="Gender apartheid">Gender apartheid</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> have little in common except a shared word. Again, this looks like an attempt to "disappear" the phrase Israeli apartheid, a phrase that has more than enough content to merit its own article. Creating a "miscelleneous" catch-all is bad organization and will lead to a bad article. The article survived an AFD, you should have some respect for that rather than trying to circumvent the AFD and kill the article in another way. Homey 05:34, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think there might be some sense in 6SJ7's proposal, although I agree with Homey that perhaps the truly figurative uses of 'apartheid' mightn't fit. But the allegations article (which would have a redirect from 'Israeli apartheid' of course) would need to be well enough sourced, and deal with the issue at hand, rather than be a grab-bag of commentary about segregation in various countries. And finally, and probably unlikely, we'd need to get people (you know who you are) to agree not to immediately try and merge or redirect the new article. --Coroebus 17:35, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In particular, this article redirected to "Segregation" as of Feb 8, and according to Homey there was "a consensus last February to merge this article with racial segregation." If I understand the History page correctly, Homey changed the redirect on May 28 to make this article redirect to "Aparthied (disambiguation)". I cannot find an edit summary or discussion associated with Homey's re-redirect. If a discussion of that change happened on another page, could someone please provide a link to it?

<p>It's not acceptable practice to copy one article in its entirety and post it in another. There is an article on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> thus this article has a "see" notice under Israel. That, too, is typical for articles that cover an international issues or another question in which there exist separate articles.

<dd>Small articles are merged into larger ones all the time. There's no policy against it; on the contrary, it's encouraged in order to provide better context, and avoid stubbiness. It's done with small school articles all the time, which are merged into school district articles. The Israeli apartheid article is bigger, but it also uses a lot of dodgy sources, and it's been worked on a lot more. I'm sure, given time, the other sections will be of similar size. Anyway, there hasn't even been a unilateral merge; the Israeli Apartheid article is still there, not re-directed. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My edits are reasonable and if there is any conculsion that should be concluded here is that the probation need to end.

In a nutshell, I <i>really</i> don't see why any of this needs to exist apart from one brief disambiguation page that lists the pseudoapartheid terms in unwikified bold text, and then wikilinks to the actual more typical, normal and NPOV terms for the phenomena. I <i>really</i>, <i>truly</i> can't see why anything more than that is necessary. I'm a politically active radical-left gay man, for gawd's sake, and even <i>I</i> think describing the LGBT rights struggle as "apartheid" is vastly too far over the top to belong in an encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd>I have no objection to using "epithet" as a disambiguator if disambiguation is necessary and epithet is the most appropriate disambiguation term; the issue in the other situation is the fact that there's <b>nothing to disambiguate it from</b>, not so much the word "epithet" itself. The parenthetical "epithet" is actually <i>less</i> problematic in this case than the existing title, because apartheid <i>only</i> exists outside of South Africa as inappropriate analogies made by people who need to get a grip on reality.

<dd>Homey, you are right, based on what I have seen untill now, it is used very different. However, I come from the user, who hears the term apartheid mentioned in a specific context and decides to go to wikipedia and type it in (without qualifyers). Where do they end up? Currently at the wrong place, get forwarded to the disambig page, which does not explain anything as well, and have to click on again. So, my proposal would be to have a good general page about the term, and it derived usages, because that is what the user expects, not the extensive political manouvering that admins and editors are doing at the moment violating many of the basic policies and guidelines of wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 19:47, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would support a pagemove to simply <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, as it's the simpler and less counter-intuitive title, but I must strongly oppose a pagemove to Apartheid (epithet) (or any variant thereof, like Apartheid (political epithet) or Apartheid (term)), as it flies in the face of Wikipedia policies regarding the use of parentheses in articles. I strongly recommend reading my argument at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Talk%7EIsraeli_apartheid_%28epithet%29_7f7a.html#Original_research" title="Talk:Israeli apartheid (epithet)">Talk:Israeli_apartheid_(epithet)#Original_research</a>, where I explained the numerous problems in such a biased (so why isn't <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual_agenda.html" title="Homosexual agenda">homosexual agenda</a> moved to homosexual agenda (epithet)? etc.) and redundant (if <a href="../../../x/_/_/X.html" title="X">X</a> redirects to X (epithet), we're just being unnecessarily circuitous; simpler is better) page-name. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:58, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Zeq, I think that your objectives to minimise the effect of <i>Israeli apartheid</i> are actually better served by having a single apartheid page, than to continue the current situation. Search engines and various oher websites just repeat the pages, and having a page name under that (in whatever form) is actually the best way to ensure that everybody will find it really easy, without the nessecary context that a apartheid page could provide ny solidly underpinning the original and current usgae of the term. In general, seperate pages increase the visibility of the term, with or without qualifiers. As an illustration, I deleted the redirect Apartthide which as far as I can tell was not a valid spelling, nor a common misspelling. A quick search at google provided many links, all directed to one source, this redirect. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 20:13, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Kim that it is nutty for us *not* to have an article called <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>.

<li>Wikipedia is not "arguing" that apartheid exists outside of South Africa by not redirecting all <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> searches to that page. It is merely noting the fact (which even you explicitly agree upon, even if you consider such uses illegitimate) that the word <i>apartheid</i> is not-uncommonly used in many contexts other than the history of South Africa. As such, a general Wikipedia article on the topic, even if only to <i>explain</i> that the usage is only ever correct with respect to South Africa (which you'd need a reputable cite to support, of course), is relevant and useful.</li>
<li>I see no pressing reason not to simply have a top-level "Apartheid" article for the concept in general (particularly for its applicability in international law, as noted above), which should mention in the very first paragraph something like: "The term <i><b>apartheid</b></i> is most commonly used in reference to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">official policy</a> of political, legal, and economic <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racial discrimination</a> against nonwhites formerly practiced in the Republic of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. However, it has also come into general usage as a term for any policy or practice involving the separation of different groups, especially where <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> is involved."</li>
<li>Just because it's a controversial and potentially inflammatory term doesn't mean we can't have a cogent, neutral article discussing it; we have articles on dozens of terms that are many times more loaded than this. If anything, it's <i>more</i> important to have articles on controversial topics like this, as it's all the more necessary for Wikipedia to provide a neutral, factually-accurate, and well-referenced account of the controversies involved in order to properly inform readers who might otherwise unwittingly step into a minefield of controversy. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:11, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise</span></h2>
<p>Ok, everyone, especially silence seems to have good points.</p>
<p>How about having a subsection within the apartheid article about <i>Allegations of Apartheid outside South Africa.</i> Here is what the opening paragraph would look like:</p>
<p><b>"The term</b> <i>apartheid</i> <b>is most commonly used in reference to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">official policy</a> of political, legal, and economic <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racial discrimination</a> against nonwhites formerly practiced in the Republic of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. However, it has also come into general usage as a term for any policy or practice involving the separation of different groups, especially where <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> is involved." Allegations of apartheid compare the actions of various nations to those of South Africa under apartheid, especially in relation to their treatment of groups who are perceived to be discriminated against. Because there is little international agreement on how to establish standards for what constitutes officially sanctioned apartheid, the use of the term 'apartheid' outside of the South African context is considered by many as purely a political epithet to advance a political agenda against the country or society the allegation is aimed against. This section describes the various uses for the term apartheid throughout the world.</b></p>

Accusations of Apartheid against Brazil can't really be classified as any of the titles used. Israeli has been accused of apartheid on any number of grounds. The artificial categories weren't working. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:53, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"no, this is what was agreed. If you want to move the Apartheid outside South Africa article, then get some agreement"</p>
<p>Where is agreement to merge Israeli apartheid into this article? "if you want to move... then get some agreement", Jayjg.</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say that the main definition of apartheid is the South African variety so I don't think there's much sense in moving this article to <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>.</p>
<p>I propose that it be merged into <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a> which would, as is now the case, be a list of articles on different "types" of apartheid. The sections on Arab countries that refer to gender apartheid can be merged into <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_apartheid.html" title="Gender apartheid">gender apartheid</a>. For sections that have no article to merge to we can create a section in the country article on discrimination (if there isn't one already) and link to that or merge the material to existing articles on racial segregation in the US or the treatment of natives in Canada. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFullsome_prison_44dd.html" title="User:Fullsome prison">fullsome prison</a> 23:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can I point out that you have not taken part in the considerable discussions over the future of this family of articles, while no consensus has been reached it is not appreciated for you to make unilateral decsions as to what is and is not the 'main' article versus a stub. At this stage, with discussions still ongoing, Homey banned, and most editors concentrating on the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> article contents it would be premature to either merge or attempt to declare the version you <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> as pre-eminent --Coroebus 22:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's no need for a debate, I'm just asking not to take unilateral action on such a controversial article. In particular, there is no special rule about adding relevant material, but it is extremely rude (and also untrue) to make declarations about what is, and isn't, the 'real' Israeli apartheid article. I've said this to Jayjg before. Also, I'm looking at slimming down the article over at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> and inviting discussions. Maybe it could be moved if it ended up shorter, <b>with agreement from other editors</b> --Coroebus 07:52, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Jayjg if you "don't own any articles' why're you adding duplicated material when asked not to by most editors of this article?

<dd>I think the "Israel" section is too long in comparison to the rest of the article. It seems to me that the obvious thing to do is keep the Israeli apartheid page a separate one, with a precis of that article here and a link to the Israeli apartheid page as the main entry on this subject. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoclass_aee7.html" title="User:Gatoclass">Gatoclass</a> 23:17, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, in fact on the contrary, I think there is probably scope for enlarging the article on Israeli apartheid - which is another reason why I don't see any point in trying to shoehorn that entire article into this one. A short entry here with a link to the main entry for those who are interested is all that's required here IMO. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoclass_aee7.html" title="User:Gatoclass">Gatoclass</a> 03:40, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, I note that someone has already seen the need to shorten the entry on Israel in this article, since it was clearly unbalancing the text as it was.
