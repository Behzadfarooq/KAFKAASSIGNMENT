<p><i><b>All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku</b></i> (万能文化猫娘 <i>Bannō Bunka Nekomusume</i>) is a six-episode <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> <a href="../../../o/v/a/OVA_586b.html" title="OVA">OVA</a> created in 1992. It spawned a 14-episode anime TV series remake (of the same name) in 1998, as well as a 12-episode second OVA series <i>All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku Dash</i> in that year. They are based on an original short manga by <a href="../../../y/u/z/Yuzo_Takada_6b70.html" title="Yuzo Takada">Yuzo Takada</a>. The series also has a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> adaptation.</p>
<p>In the show, genius inventor Kyusaku Natsume transplants the brain of a cat found by his son Ryunosuke on Christmas Eve, into a schoolgirl android that he created and subsequently stole from his former employer, Mishima Heavy Industries (owned by his estranged wife and Ryunosuke's mother, Akiko Natsume). The result, Nuku Nuku (also known as <a href="../../../a/t/s/Atsuko_Natsume_95be.html" title="Atsuko Natsume">Atsuko Natsume</a>), is a <i>nekomusume</i> (猫娘) or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">cat girl</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Purpose_Cultural_Cat_Girl_Nuku_Nuku_8910.html" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot summary</span></h2>
<p>The plot generally focuses on the custody battle for Kyusaku and the attempts by Akiko and Mishima Heavy Industries to reclaim Nuku Nuku's body. This often involves amusingly larger-than-life battles between Nuku Nuku and military hardware produced by Mishima Heavy Industries. Two episodes also deal with a one sided war between Nuku Nuku and another android name Eimi who suffers from an over the top inferiority complex and envies Nuku's more stable design though Eimi was made -after- her and seeks to transfer her programming into Nuku to ditch her own body that Akiko calls 'a piece of junk.' In spite of Eimi being more emotionally unstable than Nuku both their fights end in a draw.</p>
<p><b>Nuku Nuku TV</b> is not simply a remake, but also a retelling of Nuku Nuku's original story and follows the formulaic 'Monster of the week' pattern seen in anime such as <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a>. New characters are added and Akiko is no longer the CEO of Mishima, but rather the subordinate to the CEO who calls himself Hell Mishima for the majority of the series. Hell Mishima returns in <i>Dash</i> as Mishima Junior (also called Juza Mishima in the booklet which accompanies the third volume of <i>Dash</i>.) In addition, Kyusaku and Akiko are not estranged and she lives with her husband and son and Nuku Nuku. Several elements from this series, including the town in which the series takes place and the odd costume Nuku Nuku sports in the opening vocal montage detailing her origins, is reused in <i>Nuku Nuku Dash</i>.</p>
<p><b>Nuku Nuku Dash</b> is a completely alternate universe, as evidenced by the radical change in the ages and general appearances of most of the characters, though they do tend to retain some of their original look. In <i>Dash</i> Nuku Nuku has matured from a 14-16 year old appearance to a 19 year old and is much curvier than in the original OVAs or <b>Nuku Nuku TV</b>. She also sports green hair and golden eyes and has a form of selective memory loss, which is later explained near the end of the series when her memories are regained. She also becomes 'Super Dynamite Girl' when the need arises, typically fighting some device created by the Mishima Group, which is desperate to recapture her. Kyusaku is not her creator in <b>Dash</b> but rather is a friend of her creator, a man known simply as Professor Higuchi. As a result, Nuku Nuku, despite still using the familiar nickname, is actually named Atsuko Higuchi in this series, and Kyusaku's son Ryunosuke falls head over heels in love with Nuku Nuku, occasionally encountering her super heroic alter ego, but does not learn the truth until the end of the series. The <b>Dash</b> series also introduces two evil catgirl androids, one a near perfect duplicate of Nuku Nuku herself, and the other one possessing silvery-white hair who is officially named Rei Rei according to the DVD inserts for the third volume released by ADV films. Rei Rei's name is never spoken in the series, in fact it is completely avoided in the final episode. Rei Rei, who in the series itself is referred to as MIFX-R2-004, is a slightly less curvy android done in the same style of Nuku Nuku. Nuku Nuku, Rei Rei, and 'MIFX-N2-013' (013 was never given an official name, unlike Rei Rei) have, aside from hair and eye color, identical facial features, right down to the hairstyle, of Atsuko Yosano, whom is referred to as 'original atsuko' in the credits of the final episode. The catgirls are modeled after her because they were designed by Professor Higuchi, whom was in love with Atsuko when he was younger. Yosano is a dead ringer for the original OVA version of Nuku Nuku in terms of appearance, right down to the hair color, and presumably eye color as well, though her eyes are never shown. Rei Rei and Nuku Nuku possess the same near indestructibility which defined the original Nuku Nuku, but they also possesses other powers which set them apart. Nuku Nuku, as Super Dynamite Girl, can throw concussive blasts of heat and electricity which have deadly consequences for anything they hit. Rei Rei, (whom Nuku Nuku refers to as 'big sister' despite being seemingly the exact same age when shown in their original forms as cats), possesses <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinetic.html" title="Psychokinetic">psychokinetic</a> powers, and Nuku Nuku was especially designed with the original purpose of being a weapon of last resort to defeat Rei Rei.</p>
<p>The two characters are essentially polar opposites who often wind up causing the same end result: Destruction. Nuku Nuku, in <b>Dash</b>, is programmed 'to destroy anything which threatens life', while Rei Rei's programming is just the opposite. She was created 'to destroy all life'. Nuku Nuku, as Super Dynamite Girl, often causes havoc in her fights and a good amount of destruction to a general area. Rei Rei however, <i>deliberately</i> causes this destruction in order to fulfill her goals. She battles against the evils of the metric system with a blue dog named 'Roger Dog'; the dog is lactose intolerant. Given that Rei Rei has been sealed in suspended animation for several years, and because she seems to derive pleasure from accomplishing her goal despite seeming to be primarily emotionless during her brief appearance in the series otherwise, it is very possible that she has been rendered insane by her time in stasis.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <i>Dash</i> Nuku Nuku's serial number is MIFX-N2-009, while in the original OVA, her serial number is NK-1124. Although it is unrevealed which serial number is used in <i>Nuku Nuku TV</i>, it can probably be inferred that Nuku Nuku still is considered to have the serial number NK-1124 as the TV series was based on the original OVAs, whereas <i>Dash</i> is an alternate universe with completely different backstories for the characters as well as origins.</li>
<li>At the start of the TV series, Nuku Nuku does a dream sequence. The outfit her dream self wears is an exact replica of Higuchi Atsuko's costume, the only differences being obviously that she has red hair in this series.</li>
<li>In the original Nuku Nuku OVAs, Nuku Nuku's original feline body had stripes and appeared to be an off-white 'blue'/gray color, while the versions in <i>TV</i> and <i>Dash</i> were a solid white. In addition, there seems to be some confusion as to how the <i>Dash</i> version of Nuku Nuku was created. The ADV dub refers to her and Rei Rei's brains being placed in the androids (called androbots in the TV series and <i>Dash</i>), however the subtitles ADV produced referred not to their brains, but rather their entire nervous systems being implanted. Further, Nuku Nuku (and presumably Rei Rei as well) may have a closer basis to the Terminator than to the original Nuku Nuku, who ironically was referred to by Kyouko (whose name became Arisa in <i>Dash</i>) as being part terminator, in that Nuku Nuku's skin is cut in the second episode of <i>Dash</i> and rather than the macro molecule polymer which is in all other androbots, Nuku Nuku actually has blood, which suggests she may actually be partially organic beyond just her brain and/or nervous system being implanted into her androbot body.</li>
<li>The original Nuku Nuku appears to be made of much sturdier composition, almost to the point of being close to indestructible, as she falls from several heights which would be enough to destroy a techno-organic cyborg such as the <i>Dash</i> version of Nuku Nuku is hinted to be. The original Nuku Nuku has sustained blows much heavier than those sustained by the Dash version, and has never bled, so it is uncertain whether or not the original Nuku Nuku has a high polymer liquid under her skin or true blood as the <i>Dash</i> version has.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nuku Nuku was seen blushing in the OVAs and the TV series. It is conceivable that she has blood, as it may also be a function designed into her body by Kyusaku to make her seem more human. Nuku Nuku in the OVAs and TV is much more innocent and naive, and acts much more child/catlike than her green haired <i>Dash</i> incarnation whom acts like a very mature and sometimes demure, young woman.</p>
<p>All three incarnations feature renowned Japanese <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiy%C5%AB.html" title="Seiyū">seiyū</a> <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megumi_Hayashibara_1ae6.html" title="Megumi Hayashibara">Megumi Hayashibara</a> (as Nuku Nuku, Rei Rei, and MIFX-N2-013) and <a href="../../../a/y/a/Aya_Hisakawa_519b.html" title="Aya Hisakawa">Aya Hisakawa</a> (as Mishima Heavy Industries employee Arisa). <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allison_Keith_9f17.html" title="Allison Keith">Allison Keith</a> (credited as "Allison Shipp" in <i>Nuku Nuku TV</i>) portrays the voice(s) of Nuku Nuku, Rei Rei, and MIFX-N2-013 in the dubbed version of <i>Dash</i>, and she also portrays Nuku Nuku in the TV series and the original OVAs so far as the dubs go. Allison Keith is also known for her work as <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misato_Katsuragi_23a5.html" title="Misato Katsuragi">Misato Katsuragi</a> in the <i><a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelion.html" title="Evangelion">Evangelion</a></i> series and as Melissa Mao in <i><a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Metal_Panic_5261.html" title="Full Metal Panic">Full Metal Panic</a></i>.</p>
