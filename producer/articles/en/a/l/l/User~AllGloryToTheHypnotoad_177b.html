	    <p>I have been reading Wikipedia for years. I love Wikipedia. It's a major entertainment medium for me.</p>
<p>As far as my contributions here, I've only ever really fixed punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure. Why? I'd rather read. I'm not one of the "editor class": I'm firmly in the "user class" and intend to stay there. There are guys here who seem to spend entire days researching articles, and I'm thankful to them - but I can never be like that. I have a full-time job, and several other hobbies that are important to me. I wish I could research articles, but it just takes too much time, and I don't think I can do it as well as others. All I've ever contributed any meat to is <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirlian_Camera_%28band%29_8943.html" title="Kirlian Camera (band)">Kirlian Camera</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_Marcel_50d9.html" title="Gabriel Marcel">Gabriel Marcel</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, I felt I had to get involved in an AfD discussion for an article that I considered very important; I saw in that AfD that the opinions of the usernameless were not valued, so I decided to get a username so my opinion would count. Since then, I've gotten involved in a few AfD discussions, because I feel strongly that articles on notable topics should be kept. However, I'm getting disillusioned with that whole process.</p>
<p>Why? I think a lot of people nominate articles for deletion who have no interest in the topic, and I think they nominate for the wrong reasons. There's something like 30 articles a day going to AfD, and that means 10,000 possible deletions a year: I agree that there are many tens of thousands of articles on Wikipedia on completely non-notable topics, which should all be deleted, but what's being nominated doesn't always match what needs to be deleted. Instead it seems, once in a while, that an article is nominated for AfD that is on a completely notable topic, when it just needs major editing.</p>

<p>I think the rules here on Wikipedia nail it down pretty well (except for the "notability for porn stars" area, which I think is a complete joke). But it seems few people care. "Notability is not subjective" - but then someone comes in and says features in Wired and Spin make an entertainer non-notable (or, more likely, he just doesn't read the information).</p>
<p>I personally think the "press" criterion is rubbish. If I were the all-powerful overlord, I wouldn't want to use the press as a criteria - I'm old enough to know that I've forgotten about millions of things that were considered notable by the press 20 years ago.</p>
<p>So, for example, Anna Nicole Smith's child's custody hearing (in 2007) is <b>not notable</b> and shouldn't have an article here. Why? Nobody will care 20 years from now unless her child is a celebrity.</p>
<p>Indie-rock bands are <b>not notable</b> unless they have some talent that will ensure someone will want to read about them 10 years from now. Bands come and go by the hundreds of thousands, and most make their living off of the inherent commodity-fetishism of we hairless apes. <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Bloody_Valentine_92d0.html" title="My Bloody Valentine">My Bloody Valentine</a> was notable because they spawned genres; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Velvet_Underground_3a48.html" title="The Velvet Underground">The Velvet Underground</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pastels_6fe7.html" title="The Pastels">The Pastels</a> for the same reason; but there are hundres of thousands of other groups that will be forgotten 10 years from now. However, many of them get notable press in their short and meaningless lifetimes, mainly because labels usually pay for press (by, for example, buying a back-page colour ad in a national indie-rock magazine).</p>
<p>Basically, nothing is notable when we can be fairly certain that 3 years from now, its greatest achievement will be taking up space in a landfill.</p>
<p>Anything that could conceivably be looked up on Wikipedia by a child in Ghana in the year 2012 is notable.</p>
<p>Anything that's a product of the mass-media capitalist system is <b>not automatically notable</b> unless it's been the subject of discussion in the press. So sorry, but a Simpson's episode is not notable unless it's resulted in something.</p>

<p>An article should be deleted if it's fake. Also, it should be deleted if it <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">was written by a person with a vested interest</a>, unless other people have already begun fixing the POV problems.</p>
<p>Like I said, anything that's going to take up space in a landfill a couple years from now is not notable. Yes, two years from now people may certainly still want to read about Ted Haggard's "gay hookers and meth" scandal, at least for the historical timeline and reactions from others; but anything with a demonstrated shelf-life and no importance outside of the moment should be kept.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="Edit section: What shouldn't be deleted?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What shouldn't be deleted?</span></h2>
<p>There's an area in "Articles for Deletion" with the header <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Before Nominating An AfD</a>. A person can put a clean-up template at the top of the article. Or he can do a merge or redirect - which seems to be the result of an AfD quite a bit. I assume these full-time editors going to AfD like doing editing work, so why not contribute 5 minutes of delete-key work instead?</p>
<p>An article that's badly written should be <b>cleaned up</b> and not <b>deleted</b>. It steams me when people send an article to AfD without bothering to tag, fix punctuation and spelling, delete what they consider to be <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, and so on. You're an editor, not a nominator, right?</p>
<p>When an article has insufficient footnotes and links to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, it shouldn't be deleted if a cursory 5-minute browse on a search engine is sufficient to find proof of the notability. It also shouldn't be deleted for "lack of notability" just because there are no footnotes demonstrating its notability!</p>
<p>When an article is on a notable topic but is still just a stub, it should definitely be kept, so that someone can add to it in the future. There's a real stub-hate going around here with some people - don't be a dick, please! Don't delete it because there's 1 or 2 sentences! You don't like it? Then why not add something to the article?</p>
<p>If you're too lazy to add to it, or you feel you don't have sufficient specialist knowledge to add to it, then please explain to the world why you expect everyone else to do the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<p>On a similar thread, I know that there are all sorts of people posting <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> articles here, and they have to be squished like bugs. However, if the creator is not obviously working in bad faith, please don't tag his article for deletion within a couple hours of the article's creation! Most newbies will do Wikipedia editing very slowly, and most people don't want to spend 3 hours in a row on their computer working on one article when they could be playing <a href="../../../s/i/m/Sims_2.html" title="Sims 2">Sims 2</a>. And most newbies should be expected to be bad at editing Wikipedia articles - I know I am.</p>
<p>You find his facts suspicious? Tag the facts. You don't think he establishes notability? Drop a notability tag on the article. But don't kill it when the guy might still be working on it - doing so, I think, may just drive loads of people away from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As a Wikipedia reader for over a year (back when I was still a nameless dynamic IP, before I got this user account), I've made by far the most contributions while browsing through articles. I have fixed the odd POV problem when it was tagged. I have found the odd stub that I could add paragraphs to. I have found a few articles where my nearly-useless professional specialist knowledge was sufficient to fix huge factual errors that nobody else had caught.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's thousands of other nameless users like that out there, who will gladly add to stubs and check facts and fix POV if only <b>you stop deleting everything that you come across!</b></p>

<p>But, in reality, I'm not the overlord, and there are other rules and established norms here on Wikipedia; so, I just try and follow the interpretations of those rules that seem to be followed by the more professional, good-faith editors here. It steams me, though, that there are nominators (and admins) here who seem to have made up their own rules.</p>
<p>If you're closing an AfD, I'm under the impression you're supposed to provide a <b>rationale</b> for the result you're closing it with. Why just say "The result was <b>delete</b>"? Why not explain why you consider that to be the result? And also, please don't delete when the result is <b>no consensus</b>.</p>
<p>And if you nominate something and you can darn well see a consensus building against your position, why not accept that you may not be the final arbiter of the rules? I've accepted that I'm not the final arbiter of the rules.</p>

<p>Easily. First, Wikipedia is a game. It doesn't make my sun rise in the morning. I knew how to find interesting information on the internet before I ever came here - the only reason I'm here is because it makes it easier, with all the info being in one place.</p>
<p>Second, Wikipedia is human, and humans are smelly hairless pack animals. Internet group dynamics demands that every couple years, a major crisis must erupt here, driving away 95% of the usership. Nothing lasts forever. When that time comes, Wikipedia will go back into the hands of editors who do the heavy lifting. I repeat, I appreciate those people; Wikipedia was around a hell of a long time before it got popular, and I bet the quality of articles was a lot better back then.</p>
<p>Third, I believe in <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyd_Rice_8832.html" title="Boyd Rice">harsh Darwinian principles</a>: not only for humans, but for facts themselves. I don't believe harsh Darwinian principles are <b>good</b>, I just know that they always win in the end. If hairless ape psychology resulted in a Wikipedia that was crap, it would only reaffirm what I know the human race is capable of destroying. On the other hand, if what is best in humans wins out and Wikipedia becomes a brilliant example of man's great accomplishments, I'll be pleasantly surprised. It's easy to pleasantly surprise a pessimist misanthrope, and we actually appreciate being surprised.</p>

<p>I'm only venting here. I'm not raising these issues as an editor at all - only as a reader of Wikipedia. Does Wikipedia serve the nameless readers? Or is it only here to serve the editors? What is the purpose that it serves? I wish more people who nominate AfDs could keep the readers in mind. Obviously, since there's 100MB of Simpsons cruft here, there are people here who seem to care about the readers more than about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability criteria</a>; that's fine. I like having access to 100MB of Simpsons cruft. I just wish it could be more than a popularity contest.</p>
