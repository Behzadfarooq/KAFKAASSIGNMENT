<p>I noticed you had reverted the Article for power-assisted bicycles (PABs) at one point. Was there a reason? The reason I ask is because I believe we should go back to building that page... seperate from electric bicycle and seperate from motorized bicycle.

<p>I rather need some help, and you seem to be one of the most recently active admins I can find, so I was wondering if you could help. User:219.110.42.74 has been recently creating Japanese redirects, and rather a lot of them. I have left a note on their talk page, but I am not overly sure how to handle the situation. I donâ€™t believe they are allowed, since there is already a Japanese WP (at ja.wikipedia.org), but any help enforcing or repairing damage, or even how to handle it would be much appreciated. Many thanks. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13">Ian</a> <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan13_e2ae.html" title="User talk:Ian13">13</a> 11:56, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm glad that you're concerned over citations to sources in Wikipedia. I did, however, cite sources in the new article on Variety Shac. As you can see from the page, I cited the group's website as well as the website of one of the members. If you'd like me to retitle that last sentence "References", I can do that, but I don't see how that will help with a stub.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> 16:13, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with your revert of my edit to a blank page. Incorrect information is worse than no information or a blank page. Pan-African Congress, a series of meetings in the 1900s that took place in London, New York, etc. should not redirect to a South African political party. Whether the page should be deleted or a new page created, reverting to show incorrect information rather than no information decreases accuracy. If I removed a redirect from Republic to Republican and left it blank, would you revert that? --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucent_7a0a.html" title="User:Lucent">Lucent</a> 23:54, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got that from a website that attributed sources to local newspapers. It is also a very common fact around my area of residence that the Super Bowl was lost because of Mecham's action (and all agree that this guy's behavior is not what you consider as dignified). We can certainly debate this further and decide if this is truth of half-truth.

<p>I dont specifically know the reasons why Evan decided to rule against MLKs holiday so I chose my words very carefully. It has been proven that King plagarized his work and had ties to communists. His main advisor was <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Levison_65cc.html" title="Stanley Levison">Stanley Levison</a> and a few others with communist ties. If you read the Martin Luther King page it has a lot of information about it from credible sources such as the NY times, USA Today which acknowledged kings plagarism. Most right wing groups that Evan is affiliated with do not support a King holiday for this very reason so I added the info to establish equilibruim. I dont think it is a matter of racism as the article indicates.</p>

<p>What do you mean? I directed you to MLK's page which says everything i am telling you. Please feel free to read it. In authorship issues you will see that officially 1/3rd of his work was plagarized when a heavy ammount can't be verified to if he was the original writer. The rest of the communist ties are there as well.</p>

<p>[QUOTE]What I am saying is that there does not appear to be any sources to tie Mecham's decision to cancel the MLK holiday to these charges against King. The closest I have found is from the Watkins book were it is claimed that the Arizona voters would have likely accepted such an arguement if it had been made. Without a source to show that King's actions were the reason for Mecham's cancelation, then any claim as to the specific reason is unverifiable and original research. The inclusion that "People question that if King was worthy of the honor..." sufferes from vauge wording that also makes verification difficult. --Allen3 talk 22:27, 12 February 2006 (UTC) [/QUOTE]</p>
<p>Oh ok. Yes I agree that I do not have the proper verification to confirm if the connection to my writing and Mecham is relevant. Given Mechams history I am positive that is why he is against the holiday (Although this is a POV and unsubstantiated) That is why I was sure to chose my words carefully. In general my statement is fairly accurate and is technically correct; smears of racism can be refuted to this argument, although the question is if it is a legitimate reason why Mecham doesnt support the holiday. I couldnt find it so I am hoping if you can offer any type of assistance to find the information or find a suitable alternative to the section. Hopefully we can work this out.</p>

<p>The previous governor, Bruce Babbitt, issued a May 18, 1986 proclamation to designate a State MLK holiday on the same day as the Federal holiday that was already in effect, 9 days after the AZ legislature had defeated the holiday by 1 vote.</p>
<p>Upon taking office 7 months later, Evan Mecham issued a proclamation recinding Babbitt's previous proclamation on the grounds that the AZ Governor had no authority to declare state holidays and that this authority was held exclusively by legislature. This was proclaimed just 8 days prior to what would have been the first MLK celebration in AZ. If this, 'authority to recind but no authority to proclaim' thing doesn't sound ironic enough for you, stay tuned. In a move that many perceived as rubbing salt in the wound, Mecham later proclaimed (it seems that he completely changed his mind about that authority thing) that the previous Sunday would be MLK day in AZ - thus declaring MLK a non-holiday at best.</p>
<p>State holidays only affect State workers. Business and industry traditionally tie their holiday schedule policy to Federal holidays, religious holidays, or none at all.</p>
<p>Mecham was impeached for his crimes a few months later, saving him the embarassment of the recall election that was being driven by an outcry from voters based rather on his stupidity. A huge, undeclared campaign contribution, a rather questionable State loan to Mecham Pontiac, and interfering with the investigation of a death threat against a State employee investigating such things, made enough of a case. He denies that racism played any part in his decisions on MLK. You should form your own opinion from his more famous quotes during his brief, one-year term:</p>
<p>"I'm not against the blacks, and a lot of the good blacks will attest to that."</p>
<p>"I'm not a racist...I employ them [blacks] because they are the best people who applied for the cotton-picking job."</p>
<p>"As I was a boy growing up, blacks themselves referred to their children as pickaninnies."</p>
<p>"Well, the N.B.A., I guess they forget how many white people they get coming to watch them play." [Commenting in a Salt Lake City TV interview about the N.B.A. canceling a convention in Phoenix.]</p>
<p>MLK may have been an asshole, but if ever there was a contender for 1st prize in that...</p>

<p>Yes, if it was a local band or something, it would make sense to not have a page for it.

<p>Hi, I see you just speedied the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Brunn_36c8.html" title="Francis Brunn">Francis Brunn</a> article. I was looking at it when you speedied it, thinking it should be tagged as {{db-bio}} but on Googling, I found <a href="http://members.cox.net/~icanjuggle/df_website_2006_019.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.cox.net/~icanjuggle/df_website_2006_019.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.juggling.org/fame/fbrunn/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.juggling.org/fame/fbrunn/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001017.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001017.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> amongst many others. So I was just adding expand, wikify and stub tags when you removed it. Given this seems like a notable person, could you undelete the article? I'd be happy to contribute a little to get it into more acceptable shape. By the way, I didn't create the article, just happend upon it while looking through new pages.

<dd>Thanks for the undelete, much apprecited. I almost tagged this one for speedy myself, so I completely understand how that happened - especially given April Fool's day. I've added a little detail to the article and have added it to my watchlist. I hadn't heard of Francis Brunn 15 minutes ago, but I'm glad he's got at least some meagre coverage in Wikipedia now. Hopefully this can be expanded into something really good over time.

<p>This peer review has hardly started and yet you are calling it old, what is it to you that you clutter up our screens with trivials and waste everybodys time?

<p>Hi, Sorry if the above is a bit curt, problem is I can't reconcile most of the comments, which seem to be hidden away in any case, one with another or with the article. We all know its a poor article and a few folk are trying to improve it. But I fail to see how what has been written by only two folk in this review will help, if only because few people will see it. Why is it not repeated on the talk page? That would be very sensible. Don't understand by the way how you fit into the excercise.</p>
<p>Some guy whose main interest appears to be football, thinks only really famous folk like Stan Matthews are worth a mention. But much effort seems to have gone into that list. Perhaps it needs pruning, but it is updated frequently and probably meets a real need. Most entries have good wikilinks. I certainly would not want it removed even if it fails to meet some arbitary criterion. The other person wants other things in alphabetical order but does not say why?</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I would like to discuss the deletion and protection of the Move.com. I want to make an honest attempt at creating a Wiki-worthy page for Move.com and would like to discuss how I can go about creating an appropriate page. I do not want to clutter Wikipedia with junk, but rather create a page consumers can reference when trying to find further information about Move.com. Please advise.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello, I am a member of a research group at <a href="http://www.parc.com" class="external text" title="http://www.parc.com" rel="nofollow">Palo Alto Research Center</a> (formerly known as Xerox PARC) studying how conflicts occur and resolve on Wikipedia. Due to your experience in conflict identification and resolution on Wikipedia as an administrator weâ€™re extremely interested in your insights on this topic. We have a survey at <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=201962477432" class="external free" title="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=201962477432" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=201962477432</a> which we are inviting a few selected Wikipedians to participate in, and we would be extremely appreciative if you would take the time to complete it. As a token of our gratitude, we would like to present you with a PARC research star upon completion. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hi, would you like to give your opinion on the FA steps at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_New_steps_to_FA_714b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates/New steps to FA">Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates/New_steps_to_FA</a> (specifically the Infobox section)? This came out of a couple of discussions on the FA talk page (<a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_f596.html#FAC_culture" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates#FAC_culture</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_f596.html#Rough_revised_steps" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates#Rough revised steps</a>) in which everybody involved agreed that the current steps to FA were too simplistic and it would be a good idea to recommend going for GA status first (if you notice it was listed as optional). I listed the proposal on the PR talk page as well. The other issues have been addressed by the new <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_criteria_6d12.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">Wikipedia:Featured article criteria</a> which have just been put live today. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:38, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
