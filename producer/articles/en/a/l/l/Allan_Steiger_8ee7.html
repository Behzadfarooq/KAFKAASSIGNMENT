<p>Steiger has only ever been a recurring character on Neighbours. When he was first introduced, he was only at the rank at <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senior_Constable_ba5b.html" title="Senior Constable">Senior Constable</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Parker_%28Neighbours%29_bd3e.html" title="Stuart Parker (Neighbours)">Stuart Parker</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_McDonough_42d7.html" title="Blair McDonough">Blair McDonough</a>) decided to join the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_force.html" title="Police force">police force</a>, and Steiger was the instructor for his course. Steiger and Stuart clashed at each other, Steiger thinking that Stuart wasn't taking it seriously enough. He gave Stuart one last chance at it. Stuart was assigned to assist with police security at a football match, being observed by Steiger. After a few more tasks, Stuart gave up and knocked out Steiger, leaving the course. Steiger visited him later, telling him that he has a commitment problem, but has a lot of potential, so if he showed up at training the next day, they could forget about all of the events.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Steiger_8ee7.html" title="Edit section: Self-defence classes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Self-defence classes</span></h3>
<p>Steiger started up some <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-defence.html" title="Self-defence">self-defence</a> classes for the women of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erinsborough.html" title="Erinsborough">Erinsborough</a>, attended by a few of the women of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay_Street_8b19.html" title="Ramsay Street">Ramsay Street</a>; <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyn_Scully_ddc7.html" title="Lyn Scully">Lyn Scully</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Andrewartha_fbbf.html" title="Janet Andrewartha">Janet Andrewartha</a>), <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kinski_8007.html" title="Susan Kinski">Susan Kennedy</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Woodburne_445f.html" title="Jackie Woodburne">Jackie Woodburne</a>) and <a href="../../../l/i/l/Liljana_Bishop_f64e.html" title="Liljana Bishop">Liljana Bishop</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcella_Russo_6439.html" title="Marcella Russo">Marcella Russo</a>). Steiger started to give Lil some attention, and she seemed to enjoy it. Lil soon learned that her husband, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bishop_f9ce.html" title="David Bishop">David</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Harrington_6cd3.html" title="Kevin Harrington">Kevin Harrington</a>), was spying on her. When she caught him, Lil insisted that she was just having fun and wanted to learn a new skill, and therefore David has nothing to worry about. David still grew suspicious, as Lil had planned out a new skimpy outfit. Steiger was impressed with her new outfit, and he thought that Lil was becoming interested in him. Later on, Lil met Steiger outside the pub and he asked her to join him, but added that he knew a secluded spot down the coast where they could be alone together. Lil quickly turned him down, though her daughter, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serena_Bishop_a0af.html" title="Serena Bishop">Serena</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/Lara_Sacher_9218.html" title="Lara Sacher">Lara Sacher</a>), witnessed it and thought wrong. David, himself, hired a young, female <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_trainer.html" title="Personal trainer">personal trainer</a>, Krystal, in the hope that he could get fit and get Lil more attracted to him. Lil saw them together, and, like David, jumped to the wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>Stuart passed his training eventually and became a permanent member of the police force. For that, Steiger was also promoted to <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senior_Sergeant_8598.html" title="Senior Sergeant">Senior Sergeant</a>. One of his first investigations as Senior Sergeant was the Lassiter's fire of 2004, and the discovery of the body of Gus Cleary in the wreck of the pub. Steiger tried to prove that he was murdered by <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyd_Hoyland_0e55.html" title="Boyd Hoyland">Boyd Hoyland</a>, though there was lack of evidence and the case was dropped. Stuart, meanwhile, had problems of his own, as his injuries in the fire blinded him. Stuart didn't want to lose his job, Steiger offered Stuart a desk job, answering calls. Stuart was happy to accept it, and quickly proved his worth when he came up with a plan to catch some criminals with outstanding warrants. Stuart phoned the criminals and told them they had won a jet-ski and they had to go to the community hall (which was being used as a temporary location for the Coffee Shop and Pub) and collect it. This plan was taken from an <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_the_Skeptic_0404.html" title="Lisa the Skeptic">episode</a> of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>.</p>
<p>Over several months, Steiger investigated several crimes involving the Ramsay Street residents, such as <a href="../../../d/y/l/Dylan_Timmins_49d3.html" title="Dylan Timmins">Dylan Timmins</a> releasing the dogs at the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_pound.html" title="Dog pound">pound</a>, and David Bishop being framed by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Robinson_1e45.html" title="Paul Robinson">Paul Robinson</a>. He also helped out Stuart after his <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyesight.html" title="Eyesight">eyesight</a> was restored. Steiger advised Stuart to see the police counsellor, as he was becoming <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoid.html" title="Paranoid">paranoid</a>, suspecting the worse in everyone. It turned out that Stuart had the right to be paranoid, as his own <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engagement.html" title="Engagement">fiancée</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindi_Watts_19b3.html" title="Sindi Watts">Sindi Watts</a>, was suffering from a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_illness.html" title="Mental illness">mental illness</a>. Stuart struggled to cope after Sindi was sent to a mental hospital, and Steiger allowed him some time off.</p>

<p>Later on during the year, there were more crimes, such as the sudden disappearance of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabelle_Hoyland_6059.html" title="Isabelle Hoyland">Izzy Hoyland</a>, and Dylan robbing the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Service_station.html" title="Service station">service station</a>, with <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stingray_Timmins_5d43.html" title="Stingray Timmins">Stingray</a> involved. Stuart went undercover after they were sent to prison, with Roo Hausman also in prison, Dylan's enemy who set the brothers up. They managed to get out, as Dylan got a recording of Roo owning up to the crime. The brothers and Stuart both got out. Steiger also barged into the re-wedding of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Timmins_3c23.html" title="Janelle Timmins">Janelle</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Timmins_53d4.html" title="Kim Timmins">Kim Timmins</a>, with Kim being involved in an illegal <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> pirating business.

<p>Paul Robinson was being targeted by a mysterious stalker who <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours_Plane_Crash_1bce.html" title="Neighbours Plane Crash">planted the bomb in the plane</a>, killing Liljana, David and Serena Bishop, but wanting to kill Paul. Several months later, it was revealed to be <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Robinson_%28Neighbours%29_e10c.html" title="Robert Robinson (Neighbours)">Robert Robinson</a>, one of Paul's twin sons, who was pretending to be his brother <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Robinson_4df9.html" title="Cameron Robinson">Cameron</a>, who was in a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a>. When Robert's plans were finally revealed, Steiger turned to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katya_Kinski_491f.html" title="Katya Kinski">Katya Kinski</a>, the girl Robert had been dating, for answers. Katya was struggling to cope and Robert held his father hostage in an abandoned mine shaft, before disappearing. Paul survived, and, wanting to track his son down, he arranged a fake wedding to ex-wife <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gail_Robinson_4d6e.html" title="Gail Robinson">Gail</a>, Robert's mother, luring Robert to the wedding. Steiger was at the wedding, and Robert showed up, shot Paul (while wearing a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet-proof_vest.html" title="Bullet-proof vest">bullet-proof vest</a>), then was shortly arrested. Robert was then taken away to a secure psychiatric unit.</p>
<p>Cameron, the innocent twin, stayed in Erinsborough with Paul and <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elle_Robinson_14e5.html" title="Elle Robinson">Elle</a>. This was shortly led to a case of mistaken identity, and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Hoyland_7e2f.html" title="Max Hoyland">Max Hoyland</a> ran down Cameron, believing that Robert had escaped from prison, and was trying to kidnap Katya. Steiger investigated it and Max was arrested for <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manslaughter.html" title="Manslaughter">manslaughter</a> when Cameron later died. When Max might of gotten away with it, Elle decided to mess with his mind, making it seem like he was going insane. Max later admitted himself to the psychiatric ward at the hospital. Max later ran way and disappeared on a bus, with Steiger breaking the news to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Hoyland_03b2.html" title="Stephanie Hoyland">Steph</a>.</p>

<p>Heidi, known as Pepper, Steiger's daughter, moved into Ramsay Street in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2006.html" title="October 2006">October 2006</a>. She took Steiger by surprise when she introduced him to her fiancée, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frazer_Yeats_9737.html" title="Frazer Yeats">Frazer Yeats</a>, unaware that their engagement was fake, to get a room at Number 30 to share and pay less rent. Steiger did a police check on Frazer, and the results proved that Frazer Yeats doesn't exist, he left it to his ex-wife, Christine Rodd, to break the news to Pepper. Frazer explained to Pepper that he'd changed his name to get a new identity and get away from his family. Steiger and Christine still weren't convinced that he could be trusted with their daughter, so he took Frazer away on a camping trip, along with <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Griggs_7b24.html" title="Will Griggs">Will Griggs</a>. It was there that the emotional side of Steiger was revealed, revealing that he cried himself asleep every night over his ex-wife Christine.</p>

<p>Steiger led the investigation to the Erinsborough Hospital fire when <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Mangel_8988.html" title="Sky Mangel">Sky Mangel</a> was giving birth to her daughter, <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Mangel_II_ccb8.html" title="Kerry Mangel II">Kerry</a>. It was revealed that <a href="../../../t/e/r/Teresa_Cammeniti_4f28.html" title="Teresa Cammeniti">Teresa Cammeniti</a> started the fire, but when Sky's baby was stolen, it wasn't Teresa who took it. It was either Dylan or Stingray. Stingray couldn't remember what happened, and Dylan was away on a business trip. It was revealed in the end to be Stingray. Dylan, who, instead of going away on the trip, took Kerry from Stingray who was passed out. Elle found Dylan and took Kerry back from Dylan to Sky, though never revealed herself to Sky. Dylan later confessed to Sky that it was him.</p>

After Guy shot Katya after failing to give him $100,000, Steiger led the investigation. She was arrested, but granted bail time. During this time, Guy returned, after having fled after she shocked him with a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defibrillator.html" title="Defibrillator">defibrillator</a>. Guy returned in the 2006 season finale, and held Steph Hoyland, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Hoyland_0f10.html" title="Charlie Hoyland">Charlie Hoyland</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toadfish_Rebecchi_24fc.html" title="Toadfish Rebecchi">Toadie Rebecchi</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/k/Zeke_Kinski_4ecf.html" title="Zeke Kinski">Zeke Kinski</a> and Katya herself hostage. Toadie tackled Guy, setting everyone else free. Toadie then ran out, however Guy shot Toadie from inside. The only way Katya could escape jail time is if she presents evidence from her former criminal partners. She tried to do this, though was beaten up by them. By this, Katya was set free.</p>

<p>Steiger began dating Janelle Timmins, after being convinced by Christine. He was nervous about revealing to his co-workers about his girlfriend, due to the Timmins's criminal record. He took Janelle out on several dates, but let work get in the way. He agreed to take Janelle on a pig hunting trip, when they caught Katya Kinski breaking her bail conditions. They continued to date each other, until Paul Robinson framed Janelle by getting Alec Skinner, a fellow police officer, to plant pirated DVDs in her garage. Steiger let Janelle go, until she jumped to the conclusion that it was Paul, and she punched him. Paul got a restraining order against Janelle. Paul eventually forgave Janelle, though kept the restraining order on her. Steiger and Janelle are still dating each other.</p>
