<p>Brett Lee can't really be counted as an all-rounder. - AA</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we should replace the whole list with one based on objective criteria (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html#Always_include_list_membership_criteria" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS#Always include list membership criteria</a>). I'm just not quite sure what those criteria should be.

How about some criteria in terms of Test averages (batting average &gt; <i>x</i> and bowling average &lt; <i>y</i>; or perhaps (batting average - bowling average) &gt; <i>z</i>)? Does anyone have any suggestions what <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> should be? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 15:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Howabout they have to be a regular bowler, who often bowls 10 overs in an ODI and has scored a test 100. --<small><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamedog_e506.html" title="User:Hamedog">Hamedog</a><sup><a href="../../../h/a/m/User_talk%7EHamedog_f2cf.html" title="User talk:Hamedog">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Hamedog_0231.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Hamedog">@</a></sup></small> 13:42, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A single Test century doesn't seem enough to me. I know <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_Warne_1bd8.html" title="Shane Warne">Warne</a> hasn't done it, but he very nearly did on a couple of occasions.

<dd>Perhaps two? Vettori counts then, and he is actually a great batsmen.
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Vettori is a 'great' batsman by any measure but he is currently rated by the ICC as the 5th best test all-rounder.</dd>

<p>Well, I think that averages are better than a fluky century. Gillespie has 201*, but Pathan has a regular habit of 70s and 80s, and averages 30 with the bat. I removed Lee and Vaas from the list as they average 20 and 15 roughly with the bat. If Vaas is on that list then Gillespie, Kumble, Harbhajan, Agarkar, Boje, Giles, etc would also make it. I also removed Healy as he averaged about 30 and that is about a par for G.Jones and Kamran Akmal, and they don't count. Seems like we want 40+ average now, like Gilchrist, Sangakkara, Dhoni.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 00:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Couldn't Vettori be counted as something as more than a bowling all-rounder seeing as he now bats number 5 in ODIs?--<small><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamedog_e506.html" title="User:Hamedog">Hamedog</a><sub><a href="../../../h/a/m/User_talk%7EHamedog_f2cf.html" title="User talk:Hamedog">Talk</a></sub>|<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Hamedog_0231.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Hamedog">@</a></sup></small> 19:24, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What something more do you have in mind? His strong suit is his bowling so he will always be a bowling all-rounder, just like poor old Ian Botham or Imram Kahn. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 00:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I confess to being a big fan of stats (especially averages) because watching a good performance by someone on a given day doesn't qualify them as anything (viz. Gillespie's Test 201* or Michael Clarke's 6/9). With averages in mind is Justin Kemp a batting all-rounder? His test average batting average is 13 but bowling average under 25. However looking at ODIs his batting record is a lot better (average 32) which perhaps means the classification needs to differentiate ODI all-rounders such as Collingwood and Kemp from all-rounders in both forms such as Kallis and Pollock. Also partially based on statistics and the fact that he's become a regular opening BATSMAN I am changing Shoaib Malik from bowling to batting all-rounder. Additionally, Shane Watson has shown a lot more promise as a batsmen (especially during his occasional stints as opener) than as a bowler. His record backs this up. I'm moving him too. I question Chaminda Vaas' position on the list on the same grounds as someone above. Lee has a similar Test bat average and significantly better ODI average but in the end neither players are all-rounders. They are bowlers who are handy tail-ender batsmen. That's it. Incidentally looking at all-rounder definitions, Dwayne Bravo and Scott Styris in neither form of cricket have their batting average &gt; bowling average. I'm not disputing their all-rounder status though, they just aren't as accomplished as some of the others on the list. <a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScratchdawg_39f8.html" title="User:Scratchdawg">Scratchdawg</a> 07:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure I've come to the right place, but is there any chance of having a table for all-rounders who have scored 3000 runs and taken 300 wickets. To my knowledge there are only 5 players to have achieved this feat - S. Pollock, I. Botham, K. Dev, I. Khan and R. Hadlee. Big Al 1984 11:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>3000/200 is generally considered to be a better balance as 3000/300 basically a list of bowling all-rounders with long careers. Hell even Sobers wouldn't make that list. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 16:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a good point. I just liked the symmetry of 3000/300. Big Al 1984 11:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Warne can be added to that list of 3000/300 players. Also, Paul Collingwood is garbage, he isn't even close to an all rounder. Pottski</p>
<dl>
<dd>Paul Collingwood's ODI and List A form would certainly qualify as an all-rounder. At test level though he can only be considered a batsman. In neither arena though would anyone in their right mind call him garbage. Since when was averaging about 45 with the bat in test cricket "garbage"? --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 14:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>We're not talking about Paul Collingwood as a batsman though, it was in reference to him being on the list as an allrounder. 268 rpw for tests. And seeing that his ODI batting average is lower than his ODI bowling average, that discredits his claim even further. Perhaps calling him a part timer is justifiable, but not an all rounder. - Pottski.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By that reasoning would you discredit Garry Sobers as an all-rounder as his ODI batting average of zero is less than his bowling average of 31? Collingwood is regarding as a batting all-rounder at every source I've ever seen - stating anything else would be OR. As ever figures don't always tell the whole story. Given favourable condition, which he has rarely if ever had in his few tests, he is a very effective bowler. His 6 for 31 vs New Zealand being a prime example - it stands as the best bowling figures by an Englishman in ODI matches. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 16:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I already wrote a lengthy comment above about the merits and categorisations of various players. I wish to add that the LG ICC Player Rankings I find to be a good measure. A batting all-rounder should be ranked higher for his batting than his bowling, the opposite is true for a bowling all-rounder. If a player is present on both lists (top 100 i mean not) then they have some capacity as an all-rounder although it favours bowlers as they bat whereas batsmen do not necessarily bowl.Also there are several retired or unselected players on that list and new players who haven't got onto the list so it isn't flawless but looking at them can give a good guide.<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScratchdawg_39f8.html" title="User:Scratchdawg">Scratchdawg</a> 11:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
