<p>Concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a source for the first sentence in the lead? I'm not sure which applies.</li>
<li>Is there a source for the first paragraph of the body? I see one link to a dictionary, I'm not sure for what purpose.</li>
<li>Does Chesler actually say "Islamic Apartheid," or is it rather "Islamic Gender Apartheid"? Our article here says the former, while her articles I can find say the latter. The link included here does not work.</li>
<li>Is Mahathir a <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7Ereliable_source_d5f5.html" title="WP:reliable source">reliable source</a>? Is there an example of her making the analogy more than once? Our article currently says she "uses 'Muslim Apartheid'..." which seems to suggest a recurring usage. Actually, the source does not quote her even saying this phrase.</li>
<li>Does Colbert King actually use "Saudi Arabian Apartheid" as we say? The cited article does not use that phrase. The title says "Saudi Arabia's Apartheid." The article then only refers to gender apartheid, however. Also, it's well known that columnists generally don't write their own headlines.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, it seems we have a series of nonspecific references here, mostly to types of "gender apartheid." I don't actually see anything to "Islamic" or "Muslim" Apartheid. Do the sources exist? If not, I'm not sure what the basis is for the article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 05:17, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A quote that says "Islamic gender apartheid" fits under the heading of this article, similar to how a quote like "Israeli X apartheid" fits under the Israeli article. I explicitly gave Islamic gender apartheid its own section to distinguish this.</li>
<li>Please remove any sources that you think are misused such as Mahathir. This article is relatively new though, so for claims that you thiunk have a possibility of being cited please add a citation template.</li>
<li>Go ahead and adjust King's quote to say "Saudi Arabia's apartheid" then. By the way, it's original research to assume he didn't "mean" such a headline. Also, note that gender apartheid is part of this article, a certain section as I noted earlier.</li>
<li>This article is one day old. Naturally, many of the references are weak because many are copied from the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of apartheid">Allegations of apartheid</a> article in which this section was weak. <i>However</i>, this phrase and idea is used so much that it definitely deserves an article. The references to Islamic apartheid, both in reference to treatment of different religions, and treatment of women is numerous, and this article has just as much right to exist, therefore, as the Israeli one.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 11:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem here is that none of the sources actually support the lead. First, none of our current sources use the phrase "Islamic apartheid" or "Muslim apartheid." Accordingly, there are also none which state that these terms refer to "gender apartheid." This is the key point in the lead, and the point which you seem to think justifies the article, but it's unsourced. Regarding treatment of non-Muslims we have one source of unclear background who makes a comparison to apartheid, without saying that is what it is. This also does not support the lead.</dd>

<dd>What we seem to have in sources is a few authors referring to "gender apartheid." This is currently discussed in another article <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_apartheid.html#In_Islam" title="Gender apartheid">Gender_apartheid#In_Islam</a>. Perhaps this could be its own article; what's unclear is whether there should be an article on "Allegations of Islamic Apartheid," which is solely based on this claim of gender apartheid. If it is in line with <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_5243.html" title="Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba">Allegations_of_tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba</a>, it would use the "gender apartheid" phrase specifically in the title. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 12:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears you currently have one author using the phrase "Islamic apartheid" in a list, without clarifying what she means. I don't see any sources for "Muslim Apartheid." I also don't see any references for the "Dhimmi" section that use either phrase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unless you're planning to add more, my impression remains that this could be an article on "Islamic Gender Apartheid," or "Saudi Gender Apartheid." Would you support changing the title? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 22:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First off, it's not necessary to find the exact phrase "Islamic apartheid" to use a source for this article, any more than it is necessary to find the exact phrase "Israeli apartheid" for the Israel article. Please stop applying double standards-- if the sources make it clear they're talking about Islam's treatment of dhimmis as apartheid, it fits. There are several more sources I can find if you'll let me do it today.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 12:01, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, please try to focus more on the edits and less on the editor. The question I'm raising is whether this is the right title for the article. If we had a lot of sources talking about "Islamic Apartheid," I would be fine using authors who talked around the term without using it. If all we have is a few people talking around not "Islamic Apartheid," but <i>another</i> term "Gender Apartheid" or "Islamic Gender Apartheid," then my feeling is that this is what the title should say. If you think that's a double standard, please explain.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me what you're trying is to pigeon hole many different things together as if they're the same thing. Personally, I'm not somebody to say whether the policies or conditions in the West Bank are worse than those for women in Saudi Arabia. I do think they're rather vastly different situations. Never mind me, though, the question is what the sources say, and whether this is the right title for the article, which is what I'm getting at. Please consider it as a good faith question, which it is. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 13:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, keep in mind that <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_Apartheid_1f8f.html" title="Allegations of Israeli Apartheid">Allegations of Israeli Apartheid</a> is a very awkward compromise that was reached after a lot of time, based on a very specific situation. I think there's also a problem with extending that title-format all over Wikipedia. The obvious title for this article would be "Gender Apartheid" or "Gender Apartheid in Islamic Countries." Using <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_Apartheid_1f8f.html" title="Allegations of Israeli Apartheid">AoIA</a> as a basis for creating a slew of articles with accusatory titles strikes me as one way to address an awkward situation, just not the best one. I think our luck would be much better improving the AoIA article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 13:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<p>It's completely untrue to say the sources don't regard treatment of muslims as connected to treatment of women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given sharia’s inequality between men and women, Muslims and non-Muslims, it is de facto a religious apartheid system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The connection is made clear in other places as well. It's not original research.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're avoiding the question: What should we name this article? Most of the sources we have are talking about gender apartheid. Why would we not then make that the title? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 22:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because gender apartheid defines a large part of Islamic apartheid, but not all of it.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simply as another sum-up, we currently have 1.) Chesler on "gender apartheid" in Islamic countries. In one instance she makes reference to her commentary on "Islamic Apartheid," but we have no actual commentary from her on anything broader. 2.) Marina Mahathir, not clearly a reliable source, comments on "gender apartheid." 3.) Colbert King refers to gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia. 4.) Ali Al-Ahmed comments on gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia. 5.) Two sources on "Dhimmi" and a comparison to apartheid. I'm not sure we have any discussing this as a single subject. The question might depend on whether the two sources on Dhimmi warrant an article, since those are the ones who speak beyond the topic of "gender apartheid." <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 21:28, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is what some would disparagingly call a "lawyer summary." You've ignored completely the sources I've added that connect the two, so you can split everything up into a false dichotomy.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:26, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
