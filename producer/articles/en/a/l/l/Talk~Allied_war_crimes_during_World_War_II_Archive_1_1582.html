<dd>Hi there. Good point about Katyn, wondered why the link was removed there. The Laconia incident was the start of unrestricted submarine warfare and as far as our article says allied bombers fired in spite of rescuing operations for civilians, so it definitely qualifies for this list. As to Bleiburg, right, had not been sure whether the Yugoslav were allies. There should be something on the rapes and other crimes perpetrated on Germans fleeing to the west when the war ended, but I regard that as a particularly touchy issue. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 18:27, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I deleted the Laconia Incident, since it was not a war crime, but a legitimate attack on an enemy submarine that had not surrendered or in the process of surrendering. You can read about it here: <a href="http://www.uboat.net/articles/index.html?article=33" class="external free" title="http://www.uboat.net/articles/index.html?article=33" rel="nofollow">http://www.uboat.net/articles/index.html?article=33</a> It is also incorrect that the Laconia incident was the start of unrestricted submarine warfare. All it did was bring forth an order on the treatment of survivors from torpedoed ships. Unrestricted submarine warfare started long before.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:45, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also changed the wording of your last category, since neither of the alleged war crimes there was illegal at the time, and therefore it is quite logical that they never went to trial. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:45, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have added a Neutral Point of View and a Clean-up notice to this article, since it seems quite tendencious and often factually incorrect to me. Regards <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 10:29, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some of the acts the Germans were charged on in the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> became crimes retrospectively, right? Therefore, it's not correct to deny that the same kind of acts made by Allies were not crimes. (I also removed a paragraph that looked like vandalism: It contained provocation and was written in very poor English.)</p>
<p><a name="NPOV" id="NPOV"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h2>
<p>I added the NPOV because at the moment the article appears to me to be very much slanted against the Allies. It contains factual inaccuracies, and mixes morally questionable actions (such as the bombing of Dresden) with criminal actions (such as the massacre at Dachau).</p>
<p>It also mixes actions by the Allies during the war with actions by non-Allied nations or formations, e.g. Katyn (which occurred before the Soviet Union became an ally), or the massacres in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>It is also questionable that unrestricted submarine warfare was a warcrime. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 16:52, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article would be considerably more neutral if it were renamed. Something is only a war crime if it is investigated and found to be one. Otherwise they could be called massacres, genocides, human rights violations, alleged war crimes or something else.</p>
<p>Strangely this article does not cover genuine Allied war crimes for which people were tried and convicted, including killing prisoners and plenty of other indeniable offences. Maybe write about those and provode a link to another named article about this stuff. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 15:59, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you want to claim they are crimes, I suggest you do the research in the relevant laws of war, which are all available online, and show under which paragraph of the laws of war as in existence then they could be considered crimes that warrant punishment. The logic that something maybe a crime just because it was not prosecuted does not hold.

<p>I noted you reverted my last edit on the alleged crimes. I have told you it is up to you to provide the evidence, since you make the claim.

<p><br />
I don't see how we can have an article of Allied War Crimes if there is no mention of unrestricted aerial bombardment. If there were no convention protecting civilians, are all the German massacres of civilians not to be considered War Crimes? There should at least be an article called "Alleged Allied War Crimes". Or if this cannot fit the definition of War Crime, could they be called "Crimes against Humanity"?</p>
<p>Also, is this article by Javier Guisandez Gomez definitive? <b>The preceding comment was left by 217.196.239.189 on 12:49, 11 July 2006</b></p>

<p>The use of nuclear weapons itself would not have been a war crime, but rather the manner in which they were used. The criminal element lies not in the nature of the weapon but rather the intended effects. In this case, the destruction of two cities and the wholesale slaughter of their inhabitants. This would still have quallified as a war crime if the weapons employed had been knives. The use of nuclear weapons on purely military targets unfortunately may not quallify as a war crime. --John of Patmos 17:47, 12 September 2006 (AEST)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stopping outside Warsaw 1944</span></h2>
<p>The idea that the Red Army's stop outside Warsaw is a warcrime is extremely far-fetched. First I can not think of a single point in the laws of war that would allow it to be seen as such. Secondly, even if we assume that it was Stalin being nefarious, which may well have been the case, then consideration should be made for the fact that in August 1944 the Red Army had just fought a 500km campaign in two different sectors (Belorussia and western Ukraine/eastern Poland), suffering serious losses of men and materiél in the process. It was preparing another full-scale offensive in Romania. It was defending existing bridgeheads across the Vistula against heavy German counter-attacks, and was in the process to cut through to the Baltic sea in a separate operation. It is entirely believable that it was simply not able to cross the Vistula at Warsaw to get involved in a city fight. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 13:36, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to point out that the Warsaw uprising was inspired by Armiya Kraiowa (pardon the spelling) which was under the control of Polish government in exile. The Soviets saw them as their enemies, which is not suprising considering the Soviet-Polish War (part of Russian Civil War) and the fact that pre-war Poland had many ties with Nazi Germany (for example, Poland took part in the partition of Czekoslovakia) and had an anti-soviet approach. Also, the Soviet Union had their own version of the polish army, Armiya Ludowa. Even if the RKKA was capable of aiding the rebels, doing so would be a major political blunder for Stalin (politics are cynical, but that's how it works). The Soviet Union lost 600 thousand soldiers liberating Poland, and the last thing Stalin would want is to have an unfriendly state right across the border. He was a dictator; he was not a traitor or an idiot.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.198.125.64 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.198.125.64.html" title="User talk:69.198.125.64">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.198.125.64_5240.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.198.125.64">contribs</a>) 07:27, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

For example <a href="http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385497992&amp;view=excerpt" class="external text" title="http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385497992&amp;view=excerpt" rel="nofollow">the extract</a> by William I. Hitchcock:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has at least one distortion and one factual error in it regarding Dresden. "Dresden. This ancient capital of Saxony, once called the Florence of the Elbe for its magnificent baroque architecture, possessed little heavy industry. Following an assault by some eight hundred RAF bombers and 311 American B-17s, the city was swallowed by fire, and over 50,000 people were incinerated". No it did not possess heavy industry but it did possess light industry which in 1944, the German Army High Command's Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops which supplied the army with materiel (Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945. By Frederick Taylor, page 169). The number killed is at the high end of the range given by other respectable historians, who have specialised in the attack. If this was a reliable and reputable source one would expect him to note the Allied bombing assessments and to list the range of figures on the death toll which other respectable historians who have specialised in the raids have come up with.</li>
<li>"Russian soldiers were urged on by their commanders to behave as brutally as possible." If they had there would not have been a German alive east of the Elbe. The Zhukov quote which follows his assertion does not say what he says it says. As Beevor points out in <i>Berlin the downfall</i> on Page 409 "<i>in Berlin the feelings of the civilian population were very mixed. While embittered by the looting and rape, they were also astonished and grateful for the Red Army's major efforts to feed them".</i></li>
<li>"Some women's bodies were found raped, mutilated, and nailed to barn doors." It may have happened, but this sounds like the crucified Canadian soldier story of World War I. (The crucified Canadian has been studied by several historians and the general conclusion is that it can not be positively verified to credible first hand reports (This is not to say that it did not happen, just that the rumours that it did conveniently dovetailed into Allied propaganda whether the incident was true or not). <a href="http://www.mises.org/story/1495" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/story/1495" rel="nofollow">Niall Ferguson: Pity of War</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750939923/202-5066626-0009434" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750939923/202-5066626-0009434" rel="nofollow">James Hayward:Myths and Legends of the First World War</a>). In the same way if one looks at the <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemmersdorf.html" title="Nemmersdorf">Nemmersdorf</a> article it is possible that reports of the atrocity was tainted by Nazi propaganda. Any respectable historian ought to mention this while laying out the known facts <a href="http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv/47aa15.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv/47aa15.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<p>Of the author himself, his biography is available with a review of the book "The Struggle for Europe" from the publisher (Random House) along with some glowing review quotes.<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385497985" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385497985" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>BTW Ultramarine, the Beevor link covers more than just the rape of women in Berlin, and his book "Berlin the downfall" has pages on the atrocities in East of Berlin, before the Battle of Berlin started. But if they are to be used they should be used for specific allegations of war crimes and the book should be referenced with page numbers. It is not good enough or encyclopaedic to say "The Soviets committed war crimes in Eastern Europe" any more than it would be to say "The Germans committed war crimes in Europe" or that the "Western Allies committed war crimes in Western Europe". Specific allegations need to be backed up with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable and reputable sources</a> --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 23:52, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you denying that many German POWs were killed by the Soviets, despite the sources? Are you denying that that many civilians in some ehtnic groups were killed in the Soviet union as a colletive punishment for allegedly helping the Germans, despite the sources? Are you denying that killing POWs and civilians are war crimes?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your argument seems to be that the words "war crime" must be mentioned in the source. That is invalid, killing POW's is a war crime even if not explicitly stated. Also, why are you deleting for example the allied bombings? They should be mentioned since many people consider them war crimes and it should be explained why this is wrong. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 06:11, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>POWs die in captivity, they die of natural causes, of accidents, denial of medical attention, illegal forced labour, starvation, and from murder. That deaths were a result of war crimes has to be explicitly stated in a source, otherwise it is speculation by Wikipedia. I would assume that there are dozens of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable and reputable sources</a> which say that many POWs were killed by the Soviets and that their killings were a war crime. If it is to be included on this page, then reliable and reputable sources should be used to back up the assertion. In the same way if the assertion that war crimes were committed by American soldiers at <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheinwiesenlager.html" title="Rheinwiesenlager">Rheinwiesenlager</a>, then a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable and reputable sources</a> should be used to back up the assertion.</p>
<p>The allied bombings were not war crimes. How do I know that? Two reasons: there were no treaties which bound the antagonists; and no Axis personnel were tried for a such a crime, although Axis personnel were tried for alleged crimes and crimes which the Allies also committed. These were both types those from the customs of law (eg <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Skorzeny_f5d4.html" title="Otto Skorzeny">Skorzeny</a>) and treaty obligations (eg <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_D%C3%B6nitz_2287.html" title="Karl Dönitz">Donitz</a>) in which case they were either found not guilty or did not serve a sentence for it. As bombing was not a crime it does not have to be mentioned on this page. It cuts both ways, one would not expect to see Axis bombings included in a list of Axis war crimes. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:16, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To repeat myself: You and I may think it a war crime, but one needs a source which alledges that it is. See <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. POWs die in captivity, they die of natural causes, of accidents, attempting to escape, legal execution after a trial, denial of medical attention, illegal forced labour, starvation, and from murder, both by their own side and by soldiers overseeing them. That deaths were a result of war crimes has to be explicitly stated in a source, otherwise it is speculation by Wikipedia to draw the conclusion that the deaths were a result of war crimes.</p>
<p>Further the table source you are providing is by Rummel who is not the least contriversial source one could choose. His numbers on domicide is not necessary the same thing as POWs killed as a result of war crimes.</p>
<p>One could include the quote by Javier Guisández Gómez: <i>In examining these events [Anti-city strategy/blitz] in the light of international humanitarian law,...</i> and a see <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_bombardment.html#Aerial_area_bombardment_and_international_law" title="Area bombardment">Aerial area bombardment and international law</a>, but this opens up the article to someone posting a counter POV on a subject over which there is not a legal NPOV, just the echo of <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goebbels.html" title="Goebbels">Goebbels</a>'s Terror Bombing propaganda. I am loath to go down that route because it opens up the article to neo-nazi propaganda and revisionist history. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:17, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ultramarine Do you ever read what I write? Your Telegraph reference is to Beevor's book "Berlin the downfall".

<p>You reference "gendercide" seem to be a blog page. AFAIK the USSR had not signed the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_%281929%29_cadc.html" title="Geneva Convention (1929)">Geneva Convention (1929)</a>, So to make a case that their treatment of POWs was a war crime one is going to have to look at the Japanese treatment of POWs (as they did not sign the treaty either) and see if Axis perpetrators were found guilty of war crimes and if so which ones. That they were war crimes may be covered by the Nuremberg Trial argument that to maltreat prisoners was against the customs of war at that time (see <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/judlawre.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/judlawre.htm" rel="nofollow">Judgment: The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity</a>, which contains a legal expansion of the customary laws of war, to cover states which had not signed the Hague treaty.

<dd>"The Soviets took ferocious revenge on the millions of POWs who fell into their hands during the war. Many were simply executed; most were sent to concentration camps where they died of exposure, starvation, and overwork. German POWs (along with Romanians, Italians, and others) "were [not] treated even remotely in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Thousands froze to death and starved on the march or in unheated cattle trucks, and once in camps they were treated as slave labor. Heat, shelter, and clothing were all inadequate, diseases such as typhus were rampant, and food was so scarce that on occasion cannibalism occurred. In all, at least one million German prisoners died out of the 3,150,000 taken by the Red Army." (S.P. MacKenzie, "The Treatment of Prisoners of War in World War II," The Journal of Modern History, 66: 3 [September 1994], p. 511.)"</dd>

<p>See above, if the Soviets were not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, although they behaved in a very nasty way to their prisoners I do not know if they were war crimes.

<p>Did not die in Soviet POW camps. The number according to Soviet records is ca. 430,000, IIRC. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 08:11, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to an extensive study done under supervision of G.F.Krivosheev (it can be found in print form or online at <a href="http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/" class="external free" title="http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/</a> ) the number of Axis POWs that died in Soviet captivity is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wermaht (including not only Germans, but also austrians and other nationalities, present in small numbers, for example, 23136 french were captured)
<ul>
<li>2 733 739 captured (and reached POW camps)</li>
<li>381 067 died (13.9%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>European allies of Germany (hungarians, romanians, italians, finns):
<ul>
<li>752 467 captured</li>
<li>137 753 died (18.3%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Japanese Army (mostly japanese by nationality)
<ul>
<li>640 105 captured</li>
<li>62 069 died (9.7%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>thus all together:
<ul>
<li>4 126 311 captured</li>
<li>580 889 died (14%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>however, those numbers speak for those who actually made it to the POW camps. 220 thousand captured former Soviet citizens along with 14100 war criminals were sent to NKVD camps. Thus the Axis (excluding Japan) lost about 57 thousand POWs in transit to POW camps - because of disease and frost. Grand total: at least 637889 axis POW's died in Soviet captivity.</p>
<p>In comparison, out of 4559 thousand of Soviet troops that were captured at least 2.5 million died in German captivity.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.198.125.64 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.198.125.64.html" title="User talk:69.198.125.64">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.198.125.64_5240.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.198.125.64">contribs</a>) 07:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>The recent addition of:</p>

<dd><i>It should also be noted that the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention (1929). This may make it doubtful that the treatment of German POWs, more than a million of which were killed, was a war crime.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It certainly a start on this complicated issue. However I think that several other points need to be added if it is to remain in the article. The first is a sourced range of deaths. Second is it German or Axis POWs? Third is that as the Red Cross commentary on <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_%281929%29_cadc.html" title="Geneva Convention (1929)">GC 1929</a> contained at the start of the article says "<i>The Convention does not replace but only completes the provisions of the Hague regulations.</i>" so the <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/judlawre.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/judlawre.htm" rel="nofollow">Judgment: The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity</a>, which contains a legal expansion of the customary laws of war, to cover states which had not signed the Hague treaty becomes important. Hence the need to find a source which discusses Soviet POW treatment against Japanese treatment of their POWs, and some sort of conclusion of Soviet treatment given the crimes the Japanese were found guilty of. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 15:51, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the word "killed" should be replaced by a more accurate "died" since when a POW dies from disease or terrible living conditions, he is not killed. Also, while the condition in which the axis POW's lived in Soviet Union were horrific, those conditions were a product of the war. The Soviet population didn't live very well during that time as well. However, it should be noted, that there were cases when POW's were executed after interogation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.198.125.64 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.198.125.64.html" title="User talk:69.198.125.64">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.198.125.64_5240.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.198.125.64">contribs</a>) 07:15, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>First of all the 'over a million' just appears to be wrong, based on the post above. Secondly, I think it is important to analyse what exactly the crime is here. From my readings dealing with captivity, it appears that while certainly no picknick, Soviet POW camps were not destruction camps, as some people seem to imagine. A certain range of mortality is to be expected over the course of five-ten years, which covers the time many POWs were held after 1945. Additional to that one has to remember that many axis POWs who were taken during the war (e.g. at Stalingrad) were already in a very bad physical condition due to hunger, disease, and in many cases wounds or exposure. This would significantly reduce their chances to survive the wartime conditions of Soviet POW camps. But it does not automatically equal a war crime if they died. This is a very complex problem that has seen far too little proper analysis, in my view. Certainly the initial attempts here were not particularly impressive. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:31, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>applied to the Soviets, because Article 82 of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_%281929%29_cadc.html" title="Geneva Convention (1929)">Geneva Convention (1929)</a> states:</p>

<p>Which makes it clear that the Germans were bound by GC1929, because Germany was a signature, but your source does not say that the Soviets were bound by it. As I said above we need to find a source which explains that GC1929 was invoked to find Japanese guards guilty of war crimes, as Japan was also not a signatory to GC1929 that would be much better. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added in a section on aerial bombardment, which I thought was very balanced. It stated that some reputable historians have described some Allied Bombing raids as war crimes, but most agree that they do not fit the official definition. I linked the article to relevant wiki articles and websites.</p>
<p>Somone got rid of it and I don't know why. Would it be normal for an encycolpedia not to mention there is some dispute over whether something is a war crime. Is there someone on this page who does not want any discussion of Aerial Bombardment. Looking back over the talk page, it seems there is someone who watches this page to make sure no-one ever even mentions it. What is that about?</p>
<p>I personally don't think, from what I've read, that aerial bombardment fits the definition of a war crime, but acts which killed 600,000 people in Germany alone, most of whom were civilians, is obviously going to attract discussion. seanjw 217.196.239.189 13:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed your addition. Allied bombing and that some people saw it as a warcrime is discussed at length in the relevant articles. This article serves as a repository for warcrimes committed by Allied forces that were clearly crimes under the rules of war applying, not incidents where one side or the other alleges that a crime was committed, regardless of the rules of war. Including such a discussion here is in my view opening the door to add all sorts of things that someone somewhere thought were a war crime. That is why I am quite against the inclusion of such alleged warcrimes. As you can see from the discussion here, I am not alone in my opinion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Katyn massacre</span></h2>
<p>I changed the phrase "<i>before the involvement of the relevant nation in World War II</i>" because it is incorrect. The Soviet Union's involvement in World War II began with its first act of war, which was the invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939. This was later followed by the attack on Finland on November 30 the same year. The beginning of World War II in Europe is usually defined by Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. The Katyn massacre took place during the spring of 1940. As for references for this interpretation of the events, I will simply refer to the references for <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">the Wikipedia article "World War II"</a>. By the way, that article says, in its 2nd and 3rd paragraphs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Allies were initially made up of Poland, British Commonwealth countries, and France.</i></dd>

<p>So the Soviet Union attacked and invaded one of the Allies (Poland), 2 years before <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> after which it joined the Allies.

<p>I see this article once carried NPOV tag. I do not understand why it was removed. I have <i>serious</i> objections to the contemporary attempt to confuse specific war crimes with general acts of war. Are we really to set the Holocaust alongside the air war as comparable atrocities? Over 50,000 British airmen alone died in the strategic bombing campaign; and whatever controversy surrounds Harris' general strategy, theirs was a legitimate campaign, an important contribuation towards reducing the German capacity to wage war; or are we to conflate the acts of aircrew with those of concentration camp guards? The atomic boming of Japan, moreover, saved more lives than it sacrificed, both allied and Japanese. The wholesale raping carried out against women by Soviet troops in Germany (and elsewhere) could indeed be defined as a war crime, if this could be proved to have emerged from a specific policy directive by the Soviet government, rather than the actions of an army brutalized by four years of savage and murderous warfare. I am not saying that no crimes were committed on the alied side; but this is an issue in which definitions have to be used, and applied, with a considerable degree of care; otherwise we risk marching down the road of hopeless relativism. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 01:58, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Mass rape is very convenient accusation because how it can be proved or disproved? After a mass murder you have corpses and graves. What do you have after "mass rape" - only old wifes fables. Please take in consideration that the estimated figure of 2 million rapes comes from only source - Beevor's book. Interesting fact is that Beevor presenting this figure reffers to Sander, Helke, and Johr, Barbara (eds), Befreier and Befreite. Krieg, Vergewaltigungen, Kinder, Munich, 1992 and in the same book those authors estimate number of rapes commited by Germans in the USSR as high as 10 millions. --<a href="../../../n/e/k/User%7ENekto_6fd5.html" title="User:Nekto">Nekto</a> 06:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have only used the Japanese case as an example, because when viewed from an Anglo-American view point, it highlights how pernicious such argument are. For example look at the Japanese court case I have recently added to the text, when considering whether the bombings were a crime or not they looked at the various treaties and customary laws which were relevant at the time. They did not consider if the attacks were justified because more might of died in an invasion, because it was not pertinent to the question if it was a war crime. As in the case of Karl Doenitz, although the Allies were also using unrestricted submarine warfare, and this caused a reduction in his sentence to nothing for that crime, he was still found guilty of the crime. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:05, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The alternative cost regarding the atomic bombs was known to Truman and factored into this decision. As such it should be mentioned in a general subject.

<dl>
<dd>If you dislike the previous source, here is another: "In his book, Friedrich argues that the RAF's relentless campaign against Germany during the final months of the war served no military purpose. Instead, he says that Winston Churchill's decision to drop more bombs on a shattered Germany between January and May 1945, most of them on small German towns of little strategic value, was a war crime."<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1067232,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1067232,00.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></dd>
<dd>"This view is confirmed by the speech of the British Prime Minister before the House of Commons in 1938 in which he said that any such bombing was an "undoubted violation of international law." Shortly after, the League of Nations unanimously passed a resolution affirming that such bombing was illegal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Was this illegality known before the fact by the perpetrators? Yes, by the statements of the British Prime Minister, and as shown by Anglo-American protests to Japan over its bombing in China. For example, in 1937, the American State Department protested to Japan about its bombing of Chinese cities, "[A]ny general bombing of an extensive area wherein there resides a large population engaged in peaceful pursuits is unwarranted and contrary to principles of law and of humanity." In 1938, the United States protested again (also protesting bombing of cities in the Spanish Civil War) and now called such bombing "barbarous." The protest continued: "Such acts are in violation of the most elementary principles of those standards of human conduct which have been developed as an essential part of modern civilization." Surely, something must appear morally wrong if Anglo-American leaders officially characterize Japanese bombing in China as barbaric, inhumane, and criminal (in violation of international law, as later officially adopted by the League of Nations), but which bombing is not so when the Americans and British do precisely the same thing. And even much worse (e.g., the atomic and fire bombing)."<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/COMM.10.5.03.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/COMM.10.5.03.HTM" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>

<p>I am quite happy with the first source. Ultramarine look at the entry for the A bomb, which I added which in includes a reputable source for a Japanese court case finding it was a war crime. I have nothing against a well argued position that "such and such said it was a war crime". But the second one you have mentioned is disingenuous the Prime Minster was <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Chamberlain_8a10.html" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville "could do business with Herr Hitler" Chamberlain</a> of whom Churchill said "<i>He looked at foreign affairs through the wrong end of a municipal drain pipe</i>". --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 15:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another point the League of Nations resoultion was not binding, (As is detailed in <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_bombardment.html#Aerial_area_bombardment_and_international_law" title="Area bombardment">Area_bombardment#Aerial area bombardment and international law</a>):</p>
<dl>
<dd>..In response to a League of Nations declaration against bombardment from the air, a draft convention in Amsterdam of 1938 would have provided specific definitions of what constituted a "undefended" town, excessive civilian casualties and appropriate warning. This draft convention makes the standard of being undefended quite high - any military units or anti-aircraft within the radius qualifies a town as defended. This convention, like the 1923 draft, was not ratified, nor even close to being ratified, when hostilities broke out in Europe. While the two conventions offer a guideline to what the belligerent powers were considering before the war, neither document was legally binding.</dd>

<p>I find this debate deeply depressing-an attempt to confuse the moral issues at stake by appeals to neutrality and pseudo scholarship. 'Base motive of revenge', 'Perfidious Albion'-oh yes, of course, absolutely correct. The German bombing of London was an accident? How could any reasonable person have any other view? I supose I should make my own POV absolutely plain (and my perfidious feelings of revenge)-both the air war on Germany and the atomic boming of Japan were <i>essential</i> acts of war. Now, please tell me the Holocaust was an essential act of war; please tell me that allied air crew were the equivalent of the SS, and that Sir Arthur Harris is the British counter-part of Heinrich Himmler. What we can see here is the moral cancer that still eats away, after all these years, in the German soul, translated into an attempt to equate their self-induced suffering with the fate of the European Jews. I will never, ever accept this article for anything other than what it truly is: neo-Nazi intellectual obfuscation.

<p>Look at the history of this article: I have deleted nothing and added nothing. I have merely used this page to record my <i>contempt</i>, and I will never accept this as anything more than the malicious propaganda it clearly is; or, what is infinitely worse, an attempt to blur the issues. Tell me, does the page on the Holocaust give equal weight-as opposed to a passing mention-to those who would argue that it is all a fabrication? I think not. Can you not see the dangers in the contention that all views are worthy of inclusion? That, quite frankly, is the road to perdition. While I can clearly challenge the view that the Holocaust never happened by appeals to evidence-for those who are open to such appeals-I cannot counter the view that the bombing offensive was a 'war crime' because it is not an empirical observation but a political preconception. As such it is, in my view, as perfidious in its own way as the contention that Auschwitz 'was only a factory.' <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 00:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 00:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>IMHO the problem with Ultramarine entry is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jörg Friedrich is not claiming that area bombing was a war crime only that Churchill’s decision to bomb in 1945 was. So a source is needed that all area bombardment was a war crime.</li>
<li>The sentence <i>Other historians note that there were little protection for civilians in the laws of war at the time, or dispute that civilians were deliberately targeted.</i> is not sourced.</li>
<li>The sentence <i>No Axis official or officer was charged for war crimes for similar actions, like the Blitz.</i> has not source and although I think it is correct it is very hard to prove and as such is original research.</li>
<li>The sentence <i>The RAF Bomber Command managed to divert many German resources which helped win the war.</i> can not be used as a justification for an alleged war crime
<ol>
<li>because it is like saying that the massacre at <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oradour-sur-Glane_af7f.html" title="Oradour-sur-Glane">Oradour-sur-Glane</a> helped to pacify France.</li>
<li>The alleged war crime is about Churchill’s decision to bomb a shattered Germany between January and May 1945, which has little to do with <i>diverting German resources which helped win the war</i>. It was earlier in the war, but the point Jörg Friedrich is making is that he does not think this was true by 1945.</li>
<li>and anyway there are lots of other arguments as to why the Allied bomber offensives were effective so why pick this specific one?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i>The Allies has however been accused of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocrisy.html" title="Hypocrisy">hypocrisy</a>...</i>. This has nothing to do with if Area bombardment was a war crime. Also there is the legal argument that if tactics in war become common place for all sides and if there is no breach of a writen convention/treaty, then common usage makes it legal under customary practive ("<i>If international law is not enforced, persistent violations can conceivably be adopted as customary practice, permitting conduct that was once prohibited</i>" (<a href="http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps28111/Vol.%2056%20(2005)/Volume%2056%20Combined.pdf" class="external text" title="http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps28111/Vol.%2056%20(2005)/Volume%2056%20Combined.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Air Force Law Review Volume 56 2005</a> (PDF) Page 57/58)). So even if before World War II there was a custom not to use the tactics of Area Bombardment, but the end of World war II the custom was that these tactics were customary practice and so not a breach of the Laws of War. In this case the Allies' position is not hypocritical.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can load up the paragraph with lots of further text to NPOV each sentence, but I see little use in doing this, as the kernel of the the argument is adequately expressed in my initial version of the entry "<i>In his book "Fire Sites"...</i>" --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I disagree, obviously an encyclopedic article should also deal with the moral issues, justifications, alternative costs, and so on.

<dd>I have been looking into the accusation of hypocrisy but it does not hold water because the British did not change their policy, from that at the start of the war that broadly complied with the 1922 Hague Rules of Air Warfare, to that of strategic bombing until the day after <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam_Blitz_b7b2.html" title="Rotterdam Blitz">Rotterdam was Blitzed</a>.

<p>Hundreds of thousands; no, millions of people die in war; it's a sad fact of life. The strategic bombing campaign was, as I have said, a legitimate act, and some 50000 British airmen alone died in commission of their duty. I will not, under any circumstances, accept German revisionism on this question, or see these brave men somehow conflated with the cowards who worked in concentration camps. And as for the atomic bombing, horrible as it was, it brought the war in the east to an immediate halt. Just imagine how many would have died, both allied and Japanese, if the Japanese home islands had been invaded? You might care to examine, if you care to look at this issue objectively, the cost in human lives for the battles of Saipan and Okinawa. Many Japanes civilians committed suicide rather than surrender, because they were terrified by the tales told by their leaders what would happen if the Americans caught them. You have a distinct and clearly articulated POV: I have a series of objections. I continue to dispute the biased content of this article and, I believe, have the right to make my objections known. I will not have them washed away. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 22:25, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In case you don't know, those 50000 British airmen who died like "heroes" according to you, were trying to bomb populated areas and kill tens of thousands of innocent people. Heroes were those who died trying to stop them, not them. There were American and Russian "cowards" too, who worked in the Allied concetration camps. About the atomic bombings, you said: <i>"Just imagine how many would have died, both allied and Japanese, if the Japanese home islands had been invaded?"</i>. Yes, many would have died, but they would have died in the battlefield while defending their homeland, not as a result of bombings and radiation. <b>My point is: When someone dies in the battlefield, it's a sad fact of life. When somebody who is unarmed is shot, or dies as a result of mass bombings and radiation, or his life ends at a concetration camp like Auschwitz, then it's a war crime.</b> I 'm not a revisionist. Thousands of Greek people were kiled by the Germans during the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Occupation_of_Greece_during_WWII_6059.html" title="Axis Occupation of Greece during WWII">Axis Occupation of Greece during WWII</a>.

<p>Many, almost certainly many more than died at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki, would have been killed, not on 'the battlefield', as you put it, if the Allies had been forced to invade the Japanese home islands, but as the incidental casualties of war. You obviously have completely failed to understand the point I was making about Okinawa and Saipan. It is also certain that many more Allied prisoners, clinging on to life in Japanese camps, would have died. It is impossible to <i>separate</i> military and civilian casualties in modern warfare. That is the chief lesson of WWII. Please try to think rationally and read again what I have written: I said that British airmen died not 'like heroes', but in commission of their duty-they were heroes, but that is my POV. The air offensive was a legitimate attack on the German capacity to wage a war which, incidentally, they started. Allied concentration camps? You mean like Auschwitz? I do not mean to be unkind, but you seem to have the kind of revisionist perspective on the past the totters on the edge of a moral abyss, where one set of 'crimes' is simply cancelled out by another. However, I should make my position clear. I am not saying that no war crimes were committed on the Allied side; but I am saying that the bombing offensive was an act of war-horrible as that is-with none of the gratuity of true crimes. I am sorry you cannot understand that. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 22:21, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

We are talking about a POV tag that should be removed, because the events that are being described in the article were war crimes and not "legitimate acts of war". <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsos_26c7.html" title="User:Mitsos">Mitsos</a> 13:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The lot of you editors expressing yourself in the matter might just benefit from a bit broader outlook and a bit less "black &amp; whitishness". As a reserve NCO &amp; history student, I strongly appreciate the deeds of Finnish veterans during WWII. At the same time I can understand those that resent the systematic targetting of say field kitchens during the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_War_0986.html" title="Winter War">Russo-Finnish</a> war, leaving a great deal of Soviets starving and dying because their own logistics were ruined. I can imagine many would consider that very brutal. Yet, such brutish behaviour is within the accepted limits of war (those Soviets that surrendered were treated well), while later actions such as the handing over of POW political commissars to German forces are much more controversial.</dd>

<dd>My point is, the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II&amp;oldid=79446651" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II&amp;oldid=79446651" rel="nofollow">as of now</a> clearly state that <b>"Not all of these are agreed to be war crimes"</b>. And that's it. If one start with saying that "the bombs over Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki were good things" it'll end with another saying that "Hitler's actions were actually quite well meant, all the feller wanted to do was to secure <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensraum.html" title="Lebensraum">lebensraum</a> for his people". No matter what principles or thought systems one side has in a war, the deciding factor for one's record is if the blood on one's shining armour is from civilians or legal combatants. While accusations of allied war crimes are disputed &amp; controversial, I can't see why they can't be brought up (where else? Or should such accusations be omitted completely as some seem to want). Regardless of "extenuating circumstances" for some (disputed) allied undertakings.</dd>

<dd>Several times now I have put a POV tag on this article because I at least do not accept the accuracy, the interpretation or the content of this article. I have given clear reasons why the tag has to remain, but it has been removed nontheless. It seems to me that there is a sustained attempt to say that my objections somehow do not matter. I am new to Wikipedia, but this must surely constitute a clear breach of usage and protocol. I <i>insist</i> that my objection remains. And if you seriously want an answer to the above question instead of a hysterical outburst, yes, the bombing of Coventry was a legitimate act of war. I regret that you consider the revisionist label as an 'attack'. It is a descriptive term, no more than that. And with reference to the above point I will not accept, under any circumstances, that the strategic bombing offensive was wrong, or that the conduct of British-or American-airmen should even be included as a possible war crime. You must see from Mitsos' contributions the deep intellectual confusion such a claim inevitably causes<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 23:25, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Scoo gave a very clear response. Anyway, I don't want to discuss if the strategic bombing offensive was "wrong" or "right".

<p>I wouldn't label my rant as very clear&#160;;) Anyway, could a possible way out of this rather unproductive dispute be to alter the article by dividing it in <u>clearly</u> proven(or equivalent) war crimes and <u>alleged</u> ones (while that might also invite anons and the like that might flood that section of the article).

The Aerial Bombardment as a war crime was the best source I could find as either a legal expert or an "historian",was the best I could do and providing that it is noted that he is a revisionsit I have no objections to including it. The second is a legal court case, which is a valid source, and I think warrents a mention here even if I disagree with the verdict because it should give many English speakers who do not know of the case food for thought.

<p>I've got to say that the article as a whole needs to change. You cannot call an article "Crimes by person/institution/country XYZ" and then list only alleged and disputed so called crimes. Unless a case has come to court and been tried and XYZ found guilty it must be clear as a bell that the crimes are alleged not proven. Mitsos argument that international law states X and they did X therefore it was a war crime hold no water whatsoever. Courts not only look at action but also the reasons for the action and its intended and actual results. Until a court says that that action was a crime it only and alleged crime and so far none have. Don't get me wrong I'm sure war crimes were commited by allied soldiers but unless you have a court martial or war crime tribunal etc to say something is a war crime you run the risk of effectively accusing living people of being war criminals simply by including incidents in a list entitled "Allied war crimes..." instead of a list that makes clear that the crimes are alleged. That just can't be done on Wikipedia. I propose the article is renamed to alleged allied war crimes during WWII asap. To my mind the POV in the article stems from the fact the article is misnamed in the first place.--<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 16:21, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You say that <i>"Unless a case has come to court and been tried and XYZ found guilty it must be clear as a bell that the crimes are alleged not proven."</i> That's wrong. Who do you think that could have tried the Allies for commiting war crimes during WWII? The UN which was established by the Allies themselves?? Even now, noone can put the US government into trial for commiting war crimes in Iraq. If Germany had win the war, the Allies would have been tried and found guilty of war crimes. It happened that the Allies won the war and put the nazi leaders into trial, and found them guilty of war crimes. You admited yourself that the Allies commited war crimes. So what's your problem with the article? <b>Millions of German and Japanese civilians died because of the "strategic bombings".

An illustration of this is your use of bold type, which seems to me to constitute-like capital letters-a form of shouting, always counterproductive. You also seem to take Göring's view that the Nuremberg trial was no more than 'victors justice', which means you are sailing close to some very dark winds indeed. Might I suggest thay you take a break for a time, perhaps coming back in a week or two with some more cogent arguments, assuming you wish to pursue the issue? I do have to make it absolutely clear to you, though, that there are thousands of veterans of Bomber Command still alive in my country who made a vital contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany.

<p><i>"You also seem to take Göring's view that the Nuremberg trial was no more than 'victors justice'"</i> Yes it was "victors justice". Of course it was true justice, but only for the defeated side. <i>"there are thousands of veterans of Bomber Command still alive in my country who made a vital contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany."</i> Yes, they did made a vital contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany, but that doesn't means they didn't commited war crimes. I don't say they were "evil" people, they were ordered to do it and they did it. But they did commited war crimes. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsos_26c7.html" title="User:Mitsos">Mitsos</a> 07:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The point is you can't lump proven war crimes such as the Dachau maasacre where a court-martial took place with unproven allegations no matter what the source without implying similarity. That implication has far reaching consequences for Wikipedia as a whole as it opens them up to litigation. As people involved are still alive the article cannot stand in its present form. As a MINIMUM the article should have seperate sections with proved cases and alleged cases clearly split.

<dd>Why wasn't Goering tried? Because it wasn't a war crime? To say so (or to deny it) on one's own behalf is OR and therefore can't serve as a basis to make any point here. Citation of existing definitions of war crimes is necessary and many of those contradict each other. Let's include the major definitions into the article as well as every incident that qualifies as a war crime according to at least one of those definitions (maybe in decending order by number of applicable definitions) and let the reader decide. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 12:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haber, please don't be oversensitive, I didn't say anything about your sacred POV tag. Have it, if you really believe it's the right thing. But I think the {{OR|article}} tag may be more appropriate (read on for a reason), as <i>no proper definition of what constitutes to a war crime is being provided</i> in the first place, which would be necessary as a <i>valid reference point</i> for deciding as to whether the article is or is not in fact POV. Everything else is just personal opinions and not a basis for POV-tagging the article. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 19:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mitsos, I was puzzled and disturbed by your previous reference to Haber's opinion being determined by him, in your words, being " probably jewish or something." I think I now understand the motivation behind your relentless campaign here, and the moral obfuscation you have been attempting to introduce. Would you like to tell the other editors-those who do not already know-what your politics are? I think it may very well have some bearing on the point under discussion. And I should say that I, for one, already know the answer to this question by your written admission on on another page. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 23:42, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree on article quality, maybe I can find the time to come up with some appropriate sources. About Mitsos' politics: Just go to his user page, there is no need for a which hunt, he has a political attitude (which is more than many people can claim), but at the same time I believe he is good-faithed as an editor and that is what counts. Although I agree with Haber that moving/renaming might be needed, and some work on the article, esp inclusion of proper definitions of "war crimes" has to be done. If anyone wants to keep the title, that is. Still, I stick by my proposal of changing POV to OR tag, for the very definition of war crime within this article is not POV, but OR (which is a lot worse by wikistandards). <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 07:07, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have a <i>serious problem</i> here which goes to the heart of every concept of fairness, accuracy and political neutrality. Let me make it clear that there are <i>no private exchanges</i> in Wikipedia, and talk pages can be read by all. I have absolutely no interest in political withchhunts; but I do have an interest in the truth and the way in which a particular view of the world-POV, if you prefer-can be used for the manipulation of facts and interpretations. Haber is being far too restrained: Mitsos is more than a 'White Supremacist': he's an anti-Semite and a Nazi. I quote, "We hane (sic) got "Neonazis" in Greece too (like me)..." Further still, "A small description of National Socialism could be <i>the enforcement of the laws of nature in the human society</i>." And this, "I hate political correctness. As we say it is something <i>Invented by Jews, believed by Whites, ignored by muds."</i></dd>

This whole page must now be treated as <i>highly suspect</i> in every sense imaginable.

<dd>Anyway, the problem is not that Mitsos holds some loathsome ideas. The problem is how to have a good wikipedia entry. Removing mention of incidents is not a good way. Pointing out that they might not be war crimes is. Putting things in perspective (an entry on Axis war crimes would be ten times longer and would still miss some) might be. Clarifying someone's ideas such as <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_J._Rummel_4961.html" title="Rudolph J. Rummel">Rudolph J. Rummel</a>'s, which were badly misrepresented, is certainly a good way.</dd>
<dd>I'm thankful the allies freed my country. Their record in WWII was very good, with a very small number of black spots. However, I think we can all learn something from those black spots. History is also useful for learning from past mistakes.</dd>

<dd>Lou, I accept your sincerity, but I think you have probably set yourself an impossible task. When I first came across this page I was, I freely confess, angered by the contention that the strategic bombing offensive, which, I believe, made a vital contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany, was a war crime, especially as the contention was based on such politically suspect sources. However, I made no changes to the page itself, merely confining my disquiet to a POV tag. When I was first approached by Mitsos on this issue-via a message on my talk page-I responded in measured terms, explaining with due care why I considered the tag necessary. His reaction was to initiate an edit war in the face of all my objections. I have now become aware of the full sickening truth-yes, I have to use that term- behind his campaign. I now see this whole page not as a legitimate encyclopedia entry but as <i>Neo-Nazi propaganda</i>. Where does this end? Just imagine if Mitsos and his loathsome chums decide to write a page on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion-which they may very well do-highlighting the true nature of the 'Jewish conspiracy'? And there are a whole series of possibilities along these lines. One can tackle nonsense like Holocaust denial when this pops up; but what about more subtle perversions in the guise of encyclopedic truth? We face terrible dangers. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 08:10, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haber, I'm not meeting extremists halfway. I'm trying to have the best Wikipedia page possible, without hiding information and without diffusing false propaganda. When Italian troops on a peacekeeping mission committed acts of violence on civilians, the responsible people were tried, and training was improved to avoid other such acts. This policy was successful, and my respect for our forces is increased for this. If we make a good page, it will help improve Wikipedia's image, too.</dd>
<dd>White Guard: I can sympathize with you, I was harassed by a neo-fascist some time ago (he was banned). If Mitsos wants to contribute useful information, so let it be. If he wants to disseminate propaganda, I'll help reverting it. A page on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>?

<dd><i>I have to again be absolutely clear on this since so much takes place in time of war. War related killing by military forces that international agreements and treaties directly or by implication prohibit is democide, whether the parties are signatories or not. That killing explicitly permitted is not democide. Thus, the death of civilians during the bombing of munitions plants in World War II is not democide. Nor is the death of civilians when through navigation or bombing errors, or the malfunction of equipment, bombs land on a school or hospital, unless it is clear that the bombing was carried out recklessly in spite of a high risk to such civilian buildings. Nor is the death of civilians in a bombed village beneath which has been built enemy bunkers. Nor is the death of civilians caught in a cross fire between enemy soldiers, or those civilians killed while willingly helping troops haul supplies or weapons. Seldom is it easy to make these distinctions, but the aim here must be clear. I discriminate between democide in time of war and war-deaths. The latter are those of the military and civilians from battle or battle related disease and famine. The former are those victims (which may include the military, as when POWs are massacred) of internationally prohibited war-time killing, what may be called war-crimes or crimes against humanity.</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>I think we can say that he does <i>explicitly exclude war deaths which occure within the laws of war.</i> and as there were no "international agreements and treaties directly or by implication prohibit[ing]" area bombings, and atomic bombings, the paragraph was incorrect. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
