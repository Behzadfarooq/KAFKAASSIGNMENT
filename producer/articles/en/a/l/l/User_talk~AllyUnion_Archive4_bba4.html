<p>On my talk page, you asked "It seems that all VfD pages are moved to the Old page by the seventh day. If this is indeed true, I would like to assist in automating the copying of text of the Template:Vfd top and Template:Vfd bottom to each subpage on each day when it is moved. What do you think?"</p>
<p>I could see it working but we'd have to completely rewrite the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process</a>. Right now, we are using the header and footer templates to add a color-box around the discussion so that the people closing them can clearly see which ones have been processed and which ones still need to be closed.</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm not sure what value it would add. You will still need to edit the discussion page in order to record your decision. Using a bot to save typing 40 characters doesn't seem like enough of a savings to be worth it... I'm interested in your thoughts, though. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 18:46, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be a small luxury not to have to hand-enter the top and bottom statements (especially the bottom, since I have a tendency to leave that one out), but I agree with Rossami's point about the utility of the color-boxes. Also, if discussions are bot-closed as soon as they're moved to the /Old page, we'd have to make sure that everyone who takes part in the voting knows that articles nearing their "date of move" better get their votes in quick. As it is, there are usually a couple of days after the /Old move for people to get in last-minute statement before a close-down of the debate. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joyous</a> 18:59, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When you forget to add {{subst:vfd bottom}}, it's pretty noticable on /Old, and it isn't too hard for someone else to figure out which one didn't get closed and fix it. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 21:12, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I was thinking that a bot could tally the results... but there is a lot of text processing issues that I will need to resolve and many questions that I believe aren't possible. I won't include this feature until we've discussed it all out. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 01:05, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A bot to update <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> and <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_Old_dcc1.html" title="WP:VFD/Old">WP:VFD/Old</a> would be <i>great</i>. I had thought vaguely about it myself, but I don't have any experience running bots. I commented at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#Additional_uses_to_bot_.28User:Allyunion.29" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots#Additional uses to bot (User:Allyunion)</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 21:12, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would be very uncomfortable relying on a bot to make the decision. It might work for very simple votes but I don't think it would be possible to program in the specific scenarios we need. For example:
<ol>
<li>How would the bot screen out the sockpuppet votes?
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, very difficult to do, and an issue I raised myself. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:00, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>How could the bot recognize when the circumstances have changed (for example, a string of deletes, an "I just rewrote it, keep" and then a string of keeps)?
<dl>
<dd>Double votes could be understand based on time stamps, as well as strikeouts.-- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:00, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>How could the bot decide if there is a logical argument or evidence presented which invalidates the prior votes?
<dl>
<dd>It would not. Again, My question is to the extent of the grunt work it should do. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:00, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The problem is that "Votes for Deletion" is not really about "voting" despite the name. It's about laying out evidence (one piece of evidence being community opinion) for the deciding admin. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:49, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thoughts, which I did express on your talk page: <b>Also, there are questions about the weak and strong deletes, a question regarding anyone's vote who is delete but something else, a question regarding unsigned votes, anonymous votes, and sockpuppet votes.</b> -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:57, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another thought. You <i>could</i> use the bot to put the bottom template on the discussion thread when the discussion is moved over. A hanging /div command won't do anything but it would save a step which, as Joyous said, is easy to miss. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, agreeing with Rossami. I'd be quite unhappy trusting a bot to work through the sometimes convoluted voting, re-voting, retracting votes, strikethroughs, sockpuppets, etc. Even with a solid string of "deletes," I'd be reluctant to turn it over to a bot, as article deletion can be such a charged issue. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joyous</a> 05:28, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh! I know. How about the bot still does the adding text portion, but instead, it merely uses an HTML comment to comment it out? -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:55, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I waited until a few minutes after midnight, but the bot apparently didn't do its thing. It did create <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Log_2005_February_7_6b19.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 7">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 7</a>, but it didn't edit VfD or /Old.

<dd>Recall that the bot is updating three things at once at this time: VFD List, VFD, VFD/Old. VFD List at *:50, VFD at 23:53, VFD/Old at 23:57. If VFD List takes too long, then it may slow both VFD and VFD/Old down. Again, I ask you refrain editing until 00:15... that way, it is completely certain that the bot did not work. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 01:08, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're present wording is ok; I think the wording you put in my talk area is less clear than the wording that you'd put into the draft document.

<p>FYI: When I posted my goodbye at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">stub sorting WikiProject</a> I had every intention of kicking back for a couple of weeks and doing absolutely nothing on the Wikipedia.

However, when I found that the Charles Darwin dispute had gone to arbitration (and I was one of the users that were named in the complaint), I decided that I had to follow through with what I had started there. Now that has been settled, my plan (again) is take a week or two off, and then to finish that one article. Then "gK" will be gone for good from the Wikipedia (for more details see the last two paragraphs in this section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Charles_Darwin-Lincoln_dispute/Proposed_decision#re:Thanks_to_User:Imaglang" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Charles_Darwin-Lincoln_dispute/Proposed_decision#re:Thanks_to_User:Imaglang" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for the barnstar! VFD/Old isn't really going to be your passion, is it? I love tedious, mindless stuff like that; at work, I love to collate papers. I think there's something wrong with me. I see from the indicator that you're feeling a bit of stress; I hope clearing out VfD entries didn't cause that. I really do appreciate the help, though.

<dd>No problem. Because I've been messing around the pywikipediabot framework, I think I have figured out a way to create a way to clean out VFD very easily. It would be manually run, bot assisted work, basically. I actually used it recently to help me out adding the {{subst:vfd top}} stuff. It still could stand some improvements, and I was thinking of making it better when I have a little bit of free time. However... cleaning out VFD/Old takes too much of my time. Would you be interested using the manually bot assistant to clean out VFD/Old? You'll have to have access to Linux or some UNIX variant.</dd>
<dd>I will need to make a menu that makes the bot better... something like:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
Current page is [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Article on VFD]]
# Add link on talk page
# Result is delete
# Delete article page
# Use {{merge}}
# Redirect page
# Transwiki
# Block error page
# Insert tally count
# Keep: remove VFD notice from article text
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm... this is how the program will essentially work:</dd>
<dd>Check if the text from <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_top_d7d6.html" title="Template:Vfd top">Template:Vfd top</a> and <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_bottom_f7cd.html" title="Template:Vfd bottom">Template:Vfd bottom</a> is present
<dl>
<dd>If not, check if subst: was not included. Correct if necessary.</dd>
<dd>else, prompt to edit page
<dl>
<dd>If yes, print out menu
<dl>
<dd>Options would be: Add link on talk page if not present, insert the tally count (manual), mark result of debate as delete and delete the page, mark the result of the debate as merge (remove VFD text off article) and place merge notice on article(s), mark the result of the debate as transwiki (add to transwiki log), mark the page as undeletable due to block errors (add to block error log)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If no, skip the page</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The add link on talk page will check if the link exists, including whether or not {{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/{{PAGENAME}}}} is used.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>

<p>Lists like that are inherently un-maintainable and inaccurate, and in any event I don't see the point in keeping lists of non-notable high schools.

I don't think that categories and lists do the same thing. I think that if schools are to be listed, then the place to list them is in articles about education in a particular region and the reason they should be listed is because they formed part of that. The problem with lists is that they are impossible to maintain; What about Logan Grammar School, Bearsden, Glasgow opened in 1937, closed 1942 due to the war? How are you going to prove it doesn't exist? How are you going to notice that Bearsden didn't become part of Glasgow until much later than 1942? If you do notice it, are you going to keep separate lists for each? An article on education which includes the history of an area can much more easily provide valuable information and in this context insufficiently "notable" school names have a valid place to be included.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think that quite a few of the schools which get deleted could, in theory, have an article. I've shown that with a little work on Google, I can completely change people's opinion from delete to keep (see <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_High_School_0120.html" title="Elder High School">Elder High School</a> for an example). However, the biggest problem is verifiability; most of the information never makes it to Google. I think that many of the interesting/"important" facts about schools get lost to the extent that their pupils may not even know them and this makes for bad articles which are always going to stay unencyclopedic.<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 16:12, 2005 Feb 13 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Odd... it's actually the teaching staff that knows more about the school than the students do. Well, the teachers who have been around the longest.

<p>Thanks for your message. You have a point about lists being different from categories. Categories only specify articles, but lists can include redlinked articles. However, when I think about it, I still don't think lists to that extent are very useful. If we include lists to such a great extent, why not the following? Lists of COUNTRY schools -&gt; Lists of STATE/PROVINCE schools -&gt; Lists of REGION schools -&gt; Lists of MUNICIPALITY schools -&gt; Lists of schools in a BLOCK.</p>
<p>I think this sets a dangerous precedent for lists within lists. If they reworked the Lists of schools in the US to actually include every school in the US, instead of showing links to other lists (by state), then that might actually mean something. However, these lists would be very difficult to maintain, especially if you have two or three different lists to update with every addition of a school.</p>
<p>I'm on the fence on articles about schools (which is why I almost never vote on VfDs about schools). But these lists aren't necessary, IMO. It's too late to change the comment on my vote so it doesn't indicate that categories = lists, but I would have let my vote stand anyways. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 05:23, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
