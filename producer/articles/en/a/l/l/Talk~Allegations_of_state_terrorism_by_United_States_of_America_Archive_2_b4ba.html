<dd><s>Hi Tom,</s></dd>
<dd><s>Check the source before reverting my correction, please. The source is the NY Times for the Iraq bombing. Commondreams just archived it. As for the reporter's name, since when is the reporter's name of a major paper (the NYT) mentioned in a Wikipedia article? Should every fact in all articles be prefaced with something like "Joe Smith writing for Major News Source X reports that the dow jones lost y points last week"? It's bordering on deliberate underreporting. As it is, the piece is prefaced with "according to fornmer US intel officials." --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 23:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</s>

<dd><s>Your version of the article is what is in place. What is your question? Should every fact in all articles be prefaced with something like "Joe Smith writing for Major News Source X reports that the dow jones lost y points last week"? No. Should this assertion be prefaced by who makes it? I think so.

It's really nothing to do (as said above) with POV pushing or anything silly like that. From my comment just now on AfD: "Nothing POV about this title, or State terrorism by Canada, State terrorism by Sweden, State terrorism by Ukraine, State terrorism by Japan, State terrorism by Israel, or State terrorism by India. The "domestic" viewpoint--that is, the 'home' view of the government or local media of that nation--has no role in determining what is considered state terrorism, really. Would domestic Canadian media or government in 99% of cases even refer to it's actions as state terrorism? Or any other nation? Of course not. To call the US article POV and unsalvageable is simply patriotic bluster. I love America, I live here, but if a sanctioned United Nations court said something we did for example is terrorism, guess what? It's terrorism. Editorial/domestic POV has no place in the content or name of an article. Facts are facts--whether they are locally disliked facts are irrelevant, I'm unhappy to admit. The article needs to stay, as do the others from the original forking based on this."</s></p>

<dd><s>Well, it is semantics, but it is important semantics. Yes, real people from America committed real crimes, so why not call these crimes 'American'. To take two similar examples... real German people carried out the Holocaust, yet we refer to it as having been committed by Nazi's. Why? Or for an older example, people from Italy killed Christ and committed genocide in Israel in 70AD, yet we refer to the perpetrators as 'Romans'.</s></dd>
<dd><s>I think there is a good and proper reason for this. We say that 'Nazis' did the holocaust because this act was carried out under a certain ideology and by members of a certain subgroup within the German nation at that time. To say 'Germans' did it is to first, imply a racial guilt of all Germans, both those who lived at the time and those yet to be born, and second, to ignore the complexities of the time, to simplify the events and motivations and hide it all behind behind a shield of ignorance in the term 'evil'. This is more comforting and we can say to ourselves, "<i>If it happened because of 'evil', and I am not 'evil', then I have nothing to worry about.</i>".</s></dd>
<dd><s>The reality is that bad things are done by otherwise good people - and even if we ourselves are good, our actions may result in evil. Plenty of Germans were very good people, even at that time, even many who were nazis. (I have a personal story about my wife's grandmother who was a slave labouror in Germany during the war - she was saved by the wife of a Nazi officer who was later executed for (other) war crimes. Its too long to give the details here)</s></dd>
<dd><s>Also, it covers up the complexity of events. eg. Hitler executed 10,000s of germans who faught against Nazism.</s></dd>
<dd><s>To call it "American" terrorism covers up these important details in the same way. The terrorism is committed by a very small subgroup within US society who behave according to a particular ideology. Yes they are supported by the tax paying public, but I disagree that this implies uniform guilt on the entire population. Many people in America fight against this ideology, and they are no less American than the criminals. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 09:35, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

I can think of at least three presidents who trampled pacifist opponents in landslides. Reagan, Nixon, and TR. Americans simply don't give a fuck. As long as Americans have a full tank of gas, a generally nice standard of living, the vast majority of Americans simply don't care who we kill and how we kill them to continue to have the standard of living that we have. Don't simply blame our democratically elected leaders for the terrorism that they have caused abroad. There are millions of Americans who vote for these leaders who don't care. They don't care that Exxon takes 70% of the profits from gas extraction, Americans don't care if only 17 cents of every dollar in bannana production actually goes back to the central american countries. Americans don't care that we killed 200,000 one million Filipinos in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine-American_War_37c4.html" title="Philippine-American War">Philippine-American War</a>. I could go on and on and on. The voting record shows clearly that those who care, really care about American terrorism are in the minority. Remember presidents have some of the highest approval ratings before wars--Bush has been no exception. History is literred with politicans who were pacifists and who lost. Is there any doubt why the democrats are so unwilling to support the anti-war left? It is because the majority of Americans support the wars, the bloodshed and the horrors that our country has caused abroad, and they benefit from it.

<p><s>My reason for removal: It misinterprets what Fisk actually wrote. His story is titled "Through a Syrian Lens" and reports that there are Syrians who believe in a "fearful portrait of an America trapped in the bloody sands of Iraq, desperately trying to provoke a civil war around Baghdad in order to reduce its own military casualties." Moreover, Fisk is careful to specify that he himself has doubts about the truth of allegations such as the story quoted above of the Iraqi man whose car allegedly blew up. He writes: "Impossible, I think to myself. But then I remember how many times Iraqis in Baghdad have told me similar stories. These reports are believed even if they seem unbelievable."</s></p>
<p><s>Fisk is giving an account of stories that were told to him by an unnamed "security source" in Syria, and by Fisk's own account he has not attempted to verify the accuracy of those stories. For example, Fisk doesn't say that he actually spoke with the Iraqi soldier whose story is quoted above. Fisk's reporting tells us something about the type of rumors flying in Iraq and Syria, but it shouldn't be presented here as though these allegations are actually proven. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheldon_Rampton_b54a.html" title="User:Sheldon Rampton">Sheldon Rampton</a> 06:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd><s>MONDO: <i>If the U.S. was ever guilty of terrorism, it was to the aboriginal peoples of the U.S. The rest of this stuff is definitely simply POV based on sources that I find to be POV...so counterbalance is badly needed.</i> Well Monodo, use your considerable research skills to actually write something in this article. You are good at countering the 9/11 conspiracy theories, why not actually take those research skills and apply them here? Thus far I have yet to see one conservative with a counter view add one sentence to this article. Instead everyone is screaming "POV" probably because the views that are expressed here are completely opposite their own ideology and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_civil_religion.html" title="American civil religion">American civil religion</a>. As I have been reminded myself a few times, wikipedia is not a chat board, this is an encyclopedia. Start building and stop whining. I have already removed three sections from this article, and because I did it in a diplomatic way, explaining my deletions, 2 of these three deletions have stayed removed. Whereas Morty has deleted large sections, with no explation, or clearly erroneous explanations, and his edits have been removed immediatly. So this begs the question: who is the most effective wikipedia editor, Morty or myself? Who more effectively pushes his POV, Morty or myself. I learned long ago that the <b>key</b> to winning edit wars is out research your opponents. This takes a lot of work and dedication, which clearly no conservative wikieditor has shown here.</s></dd>

<p><s>It is much easier to delete in mass like a pre-teenage vandal, but it is much less effective, and truly pointless.</s></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name suggestions</span></h2>
<p>I like <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a>'s idea of calling this article "<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_9a2f.html" title="Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America">Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America</a>", and I think this naming should be applied to all countries. Why? Because who _proves_ such a thing? Do we have international trials for national governments that sponsor state terrorism? If not, then we never had anything proven. Further, it's clear that getting people to agree on a definition of state terrorism is problematic. That's why I think this series of articles, if they concentrate on noteworthy, well-sourced <i>allegations</i>, will be much easier to develop in an NPOV manner. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 03:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunatly, I have to disagree with the name change.

<dd>I'd dispute that. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> refers to <i>if A is true and B is true then C</i>, which the listing of references does not do. It instead details A, B, C, D, E, etc, rather than attempting to tie together the list of them to draw a conclusion from the combination. Perhaps the leading paragraph could be changed to indicate that this is a compilation of sources rather than an attempt to make a point (from the presense of the list). To help with this we really need some counter-references. However I am not entirely sure where to find them. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 17:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Much of the page is a collection of references (some of dodgy reliability) chosen to advance the position that the US routinely commits acts of state terrorism. That is original research. If we want to have an article about allegations of state terrorism by the US, we can have an article about those allegations. If we want an article about how the US has commited acts of state terrorism, that's original research. We can easily say, "Chomsky says this happened and was terrorism" or "Ganser says this happened and was terrorism." We cannot say, "This was an act of terrorism."(Ganser, 20xx). <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:09, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Iran vs. US Define terrorism - rename article or new section</span></h2>
<p>Ther problem with the iran vs. US dispute is quite sinmply that terrorism is a lousy word. It is used by people and governments the world over the describe something they disagree with, with very little consistancy. Now, I feel the iran Vs. US section is certainly within the spirit of this article, since Iran clearly still believe that the attack was on purpose and they refer to it as a crime, and there are accusations from elsewhere of a 'secret war'. Clearly, these actions fall under the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">Definition of terrorism</a>.</p>
<p>As single action we cannot call this terrorism (as none of the references explicitly call it that), as that would be additional reasoning. However it does serve a vital part in the article, in my opinion. Either we need a new section, a new article, or a renamed article ('Missuse of US force and funding', off the top of my head, is a suggestion). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 21:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do get to rename the article, however, so as to bring facts within the article's remit. <i>That</i> is not original research. Original research in this case would be, as you said, stating something not called terrorism as terrorism.

<p>Giving the already absurd level of content fighting, I move that all deletions or additions to the article contested even once be justified by the "other side" here on the Talk page. If not, this is going to end up sooner rather than later at ArbCom. I think this would be fair--as TravB said above he's nuked whole chunks of the article and no one has put them back in yet, while wholesale uncommented likewise nuking by others keeps getting undone. The allegations were made, were documented, and were notable, so the article will remain: lets just get it to a NPOV middle ground. I'll remind everyon again that the only POV that matters is NPOV. Anyone's left or right wingism will be left at the door, and abusing based on either side will be met with eventual sanctions by the community.

<dd>I think all Rootology is attempting to do is stop revert wars. We all have a vision of how this wikipage should look. Wikipedia is built on consesus. As I have argued with Morton, my "nuked whole chunks of the article (which) no one has put them back in yet" is because I explained in detail <i><b>why</b></i> I deleted these sections. Whereas others have started revert wars, whose edits last less than 2 minutes. Who is the more effective POV warrior/diplomat? Someone whose edits last days, even weeks, or someone whose edits last a grand total of 10 minutes before being deleted? I am trying to teach my POV opposites how to effectively push there own POV, but no one seems to be listening.

<p>There is alot of A+B=C type of logic in this article, some sections use references that dont even cite terrorism. Furthermore there is a connection being drawn between unlawful combat and terrorism, with only Chmsky's opinion to support them as the same thing. Claims like the US commited acts of terrorism need more then Chomsky's opinion to support them. Cases such as Yugoslavia do not even state terrorism nor are their any sources calling it that, the case was further dismissed. Please follow WP:OR and do not link statements, find sources that do the linking. Extraordinary conclusions need more then one source as well. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would advise for now leaving unlawful combat, since the definition of terrorism does allow such things to be covered.

<p>The problem I have with unlawful combat being linked to terrorism is the only source being provided for them being the same thing is a person who is not a lawyer. While Chomsky is popular he does not even have a law degree to be offering a legal opinion on equality of terms. Further since such a claim is being used to link two lawsuits to acts of terrorism, the claim needs to be supported by more then a sole source. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If one source covers both and it's a very good source, that's fine by me. More sources are always good, but requiring more than one can get you into the land of endless escalation. Chomsky is a world-renowned scholar, and calling something 'terrorism' isn't a legal statement, actualy - considering that the word has very few formal definitions. What we need is good sources by him, rather than interviews - ideally peer reviewed. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 17:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think some users are confused about the purpose of this article. Wikipedia's role is not to 'prove' US terrorism one way or the other. It is to present a collection of cited facts, beliefs and opinions.

<dd>I dont know what you are talking about, one of the items removed had no sources that claimed a terrorist attack happened, so it was not presenting even beliefs or opinions to that affect. As for Chomsky he is not a lawyer, therefore he is not a person of expertise in the field he is discussing, and not appropriate for citing. Also the section basically takes the word of one man to link every unlawful combat case to being terrorism, a man that is not even a legal expert. I do not mind you putting peoples opinions but they need to be widely held opinions, not just Chomskys opinions, especially when defining a legal term. Do you want this to be a good article, or a list of things Chomsky thinks are terrorism? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleted sections: Honduras, Nicaragua vs. US, U.S. Military Plans To Commit Terrorism</span></h2>
<p>I took out a couple of sections for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>U.S. Military Plans To Commit Terrorism</i> - entire section: This article is bad enough dealing in allegations, a subject I think is highly unencyclopaedic, but so long as it is not titled Allegation of state terrorism by the United States and any plan(s) that may have been thought of but never implemented, it should at least deal with allegations of STT, not plans that were never implemented. Other than that, some of the bitses were highly speculative, like the actual killing of people.</li>
<li><i>Honduras</i> - entire section: Similar reasoning, it is not STT by the US even if true and carried out as stated. The US may have financed things, it is also a fact that they tried to persuade them from commiting terrorism. Finally, it was commited, if at all, by Honduras, not the US.</li>
<li><i>Nicaragua</i> - Section stating <i>demonstrators into clashes with the authorities...</i> - Leading demonstrators in into protests to solicit a violent response by the <i>other</i> side is hardly terrorism, just provocations.</li>
<li><i>Tolerance of lynching</i> - I took this out because it isn't STT even if it is true.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also question the part regarding the Baghdad bombings. This part is pure speculation on the part of some agents and the newspaper reporter. Reading the piece also trows much doubt whether anything really happened and by whom and to what effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the section dealing with Gladio starts out by saying that it was a NATO operation and the USSD denies any terrorism took place. So, it isn't a US operation and thus doesn't belong here but under another article dealing with NATO.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 21:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I know my explanation will not be satisfactory to you, because you will only be satisfied when this article ceases to exist, but I will do it anyway.

<dd>Travb, I have not "lost" the AfD as you state it nor am I <i>required</i> to add to this article in order to delete sections of it that are not to be included in my opinion. Whether you will "waste" your time explaining is neither here nor there, this is not your article. What you know your explanations will do to me is totally irrelevant and I resent the implication therein. What about assuming good faith? Also, when did you become so perceptive as to presume to know when I will be satisfied with this article? Last but not least, for your information, I care a great deal about Wikipedia, a <b>neutral</b> <i>encyclopaedia</i> if it can still be called that. I work every day during my limited time that I can allot to this project to better Wikipedia. If by doing that I appear to spoil the party of anti-American demagogues by pointing things out and deleting non-encyclopaedic parts of this article than so be it. All I see you do is add things to this article and denigrate anyone who dares disagree with your POV.

<p>There seems to be some dispute as to whether to include Operation Northwoods under the Cuba section or the Within the US section of this article. US Terrorism was perpetrated against Cuba (Operation Mongoose = the Cuba Project) and is well documented (e.g. National Security Archive). So far I know, there is no evidence that Operation Northwoods terrorist acts proposed by the Joint Chiefs against targets in the US were carried out (thanks to the civilian leadership under JFK nixing the proposal). So the Within the US section should only have the acts proposed but not carried out in Northwoods. --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 22:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Avoiding a full fledged edit war</span></h2>
<p>Based on the edits the past day, <s>I think it is important to bring in a third party mediator to avoid a full fledged edit war.</s> <i>I will hold off, see what happens in the next day.</i></p>
<p>There appears to be three parties too this argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those who often delete large portions of text, and add nothing except minor word to the article.</li>
<li>Those who almost exclusively add content to the article.</li>
<li>Those who both add and delete content from this article (myself and MONDO)</li>
</ol>
<p>The parties who seem most effective are the last two. Deletions by the first group are quickly reverted. Again, I am concerned that not one of these deletionists has added a single source to this text. Many users have added nothing to the article, except for minor word changes which better reflect their POV. For those deletionists who continue to delete large portions of text: you are on the wrong webpage. Wikipedia favors those who can source their POV, not those who delete large sections of text which do not meet their POV. I hope a mediator will calm the deletionists urge to delete, and not add anything to this article.Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 22:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trav, we have had this conversation before, and you have been chastised for it as well. You cannot just cut and paste entire swaths of material into an article. Unless it is attributed and pruned, the article, aside from violating copyright, winds up reflecting 100% the bias and POV of the source from whence it came. NPOV is not about he said she said, tit for tat quotes, but its about evaluating sources, shit canning the bad ones, and placing the good ones in proper context. Why you cant see this frustrates the hell out me. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 22:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh TDC, the nostalgia that wells up in my heart when we begin arguing article content is overwhelming. <i>You cannot just cut and paste entire swaths of material into an article.</i> I agree. <i>Unless it is attributed</i> check, that has been done. <i>aside from violating copyright</i> Please don't quote copyright law to me, this is not the forum, especially since there is nothing in this article which is a copyright violation. All I have to say is: "fair use" and that you use copyright the same way you use all wikipedia policy, to push your own POV. <i>NPOV is not about he said she said, tit for tat quotes, but its about evaluating sources, shit canning the bad ones, and placing the good ones in proper context.</i> Goodness.

<dd>At least TDC is reading the articles that others are posting, and tweaking them to be more reflective of what they actually say. I have yet to see many editors add one word of content. Failing to delete this article in an AfD it appears like some editors have moved onto PLAN B: delete this article section by section. This is why a mediator is sorely needed. The twisting of wikipedia policy to justify this POV is patently absurd. Including the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> which some editors continue to state.

<dd>Any edit lacking a source may be removed, but some editors may object if you remove material without giving people a chance to provide references. If you want to request a source for an unsourced statement, a good idea is to move it to the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html" title="Help:Talk page">talk page</a>. Alternatively, you may tag the sentence by adding the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} template, or tag the article by adding {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">not verified</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsourced_589d.html" title="Template:Unsourced">unsourced</a>}}. Also in that case it may be helpful for your co-editors to leave a clarifying note on the talk page, for instance indicating which sources you already checked. You can also make the unsourced sentences invisible in the article by adding &lt;!-- before the section you want to comment out and --&gt; after it, until reliable sources have been provided. When using this "commenting out" technique it is usually best to leave a clarifying note on the talk page.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>According to the weight of scholarly opinion, the aim of Truman and other key US decision makers in bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki was to demonstrate to the Soviets, then correctly understood as emerging out of the war as the major rival to US power, the ability and willingness of the US to use nuclear weapons and their devastating effect on large human targets; Japan was already persuing peace talks that Summer and was days away from agreeing to surrender. Therefore, according to this view (most historians who have studied the issue), the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki meet most reasonable definitions (including the US legal definition) of terrorism, EXCEPT that there was a declared state of war between the US and Japan. My question therefore is the following: Should this state of war be considered irrelevant, since the acts in question had nothing to do with the prosecution of the war. The war only provided a cover for acts that were aimed at generating fear in a (then ally) emerging rival. Should Hiroshima and Naga be included as nuclear terrorism? --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 23:25, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I personally like this defintion is best: <b>The use or threat of violence to intimidate or cause panic, especially as a means of affecting political conduct.</b></p>
<p>So the following would be included&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>torture</li>
</ul>
<p>The following would not be included&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>political assinations</li>
<li>war crimes</li>
<li>accidental military actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Any alternatives?</p>

<dd>I do not object to mediation if people think it would be useful, but I have seen way worse pages than this. One thing to remember is, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">there is no deadline</a>. Another thing to remember is, an encyclopedic <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">definition of terrorism</a> does not come from a dozen random guys who chose to edit Wikipedia one day. We absolutely do not get to craft our own definition of terrorism, or to vote on the definition we like best. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 23:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like most of your statments Tom, I agree in part, disagree in part. <i>Another thing to remember is, an encyclopedic <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">definition of terrorism</a> does not come from a dozen random guys who chose to edit Wikipedia one day.</i> I agree. That is why I provided encyclopedic definitions. What would you suggest instead Tom? I am trying to get a viable comprimise. Thus far you have provided a lot of critism of my comprimises, and provided no alternatives of your own. The way you dismiss my idea, your statment makes it sound like I am attempting to write a new dictionary, and place my name on it. I am attempting to avoid future edit wars, and focus our work. Terrorism is a vague term, as you showed by your <a href="#Links" title="">#Links</a> above.</dd>
<dd><i>We absolutely do not get to craft our own definition of terrorism, or to vote on the definition we like best.</i> Actually, we can. No matter what people claim, wikipedians vote for things all the time, and decide via consensus what should be included and what should be excluded from articles. As you showed with your <a href="#Links" title="">#Links</a> above, there is a wide variety of defintions on terrorism. What terrorism are we talking about here? Are war crimes terrorism? Is all torture terrorism? I don't see an answers to those questions from you. If we don't decide on a defintion, ever war that America has ever been in can be included in this list. NYC is wondering if we should include the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasoki. Should we? If we should why? If not why shouldn't we?

<dd>I see I already linked to <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">Definition of terrorism</a>. I think what we are talking about are "allegations of terrorism." Cooking up our own definition, or voting on which definition we like best, would be original research. We should describe the allegation, and cite the source. As an encyclopedia, a tertiary source, that is what we do. We do not vote on a definition of 'planet', or 'bismuth'; We are just as unqualified to define terrorism. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 00:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What this article is</span></h2>
<p>Can we agree what this article is going to cover? Can we agree that, staying true to its title, it will cover allegations of state terrorism? I hope we do and if so, that means that non implemented things, or opinions that are clearly not applicable, should go. As an example I deleted the Yugoslav court case. It might not have been pretty, or necessary, for the Clinton admin to go into Yugo, but it was a military operation, not terrorism. Note to that the "court" took no action. This article should not degenerate into a list of accusations and opinions from anti-americans against anything the US has ever done, planned or even thought to have planned.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 00:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Operation Northwoods is a clear example of the United States military planning to execute state terrorism. Should we exclude mention of the foiled airliner bomb plot from Islamic terrorism because it was only "planned?"

<dd>Nope, I have left numerous parts. What I object to are the parts that are not covered by the subject of this article, namely, allegations of state terrorism. I have removed sections where nbo terrorism occured, or where there were only plans that were not implemented. What rationale is there for those sections?--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 01:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kalsemar, by your logic, the attacks against the WTC on 9/11 may also not be terrorism since it was a "military operation" by an international guerilla army trained in large part by the US in the 1980s in Afghanistan who were fighting, in their view, a defensive war against the US and its allies in the region.</p>
<p>Let's consider the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, like all members of NATO, including the US, are member states of the UN, and have signed the UN Charter and are therefore bound by it. The UN Charter provides only two exceptions to its ban on member states attacking fellow member states (the very reason the UN was established after WWII was to prevent war): 1. UN Sec Council authorized action, 2. A threat of imminent armed attack. Neither condition was met in bombing Yugo. No UN Sec. Council Res. It was not even alleged thatt Yugo was about to attack any NATO country or threatening to do so. So it seems that the NATO bombing was illegal. Was it a war? Did any NATO countries declare war? No. So if it's an illegal attack that includes the deliberate targeting of civilian targets (Belgrade bridges, radio stations, electricity plants etc.) why isn't it terrorism? Did I become "anti-American" by thinking these thoughts? --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 01:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nope, and the bombing of Yugo was imho totally unacceptable, <i>but</i>, it was not terrorism.

<dd>ok, you will get a simple answer. Look at the title of this article, it is <i>Allegations of state terrorism by USA</i>. So what should be here:</dd>
<dd><b>in:</b>
<ul>
<li>Acts that might be deemed state terrorism, Wounded Knee and Timothy McVeigh I could live with, one commited by the US one by a citizen, although I don't think the latter should be here but I can live with it.</li>
<li>The whole beggining of the article, definitions and such.</li>
<li>First part of the Cuba section.</li>
<li>Middle East section as they are allegations. Although the Baghdad bombing should be looked into as you stated.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>out:</b>
<ul>
<li>Plans, things that were not carried out. Why? Because it did not occur and like I said elsewhere, this is not about any and all plans ever concieved. Is this not reasonable?</li>
<li>Military action by national armies, thus Yugo bombing is out imho and so would the Iranian airline downing.</li>
<li>Things like the Baath party allegations. These are so obviuous I shouldn't have to explain why.</li>
<li>Acts commited by non government sanctioned ops. To answer an edit summary, no, if a Libyan <b>citizen' without <i>authorization commits an act of terror it isn't</i> by the USA</b>. 9/11 is terrorism because it wasn't a regulated national military op but it is not Saudi ST because they did not authorize it (as far as we know)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Iffy:</b>
<ul>
<li>Gladio, as stated in this article it was a NATO op. thus not <i>by USA'</i></li>

<p>There have been so many sections of this article deleted, I can't keep up.
