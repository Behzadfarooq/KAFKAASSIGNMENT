<p>I think the fact that there was a syndicated political column called "All in the Family" for thirty years is a significant bit of trivia for this page.

<p>This isn't an issue specific to All in the Family -it's applicable to all articles about TV shows on Wikipedia - but I don't know how to write about a last season's summer reruns in an article that mentions the last airdate. The truth of the matter is that CBS broadcast episodes of AiTF past April 1979 - they did so right on through the summer in reruns. So while I understand the change you made, Mike, it also isn't exactly true. But I don't know quite how to say it in the article - that the last original episode aired in April but reruns (i.e., CBS broadcasting the series) continued right up through the summer. Ideas? Because this is a common problem on all of these articles and it'd be great to come to some kind of consensus for the infoboxes, etc. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 06:18, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can always say "final original episode aired on April so and so 1979" and have it be true. I think it's a given that a show still airs reruns in the summer. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 03:18, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that most Americans realize that US shows air summer reruns (or did nearly universally until recently), but not all readers of Wikipedia will know this (for example, British readers from an entirely different system of TV airings). I clarified it in this case, but I still think it's something we need to be aware of in other TV articles. I don't have the answer. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 03:22, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please offer proof - which episode, season - Archie mentions they live in Astoria. I've read in several places that the neighborhood of Queens they lived in was never mentioned. There are references to Northern Boulevard, but also references to being somewhat close to Kennedy airport - in other words, amorphous locations in Queens. The house filmed in the opening credits isn't anywhere near <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astoria%2C_Queens_214e.html" title="Astoria, Queens">Astoria, Queens</a>. Moreover, Manhattan is referred to as being a fair remove from their neighborhood - a rather long subway trek - and that's not indicative of being in Astoria either. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 23:46, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>In the United States, television in the seventies was transformed by what became termed as "social consciousness" programming, spearheaded by television producer Norman Lear. All in the Family, his adaptation of the British television series Til Death Us Do Part, broke down television barriers. When the series premiered in 1971, Americans heard the words "fag," "nigger," and "spic" on national television programming for the first time. All in the Family was the talk of countless dinner tables throughout the country; Americans hadn't seen anything like it on television before. The show became the highest-rated program on US television schedules in the fall of 1971 and stayed in the top slot until 1976—to date, only one other series has tied All in the Family for such a long stretch at the top of the ratings.</i> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">(Talking is hot)</a> 05:19, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article does not say when Mike and Gloria moved out. I have seen the episode, of course, but I don't know what season it is. Since Edith's "departure" and the Jeffersons' departure are well-documented in the main article, it seems to be an omission for the Stivics' departure (and move next door and Joey's birth, both before it) not to be detailed. I am assuming, if incorrectly, that the Stivics left when the actors' five-year contracts expired, and they made guest appearances under other arrangements. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 21:32, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
