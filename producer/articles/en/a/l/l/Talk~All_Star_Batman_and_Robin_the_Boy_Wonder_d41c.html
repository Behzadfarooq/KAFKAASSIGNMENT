	    <p>I have to agree here, "All-Star Batman" is trying to be an Ulitmates version of Marvels' line under the same banner under the supposed camaflauge of telling early stories, Frank Millers' always been known to make contraversial moves with the Batman character, and is blatantly doing this to irritate fans (and judging from forum reactions over the 'net, this is the precise reaction he wanted as usual)</p>
<p>Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale are out in a date to the circus. All hell breaks loose was Richard John "Dick" Grayson parents are shoot/murdered by a gun man (Not by a sabotaging to their trapeze equipment) right before his eyes. Later Vicki Vale see sum cops take Dick to the woods to kill him, but he is saved by a Batman who holds up Dick and says "You've just been drafted. Into a war"</p>

<p>If you want to make a section for the opening story and list the artist/writers there then thats fine. But the AllStar line will switch creative team after 9-12 issues so to have Miller and Lee in the opening paragraph is inappropriate for the article.</p>
<p>On a side note I must restate my objection to calling Frank Miller a "former" Batman writer. Legendary would be acceptable, but people move around on titles on comics all the time. Calling him former is like saying he retired or something. He is working on another Batman book on the side, and has put many out over the years. Former is completely wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Legendary" would be completely inappropriate. This is an encyclopedia, not a fanpage. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 20:26, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not that I actually meant to add the word, but I would argue that based on the picture painted of how Frank Miller has impacted the Character of Batman in the Batman Article "Legendary" would not be fanboy at all. I don't think his name NEEDS to be mentioned on this page at all, my only point was that it should not be with the moniker "FORMER".--<a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxSerix_ac9f.html" title="User:AjaxSerix">AjaxSerix</a> 15:37, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Giving him the honorific "legendary" is utterly fannish. As is objecting to the fact the was described in terms of his past association with the character, to which he is returning only temporarily. When his run on this series is over, he'll be a "former Batman writer" again. Get over it. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 22:54, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are incorrect in your interpretation of "legendary." Given Miller's relationship with Batman and, as has been stated, his overall effect on how the character has been written for the last 20+ years, calling him a legend would be comepletely accurate, and appropriate for an encyclopedia. Not necessary in this article, perhaps, but Frank Miller is most certainly a legendary Batman writer.12.47.223.8 15:50, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, before anyone goes changing things, the current 2005 imprint DOES NOT have any hyphens (All Star NOT All-star).

But anyways, about balancing criticism with positive reactions... ive always believed its a sign of amateur writting here, not that theres anything wrong about it, but its always written in sucha bad way here, if you find some be my guest to place it in a proper way (instead of the usual <b>&lt;&lt;"bad criticism</b>" <i>however it could be argued that/some say that/this could be defended by stating</i> "<b>positive criticism</b>").

<p>Having read the article I think the issue of "fan reaction" is so one sided that it probably violates Wiki protocols. It is true that SOME fans are not happy with the book. But, even a causal search of message boards will reveal that just as many really like it. Putting aside sales, which is a significant indicator of its reception, the "fan reaction" is not all that accurate. Moreover, it siting message board postings as sources, this bit has really cherry picked what is out there. A far more accurate piece would discuss why fans do not, and why fans DO like the book. The impression this article gives is that All Star Batman is universally hated...which is demonstrably not true.--GrantLaFleche 01:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I reworded some of that "Fan Reaction" section (as far as I could make sense of it) but I would agree with the above user that message board postings aren't the most credible sources for citation. Are these reputable comic book reviewers or just random wwweb haters?</dd>

<dd>Having re-read everything, the fan reaction section just seems to be an unencyclopedic bashing of the comic book with some message board references thrown in. I know of at least one very positive and well-written review that went on at great length about how good the series is. But since this is an encyclopedia article, it's probably just as well to not provide a bunch of POV stuff. So I deleted the entire section again. If someone wants to write something a little fairer for the fan reaction section, that might be okay, but I think the article is just as good without it. <a href="../../../r/r/a/User%7ERray_9aaf.html" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> 00:17, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
