<i>All That Fall: A Play for Radio</i>, London: Faber and Faber, 1957</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i><b>All That Fall</b></i> is a one-act radio play by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Beckett_de21.html" title="Samuel Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a> produced following a request<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> from the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>. It was written in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_%28language%29.html" title="English (language)">English</a> and completed in September <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>. The autograph copy is titled <i><b>Lovely Day for the Races</b></i>. It was translated, by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Pinget_3abb.html" title="Robert Pinget">Robert Pinget</a>, as <i><b>Tous ceux qui tombent</b></i>.</p>
<p>When the germ of <i>All that Fall</i> came to him, Beckett wrote to a friend, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Cunard_40c9.html" title="Nancy Cunard">Nancy Cunard</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Never thought about radio play technique but in the dead of t’other night got a nice gruesome idea full of cartwheels and dragging of feet and puffing and panting which may or may not lead to something.”<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Although written quickly and with few redrafts, the subject matter was deeply personal causing him to sink into what he called “a whirl of <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depression</a>”<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> when he wrote to his US publisher <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Rosset_35a7.html" title="Barney Rosset">Barney Rosset</a> in August. In fact in September “he cancelled all his appointments in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> for a week simply because he felt wholly incapable of facing people”<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and worked on the script until its completion.</p>
<p>It was first broadcast on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Third_Programme_84b9.html" title="BBC Third Programme">BBC Third Programme</a>, 13th January <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> featuring Mary O'Farrell as Maddy Rooney with <a href="../../../j/2E/g/J.G._Devlin_ff66.html" title="J.G.

Soon-to-be Beckett regulars, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Magee_%28actor%29_f292.html" title="Patrick Magee (actor)">Patrick Magee</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_MacGowran_94d8.html" title="Jack MacGowran">Jack MacGowran</a> also had small parts.

<p>This is the first work by Beckett where a woman is the central character. In this case it is a gritty, “overwhelmingly <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/capacious" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/capacious" rel="nofollow">capacious</a>”,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> outspoken, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a> <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/septuagenarian" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/septuagenarian" rel="nofollow">septuagenarian</a>, Maddy Rooney, plagued by “<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheumatism.html" title="Rheumatism">rheumatism</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childless.html" title="Childless">childlessness</a>”.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> “Beckett emphasized to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billie_Whitelaw_d5b5.html" title="Billie Whitelaw">Billie Whitelaw</a> that Maddy had an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish</a> <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accent_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Accent (linguistics)">accent</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>‘I said, “Like yours,” and he said, “No, no, no, an Irish accent.” I realized he didn't know he had an Irish accent, and that was the music he heard in his head.’”<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The opening scene finds Maddy trudging down a country road towards the station, renamed “Boghill”<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> in the play. It’s her husband’s birthday. She’s already given him a tie but decides to surprise him by meeting him off the 12:30 train. It is a fine June morning, a Saturday since her husband is leaving his office at noon rather than five. In the distance the sounds of <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a> animals are heard.</p>
<p>She moves with difficulty. She hears <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_music.html" title="Chamber music">chamber music</a> coming from an old house, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schubert_d1e2.html" title="Franz Schubert">Schubert’s</a> “<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_and_the_Maiden_Quartet_%28Schubert%29_9221.html" title="Death and the Maiden Quartet (Schubert)">Death and the Maiden</a>”.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> She stops, listens to the recording and even murmurs along with it before proceeding.</p>
<p>Her first of three encounters with men is with the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manure.html#Uses_of_manure" title="Manure">dung</a> carrier, Christy, who tries to sell her a “small load of … stydung”.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> She tells him she will consult her husband. The man’s cart is being pulled by a “<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/clegg" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/clegg" rel="nofollow">cleg</a>-tormented” <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hinny" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hinny" rel="nofollow">hinny</a> who shows some reluctance to move on and needs to be whipped. As she heads off Maddy’s thoughts return to “Minnie! Little Minnie!”<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The smell of <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laburnum.html" title="Laburnum">laburnum</a><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> distracts her. Suddenly old Mr Tyler is upon her ringing his cycle bell. Whilst relating how his daughter’s operation has rendered her unable to bear children, they are almost knocked down by Connolly’s van, which covers them “white with dust from head to foot”.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> Maddy again bemoans the loss of Minnie but refuses to be comforted by Tyler who rides off despite realising that his rear tyre is flat.</p>
<p>Lastly an “old admirer”,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Mr Slocum, a racecourse clerk, pulls up in his “limousine”<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> to offer her a ride. She is too fat and awkward to climb in alone so Slocum pushes her in from behind and in doing so her frock gets caught in the door. He tries to start the car but it has died. After applying the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choke_valve.html#Automotive" title="Choke valve">choke</a> he does manage to get going and, no sooner having done so, runs over and kills a hen, which Maddy feels the need to <a href="../../../e/u/l/Eulogy.html" title="Eulogy">eulogise</a>.</p>
<p>At each stage of the journey the technology she encounters advances, but despite this each means of locomotion is beset by problems, foreshadowing the problem with the train: she finds walking difficult and is forced to sit down, Christy needs to whip his hinny to make her go, Tyler’s tire goes flat, and Slocum’s engine dies. All the relatives mentioned in this section are female and all the modes of transport are also referred to as females.</p>
<p><a name="The_station" id="The_station"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_That_Fall_ae7b.html" title="Edit section: The station">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The station</span></h3>
<p>At the station Slocum calls on the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porter_%28railroad%29.html" title="Porter (railroad)">porter</a>, Tommy, for assistance to extricate his passenger, after which he drives away, “crucifying his gearbox.”<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Beckett told Billie Whitelaw that Maddy “is in a state of abortive explosiveness”.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> This becomes apparent when she considers herself ignored. To the boy Tommy she says abrasively: “Don’t mind me. Don’t take any notice of me. I do not exist. The fact is well known.”<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> As Ruby Cohn quips, “she endures volubly.”<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The stationmaster, Mr Barrell, asks after Mrs Rooney’s health. She confesses that she should really still be in bed. We hear of the demise of Mr Barrell’s father, who passed away shortly after retiring, a tale that reminds Maddy again of her own woes. She notes that the weather has taken a change the worse; the wind is picking up and rain is due.</p>
<p>Miss Fitt approaches so immersed in humming a <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymn</a> she doesn’t see Maddy at first. Miss Fitt, as her name indicates, is a self-righteous misfit. After some discussion she condescends to help the old woman up the stairs to the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_platform.html" title="Railway platform">platform</a>, primarily because “it is the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> thing to do.”<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unusually the train is late. The noise of the station builds to a <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamics_%28music%29.html" title="Dynamics (music)">crescendo</a> but it is an anticlimax; it is the oft-mentioned up mail. Dan’s train comes in moments afterwards. Maddy panics. She can’t find her husband because he has been led to the <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">gents</a> by Jerry,<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> the boy who normally helps him to the taxi. It’s only at this point in the drama we learn that her husband is <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindness.html" title="Blindness">blind</a>. Tightfisted Dan chides her for not cancelling Jerry but still pays his <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_one_penny_coin_%28pre-decimal%29.html" title="British one penny coin (pre-decimal)">penny</a> fee. He refuses however to discuss the reason for the train’s lateness. Not without some difficulty – her husband is also not a well man – they descend the stairs and begin the trek home.</p>
<p>On her journey to the station Maddy only had to compete with one person at a time, each an old man. Now she is faced with a crowd. Rather than the flat open countryside she has to contend with a mountainous climb; she refers to the stairs as a “<a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff.html" title="Cliff">cliff</a>”, her husband calls them a “precipice” and Miss Fitt compares them to the “<a href="../../../m/a/t/Matterhorn.html" title="Matterhorn">Matterhorn</a>”, a mountain that for years inspired fear in climbers. Also, the means of transport that are mentioned here, the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Titanic_9d7a.html" title="RMS Titanic">Titanic</a>, the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Lusitania_c1dd.html" title="RMS Lusitania">Lusitania</a> and the train due are modes of mass transport and the level of danger shifts from the inconvenient to the potentially lethal. All the relatives mentioned in this section are now male.</p>
<p><a name="The_walk_home" id="The_walk_home"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_That_Fall_ae7b.html" title="Edit section: The walk home">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The walk home</span></h3>
<p>The weather is worsening. The thought of getting home spurs them on. Dan imagines sitting by the fire in his dressing gown with his wife reading aloud from <i><a href="../../../e/f/f/Effi_Briest_3c77.html" title="Effi Briest">Effi Briest</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> The Lynch twins jeer at them from a distance. Dan shakes his stick and chases them off. Previously they have pelted the old couple with mud. “Did you ever wish to kill a child?”<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> Dan asks her then admits to having to resist the impulse within himself. This makes his comment shortly after about being alone in his compartment – “I made no attempt to restrain myself.”<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> – all the more suspicious. This also focuses attention on his remarks about the pros and cons of retirement: one of the negatives he brings up has to do with enduring their neighbour’s children.</p>
<p>Dan is as <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/laconic" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/laconic" rel="nofollow">laconic</a> as Maddy is <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/loquacious" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/loquacious" rel="nofollow">loquacious</a>. His refusal to explain why the train was delayed forces her to pester him with questions which he does his best to avoid answering. He prevaricates and digresses, anything to throw her off track (<a href="../../../p/u/n/Pun.html" title="Pun">pun</a> intended). Eventually he maintains that he honestly has no clue what the cause was. Being blind and on his own he had simply assumed the train had stopped at a station.</p>
<p>Something Dan says reminds Maddy of a visit she once made to hear “a lecture by one of these new mind doctors.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> What she heard there was the story of a patient the doctor had failed to cure, a young girl who was dying, and “did in fact die, shortly after he had washed his hands of her.”<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> The reason the doctor gave for the girl’s death, as if the revelation had just come to him there and then, was: “The trouble with her was that she had never really been born!”<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>As they near the house Maddy passed earlier, Schubert’s music is still playing. Dan starts to cry. To stop her asking questions he asks about the text of Sunday’s <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon.html" title="Sermon">sermon</a>. “The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down,”<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> she tells him, and then they both burst out laughing. Mr Slocum and Miss Fitt had both passed comment on Maddy’s bent posture. Perhaps, this is partly why they laugh: it is the best reaction to a life of unending misery in a world devoid of any God. In <i><a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Days_%28play%29_3e55.html" title="Happy Days (play)">Happy Days</a></i>, Winnie asks “How can one better magnify the Almighty than by sniggering with him at his little jokes, particularly the poorer ones”.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> It is worthy of mention too that “it is Mr Tyler, rather than the Lord, who saved the preacher’s life when they were climbing together”.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> It would be fair to assume that Maddy doesn’t really believe in a god anymore. When she says, “We are alone. There is no one to ask.” She is certainly not talking about there being no one to ask about her husband’s age.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jerry catches them up to return something Mr Rooney has dropped. Learning that it is some kind of ball he demands the boy hand it to him. When pressed by his wife all he will say is that: “It is a thing I carry about with me,”<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup> and becomes angry when pressed on the subject. They have no small change so promise to give Jerry a penny on Monday to compensate him for his trouble.</p>
<p>Just as the boy starts back Maddy calls him to see if he has learned what delayed the train. He has. Dan doesn’t want to know – “Leave the boy alone, he knows nothing! Come on!”<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup> – but his wife insists. Jerry tells her that it was a child at which point her husband groans. When pushed for details the boy goes on: “It was a little child fell out of the carriage, Ma’am … Onto the line, Ma’am … Under the wheels, Ma’am.”<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup> We assume the child is a girl – all the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreshadowing.html" title="Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> in the play has been pointing to that – but, crucially, Beckett never actually says. (See his comment to <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Boyle_1325.html" title="Kay Boyle">Kay Boyle</a> below however).</p>
<p>With that Jerry exits. We hear his steps die away and the couple head off in silence. Maddy must realise the death happened while she was making her way to the station but she is – for once – speechless. All we are left with is the wind and the rain and to wonder what, if anything, Mr Rooney actually had to do with the death of the child.</p>
<p>The third section of the play returns Maddy to the relative calm of the walk home. They encounter a further three people only this time they are all children. The laburnum also serves as an important <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/benchmark" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/benchmark" rel="nofollow">benchmark</a>.

[Later I asked him the same question.] And he looked down and said, ‘Well, a number of weaknesses’. [I asked:] ‘Do you mean the production?’ He said, ‘No, no, no.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> Kay Boyle asked Beckett if, at the end of <i>Happy Days</i>, Willie is reaching for the gun, or for his wife. Beckett replied:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“The question as to which Willie is ‘after’ – Winnie or the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a> – is like the question in <i>All That Fall</i> as to whether Mr Rooney threw the little girl<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup> out of the railway-carriage or not.

“<i>All That Fall</i> manages to develop a highly dynamic <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a> in radio drama through a multi-layered script, which can be read as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragicomedy.html" title="Tragicomedy">tragicomedy</a> , a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_fiction.html" title="Crime fiction">murder mystery</a>,<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> a cryptic literary <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riddle.html" title="Riddle">riddle</a> or a quasi-musical score.”<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s said that, death is no joking matter. The thing is, with Beckett it is and this play is crammed full of references to it. The play’s setting is realistic enough and the characters too, if a little <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grotesque.html#In_literature" title="Grotesque">grotesque</a>, but hardly anyone’s life has not rubbed shoulders with Death, from the unfortunate hen mowed down by Slocum’s car to the poor child thrown from the train.

<ol>
<li>Schubert’s <i>Death and the Maiden</i> is heard at the start and near the end of the drama, setting the theme from the outset.</li>
<li>All parts of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laburnum.html" title="Laburnum">laburnum</a> are poisonous; “children should be warned never to touch the black seeds contained within the pods as they contain an <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkaloid.html" title="Alkaloid">alkaloid</a> <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison.html" title="Poison">poison</a>.”<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup></li>
<li>Maddy’s daughter, Minnie, appears to have died as a child. <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivian_Mercier_f3c2.html" title="Vivian Mercier">Vivian Mercier</a> goes so far as to suppose that the child may only ever have existed in Maddy’s imagination<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup> a view supported by Rosemary Pountney.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup></li>
<li>Maddy tells Tyler: “It is suicide to be abroad.”<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> The pun is often commented on (i.e. a broad). The alternative would be to remain <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fœtus</a>-like in the <a href="../../../u/t/e/Uterus.html" title="Uterus">womb</a> of the home. “The <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topography.html" title="Topography">topography</a> in <i>All That Fall</i> is distinctly hostile to the females – human or animal – who try to walk through it. Maddy’s comment ‘It is suicide to be a broad’ suggests that her death will be her own fault, namely the fault of being born a woman.”<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup></li>
<li>When she arrives at the station Maddy describes herself in such a way as to conjure up the image of a corpse being <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shroud.html" title="Shroud">shrouded</a> for burial.</li>
<li>She recalls the lecture where the doctor spoke about a young girl who died.</li>

<li>Jerry returns “a kind of ball”<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[64]</a></sup> to Mr Rooney. Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant motif of <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grief.html#Childhood_bereavement" title="Grief">childhood grief</a> for Beckett.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[65]</a></sup></li>
<li>Miss Fitt believes she not really of this world and left to herself “would soon be flown … home.”<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup> “I suppose the truth is, “she tells Mrs Rooney, “I am not there … just not really there at all.”<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup> (See <i><a href="../../../f/o/o/Footfalls.html#Part_IV" title="Footfalls">Footfalls</a></i>).</li>

<li>The sinking of the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Lusitania_c1dd.html#_Sinking" title="RMS Lusitania">Lusitania</a> is mentioned; 1,198 people died with her, including almost a hundred children.</li>
<li>Tyler thinks that Miss Fitt has lost her mother (as in death) but it turns out that she simply cannot find her because the train is late; thus, since the mother is bringing fresh <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sole_%28fish%29.html" title="Sole (fish)">sole</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>), there is still hope that the mother is not lost.</li>

<li>He refers to his time at work as being “buried alive … not even <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_certificate.html" title="Death certificate">certified death</a> can ever take the place of that”.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup> Dan’s workplace is at the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminal_station.html" title="Terminal station">terminus</a>, the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_the_Line_%28disambiguation%29_94e6.html" title="End of the Line (disambiguation)">end of the line</a> (pun intended), and, with its “‘rest-couch and velvet hangings’, the office seems womblike, but a “wombtomb”,<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup> a womb after life rather than before.”<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[71]</a></sup></li>
<li>Dan thinks he can smell a dead dog in a ditch but is told its only rotting leaves despite the fact that it’s only <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">Summer</a>.</li>
<li>He also alludes to Matthew 10:29 about the death of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparrow.html" title="Sparrow">sparrows</a>.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[72]</a></sup></li>
<li>The play ends, of course, with the revelation that the train was late due to the death of a young child under its wheels.</li>
<li>At one point Maddy – who thinks she is still talking to the stationmaster – says: “Then at evening the clouds will part, the setting sun will shine an instant, then sink, behind the hills.”<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[73]</a></sup> This phrase evokes the famous description of the birth astride a grave from <i><a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiting_for_Godot_fef6.html" title="Waiting for Godot">Waiting for Godot</a></i> reminding us that the best of life only lasts an instant before darkness consumes it once more. Beckett emphasis this in <i>All That Fall</i> by making all the characters either young or old, focusing on the beginnings and end of life; the rest is of little consequence.</li>
<li>Another Beckettian <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leitmotif.html" title="Leitmotif">leitmotif</a> is underlined by a seemingly innocuous remark made by Maddy when other characters take control of the conversation for a moment: “Do not imagine, because I am silent, that I am not present.”<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[74]</a></sup> In radio a character only ‘exists’ for as long as we can hear him or her. This reminds us of the many Beckett characters that feel compelled to keep taking to prove they exist.</li>

<li>Tyler and Maddy flirt. Tyler, who had pumped his tire firm before departing, now finds his rear tire flat. He cycles off riding on the rim.

<li>Maddy tries to get Dan to kiss her at the station but he refuses. Later she asks him to put his arm around her. She says that it will be like old times.

<p>This is not the only ‘birth’ in the play.

<p>A remark made by Professor Harry White about Beckett’s later dramatic work gives an idea of the demands made upon the listener in this and his subsequent radio work:</p>

<p>Since the journey of the main character is presented psychologically, Beckett asked for natural sounds to be adapted in unnatural ways. “New methods,” <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Esslin_c932.html" title="Martin Esslin">Martin Esslin</a> writes, “had to be found to extract the various sounds needed (both animal and mechanical – footsteps, cars, bicycle wheels, the train, the cart) from the simple naturalism of the hundreds of records in the BBC’s effects library. <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Briscoe_dbc5.html" title="Desmond Briscoe">Desmond Briscoe</a> [sound technician] (and his gramophone operator, Norman Baines) had to invent ways and means to remove these sounds from the purely realistic sphere. They did so by treating them electronically: slowing down, speeding up, adding echo, fragmenting them by cutting them into segments, and putting them together in new way.”<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[95]</a></sup> Actors produced the sounds of all the animals but “Beckett was actually unimpressed by the use of human voices for the rural sounds when he listened into the … broadcast.”<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>"These experiments, and the discoveries made as they evolved, led directly to the establishment of the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop_e92b.html" title="BBC Radiophonic Workshop">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>. Beckett and <i>All That Fall</i> thus directly contributed to one of the most important technical advances in the art of radio (and the technique, and indeed technology, of radio in Britain)."<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>

<p>Beckett conceived <i>All That Fall</i> as a radio play. To Beckett’s mind it was unthinkable to transfer it to another medium and yet it was done, and in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Beckett admonished Barney Rossett, on 27th August <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, saying of <i>All That Fall</i>: "It is no more theatre than <i><a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame_%28play%29.html" title="Endgame (play)">Endgame</a></i> is radio and to 'act' it is to kill it. Even the reduced visual dimension it will receive from the simplest and most static of readings ... will be destructive of whatever quality it may have and which depends on the whole thing's <i>coming out of the dark</i>.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[98]</a></sup> And yet despite this fact “Beckett authorised a French TV version adapted by Robert Pinget, shown on <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiodiffusion-T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision_Fran%C3%A7aise_7f45.html" title="Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française">RTF</a> on 25th January <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>.

<p>“When … <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingmar_Bergman_5cc0.html" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, asked if he could stage both radio plays, <i>All That Fall</i> and <i><a href="../../../e/m/b/Embers.html" title="Embers">Embers</a></i>, the answer was a firm ‘No’,”<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[100]</a></sup>The same went, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, when Sir <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Olivier_615b.html" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and his wife visited him to persuade him to allow them to produce a version at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_National_Theatre_9aec.html" title="Royal National Theatre">National Theatre</a>. “They had refused to accept his written refusals and made the trip … anyway. There he greeted them with politeness and offered limited hospitality, but remained steadfast in his decision.”<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>“[S]ince his death [Beckett’s] Estate has assiduously followed his wishes. Permission is granted only for faithful radio productions or for staged readings in which producers agree to limit the action to actors speaking the lines and walking to and from chairs. The director John Sowle, in his [1997] staging of <i>All That Fall</i> … cleverly identified a loophole in the rules: since the play requires many elaborate and self-consciously artificial sound-effects, the production of those effects can become a spectacle in its own right. On stage at the Cherry Lane are a <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind_machine.html" title="Wind machine">wind machine</a>, gravel-trays, bells, coconuts, a stationary bike and much more. Furthermore, the actors, who read in front of old-fashioned mikes, dressed in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> clothes, never acknowledge the audience, even at the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtain_call.html" title="Curtain call">curtain call</a>.
