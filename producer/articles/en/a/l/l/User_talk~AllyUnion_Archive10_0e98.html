<p>Hi there! I'm sure the templates in question are harmless, but I believe there are more generic templates that would do the job. Templates for <i>"Leap year starting on tuesday"</i> or <i>"30-day month starting on friday"</i> (with parametrization for which month and year it is) have the advantage of being reusable for each and every year in the Gregorian calendar, obviating the need for hundreds of templates for each individual month and year therein. IMHO, of course, and I'd be happy to discuss it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:17, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, a quadruple nested template is very wrong. However, wouldn't it be easy to make {{YearStartingMonday|1950}} and {{MonthStartingTuesday|1988|august}} or something like that? Neither requires nesting. Usage is simple once you know how, and could easily be explained on the talk page. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:58, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you feel that the template is likely to be vandalized, the obvious solution is to protect it, that's what protect is for. Note that having a (small group of) generic templates would allow for easier changes to the lot of them if such is ever found useful by WikiLayout. I know that <i>space</i> on WikiPedia isn't really an issue, but <i>organization</i> of information is important. And that includes centralizing partial redundancies. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:58, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would be happy to look at your bot code. But some caveats, I don't use the pywikipediabot framework, I don't even know much about it. Also, I haven't programmed in PERL in a <b>LONG</b> time. I have written my own framework in C# and all of my bots use that.</p>
<p>If you could be a bit more specific about your problem, is it just not posting the data back to the server after retrieving it? Which of these three steps (or all of them) are causing you trouble?</p>

<li>Leave three blocks of "...that" on <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">Template talk:Did you know</a></li>

<p>I looked over your code, and I'm sorry, I don't think I'm going to be able to help you. I just don't know enough about Perl.

<dd>I'm glad to hear that you got it working. It's like that so often eh, step back for a while and it all comes crystal clear.

<p>In November 2003, there was a VfD debate over <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_6fd2.html" title="Sunset High School (Portland)">Sunset High School (Portland)</a>. The debate was archived under <a href="../../../s/u/n/Talk%7ESunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_65ea.html" title="Talk:Sunset High School (Portland)">Talk:Sunset High School (Portland)</a>. What to do with the article is still being contested and has been recently re-nominated for VfD at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_1a08.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sunset High School (Portland)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sunset High School (Portland)</a>.</p>
<p>I am writing to you because you have participated in such debates before. There still does not exist a wikipedia policy (as far as i can tell) over what to do in regards to articles about specific U.S. public school.

<p>I did a quick pass and it looks like the bot edits are okay, but I'll have to have a closer look to be sure. I did comment out a possible copyvio, which was included in the archiving.

<ul>
<li>How come there's items on Recent additions that haven't been removed from the list on the talk page? Wouldn't they be included again with the next use of the bot?

<dd>Ah. The unfortunate side effect of processing a page. The time that it takes for Sandbot to get a page and process it has a lag time of about a minute or so. Therefore, when it attempts to re-enforce the existing header, the page in its cache is stale. I'm thinking a way to revert that. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 23:05, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, thanks for your response. I don't know too much about bots, but why would it take a minute?

<dd>Ah... I found the problem... The lag time is due to the fact that it gets two pages in a row. I moved it, so that it will attempt to process and post immediately.

<p>Hi there! On <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Restructuring_2e83.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Restructuring">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Restructuring</a>, the suggestion was made to split CfD into one page per day, and transclude these into the main page (just like is done on VfD, except that VfD goes one step further and also uses sub-pages for each individual nomination). This suggestion seems to have met consensus. Since (iirc) you wrote the VfD-bot, could you please do something similar for CfD?</p>
<p>This bot should (daily) create a new page Categories for deletion/Log/-date-, redirect Categories for deletion/Log/Today to the most recent one, and add a transclusion on the <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> main page (and if possible an 'add new section to /today/' link).</p>
<p>As a side point, would you consider having your bot create a WP:VFD/Log/Yesterday link every day? (and ditto for CFD) I would think it useful since the 'today' page gets new nominations all the time, and the 'yesterday' page would be stable and votable.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Is there a particular format of the new day pages? Just the date or what? Do you want the bot to close each day as well on CfD? I'll do something similiar, but you'll have to be more specific to your request. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 10:02, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wow that was quick&#160;;) - the format can be very simply, see <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> for an example, but basically it's just a level-1 header with the date. A hidden tag stating to add new nominations to the top would be nice (for some reason new votes are added to the top rather than the bottom on CfD; similarly the CfD main page has newer dates on top). It would be nice if the bot also closed each day when a new day starts. The process should mimic VfD's as much as possible, for consistency's sake. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:07, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You caught me when I was editing. Any HTML comments? And do you have a cute name for the bot? (I prefer to run separate accounts for bots if they are active only in a specific area. That way, the contributions list is much cleaner for someone to look at what the bot is doing... rather than looking at a mess of tasks on one single bot.) -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 10:11, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Not sure what you mean with HTML comments. I could think of lots of cute names&#160;:), but for clarity's sake something like CfDaemon would be best, I guess. Separate accounts are a good idea.
<dl>
<dd>An HTML comment is something between <b>&lt;!--</b> and <b>--&gt;</b>.

<li>Okay.

VfD links to 'WP:VFD/pagename' but might also provide a link to 'WP:VFD/Log/Today' (maybe even opening that page in edit mode).

<p>This isn't exactly related to archiving, but it seems like it would be a simple, but useful thing to implement. I've found that several articles on people are located at the page with their middle initial, instead of the full name, but there is no redirect page for the full name. It would be nice to have all of these redirect pages created, making it a lot easier to find people's names for linking. The pseudocode might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all pages with a name in the format of [[* %. *]], where <i>%</i> would be any letter in the alphabet, and each * would be the first and last name, of any length. Remove from this list any pages that are redirects or disambigs (could determine disambiguation by seeing if it contains {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}} and/or if it links to at least one other page with a name of the format [[* *]] or [[* $ *]], where the first and last * are the first and last names, and the $ is a word longer than 1 character that has the same first letter as the middle initial.</li>
<li>Go to each of the pages, and for each, save the first name and last name, and look in the article for the middle name (the word between the first and last name which begins with the same letter as %). Then you can make the url for the page where the redirect should be.</li>
<li>Check to see if the page exists, and if it doesn't, make it a redirect to the previous page.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this should be it. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"></font></a> 03:21, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
