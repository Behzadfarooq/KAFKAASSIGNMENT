<p>The term <b>allelopathy</b> denotes the production of specific biomolecules by one plant that can harm, or give benefit to, another plant. However, it is most commonly used in the former sense - an interaction in which one plant causes suffering to another plant.</p>
<p>Conceptually, biomolecules (specifically termed <i>allelochemicals</i>) produced by a plant are released into the environment and subsequently influence the growth and development of neighbouring plants. It is important to keep in mind that allelopathy involves the addition of a chemical compound or compounds (secondary metabolites) into the environment, while resource competition involves the removal or reduction of some factor or factors in the environment (such as nutrients, water, or light).</p>
<p>Although allelopathic science is a relatively new field of study, there exists convincing evidence that allelopathic interactions between plants play a crucial role in both natural and manipulated ecosystems. These interactions are undoubtedly an important factor in determining <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a> distribution and abundance within some plant <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biocoenosis.html" title="Biocoenosis">communities</a>. Allelopathic interactions are also thought to be an important factor in the success of many <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasive_plants.html" title="Invasive plants">invasive plants</a>. For specific examples, see Spotted Knapweed, Garlic Mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>), and <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyperus_rotundus.html" title="Cyperus rotundus">Nutsedge</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allelopathy.html" title="Edit section: Mechanisms of action">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mechanisms of action</span></h2>
<p>There are hundreds of secondary <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metabolite.html" title="Metabolite">metabolites</a> in the plant kingdom, and many are known to be <i><b>phytotoxic</b></i> (Einhellig, 2002). Allelopathic effects of these compounds are often observed to occur early in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_life_cycle.html" title="Biological life cycle">life cycle</a>, causing inhibition of <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seed.html" title="Seed">seed</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germination.html" title="Germination">germination</a> and/or seedling growth. The compounds exhibit a wide range of mechanisms of action, from affects on <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkaloid.html" title="Alkaloid">alkaloids</a>), <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthesis.html" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitochondria.html" title="Mitochondria">mitochondrial</a> function (quinones), phytohormone activity, <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion.html" title="Ion">ion</a> uptake, and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> balance (<i>phenolics</i>). Interpretations of mechanisms of action are complicated by the fact that individual compounds can have multiple phytotoxic effects (Einhellig, 2002).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allelopathy.html" title="Edit section: Demonstrating allelopathy in nature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Demonstrating allelopathy in nature</span></h3>
<p>The vast majority of allelopathy research attempts to focus on direct negative plant-plant interactions caused by <i>allelochemicals</i>. One of the greatest challenges of this approach is showing that the effect is direct, since allelochemicals can have indirect effects on plant species through interaction with biotic (e.g. <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycorrhizae.html" title="Mycorrhizae">mycorrhizae</a>) and/or abiotic <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a> factors (e.g. <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrient.html" title="Nutrient">nutrient</a> availability; anon., 2002). In terrestrial systems, the soil plays an important role as the matrix through which potential allelochemicals pass. Both abiotic and microbial decomposition will have significant effects on the concentration of allelochemicals reaching other plants.</p>
<p>Proving that allelopathy is occurring is difficult for the reason that it is difficult to separate the effects of allelopathy from those due to resource competition (e.g., for space, light, water, nutrients or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a>). Controlled <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse.html" title="Greenhouse">greenhouse</a> studies that allow for examination of a single independently varying factor may be of little interest since the factors do not vary independently in nature. Willis (1985) required that six criteria be met, and even when maximally relaxed to just three, proving allelopathy is rarely if ever accomplished (Blum et al., 1999).</p>

<p>Allelopathy also interacts with plant stress, because stressed source plants often release a greater array and concentration of allelochemicals, and stressed target plants may be more susceptible to allelochemicals (Reigosa et al., 2002). Measurement of the effects of allelochemicals along stressor gradients should help to elucidate the relationship between allelopathy and stress.</p>

<p>One of the most studied aspects of allelopathy is the role of allelopathy in agriculture. Current research is focused on the effects of weeds on crops, crops on weeds (Pheng et al. 1999), and crops on crops. This research furthers the possibility of using allelochemicals as growth regulators and natural pesticides (a number of them are either commercially available or in the process of large-scale manufacture) to promote sustainable agriculture. Leptospermone is a purported allelochemical in lemon bottlebrush (Callistemon citrinus). It was investigated as a possible commercial herbicide but was found to be too weak. However, a chemical analog of leptospermone was found to be an effective herbicide. The analog is mesotrione, tradename Callisto.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is sold to control broadleaf weeds in corn but also seems to be an effective control for crabgrass in lawns.</p>
<p>One of the most famous cases of purported allelopathy is in <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">desert</a> <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrub.html" title="Shrub">shrubs</a>. <i><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvia_leucophylla.html" title="Salvia leucophylla">Salvia leucophylla</a></i> was one of the most widely known early examples because it was on the cover of the journal <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i> in 1964<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Bare zones around the shrubs were hypothesized to be caused by volatile terpenes emitted by the shrubs. However, like many allelopathy studies, it was based on artificial lab experiments and unwarranted extrapolations to natural ecosystems. In 1970, <i>Science</i> published a study where caging the shrubs to exclude rodents and birds allowed grass to grow in the bare zones.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> A detailed history of this interesting story can be found in Halsey 2004.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In other studies allelopathy has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in forests, influencing the composition of the vegetation growth, while also providing an explanation for the patterns of forest regeneration. The <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_walnut.html" title="Black walnut">black walnut</a> <i>(Juglans nigra)</i> produces <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juglone.html" title="Juglone">juglone</a>, an allelopathic substance that interferes with the growth of other plants. Juglone is somewhat selective, with certain species greatly affected by it and others not affected at all. <i><a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucalyptus.html" title="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a></i> leaf litter and root exudates are allelopathic for certain soil microbes and plant species. The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree_of_heaven.html" title="Tree of heaven">tree of heaven</a>, <i>(Ailanthus altissima)</i> produces allelopathic substances in its roots that inhibit the growth of many plants. Furthermore, the trends of evaluating allelochemicals release from higher plants in natures are much concentrated and showed a promising results of field screening.Khanh and Xuan <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garlic_mustard.html" title="Garlic mustard">Garlic mustard</a> is an invasive plant in North American temperate forests. Its success may be partly due to its excretion of a not yet identified allelochemical that interferes with <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualism.html" title="Mutualism">mutualisms</a> between native tree roots and their <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycorrhizal_fungi.html" title="Mycorrhizal fungi">mycorrhizal fungi</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>A study of kochia (Kochia scoparia) in North Toole County (NTC), Montana by two high school students showed that when kochia precedes spring wheat (<a href="../../../t/r/i/Triticum_aestivum.html" title="Triticum aestivum">Triticum aestivum</a>), it reduces the spring wheat's performance. Among these effects are delayed emergence, decreased rate of growth, decreased final height, and decreased average vegetative dry weight of spring wheat plants. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> This small study was followed by another which further showed that kochia does seem to exhibit allelopathic effects on various crops grown in northern Montana. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> For their work in the area Overcast &amp; Cox were awards a first place team prize at the International Science and Engineering Fair <a href="../../../i/s/e/ISEF_3564.html" title="ISEF">ISEF</a> in 2001.</p>
