<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="Edit section: Premise">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Premise</span></h2>
<p>Archie Bunker (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carroll_O%27Connor_17a7.html" title="Carroll O'Connor">Carroll O'Connor</a>) is portrayed as a working-class, very outspoken bigot, prejudiced against everyone and everything not in agreement with his narrow-minded, very <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> view of the world. His ignorance and stubbornness tend to cause his <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaprop.html" title="Malaprop">malaprop</a>-filled arguments to self-destruct. He often responds to uncomfortable truths by <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowing_a_raspberry.html" title="Blowing a raspberry">blowing a raspberry</a>. He longs for simpler times, when people sharing his viewpoint were in charge, as evinced by the nostalgic theme song, "Those Were the Days."</p>
<p>By contrast, his wife Edith (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Stapleton_98c0.html" title="Jean Stapleton">Jean Stapleton</a>) is a sweet, understanding, if somewhat intellectually limited woman. She usually defers to her always-opinionated husband, but on the rare occasions when she takes a stand, she proves to be one of the wisest characters in the series. Archie often tells her to "stifle [herself]" and calls her a "dingbat", but despite their very different personalities, they love each other deeply.</p>
<p>They have one child, Gloria (<a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Struthers_9e36.html" title="Sally Struthers">Sally Struthers</a>), who is married to perennial college student Michael Stivic (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Reiner_ca62.html" title="Rob Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>). Michael is an archetypal <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>-style liberal. He and Archie constantly clash over politics and social issues, as well as the fact that Michael doesn't hold down a job and support his wife. For much of the series, the Stivics live in the Bunker home to save money, providing even more opportunity for the two men to irritate each other. Archie frequently calls his son-in-law "meathead" and "<a href="../../../p/o/l/Polack.html" title="Polack">Polack</a>" (since Michael is of Polish descent).</p>
<p>The show is set in the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astoria%2C_Queens_214e.html" title="Astoria, Queens">Astoria</a> section of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a>, one of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>'s five boroughs.</p>

<li><b><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carroll_O%27Connor_17a7.html" title="Carroll O'Connor">Carroll O'Connor</a></b> as <b><a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Bunker_d610.html" title="Archie Bunker">Archie Bunker</a></b>, frequently called a "lovable bigot," an assertively prejudiced blue-collar worker. Former child actor <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Rooney_7dbd.html" title="Mickey Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a> was Lear's choice to play Archie, but Rooney declined the offer due to the strong potential for controversy and, in Rooney's opinion, poor chance for success. O'Connor enthusiastically sought the part, even though he agreed with Rooney's assessment. O'Connor was living in Italy at the time, and made his acceptance contingent on Lear's covering his airfare back to Italy if the show failed. At the end of the 1973-74 season, O'Connor attempted to renegotiate his contract. When he and producers reached a stalemate, he went on strike. To work around his absence, the writers devised a three-part episode in which Archie disappears on his way to a convention (O'Connor only appears for less than a minute, at the very end of the third part). Had O'Connor not returned to work by the time taping began on the third part, the writers had reportedly planned to kill the character off. Ironically, O'Connor, the actor who fought the most with Lear, was the last one to leave the series.</li>

Stapleton remained with the show all through the original series run, but decided to leave before the first season of <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Bunker%27s_Place_ac3d.html" title="Archie Bunker's Place">Archie Bunker's Place</a></i> had wrapped up. At that point, Edith was written out as having suffered a stroke and died off camera, leaving Archie to deal with the death of his beloved "dingbat".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Struthers_9e36.html" title="Sally Struthers">Sally Struthers</a></b> as <b><a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Stivic_badd.html" title="Gloria Stivic">Gloria Bunker Stivic</a></b>, the Bunkers' college-age daughter, married to Michael Stivic. Gloria frequently attempted to mediate Archie and Michael's arguments. The roles of Archie and Edith's daughter and son-in-law (then named "Dickie") initially went to Candice Azzara and Chip Oliver. However, after seeing the show's <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot.html" title="Pilot">pilot</a>, the original production company, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>, requested a second pilot, expressing dissatisfaction with Azarra and Oliver. Lear recast the "Gloria" and "Dickie" roles to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Struthers_9e36.html" title="Sally Struthers">Sally Struthers</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Reiner_ca62.html" title="Rob Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> for the second attempt. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Marshall_1e62.html" title="Penny Marshall">Penny Marshall</a>, whom Rob Reiner married in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, shortly after the program began, was also considered for the role.</li>

As discussed in <i>All in the Family</i> retrospectives, Richard Dreyfuss sought the part, but Norman Lear was convinced of Reiner's talent.</li>

Lionel and Louise joined the show in its first season. George was first seen in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. George is Archie's combative black counterpart, while Louise is a smarter, more assertive version of Edith. Hemsley, who was Norman Lear's first choice to play George, was performing in the Broadway musical <i>Purlie</i> and didn't want to break his commitment to that show. However, Lear kept the role waiting for him until he was finished the musical.</li>

Stewart filled in for Hemsley. The two appeared together only once, in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> episode in which the Bunkers hosted Henry's going-away party, marking Stewart's final episode and Hemsley's first. (Although George had previously been mentioned many times, he was never shown on camera up to that point.) Even when the Jeffersons were spun off into their own show in 1975, Stewart's character was rarely referred to again and was never seen.</li>

<p>In a warning to viewers, CBS ran a disclaimer before airing the first episode (which disappeared from the screen with the sound of a <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">toilet</a> flushing):</p>
<p>"The program you are about to see is <i>All In The Family</i>. It seeks to throw a humorous spotlight on our frailties, prejudices, and concerns. By making them a source of laughter we hope to show, in a mature fashion, just how absurd they are."</p>
<p><i>All in the Family</i> was notorious for featuring language and epithets previously absent from television, such as "fag" for homosexual, "spade" and much less frequently, "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>" for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks.html" title="Blacks">blacks</a> and phrases such as "God damn it." It was also famous for being the first major television show to feature the sound of a flushing toilet; it became a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> on the show.</p>
<p>While moral watchdogs attacked the show on those grounds, others objected to the show's portrayal of Archie Bunker as a "lovable" bigot. Defenders of the series pointed out that Archie usually lost his arguments by reason of his own stupidity (it is perhaps worth noting that <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf_Garnett_c7e2.html" title="Alf Garnett">Alf Garnett</a>, Archie Bunker's counterpart in the original British series was far from lovable and used much stronger language that would not have been allowed on US network television).</p>
<p>In addition to its candid political dialogue, <i>All in the Family'</i>s story lines also included a sense of realism not previously associated with sitcoms. A <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> episode, for example, found the Bunkers discovering a <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">swastika</a> painted on their front door. (It had been intended for their Jewish neighbors down the street.) An activist from the Hebrew Defense League showed up, proposing violent retaliation against whomever painted it, but upon leaving, he was blown up in his car, as the Bunkers watched in horror from their front door. To interweave illness, crime, or in this case, the offscreen violent death of a character into the plot of a comedy show was an unprecedented move.</p>

<p>Lear bought the rights to <i>Till Death Us Do Part</i> and incorporated his own family experiences with his father into the show. Lear's father would tell Lear's mother to "stifle [herself]" and she would tell Lear's father "you are the laziest white man I ever saw" (two 'Archieisms' that found their way onto the show).</p>
<p>While in pre-production, the last name chosen for Archie's family was "Justice" and the show's title was <i>Justice for All</i> but was later changed to <i>Those Were the Days</i>.</p>
<p>ABC became uneasy at about the time <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dreyfus_8221.html" title="Richard Dreyfus">Richard Dreyfus</a> sought the role of Michael and canceled the project. Rival network <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Broadcasting_System_2d2f.html" title="Columbia Broadcasting System">CBS</a> was eager to update its image, and was looking to replace much of its then popular "rural" programming (<i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayberry_R.F.D._107a.html" title="Mayberry R.F.D.">Mayberry R.F.D.</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beverly_Hillbillies_8b9b.html" title="The Beverly Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../p/e/t/Petticoat_Junction_abf2.html" title="Petticoat Junction">Petticoat Junction</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Acres_cd06.html" title="Green Acres">Green Acres</a></i>) with more "urban", contemporary fare (see <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural_purge.html" title="Rural purge">Rural purge</a>), and was interested in Lear's project. They bought the rights from ABC and re-titled the show <i>All in the Family</i>.</p>
<p>Lear initially wanted to shoot in black and white, perhaps feeling that it would emphasize the Bunkers' stark surroundings to greater effect. While CBS insisted on color, Lear had the set furnished in rather neutral tones, keeping everything relatively devoid of color.</p>
<p><i>All in the Family</i> was the first major American series to be <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">videotaped</a> in front of a live studio audience. At the time, sitcoms were shot on film in front of an audience, and the 1960s had seen a growing number of sitcoms filmed on soundstages without audiences, with a <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laugh_track.html" title="Laugh track">laugh track</a> simulating audience response. After the success of <i>All in the Family</i>, videotaping sitcoms in front of an audience became the standard format for the genre. However, the use of videotape also gave <i>All in the Family</i> the look and feel of the classic sitcoms of early television, which had been performed live before a studio audience (including the original live broadcasts of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Honeymooners_1699.html" title="The Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a></i>, to which <i>All in the Family</i> is sometimes compared.</p>
<p>In later seasons, the practice changed to playing the already taped and edited show to an audience and recording their laughter to add to the original sound track. Thus, O'Connor's voice-over during the end credits was changed from "<i>All in the Family</i> is taped before a live studio audience" to "<i>All in the Family</i> was played to a studio audience for a live response." However, throughout its run, Norman Lear took pride in the fact that <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canned_laughter.html" title="Canned laughter">canned laughter</a> was never used (mentioning this on many occasions); the laughter heard in the episodes was genuine.</p>
<p>The house shown in the opening credits is located at 89-70 Cooper Avenue in the <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_Queens_febb.html" title="Glendale, Queens">Glendale</a> neighborhood of Queens, New York. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E3DA1531F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E3DA1531F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The fictional address of the Bunker home was 704 Hauser Street. One may notice there isn't a porch to the house, which is often referred to in the episodes.</p>

The laughter went on for so long that it had to be severely edited for network broadcast as Carroll O'Connor still had one final line to get out following the kiss.

<p><i>All in the Family</i> spawned several spin-offs, beginning with <i><a href="../../../m/a/u/Maude_%28TV_series%29_8bff.html" title="Maude (TV series)">Maude</a></i> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. Maude Findlay, played by <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatrice_Arthur_ffd6.html" title="Beatrice Arthur">Beatrice Arthur</a>, was Edith's cousin; she had first appeared on <i>All in the Family</i> in December <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> in order to help take care of the Bunkers when they all were sick. Maude disliked Archie intensely, mainly because she thought Edith could have married better, but also because Archie was a conservative while Maude was very liberal in her politics. Maude was featured in another <i>All in the Family</i> episode in which Archie and Edith visited Maude's home in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westchester_County%2C_New_York_0dbc.html" title="Westchester County, New York">Westchester County</a> to attend the wedding of Maude's daughter Carol â€” it aired near the end of the second season in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. The episode was essentially designed to set up the premise for the spin-off series <i>Maude</i>. In the episode, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Macy_c01d.html" title="Bill Macy">Bill Macy</a> played Maude's husband, Walter; it was a role he would reprise for the weekly series that fall. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcia_Rodd_9461.html" title="Marcia Rodd">Marcia Rodd</a>, the actress who played Carol in the episode was replaced by <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Barbeau_1027.html" title="Adrienne Barbeau">Adrienne Barbeau</a> in <i>Maude</i>.</p>

George Jefferson was the owner of a chain of seven successful <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_cleaning.html" title="Dry cleaning">dry-cleaning</a> stores; as <i>The Jeffersons</i> began, he and Louise had just moved from the Bunkers' neighborhood in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a> to a luxury high-rise apartment building on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>'s <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_East_Side_9503.html" title="Upper East Side">Upper East Side</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="Edit section: Theme song">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theme song</span></h2>
<p>The series' opening theme song, "Those Were the Days" written by <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Adams_dad9.html" title="Lee Adams">Lee Adams</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Strouse_1fcc.html" title="Charles Strouse">Charles Strouse</a>, was presented in a unique way for a <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> series, with O'Connor and Jean Stapleton seated at a <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinet.html" title="Spinet">spinet piano</a> (played by Stapleton) and singing the tune on-camera at the start of every episode. Several different performances were recorded over the run of the series, including one version that includes an additional verse. The song is a simple melody in which Archie and Edith wax nostalgic for the simpler days of yesteryear. Listening to each version chronologically, there are two trends. Jean Stapleton's screeching high note on the line "And you knew who you WEEERRE then" became louder, longer, and more comical; and the final lyrics (especially "Gee, our old <a href="../../../l/a/s/LaSalle_35d8.html" title="LaSalle">LaSalle</a> ran great") were sung with increasingly deliberate enunciation as viewers had initially complained that they couldn't understand the words.</p>
<p>The closing theme (an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrumental.html" title="Instrumental">instrumental</a>) was "Remembering You", played by <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Kellaway_2638.html" title="Roger Kellaway">Roger Kellaway</a> and co-written by Kellaway and O'Connor.</p>
<p>Except for some brief instances in the very first episodes, there was no background or transitional music.</p>
<p>In interviews, Norman Lear stated that the idea for the piano song introduction was a cost-cutting measure. After completion of the pilot episode, the budget would not allow an elaborate scene to serve as the sequence played during the show's opening credits. Lear decided to have a simple scene of Archie and Edith singing at the piano -- a sequence that became one of the most famous and parodied openings in TV history.</p>
