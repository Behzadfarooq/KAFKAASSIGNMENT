	    <p>Nothing new in this article though it has some historical tit bits here and there. For example, the year 3 wheeled ATV seized to be sold can be got from this sentence. "In 1987, the agency sued ATV manufacturers, declaring the vehicles an imminently hazardous consumer product. The suit was settled a year later, with the companies agreeing to stop selling the three-wheel ATV models the agency considered highly unstable." Sales figure for ATV in some past years come out in this sentence "According to the industry, 884,000 ATVs were sold in 2003, up from 447,000 in 1998." Other historical data "The popularity of ATVs has been increasing, with 6.2 million four-wheel vehicles in use in 2003, double the number in 1998. Injuries have been rising steadily every year, according to agency statistics. In 2003, there were 125,500 injuries, up from 67,800 in 1998. About 31 percent of those injured in 2003 were younger than 16, compared with 37 percent in 1998." <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6495-2005Feb7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6495-2005Feb7.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../w/k/_/User%7EWk_muriithi_6a20.html" title="User:Wk muriithi">gathima</a> 18:37, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wondering if it would be prudent to make note of non-typical usages of ATVs. For example, they are a familiar sight driving down city streets in phildelphia and can be seen with rims and other such adornments.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardina16_789c.html" title="User:Cardina16">Ron</a> 19:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Curious! I've never heard of widespread inner-city use, though I have seen some on the outskirts of Miami. Nothing like what you describe, however. I would think this would be a good addition to the article -- very educational, and I thought I'd seen and heard a lot about ATVs to this point.

<dd>Yes, people actually use them for drag racing (complete with wagering) in inner cities. However, I would have to be convinced that it's a "familiar sight" in urban Philadelphia. --Don Williams 22:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In several countries in Europe ATVs are legal to use on the street and are considered an automobile. Japanese and North American manufacturers have to convert ATVs sold to Europe for the market. This includes having the foot brake operate all four wheels, reinforce the ignition to guard against theft, place engine restrictions (if the particular market calls for them) and adding turn signals and reflectors. Also, it is legal to ride 2-Up on a one-person machine. I rode in the French Alps and it was quite an experience riding on the streets of the French towns. If I can find any photos I will consider adding them. There are also several American communities that have made it legal to ride on streets in order to facilitate business growth around trail use and to connect trails. One place that comes to mind is the city of Logan, W.V. that is in the heart of the Hatfield-McCoy Trails.Alf rules 21:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to mention that where I live in Canada, ATVs are almost always referred to as "four-wheelers" or "three-wheelers", and almost never ATVs. Is this the common term anywhere else?<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 16:34, 16 September 2006 (UTC)Thomasiscool</p>
<p>Well, if you look at the magazines, you have ATV Action, ATV Sport and ATV Illustrated. Don Williams 07:06, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is also Quad, Dirt Wheels, and many more that dont have ATV in the name, That is a very shity point. "four-wheeler" and "three-wheeler" are the most common here to.</p>

<p>I find the overall tone of this article to be decidely anti-ATV. Especially the section regarding injuries and deaths. While it is worth noting that there are people killed and injured on ATVs each year, it is also worth noting that the accident rate per hour of use is actually decreasing. The more ATVs are sold, the more people will ride them. And the more ATVs are ridden, the more accidents will happen. Just something to think about, I believe. I will research sources to back up my claims. Alf rules 21:28, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>About road riding: In some states, South Dakota, for instance, ATVs with a displacement of 250CC or greater can be licensed as a motorcycle for road use. However the machine must have a rear-view mirror and horn. BTW, in the Black Hills of South Dakota, more than 80% of the 1.4-million-acre Black Hills National Forest, is open for ATV users. Additonally, BLM land, national grasslands and state lands are also open to ATV users.Dab1066 04:48, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Three wheelers" can actually be made street legal in the United States due to loop holes for three wheel vehicles to be classified as motorcycles, allowing "meter-maid" vehicles and the such. Conversion kits are available to convert some sport ATV's to a single rear wheel, thus allowing them to be licensed with the afor mentioned horn, mirror, turn signal additions. Four wheel ATV's cannot be made street legal in most states because they are then classified as cars and do not pass Federal safety standards (side impact, etc.). Road legal quads abound in Europe and the quad magazines regularly do articles on them. RustyATV 04:24, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
