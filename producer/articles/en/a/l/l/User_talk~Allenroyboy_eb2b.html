<p>Look, you're the one who was relying on this guy's qualifications to authenticate your arguments. In that case, it's not at all <i>ad hominem</i> to question those qualifications. <i>Ad hominem</i> is a logical fallacy where an argument is countered by attacking the arguer, not the argument itself. Had I attacked <i>you</i> personally, that would have been <i>ad hominem</i>. But when the argument is about someone's qualifications to issue an authoritative opinion in the first place, it's perfectly fair game to talk about them.</p>
<p>All the theory in the world can't overcome facts, and the fact of the matter is that shipbuilders of the wooden ship era, a time when Naval Architects were very well-acquainted with the material, found that a ship over a certain size, but still far smaller than the ark, could not be made structurally sound without modern techniques. This website seems to feel it's an unreasonable constraint on building technique to assume no metal was used. They obviously don't understand how expensive metals were in those days, and that Noah simply could not have come by so much bronze. Their design requires literally tons of it, more than can be shown to have existed worldwide at the time! (150 kg/joint over "hundreds" of joints.)</p>
<p>You might counter that God miraculously provided materials and building techniques, but the Bible says no such thing. This means that this ark of theirs relies on things found neither in Scripture nor by archaeology and anthropology. If that doesn't tell you anything, I don't know what will. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 18:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My argument was that Naval Architects have designed a wooden hull the size of Noah's Ark. To claim that they are not qualified by someone who is not qualified is flawed logic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To be technical, Naval Architecture did not begin until between WWI and WWII with the beginings of steel ships. Before that, the shipbuilders depended upon empirical data kept and supplied by insurance companies like Lloyds of London. (You could not build a commercial ship unless it could be insured. So Insurance companies held all the data.) Before the begining of Naval Architecture there was NO ENGINEERING INVOLVED. If you wanted to build a ship a certain size, you went to Lloyds, got measurment data and wood types of "successful" ships, then you just scaled up to the size you wanted, without any engineering or strengths of materials knowledge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because there was no data in the insurance companies about steel ships, steel shipbuilders built from the hip, modeling steel ships after wood ships. They soon discovered that that didn't work. They had to take a completely different approach to ship design using engineering. This is what has become known as Naval Architecture. And what we have learned from Naval Architecture has shown the fatal flaws of the previous wood ship design methods. It wasn't the materials -- i.e. the wood -- that was the problem, but the lack of engineering and dependence upon what was thought to be "successful".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Using modern Naval Architecture and modeling after some ancient ship designs, they have designed a wood vessel that is stronger than anything from the 19th century could ever have been.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How similar was the Pre-flood culture to the misdated, post-flood cultures now studied by archaeology and anthropology is open for debate. The assumption of construction techniques and materials of and costs to post-flood cultures need not be slavishly applied, because the Pre-flood culture may well have been more advanced. The ship design depends mostly upon wood pegs with only some minor agumentation by bronze. And I believe the authors would prefer to design using only wood. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenroyboy_73c7.html" title="User:Allenroyboy">Allenroyboy</a> 20:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By your logic no company can ever hire any engineers in a specialty they don't already have on staff, because they have no one who can evaluate their qualifications. Or no one who is not an auto mechanic himself can ever select a qualified mechanic to service his car. No one who is not a doctor can ever choose a well-qualified specialist to treat an ailment. Etc., etc., etc. Clearly nonsense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once again you have to drag in un-Biblical and un-historical assumptions to make your case. Metalworking is mentioned only once before the building of the ark, in Genesis 4, and it's the invention of Tubalcain of the line of Cain. There's no sign of high technology, and there's no sign that the descendants of Seth ever adopted this technology. I saw their "technology level" chart. Besides being incorrect in several particulars, it's circular. They have to assume such a high level of achievement in Noah's time in order to say their design is feasible. Where's the other evidence for it? It's not in the ground, and it's not in the Bible. And even though Noah and his sons must have been experts in multiple disciplines, they managed to pass on practically nothing of this to their descendants? This strains credibility to the breaking point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have to point out that 150kg of metal per joint is much more than "minor augmentation". Even a mere 200 of such joints, would require 30,000kg of bronze, or over 33 short tons. Never mind wooden remains; we should certainly be able to locate such a rich deposit of metal somewhere! Besides, the story says that God specified the materials in his instructions to Noah and says nothing about bronze. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 21:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If an engineering company want to expand into Naval Engineering or Architecture I believe they would do the following:</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>If some global disaster [asteroid, nuclear war] were to hit the world today we would be reduced to near "stone age" and subsistance living overnight. Just consider the countries like Cambodia where the intelligencia, the educated, the teachers were mass murdered by the Chamere Rouge. They became the lowest of the 3rd world countries. It is not surprising that post-flood technology would be much lower than Pre-flood technology. It is highly likely that Noah and sons were not the only ones to build the Ark. They could have hired specialists to help build some parts of the Ark, etc. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenroyboy_73c7.html" title="User:Allenroyboy">Allenroyboy</a> 18:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't say that in the Bible though, does it? The fact is that you have to drag in more and more extraneous material in order to justify reading the Flood story literally. (As well as come up with an entire alternative science of geology that raises more questions than it answers.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, you end up being highly selective in what you take literally and what you do not. For example, you're now suggesting that Gen 6:14-22 is being incomplete or figurative when it says that God commanded <i>Noah</i> to build the ark and that <i>Noah</i> built it. Why you find the idea that one man, 600 years old when the project was completed (Gen 7:6) could have built it himself more incredible than the very idea of a worldwide flood that submerged even the mountaintops beneath 30 feet of water I don't know, but there you are. It's not an unreasonable stretch of the text to say that his sons helped him, but hirelings are not mentioned by the text and seem in fact to be excluded by a literal reading.</dd>

<dd>1: You have a very flawed idea of what most creationists are. Most are NOT LITERALISTS in the sense that they take EVERY WORD literally. In my experiences, most creationists read the Bible in what is often called a "straight forward" or common sense way of reading. If something is obviously literal, both from a literary and contextual sense, you read it literally. If it is obviously symbolic, such as in symbolisms in prophecies and some poetic writings, then read and understand the meaning of the symbols. The literalism of which critics make fun is just a straw-man that critics have invented and no creationist is.</dd>

<dd>2: Just because something is not specifically mentioned in the Bible that does not rule it out! As long as something is logical and does not specifically contradict the Bible, it could be possible. It is YOUR idea that the ONLY things allowed MUST be mentioned ONLY in the Bible; that is not a creationist's idea. This is because you have a flawed idea of how Creationists read the Bible. Actually, it is the way you WANT creationists to read the Bible, so you can ridicule them. And, give you an excuse for subjecting Biblical interpretation to evolutionary interpretation. This way, you are being 'sensible' and they are being ridiculous. Yet, you are doing exactly what you claim they are doing. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenroyboy_73c7.html" title="User:Allenroyboy">Allenroyboy</a> 03:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never intended to suggest that literalists read every word in every prophecy literally; that would be stupid of me. But there are, or ought to be, more options than merely "literal" and "symbolic". A story can also be a parable; a story intended to convey a lesson on an abstract concept by presenting it in concrete terms. A parable <i>might</i> be primarily allegorical, where each feature and event in the story has some symbolic meaning, as in the Lord's <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Sower_ec99.html" title="Parable of the Sower">Parable of the Sower</a>. In that case He took the trouble to explain it to His disciples, so we understand its symbolism very well. Or it could be almost completely non-allegorical, as in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan_0883.html" title="Parable of the Good Samaritan">Parable of the Good Samaritan</a>, where the lesson was clear enough that no explanation was necessary. (Yet it does contain some symbolism that was hidden from most of his audience. It works on several levels.) You do not, in any event, expect that it must be literally true. Since the Lord in His Incarnation was recorded as teaching in parable so often, there's no reason why we cannot expect some parables in the Old Testament as well. I don't know if you meant to exclude parabolic material in your explanation here or if it was an inadvertent omission. It's irrelevant either way because in the case at hand you <i>are</i> taking the Flood story literally. You must be seeing it as neither symbolic, allegorical, nor parabolic.</dd>

<dd>You can assume anything you want that doesn't overtly contradict Scripture. That doesn't mean that is what really happened. You could do the same if I were to tell you about what I did yesterday. I'm bound to leave something out, either through forgetfulness or for the sake of brevity. If you really wanted, you could exercise your imagination and fill in the blank spots in my day with any activity you like, and it would seem to make sense as long as it didn't preclude anything I actually told you I did. That doesn't automatically mean you're right. Suppose I said I bought something at the market but didn't tell you how I got there. It's not impossible that I walked, and if you like you can just assume that I did. However, if the truth of the matter is that I drove, you'd be wrong. So when you start to pile on guesswork upon guesswork upon guesswork, as you must do to take the Flood story literally, there's a very high probability that you're not going to be correct no matter what.</dd>

<dd>The basic problem here is that we have ample evidence from the physical world that certain parts of Genesis that appear to be straightforward narrative cannot be taken literally. The Flood is one of those parts. We simply do not see what we should be seeing in the geology if it were literally true. This is why people don't believe in the literal event, not some kind of small-minded hostility toward Holy Scripture or innate hatred of Creationists. In order to turn things around so that it's literally possible, a whole collection of extraneous assumptions have to be made that are not spelled out, or even suggested, anywhere; not in the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_science.html" title="Earth science">earth sciences</a> and not in the Bible: A plethora of advanced technologies in the antediluvian world, massive and very fast movement of tectonic plates, building contractors, instant fossilization, recent worldwide volcanic activity on an enormously massive scale, the presence of more water than has ever existed on this planet, etc. The list could be multiplied almost endlessly. <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>, if nothing else, should suggest this was not a literal event since that's the proposition requiring the fewest assumptions. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 05:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When it comes to the Ark and the Flood, there is very little detail given in the Bible. But, that is what you start with and you build upon that foundation using logic and evidence. However, there are a couple facts that are not debate able--1) there was a global flood and 2) there was an Ark--simply because God said so. Creationary catastrophists make mental "models" of what the Ark MAY have been like and what MAY have happened during the Flood. I believe that most, including myself, consider those models to be tentative and never the final word. The whole thrust of the WorldWideFlood site is that it is POSSIBLE to design a wood ship the size of Noah's Ark. They do not say that this is how it MUST have been done.</dd>

<dd>"Ample evidence from the Physical world?" One thing that Creationists are trying to help people understand is that all scientific evidenced is paradigm driven and interpreted. One of the mistaken concepts most people have is that science is a neutral methodology. Since about the 1950s science philosopher <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn_f8cd.html" title="Thomas Samuel Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a> (not a creationist) has shown that all science must be done within a paradigm in order to make sense.</dd>

<dd>The prevailing paradigm is called Naturalism which has been well defined by Carl Sagan in "Cosmos" when he said, "the Cosmos (nature) is all there is, has ever been or ever will be." (the first sentence in his book.) This paradigm excludes any influence by any kind of God. A corollary to this proposition is that 1) since there was once no life and 2) now there is (and 3) since there is no God to interfere) then Abiogenesis is and must be a fact of nature. A related corollary is that 1) since there was once few life forms and now 3) there are many (and 3) since there is no God to interfere) then Evolution is and must be a fact of nature. A third is that since the cosmos has ever been, then Deep Time is a fact of nature. This paradigm also supplies the axioms that are REQUIRED BEFORE one can even to science: 1) Uniformity of natural law across time and space; 2) Uniformity of process across time and space. (for instance if gravity is not assumed to be in effect here and "out there" in space then science cannot be applied to "out there" in space. And if gravity is not assumed to be in effect back into deep time, then science cannot be used to understand the past [or future].) Once these axioms are accepted ONLY THEN science can be done.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So, science is done by evolutionists within these paradigm determined 'facts' of abiogenesis, evolution, and deep time. Therefore, science does not and, in fact, cannot prove abiogenesis, evolution or deep time true. It is a logical fallacy to try to prove your assumptions. They are true because the paradigm assumes them true to begin with.</dd>

<dd>Creationists do not start with Naturalism, but rather they start with Creationism, where God invents, designs and calls into existence the cosmos. He invents the laws and processes and causes them to work. He defines the length of time that things have existed. We accept this paradigm because “Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.” Amos 3:7. And because “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. … He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. …The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.” John 1:1-14. Jesus is not only a Christians savior, but also THE Creator. If you trust Him to save you, you can trust Him when He says He created world and told us that he did it.</dd>

With the acceptance of these axioms Creationists conduct science within the creationary paradigm. But, Creationists doing science cannot prove Creation or the Flood true. It is a logical fallacy to try to prove your assumptions. They are true because the paradigm assumes them true to begin with.</dd>

<dd>Now, about your “ample evidence.” That evidence comes from within the paradigm of Naturalism. Since it starts with the assumption that there is no God. Since Abiogenesis, Evolution and Deep Time are truth. Then one can expect that the evidence interpreted within the paradigm of Naturalism will contradict the Biblical narrative. However, if one does their science within the Creationary paradigm which starts with the Biblical narrative as true, then scientific evidence will NOT contradict the Bible. The evidence as interpreted within Naturalism is completely irrelevant to the Biblical narrative. And Creationists treat it as such. When they ignore scientific evidence as interpreted within Naturalism, it does not mean that they are anti-science, but that they are anti-Naturalism; anti-evolutionism. The controversy between Evolution and Creation is not about science. The controversy is over which paradigm you choose to do your science within. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenroyboy_73c7.html" title="User:Allenroyboy">Allenroyboy</a> 20:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now who's making up strawmen? Carl Sagan does not speak for all scientists, nor did he invent the scientific method. The reason that a naturalist paradigm is used is because it works. If we just throw up our hands over a problem and say, "God did it," we learn nothing. Assuming instead that nature operates consistently within its own laws has opened the doors to truly understanding nature and the astonishing balance in its laws as they have been designed. If it didn't work, we couldn't be communicating with each other right now. The same general paradigm that produced the various sciences of natural history also invented the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor.html" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a>. Nor is this an unreasonable assumption in any way. If it did not hold, there would be no nature but only chaos. This is clearly not the case.</dd>

(That is, if the laws do change then they change in regular and predictable ways as governed by some other law.) Science has observed nothing that would tend to dislodge this assumption either. Gravity works the same everywhere we see it in operation. We in fact understand it very well as a force, even if we don't understand how it arises from mass. We can launch a satellite from Earth and have it approach a distant moon to within a few kilometers of its predicted position. This would be impossible if the law of gravity was not constant.</dd>

Modern physics posits an intimate relationship between space and time, and one does not exist without the other. This is one reason why it's difficult to conceive of a time "before" the universe began. We also say the God exists outside of time. But so what if the universe is far older than a literal reading of Genesis seems to suggest? What is time to the eternal God who made it, and is not subject to it?</dd>

<dd>Abiogenesis is one possibility for the origins of life that is being considered, yes. Not out of hostility to the idea of God, but again out of looking for explanations out of the laws built into nature. There are also other possibilities that are being considered as well, since no convincing mechanism has yet been found for it. This isn't to say there aren't the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkinses</a> of the world, but there are also scientists like <a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/DutchS/pscindx.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uwgb.edu/DutchS/pscindx.htm" rel="nofollow">Steven Dutch</a> who are very strong believers but who work precisely in those disciplines where early Genesis is contradicted in literal terms. As you say, they have to make sense of their data. And the data say that the earth is on the order of 4 billion years old, and that there is no evidence for a worldwide Flood at any time since mankind began to live civilized lives. If the Flood happened, no matter what your paradigm you ought to see evidence of it in the ground, and we simply do not. Not in any way that fits the bulk of the data well.</dd>

It's an amazing mechanism.) The flaw in "<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">creation science</a>" is that it cannot do this with anywhere near the regularity of evolutionary biology, or geology, or astronomy, or any other of the mainstream sciences.

He wishes us to come to him in faith and love, not out of confidence in our experiments or exploratory data since it is in faith and love that we might grow to the measure of the image in which we were made. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 00:39, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All Sagan did was elucidate in a simple, concise way, what IS the foundational paradigm for evolutionary science as developed by others. Most evolutionists don’t realize that they are working within a paradigm. To be sure, Scientists who are Christian are very uncomfortable with Sagan’s clearly atheistic elucidation of Naturalism. It is thought that one can modify Naturalism such that nature is NOT ALL that there is, has been or ever will be. Thus God can be allowed for. Even Creationists would agree with such a basic statement. However, the way it is put in to practice separates Creationary scientists from other scientists who are Christian. The distinction comes in to what extent one accepts what the Bible says about Origins and Creation. Which takes precedence? A paradigm thought up by men? Or a paradigm based on what Jesus says? Within either one, science can be conducted because both provide the axioms needed for science to work. Because both paradigms are the foundations for science, neither one can be more scientific than the other. And both are, in fact, religious beliefs systems.</dd>

<dd>Creationists recognize two different aspects of nature: 1) The origin of nature and 2) the continuing functionality of nature. The ONLY place where creationists throw up their hands and say, “God did it” is dealing with Origins. There is no way to put God in a test tube and scientifically study just how God created by speaking things into existence. But, just as you say, science is excellent for studying how nature functions. The problem is that Evolutionists believe that by studying how nature functions they are also studying how nature originated. This is exemplified by Darwins “Origin of the Species” where some natural law of how nature functions (survival of the fittest) is thought to be how species originate. In fact, evolutionists don’t seem comprehend that one can just study how nature functions and not be studying how it originated. That’s why when creationists claim God originated things; evolutionists think creationists are giving up on science. In general, Evolutionists are unable to comprehend things from the creationary perspective.</dd>

It may be possible to confirm that they are the same everywhere only when someone is able to go out there and tell us. The point about gravity is that it is impossible to prove it exists “out there” unless we can send something or someone out there like we did to the moon. We MUST assume it works out there until we can confirm it in some way.</dd>

<dd>The concept of Deep Time is simply the idea that the universe is millions and billions of years old. The point being that you must first take the position that anything COULD BE old before one would accept that something IS old. And it is your paradigm that determines if you consider Deep Time valid. Most Creationists find the philosophical question of Deep Time in conflict with the Biblical record and age of the Creation Week. Therefore, they consider ages derived within Naturalism to be not in error, but actually quite irrelevant within the Creationary paradigm. All the ages of Naturalism’s Geologic Column are completely useless to Creationists.</dd>

<dd>Creationists see almost the entire geologic record as evidence for the flood. Evolutionary geologists have interpreted the geologic layers within the idea that the Geologic Record represents billions of years of earth history. Thus they have interpreted the layers within Naturalism. The paradigm has such a grip on their thinking that they seem unable to grasp the idea that the geologic record can be interpreted any other way. That is why they ask Creationists for evidence in the geologic column as they have interpreted it for the flood. Creationists realize there is no way to insert their paradigm into the evolutionary paradigm. Therefore, it is impossible for them to point to any “flood” layers within the evolutionary geologic column. You have to completely change paradigms to see and interpret the geologic record within a Flood model.</dd>

<dd>Evolution is not a theory in Naturalism but a FACT. What is theorized are the methods by which Evolution is thought to have happened, i.e. natural selection, mutation, etc. Creationists and Evolutionists alike observe common ordinary genetic variation. The difference comes in interpreting what is seen. Evolutionists, knowing that evolution is a FACT, see in genetic variation evolution in process. Creationists simply see variation and adaptation of created kinds to the external forces of an evil world.</dd>

For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;” Matt 24:37-38 With these words Jesus, the Creator himself, tells me to take the creation and flood accounts seriously as they are written. There is no need to find any hidden meaning. There is no need to try to mix man’s beliefs with the Bible. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenroyboy_73c7.html" title="User:Allenroyboy">Allenroyboy</a> 22:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, this isn't about paradigms. The time scale of geological processes was discovered by people working within a creationist paradigm -- who were, in fact originally looking for evidence of the Flood. They concluded something rather different when they began to look at the data <i>tabula rasa</i>. The modern viewpoint was adopted slowly and with great reluctance. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_geology.html" title="History of geology">History of geology</a>. We understand very much about how these things work now, and it's not how creation "science" describes it. You are choosing to believe the wrong people.</dd>

<dd>Your insistence isn't merely on origins, as anyone who examines the foregoing conversation can tell immediately. It's on the literal-to-the-letter false understanding of a heavily abridged and symbol-laden account of how this origin came about -- an account which was intended to convey far more than that God is the maker of all things. If that's all it was about, it would be a useless revelation. After all, many pagan philosophers came to the same conclusion, and they didn't need Scripture to tell it to them.</dd>

The word for this passing-on of the faith is "tradition".
