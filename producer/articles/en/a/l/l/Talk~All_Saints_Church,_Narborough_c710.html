	    <p>Hello. To expand this article, there is a useful photograph of this church at <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narborough%2C_Leicestershire_6a6f.html" title="Narborough, Leicestershire">Narborough, Leicestershire</a>. Incidentally, you may want to move this page to remove the capitalisation of Leicester - just <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Saints_Church%2C_Narborough_a5e2.html" title="All Saints Church, Narborough">All Saints Church, Narborough</a> would be better, perhaps. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 16:06, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mr Castle,</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your comments. The reason I put Leicester in the title is because if I remember rightly the church in Narborough, Norfolk is also called All Saints! I'm trying to find pictures I've taken of the church at the moment but I've been updating the Littlethorpe page too! I only joined today. Thanks for your comments/suggestions.</dd>
<dd>Chris <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chrisnnr (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisnnr_f939.html" title="User talk:Chrisnnr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chrisnnr_3925.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chrisnnr">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>That's fine - there isn't even a page for the village of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narborough%2C_Norfolk_e5fc.html" title="Narborough, Norfolk">Narborough, Norfolk</a> yet, so I wouldn't worry about that. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 16:51, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gosh, what a coincidence, the church in the other Narborough is also <a href="http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/PAGEVIEWER.ASP?fn=000091ID.TIF&amp;dn=LUL13009tif&amp;zoom=in" class="external text" title="http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/PAGEVIEWER.ASP?fn=000091ID.TIF&amp;dn=LUL13009tif&amp;zoom=in" rel="nofollow">All Saints</a>. But in any case, my view is that English churches, unless especially notable, should be included in the village article rather than having their own article. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 20:26, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, that is quite a coincidence, although I suppose "All Saints" is a fairly common dedication. However, I am inclined to agree with your comment about notability - I was expecting a history of this church to be written here, but at the moment it is just repeated content from the Narborough page with a few extra photographs. These could still be usefully included in the village page, and if there are any interesting stories from the history of the church, that would qualify as notable - I suppose it's over to you, Chrisnnr. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 21:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>At the moment Im trying to sort out some history for the page, as there's little about it on the web. I created a seperate page as there are many church in Narborough itself. As I've had exams recently I haven't the time to speak to the Rector about the history of the church, EG I know one of the stained glass windows in well known throughout the country by 'stained glass enthusiasts'! Thats something I need to look into rather that doing a half-hearted attempt, although it will appear soon.</p>

<dd>Hi again, sorry to revert you, but this isn't really the place to add times and contact details about a church - for one thing, the rector/churchwarden may not want his details being readily available on the internet. To be honest, in its present form, this article isn't worth keeping - the only text content is a short paragraph that I pasted in here from the Narborough page to help you start it. However, <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> is quite right that it offers nothing more than what is already on the village page. It might be worth having a look at something like <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Michael%27s_Church%2C_Tilehurst_0a15.html" title="St. Michael's Church, Tilehurst">St. Michael's Church, Tilehurst</a>, which is the level of content that makes it encyclopedic. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 20:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interesting discussion; a comment on whether 'this page is worth keeping'; the normal wiki approach is that if there <i>could</i> be an encyclopaedic article, it should be started; content will arrive! Many old churches in England do have sufficient architectural or historical significance, but hitherto have lacked the home that Wikipedia can provide to make the information available. (I would suggest they are frequently of longer term encyclopaedic value than many existing articles - try <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Star_5c3d.html" title="White Star">White Star</a>&#160;!) I would therefore solve the 'problem', if there is one, by keeping the article and encouraging everyone to add the information. The example of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Michael%27s_Church%2C_Tilehurst_0a15.html" title="St. Michael's Church, Tilehurst">St. Michael's Church, Tilehurst</a> is a good one; its early version was very thin, but content arrived! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonix_f202.html" title="User:Carbonix">Carbonix</a> 12:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS Chris please sign your comments with four tildes (ie 4 of these: ~ ) and your name/date/time will miraculously appear - thanks</p>

<dd>It is quite an interesting discussion, although it's rather old now. I am all for keeping this article, and others like it. My comment merely reflected that I wrote or added nearly all of the content myself, and much of that was just from the village page. However, it does raise an interesting question. As you say, many English churches are some of our earliest examples of architecture, and are found everywhere. However, I'm generally disappointed by the coverage of them on Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 23:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
