<p>NPOV may be the wrong tag. This is a touchy and controversial subject being approached, and this may not be the most diplomatic way to go about it. It is worth pointing out that, thus far, the article may as well be called "Grievances against the United States." Also, applications of the term (neologism?) "American terrorism" are only notable when they come from notable sources. If you're going to step into this breech, do it following WP sourcing, citation, and POV rules carefully. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 09:32, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, i dont agree. The term is made legitimate by the use in prominent sources, but they dont refer as a single act as "American terrorism", rather it is a umbreall term for everyting the USA has done. It is easly demostrated by the widh of the events labeled "American terrorism". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:13, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well as an umbrella it gives any wiki contributer a carte blanche to add whatever relevant information they have about "American terrorism" to this page. With such a broad definition it becomes a forum of anti-Americanism by the very nature of the subject. If there are to be pages on "United States Policy Towards American Indians" or "United States Intervention in Latin America" so be it, those are well defined specific topics where the idea of terrorism can be defined. However, to create one page specifically tailored to "American Terrorism" and the expression thereof is inherently anti-American and thereby POV. 63.161.169.66 19:05, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This page is about the <i>term</i> "American terrorism" as a term. It's not about putative examples of terrorism by the US government. It's about the term, who uses it, and how it's used. If I search wikipedia for "American terrorism" I get a disambiguation page that lets me choose <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism_%28term%29.html" title="American terrorism (term)">American terrorism (term)</a> (this page here), <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism_in_the_United_States_4a58.html" title="Domestic terrorism in the United States">Domestic terrorism in the United States</a>, and a page about the book <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Terrorist_20ed.html" title="American Terrorist">American Terrorist</a>.

<p>After looking around Wikipedia to see if there were analogous pages for other nations (as I am entirely sure that the grievances being aired here are covered elsewhere), I found <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html#United_States" title="State terrorism">State terrorism#United States</a>.

<dd>Note the way those pages are written, and the way this one is written, before hastening to remove the {{NPOV}} tag. Those pages are about terrorism that occurs in those nations; this page is just a list of alleged terroristic crimes committed by the US. It clearly lacks a neutral point of view, and it's clear that you have grievances against the US which you are attempting to air on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WMD's</span></h2>
<p>Someone removed the section about the US's use and ownership of WMD's. My question is- do we need a source for something that is self-defining, terrorism is the use of WMD's or violence against civilians to disrupt the functioning of society... and the WWII bombings fit that definition exactly.</p>
<p>As the article stands, the fact about the US's ownership of WMD's doesn't really fit, however, the direction it is headed, the US government and some citizens as people who have engaged in terrorist acts (see page on request for deletion about current discusssion), I believe that fact fits well.</p>

<dd>I don't think the article should be a redirect right now, but it should start as a stub. There certainly was <i>not</i> a consensus to keep the article, there just wasn't consensus to delete. It makes much more sense to rebuild from a stub than to try to rework the horrible version that was put up for deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:44, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This probably means little since I wasn't involved and am not an expert on terrorism, but I agree with Carbonite. The original article was way too biased. A redirect is questionable since a lot of people do consider the US to have committed acts of terrorism. So the best alternative IMO would be to rebuild the article from stub level. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 14:04, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. AFD is not a debate on whether an article should stay as an article or not. It's a debate on whether an article should be deleted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About what?</span></h2>
<p>What is this page to be about? A term in current use, or a phenomnon illustrated by examples? <i>Terrorism by the United States of America</i> seems to suggest it's about a phenomonon. <i>American terrorism</i> suggests to me that it's about a term. Also, I think more casual users will serach for <i>American terrorism</i> than for the other.</p>

<p>"American terrorism" is documented and cited as a widely used term. There was no consensus to delete, rename, or redirect that article.

<p>This <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_6915.html" title="Terrorism by United States of America">Terrorism by United States of America</a> article is a joke. You renamed "American Terrorism" to your made-up neologism and then changed the definition, essentially deleting the original article. You can claim that you didn't delete it, but the effect is the same. Do you think people are so dense that they can't see what you're doing? People who ignore consensus, force their will on others, and justify their actions through misdirection, are the reason that Wikipedia fails to live up to its potential. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 15:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On a side note, I will ask you to stop insinuating that I have some sort of pro-American agenda to push here. We've gone up and down and left and right over the notability of "American terrorism" as a term. There are myriad potential meanings for the term, which makes it difficult to determine whether or not it is worthwhile to discuss the term <i>in and of itself</i>. It was a bad faith article creation, designed to make a point about biased neologisms, and the material contained in the article was unsalvagably awful. On the other hand, if the desire is to create a genuine article to contain a discussion of acts by the United States which could be considered terroristic, would it not be to your <i>advantage</i> to broaden it beyond the particular application of the term "American terrorism?" It allows for a more general treatment of the issue without the taint of the initial bad faith article and the obvious contention that comes with it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One more thing: at some point in the process, it was decided by someone (I can't tell who) that the existence of the "American terrorism" article would be justified by making it a branch of the main State terrorism article. It would seem that this is the path that is being followed. A discussion of Domestic terrorism in America has no place in an article serving that purpose. However, Domestic terrorism in America has as much a claim to the meaning of the term "American terrorism" as State terrorism.</dd>

<dd>I Google tested this up and down, then Lexis tested it, then JStor tested it. An archive of the discussion is preserved with the AfD debate. The point is this: the term is used, but it used to mean several dozen things. Writing an article which discusses every possible use of the term would be a.) an NPOV nightmare and b.) next to impossible. The <i>potential</i> meanings that I am proposing we focus on with a disambiguation page are a challenge enough, and honestly aren't the most common meanings. (Google-sift. You'll see that American terrorism seems to most commonly refer to terrorism in the Americas as a whole. I am not making this up.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV tag.</span></h2>
<p>It would be nice if the individual(s) who are responsible for the presence of the current NPOV tag would explain the reasoning for it. An argument over the redirect shouldn't be signified with the tag. (An argument over an unreasonable POV being inherent in the title might be, but I don't see how you can argue with the POV of the title.) What about the questions of factual accuracy?</p>
<p>In other news, I am going to let this cool for a bit and do some journal reading. (Yay, academia.) <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 18:53, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe the tag is a carry-over from the original version of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Terrorism_f114.html" title="American Terrorism">American Terrorism</a> article. Since the rebuilding really just started a few hours ago, I think it might be best to keep the tag for a short while until the article becomes a bit more stable. Otherwise I think a revert war over which dispute tags are appropriate (if any) is rather likely. Once the article is expanded and slightly polished, discussions about compliance with NPOV will be much more productive. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 19:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not advocating removing this as an act of terrorism, although I think it's more rightly classified as a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crime</a>. I am, however, suggesting that the contributor of that item find a new source to justify it. The source they're using utterly contradicts the point they're trying to make.

<dd>Not really. The AFD is a debate whether to delete the article or not. That is all. It is not a debate on whether the article should be moved or redirected or whatever. Quite often those options are brought up, but it is always up to the closing admin to decide unless there's massive consensus that the article should never have been on AFD in the first place and should have been redirected/kept. The article's survived the AFD. All that means is it's now an article like all others, without any threat of being deleted. If someone wants to move it or even remove the content and redirect it elsewhere, then the AFD cannot be cited for or against it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 15:02, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The addition of George Washington was incorrect because it included no citation to a reputable source characterizing his actions as terrorism. If there is one, put it in. Like the others, we'll say who says Washington was a terrorist, and quote him in context saying so. The point is that the page is about the use of the term, not the putative phenomonon. I don't think we need to restrict ourselves to recent use.

<dd>Chomsky, and certainly West, seem to apply the label to all Administrations, and again their claims do pretty much seem to involve a continuing activity: slavery, lynchings, the United Fruit Company, etc. Every American? Well, Ward Churchill, who we haven't got around to quoting yet, seemed to condemn almost all, characterizing the workers in the WTC as 'little eichmanns.' We might be inclusive, or we might limit it to official and quasi-official actions of government.

Were the americans who fought for the civil rights movement also american terrorists?--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 13:24, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course none of them actually are terrorists; The question is, does anyone call them terrorists? If some Hollywood windbag says (I'm completely making this up as an example) "Dude, all of us, every one of us Americans is a terrorist! That's American terrorism!" then that would be a use of the term. If the Times picks it up, and Bill O'Reilly condemns it, then it's a notable use of the term. It's easy to make up contrived examples, harder to find notable and citable uses. What was it in the intro that you thought needed to be sourced? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 13:51, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well I wanted to be more specific in the intro as to the scope of the term , who specfically is accused of this , when did this occur , where. If you just say the US government , that does not work, there have been many different administrations in the US history and you need to specify which ones have allegedly perpetrated acts which have been labelled by critics as American Terrorism.--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 15:51, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter who did what, only who said what. The scope of the article is controlled by what uses we can find and cite. If someone wrote in 1923 that U.S. supression of the Philippine insurrection was terrorism, then we report that use of the term. If Upton Sinclair described the actions of the United Fruit Company as terrorism, then we quote him. If the Singapore Straits Times wrote in 1962 that President Kennedy's use of the Special Forces in Vietnam was terrorism, we report that. If a columnist for the Guardian (I'm making this up as an example) characterised the U.S.'s sale of helicopters to Israel over the past thirty years as terrorism, then we report that.</dd>

<dd>The article is about the term <i>American terrorism</i>. I don't see that we need to limit the article to only uses of the term that characterise actions by the Bush administration. Would it be useful to have sections, like maybe <i>use of the term from 1945 to 2000</i> and <i>use of the term since 9/11</i>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 16:21, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well your first paragraph of your reply above hits it right on the nail."If someone wrote in 1923 that U.S. supression of the Philippine insurrection was terrorism" . That is specific and that makes sense and that is what I advocate. Speficic and factual works fine.</dd>

<dd>I don't think anyone needs to fear an accurate and cited description of the term <i>American terrorism</i>. In particular, if the President of Iran has described something as <i>American terrorism</i>, let's just quote him in enough context to make his meaning clear. Readers will either think his words conclusively demonstrate the fundamental hypocricy of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Satan_b64a.html" title="Great Satan">Great Satan</a>, or readers will think the quote says more about <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">President Ahmadinejad</a> than about America.

<dd>Thank you, Brandon (or do you go by Jusuf?) for pointing out that I haven't moved the page.

<dd>I don't think anyone is working in bad faith here. I suggested above that a reader typing in <i>American terrorism</i> should go to a disambiguation page from which they can choose, roughly, "by US" or "US domestic". The disambiguation page could then go on to discuss <i>American terrorism</i> as a term. This seems consistent with what most people were thinking at the AfD, and not too far from what we have now. How does that differ from what you would like to see? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 17:45, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I don't see why the disambig page has to have the content about the term. That seems kind of odd. It sounds like what you are describing is a sequence branching between "by US" and "US domestic" -- the "by US" thing should eventually lead to an article about the term. Perhaps some clarification on the "term" thing is in order. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 18:53, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not really. Trust me, I think most of the names this article has had suck, and I don't like this name (currently <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Terror_a2ec.html" title="American Terror">American Terror</a>) very much either. However, it will not hurt the encyclopedia if the article has the wrong name for a few days while we settle this mess. We need to maintain the integrity of the page history (done, I think) and then decide on the article name. It doesn't matter what the article is named now; what matters is that we hurry things up so we can get consensus to decide on the article's name in the future.

<dd>I don't really care what it's called. The point is the AfD debate was a debate to keep or delete the article. It cannot be cited for consensus on anything else. This is no special case; there have been many other cases where the article was kept but eventually redirected elsewhere. Despite much argument, the fact is, if there is consensus, you can't fight it. And I don't think many people will be easily swayed by the fact that this article is currently at "American Terrorism". It's quite clear the original title was <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a>. I don't see any particular advantage in moving this page back there *now* because we might as well settle on consensus before another round of page moves. There is no consensus at all for what this article should be titled, and I'm sure we can all agree that before this page is moved yet again, we need consensus. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 20:17, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>John, the policy of Wikipedia is that articles are deleted only when there is consensus to do so. If an admin oversteps his authority and deletes an article without consensus, we restore the deleted article. We don't seek consensus about whether or not the article should be restored.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, this article has been deleted. The name was changed to something that was made up. The content was completely replaced by something that has nothing to do with the original term, and the actual term is redirected to the hijacked completely different article.</p>
<p>An AfD has already failed for this article. There is no consensus for deletion. Hijacking it, renaming it, redirecting it, and protecting the hijacking is nothing but a way around the decision of the AfD. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 21:24, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh, no. I believe I've already stated quite clearly that there's a precedent for all this â€” an AFD only indicates consensus (or a lack of it) to keep or delete an article. Once the AFD is closed, it's just a footnote. The page is to be treated like any other; if it's blanked, we revert. If people edit war on it, we protect it (or block them). If some guy wants to redirect it, it's redirected. If there's consensus to maintain that redirect, it's maintained, AFD be damned (you might want to review the various articles related to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> and her debut album that got AFDed and kept but later redirected). If there's no consensus to do so, then it's undone.

<dd>That is exactly the system we were following. There is not consensus to maintain the renaming or the redirecting, so it will be changed back to the way it was until we can get a consensus for change. Obviously there will never be consensus to change a term in common usage to one that an editor made up because original research, including the coining of a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a>, is specifically against Wikipedia guidelines. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 00:57, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to ask the administrators involved to do the right thing and not make the arbitration committee force it upon you. Regardless of how badly you want "American terrorism" to not exist, the fact remains that the term is in wide use, and there is no consensus to hijack, delete, rename, or redirect an article about it. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 01:44, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, of course. I don't want the term to exist. That's obviously it. It's not that your camp has decided use an article which is being used as a an extention of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html#United_States" title="State terrorism">State terrorism#United States</a> into a discussion of that term. It's not that someone searching for the (politically charged and <i>broadly</i> used, not <i>widely used</i>) term "American terrorism" isn't necessarily looking for a discussion of the neologism, but instead for State terrorism by the United States <i>or</i> Domestic terrorism in the United States. For the umpteenth damn time, Tom Harrison and I aren't trying to hijack your article. You're trying to hijack the search term. The creation of more specific articles using "American terrorism" as a disambiguation is not a "sweep under the rug" tactic. It's an attempt to broaden the conversation and make information which might relate to the term more readily and reasonably available. If you took one moment to think about this and <b>actually read</b> the proposals we're making, you'd see that we're not pushing POV; we're trying to include as much information as possible in an organized fashion. You seem to be trying to hijack the term so it can directly link to a polemic without any further consideration.

<dd>It's not a decision made lightly, I assure you. The whole thing is so toxic that I can't see a consensus developing. I am all for discussion as the optimal model for dispute resolution, but it's extremely discouraging when every alternate suggestion and all the reasoning behind those suggestions is explicitly and immediately dismissed as "trying to make the term going away" or derided as being part of some mass conspiracy. There is no possibility of good faith discussion when all attempts at discussion are arbitrarily ignored with a rather weak understanding of Wikipedia guidelines as justification. Look at the rest of this page and tell me that I'm unjustifiably concerned.</dd>

<p>i dunno if i'm too late or too early, but my vote is for "terrorism by the united states of america." "american terrorism" examples cited are adjective-noun string in sentences, not labels of the subject. for example, you'd get more hits for the string "american presidents" but <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">Presidents of the United States</a> is more appropriate as a title.

<li>It's entirely possible that this arbitration is the best way to resolve this. Either the term is notable or it's not -- if it is, it needs an article. I'd like to get some clear signals on this myself.</li>
<li>Moving the article around by means of vandalous redirects is a far less effective solution, and whether people feel like admitting it outright or not, that is precisely what has happened here.</li>
<li>Those who insist on defending such tactics <b>or their outcomes</b> are (you are quite correct) likely to make little progress toward dialogue with people who see such tactics as deeply inappropriate.</li>
<li>No one human being has yet stepped up to take responsibility for it, but it <b>somehow</b> became impossible for anyone but an admin to redirect this page back to the title that survived AfD.

<p>There was an AfD, and no consensus to delete <i>American terrorism</i>. <i>American terrorism</i> remains a page like any other, if more contentious. The question is what content to put on that page. Right now that page is locked, and its content is a redirect to <i>American Terror</i>. <i>American Terror</i> discusses usage of the term "American terrorism."</p>
<p>Again, the question (at least in this forum) is not "Who hit John?" but "What goes on the page?" I see three possibilities, based on what I imagine a middle-school student might want information about if he searched for <i>American terrorism</i>: Terrorism in America by Americans; Terrorism by Americans against others; The term "American terrorism."</p>
<p>I see this as an ambiguity that could be mitigated by making <i>American terrorism</i> a disambiguation page. I would like to hear reasoned arguments for and against that suggestion. If we can't manage that without arbitration, I will support arbitration. But arbitration isn't anyone's goal; is it? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 14:52, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arbitration is a failure state. It means that somebody is controlling this article and will not release it to be discussed from a neutral point of view. That somebody refuses to step forward and take responsibility for hijacking, renaming, redirecting, thereby essentially deleting the article on "American terrorism" without consensus. Everyone here is bringing up valuable points about content that can be discussed rationally as soon as the administrators involved release the article to its original state before it was hijacked. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 15:13, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quality of the article is unquestionably improved. As John has mentioned several times now, the AfD debate is immaterial to the current discussion. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> has very clearly explained my concerns in his immediate past contribution. I want to discuss what a person who searches for "American terrorism" is reasonably looking for, and what that search term should bring up. They are probably looking for, as Tom said, domestic terrorism in the United States or state terrorism by the United States government. This isn't to say that "American terrorism" as a term doesn't merit discussion. (I lost that argument, apparently, and have never contended otherwise.) It <i>is</i> to say that we should consider making "American terrorism" and "American terror" disambiguation and redirect pages, respectively. I don't see what's so POV-pushy about that. It makes good editorial sense.</dd>

<dd>The current article doesn't address domestic terror in the United States; it never can, because it is an extension, theoretically, of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html#United_States" title="State terrorism">State terrorism#United States</a>, and domestic terrorism is distinct from that. It lays equal claim to the search term "American terrorism," if not the political term. (It's debatable, but I don't think we need to debate it.)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>What it comes down to, then, is this: do we want a list of aspects of a complete, encyclopedic discussion of the various concepts which can be considered "American terrorism" being properly laid out as a result when the term is searched for? Or do we want an encyclopedic discussion of the term itself? I think the concept trumps the term. Apparently, you think the term trumps the concept.</dd>

<p>I believe <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism_%28term%29.html" title="American terrorism (term)">American terrorism (term)</a> is the right and the most representative title for this article. The term <i>Terrorism</i> is controversial in itself, let alone <i>American Terrorism</i>. We are experiencing the same paradigm in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. They are all terms and I am feeling sorry for the Wikipedia community for delving so hard to make a point. We rely on Google and forget that the <i>google</i> wikipedians use at this version is not representative at all! Why? Simple reason, Terrorism is called another term in another city! Let's not <i>promote</i> false propaganda based on <i>making a point</i>. I have to add a very essential note. If we are giving our opinions here in good faith, than please, let's do the same with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Most informative things first</span></h2>
<p>The first line of this article says "<b>American terrorism</b> is a controversial political neologism." I hardly think that is the most informative thing about <i>American terrorism</i>. Wikipedia editors report how a term is used. In every country but the <i>United Kingdom/States</i>, terrorism refers to the creation of terror, either through "a system of coercive intimidation" or by trying "to awaken or spread a feeling of terror or alarm" (<a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">OED</a>). <b>American terrorism</b> is simply the creation of terror by the United States of America (through "a system of coercive intimidation" or by trying "to awaken or spread a feeling of terror or alarm" in its own people). Ask pretty much any person outside of the <i>United Kingdom/States</i>, and they'll explain something along those lines as the definition of "American terrorism." That's a lot more informative than making people read truisms about politics being controversial and types of grammar. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 23:09, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've determined, by consensus, that the article about the use of the term, and I think we have an obligation to follow through on that. Reporting on the phenomenon as though it were an objectively identifiable process, like <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthesis.html" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> or something, is outside the scope of this article, I think. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken up somewhere else, though, if you can get consensus, but I have a feeling connecting any nation's unique brand of terrorism to a specific article would be a difficult sell. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> 14:55, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The intro</span></h2>
<p>CltFn wrote in his edit summary, <i>The intro you keep reinserting is ambiguous, are you doing this on purpose?</i></p>
<p>CltFn, only in the same sense you are; that is, we're trying to write a good article. Some of my concern about the intro is this part: <i>to negatively characterize the conduct of various officials of influence in specific administrations of the United States government or their proxy agents during specific military or foreign campaigns</i>. To me, that does not describe what either Chomsky or West are saying. Further down the page, we write:</p>
<dl>
<dd>West described decades of official tolerance of lynching and crimes of violence against blacks as "American terrorism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now I think <i>decades of tolerance by officials</i> more acurately describes West's position, but leave that for now. What West is alleging is not limited to specific administrations, or to specific campaigns, or even to specific officials. He's alleging a pattern of institutional racism that he says constitutes <i>American terrorism</i>. (I'm not saying that, I'm just saying Dr. West is saying that.)</p>
<p>The intro above is too narrow to accomodate what West is saying. I think our description of what the term means has to be driven by documented uses of the term. We find uses of the term, see what those uses have in common, and use the intro to build a box to hold what we find. I look forward to hearing the other editors' thoughts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 00:04, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually if you read the quotes you googled , they all provide a specific scope and context for the label of "American Terrorism" . The context defines specific participants at specific historical time periods in specific place. The intro should reflect the specificity of the topic rather than a blurred generalization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your inclusion of Cornel West's hyperbolic exploitation of a politically charged phrase may not be applicable to this article because although the issues he raises are social ills they would hardly qualify as American Terrorism in the sense as it is applied to the US government. To fail to make this distinction will eventually lead to inserting every instance of domestic violence, or violent conflicts between human beings that take place in the United States under the topic of this page as they all could be called American Terrorism too. --<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 03:16, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the book too; I expect the controversial part will be <i>American terrorism</i> as acts of terrorism carried out by the US government.

Maybe we could agree to not link this from the dab page until US state-sponsored terrorism has settled down. Or we could put up the disambiguation page with a link to US state-sponsored terrorism (or whatever it's called) and then lock down the dab page. I just would like to avoid another festival of redirects and deletions, and confine the controversy to the controvesial page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 15:30, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A potential problem with separating the terms is that some of them are interrelated. For instance, socio-political analysts have argued that our terrorism of other countries wouldn't be possible without terrorism of our own people.

<dd>Webster reconciled contradictory meanings of terms, from people with roots all over Europe, into one <i>complete</i> language. The "complete" part is the important thing here. It means that if a concept exists, there is also a term to describe it. Today, our language is in disarray again. I could give you a dozen concepts that lack terms to describe them off the top of my head. One of them is "terrorism." As I'm sure you realize, when I say "terrorism," that doesn't <i>mean</i> anything. I didn't convey any information to you, and that's my point.</dd>

<dd>"Terrorism" used to mean something. It used to convey a specific idea. It doesn't any more, but the <i>concept</i> behind <i>terrorism</i> still exists. It just doesn't have a term to describe it. As a result, we can't describe <i><b>anything</b></i> that contains the word <i>terrorism</i> in more than pejorative or ambiguous terms. Look at this article, for example: "American terrorism is a controversial political neologism." Wow! That really gets to the heart of the matter, doesn't it?</dd>

<dd>If I thought that the definition would be accepted in the article, I would have put it there. My point is that the <i>concept</i> of "systems of terror created for the purpose of intimidation and political gain" exists, whether we have a term to describe it or not. In order to communicate efficiently, we need to have a term for every concept. The reason why it takes five articles to describe such a simple concept is that we don't really want to describe it. We want to bury the concept in mountains of ambiguous, pejorative terms, so we can pretend it doesn't exist. "The United States is not a terrorist nation!" So says President Bush. In order to prove him right, all we have to do is perform a juggling act to keep everything in the air.</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your statement that "America doesn't do that." A terrorist is someone who uses terror as a weapon. The object of that terror can be something that the terrorist did, or it can be an act perpetrated by another person but used to create a system of terror to achieve a political goal. Consider 9/11, for instance. There was no coercion associated with it. Nobody made demands. Nobody said that they would blow up more buildings unless we did something. In fact, the Pentagon was obviously a military objective, and anyone following the protests of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a> would know that the trade towers were a military objective as well. We only got the idea that we were supposed to feel terrorized when President Bush used the attack as a springboard for his <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a>, and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities_5add.html" title="2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities">2004 reelection campaign</a>.</dd>

<dd>Compare that with some <i>real</i> terrorism, and you can see the difference: the U.N. estimates that 1.8 million people died as a direct result of our sanctions in Iraq during the '90s. You might argue that they deserved it, but that doesn't change the fact that we used the sanctions as a means of coercion. Whether or not a <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/crisisindex.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/crisisindex.htm" rel="nofollow">half-million</a> Iraqi children deserved to die from malnutrition and preventable disease as a direct result of our sanctions, the fact remains that we employed systems of terror as a means of intimidation in Iraq during the 1990s. Unlike the 9/11 attacks, we made demands and threatened more sanctions, and consequently more lingering deaths of their children, if they didn't comply. While we may be insolated from the horror associated with our actions here in the United States, most of the rest of the world is not. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out why they attack us once take a hard look at what they see. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 02:20, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a good reason against merging, for a discussion of a term is certainly different from a discussion about a subject. In any case, from the above evidence there is sufficient reason for an article about the term "American terrorism". Thus:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's simply list what can be considered US terrorism</span></h2>
<p>There should be a list of events that certain groups consider US terrorism:</p>
<p>- US conquer of Hawaii and the Philippines, where the most infamous massive atrocities against people and their islamic religion was committed and many villages were burned by the soldiers. Muslims were executed and their bodies were dropped into pools of pig blood, which made them unsuitable for Allah's paradise due to ritual dirt.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were Muslims in Hawaii?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Atrocities during Mexico land grabs</p>
<ul>
<li>Is an atrocity necessarily an act of terrorism?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- There was a belgian town which totally razed by B-26 carpet bombers in WWII, because the US Army was too afraid to go in on foot and siege it due to very well built nazi defences. Entire civilian population of the city was killed in the aerial bombing.</p>
<ul>
<li>How is this different from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventional_warfare.html" title="Conventional warfare">Conventional warfare</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- The firebombing of Drezden and Tokyo in early 1945 (2 x 130k dead)</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the number dead have necessarily have anything to do with whether or not something is terrorism?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Hirosima and Nagasaki in August 1945 (250k and 110k dead)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead people can't be terrorized. Who was terrorized here? Within the context of "terrorism," what was the purpose of these attacks?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Agent Orange/White/Blue chemical-genetical weapons use in Vietnam (1 million vietnamese dead and frequent birth deformations even today)</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the primary purpose of this to terrorize someone into submission, or as a direct attack against an enemy?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Napalm in Vietnam (also see the famous little girl photo)</p>
<ul>
<li>By the time this photo was taken, nobody in the United States through the Vietnamese would "give up" if we applied enough pressure. The famous little girl was collateral damage from a direct military attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Shelling of 12 lebanese coastal villages by USN BB New Jersey, killing 5000 kids, women, elderly (all men were away labouring in the cities during the workdays)</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the motivation for this attack? What purpose did it serve? What were the goals?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Downing of the iranian A300 pilgrim plane. Iran considers this terrorism, since the Vincennes was actively engaged in artillery combat against iranian swiftboats that patrolled iranian territorial waters during the time it fired the SAM missile at the A300.</p>
<ul>
<li>Were we trying to make the Iranian people afraid of flying? Even if we believe the act was deliberate, what kind of terror were we trying to promote in the Iranian people by shooting down their aircraft?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- CIA role in assasination of foreign politicians. Salvador Allende is a prime example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we trying to make them terrified of becoming politicians, or is this just another example of a direct attack against someone we don't like?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- US gave support of billions of dollars for the internationally excommunicated apartheid south african regime, money was was proxied via Israel. This money allowed the apartheid regime to maintain its racist black slavery system for four decades and to invade Angola and kill tens of thousands.</p>
<ul>
<li>What was our motive for doing this within the context of "terrorism?"</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Sabotage of a major soviet natural gas pipeline during the 1980's, with a very big explosion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did we do this with the motive of terrorizing Soviets? Did we hope that they would submit themselves to our authority is we blew up their pipeline?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Continued monetary and military support for Israel, which does everything US does not dare, like chasing away 3 million arabs, who had a continuous 1500 year history of living in the same place, dropping US made cluster bombs on villages, bulldozing arab houses by the hundreds to change the ethnical standing of the Holy Land area, helicopter assasinations, land grab fences, invading and occupying foreign territory and banning interracial marriage!</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we separate the violence and the atrocities from the terrorism here, or are we just throwing it all against the wall to see what sticks? The purpose of this article is to identify items that fall specifically into the category of "American terrorism," not to list every <i>bad</i> thing that the United States has ever done.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
- Continued US air strikes against civilian groups in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are later baged as "collateral damage" and forgotten.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to hide or "forget" collateral damage defeats the purpose of terrorism, which requires the spreading of terror.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Unless we want this article to become a catch-all for grievances against the United States, I think we need to define constraints for what would fit into this definition. I propose that no method of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventional_warfare.html" title="Conventional warfare">conventional warfare</a> be considered "American terrorism." If the primary function of an attack is to reduce the military capability of the other team, the main purpose couldn't <i>also</i> be to spread terror. Furthermore, terrorism requires some sort of at least <i>implied</i> <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">coercion</a>. If we express our examples of <b>American terrorism</b> in terms of how they meet these two minimum requirements, <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconventional_warfare.html" title="Unconventional warfare">unconventional warfare</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">coercion</a>, we will have a stronger and much more useful article. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 14:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Neither are they examples of usage of the term <i>American terrorism</i>.

<li>It would be POV, however, to suggest that WP holds as an objective fact that the ZOG a) exists or b) controls US policy.</li>
<li>Also, prominent people who argue in favor of any implied <i>ZOG-like</i> phenomenon or process, without being on the record as having actually said things like "Zionist," would not, in my view, belong in the text.</li>
<li>What we as editors personally do or don't consider to be evidence of ZOG (or American terrorism) seems well outside of the scope of what this article is about. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> 15:43, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>All words have both <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptive.html" title="Prescriptive">prescriptive</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descriptive.html" title="Descriptive">descriptive</a> meanings.

<dd>Less than 5% of the world's population adopted President Bush's definition of terrorism.

<dl>
<dd>That was the best I could do to explain the problem in a single paragraph. Let me try expanding a bit:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The purpose of language is to convey information. A language is only as strong as the definitions of its terms. An effective term conveys a distinct packet of information that is the same in the mind of the sender as it is in the mind of the receiver. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and our most popular books create this essential equality between what we are saying and what the other person hears. When that bond is broken and a civilization loses its ability to communicate and combine concepts, it will surely fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Linguists say that Wikipedians cannot understand this concept, that we will confuse words and meanings to the point that saying something distinct will mean something else in the mind of the person hearing the term, or will be so ambiguous that it doesn't mean anything. Some people say that Wikipedia will bring the English language to its knees because we will create official alternate meanings out of every notable "misuse" of a term, effectively eliminating the power of that term to convey a distinct packet of information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Members of the cabal keep tightening controls to keep our definitions from getting watered down, but that only serves to make the articles subject to their personal bias. You could argue that <i>all</i> resources like dictionaries are subject to the POV of their authors, but I have read Webster, and I can assure you that the cabal is no Webster. Top-down control is not going to make Wikipedia a superior resource. Instead, Wikipedia uses a kind of Darwinism to come up with its best articles. The strongest and <i>most fit</i> definition wins. In a society of equals, a Wikipedia edit can survive if it meets two essential qualifications: 1) it <i><b>must</b></i> receive more support than any other edit, and 2) it <i><b>must</b></i> be within the tolerance level of <i><b>all</b></i> contributing editors. The obvious question follows, what do we do when these two necessities conflict? The answer is that we work it out - we allow the evolution of these articles to take its natural course. Peer based evolution of an article can work through cooperation or confrontation, but it can never work through control. Top-down control of content eliminates the multi-faceted filtering process that would normally allow a term to convey distinct and universally agreeable information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, it befalls us, a groups of peer editors, to ultimately save or destroy the linguistic foundation of our society. Wikipedia is becoming the largest and most googled resource on the planet. How can the relatively uneducated masses of Wikipedia surpass the great linguists of the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webster%27s_Dictionary_d964.html" title="Webster's Dictionary">Webster's Dictionary</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a>? We have one thing going for us that too few people understand. In a system of equals, the content of an article will always have the <i>unanimous</i> consent of all contributing editors in order to survive. With the exception of the cabal, Wikipedia is organized to naturally enable the best articles to rise to the top on two criteria: 1) it must be popular, in both number of people and how passionately people feel about it, and 2) the narrative voice of the article must not offend even a single editor with something that the editor considers to be a biased presentation of the facts or a disputed uncited conclusion. This sets a standard as high as <i><b>any</b></i> other resource, and gives us <i><b>more</b></i> power to reach that standard. Every one of us knows a few things that will keep our language from degrading, and a few things that will make it stronger. When we combine the knowledge, experience, and disparate POV of the thousands of people who view each article, and who are also free to edit it, and who must ultimately consent to the content in order for the article to be stable, our quality-control process is many times more powerful than what any other single person or small body of people can accomplish. To find the definition that conveys the most distinct and universally recognized packet of information for each term, the article will go through <i>your</i> filter of common usage, <i>my</i> filter of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptive.html" title="Prescriptive">prescription</a> based on <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_nouns.html" title="Latin nouns">elements</a>, someone else's filter of making sure that every possible concept has a distinct term (which might mean combining or dividing this article), and dozens of other refinements that we haven't even though about. None of these purifiers reduce the effectiveness of the others, nor do they keep a final result from happening. We all have the same goal of making a strong article that conveys information and that everyone can live with, and we will all do whatever it takes to reach that goal. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 23:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could say the same thing in German in about three sentences, and everyone would understand me, because that language has precise terms that encompass the fundamental concepts. If you think trying to <i>understand</i> a complex problem in American English is frustrating, imagine how it is for someone trying to <i>convey</i> it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that, as editors of Wikipedia, we have a chance to reverse the trend. English can be a strong language again. We can provide a distinct meaning for every term, and a distinct term for every concept. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 03:08, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's interesting watching the Cabal work. First they try to delete the article. Then they try to redirect it to a title that doesn't mean anything. After that, they try to merge it with an unrelated article. If all else fails, they change the content of the article to mean absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Imagine that you just paid $1600 for a nice set of Britannica encyclopedia books. You want to impress your dinner guests, so you flip open to a random definition that you've never heard. You announce to your friends that your slick new encyclopedia will teach you enough about your random term that you will be able to use it definitively in a sentence. After all, isn't that what encyclopedias are for? The article that you picked says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_________ is a controversial political neologism. It is meant to negatively characterize a variety of crimes allegedly perpetrated by the government of the USA, by its citizens, or proxy agents.</p>
<p>Some of the controversy associated with the term has to do with disputes over the actual definition of terrorism, and some with the substance of the allegations. The term's usage (and controversy) appears to have increased in parallel with media coverage of terrorism since the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Bush administration's proclamation of a War on Terrorism, but its usage to refer to lynching dates back to at least 1996.</p>

<p><b>Disputes over the use of the term</b><br />
In any discussion of the proper usage of the term terrorism, identifying a common definition is a difficult and contentious matter. One 1988 study by the US Army (PDF) found that over 100 definitions of the word terrorism have been used. That diversity of opinion has not, however, prevented intellectuals such as Cornell West and Noam Chomsky from using the term _________ or associating themselves with it prominently in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the above definition, would you be able to use ________ definitely in a sentence? Or, would you be the laughing stock of your dinner party? Would you feel like chastising your Britannica salesman quite sternly?

<dd>When we define something as an "umbrella term" or as a "negatively characterizing" "controversial political neologism," we give politicians all the ammo they need. We also make it impossible to talk about the real issues. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 17:57, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV</span></h2>
<p>Every commentator listed as supporting "American terrorism" is a left wing commentator, and widely known to be on the fringe and/or extremist. You have Noam Chomsky who comments against America and American imperialism and is on the fringe left. Cornel West who is a communist and black militant. Hugo Chavez who is a communist in his own nation opposed to the United States for political gain. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who has called the Holocaust a 'myth' and is president of one of the United State's oldest enemies. Gore Vidal has called the Oklohoma City bombings the result of the FBI for stricter terror laws. Finally there is Howard Zinn a Marxist-historian who has written a revisionist history of the United States.</p>
<p>Where is one, just one, mainstream or widely accepted or respected academic or leader who can lay claim against the United States or believes in "American Terrorism"? This page is pure POV and deserves to be deleted or merged with another topic. However, if a reasonable source can be found that is reputable and has consensus support, at least in the world at large not necessairly wikipedia, then this article will have merit, but until then this is just a polemic of anti-Americanism User:63.161.169.67</p>

<dd>Secondly, the fact that someone is well known for expressing specific political viewpoints makes him or her more notable, not less so.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrorism -- In America and from Americans</span></h2>
<p>It's probably the same in most nations, although the United States does have ICBMs as a patent advantage. Military troop members are the most prevalent terrorists when constituents are non-cooperative or pre-occupied outside the national security realm of active influence.</p>
<p>Terrorist techniques include the ingestion of dairy products which cause abdominal distress, then a targeting of individual constituents who have been observed to be engaged in questionable conduct -- most prevalent, probably, near oil refineries and other might-become-volatile manufacturing sites. 06:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)1/3/2006 beadtot</p>

<dd>That's the implication. ('If only Americans were consistent, they would by definition acknowledge that they are terrorists; it's only their inconsistency that allows them to claim otherwise.")

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></h2>
<p>The examples listed in the article for operations organized or supported by the U.S. that some have called "terrorism" gives the misimpression that Mai Lai massacre is one of the only such events since WII. The casual reader is thus given the impression that this issue is just an academic exercise.</p>
<p>To rectiy this situation, today I added several post-war examples, which I prefaced by something like "some critics have also given the following as examples of terrorist operations organized or supported by the U.S." Operation Ajax, Operation Condor, Operation Northwoods (proposed by the joint chiefs but never implemented, the Cuban Project (also known as Operation Mongoose).</p>
<p>Why was this deleted? Will the deleter please identify her/himself and her/his reasons? If you check Wipidia's entries under each of these, you'll find ample reasons why some have suggested these as examples of American terrorism? What part of this do you dispute, deleter? GB in NY Jan 5/06.</p>

<dd>Hi GB; First, you can always see who did anything by looking at the page history. There is a tab at the top labeled <i>history</i> that will show you who did what, with a brief summary of the edit.</dd>

<dd>What you wrote, "some critics have also given the following as examples..." is not well enough <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a>. "Some critics say," while common, is the language of innuendo. We need to know who says. Find a notable published quote of someone calling Operation Northwoods terrorism, and I will support its inclusion here. This page is about <i>American terrorism</i> as a term, not as a thing. We are not collecting examples of actions by the U.S. that someone might consider terrorism. We want examples of people calling actions terrorism. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 00:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While not necessarily being labeled as 'terrorism', the alleged war crimes that the mentioned US administrations have been accused of doing may be considered the closest thing to state sponsored terrorism the US government has participated. These examples, however speculative and ungrounded, are relevant to how the media, both past and present, have portrayed the listed administrations as controversial and corrupt. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuneraako_4690.html" title="User:Luneraako">Luneraako</a> 23:01, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that it's relevant to media portrayal, but this article is about the term <i>American terrorism</i>, as a term. If the alleged actions aren't labeled as terrorism, they aren't really relevant to use of the term 'American terrorism.' I also think there is a distinction to be made between atrocities, war crimes, and terrorism. I'd be reluctant to open this page up to general-purpose anti-U.S. allegations. The list of alleged war crimes might do better continuing on its own.</dd>

<p>The discussion about the title seems to have died down since December but by no means was resolved so this seems like as good a time as any for starting the move discussion.

The disambiguation page that is at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a> should be moved to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="American terrorism (disambiguation)">American terrorism (disambiguation)</a> and this page should be moved there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">@ usage of the term</span></h2>
<p>HenryS said: <i>Many people use the the term</i> American terrorism <i>with meaning</i> terrorism in America<i>. There are famous acts of terror and terrorists in the USA, so the term is pure legitimate. On other hand some people use the term with meaning</i> terrorism of the USA, as a state<i>. That is meaningless (see <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html#ST_Dispute" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>)</i><br />
"Dear HenryS, June 29, you added the above. It consists of 4 statements I think: Meaning A, then your opinion, then meaning B, then your opinion on that. Firstly, I think this is already covered in the disambiguation page, which is mentioned on top of this article. Secondly, I believe that <i>state terrorism</i> and <i>terrorism by a state</i> are two completely different things. The first being overt, and directed towards its own population, the second usually covert, and directed towards non-citizens.
