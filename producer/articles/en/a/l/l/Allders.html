<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allders.html" title="Edit section: Joshua Allder">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Joshua Allder</span></h2>
<p>Allders was opened in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> at 102 and 103 North End, central Croydon, as a 'linen draper and silk mercer' by Joshua Allder (<a href="../../../1/8/3/1838.html" title="1838">1838</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>) from <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walworth%2C_London_01ae.html" title="Walworth, London">Walworth</a> who had served his apprenticeship in Croydon. His shop was diverse, with special offers on silk dresses but also a mourning dress section, and departments offering lower-cost items such as buttons and ribbons. This diversity showed a shrewdness in business and an understanding of his mostly female customers.</p>
<p>Croydon was a growing town, and Allder's business grew with it. It was not long before the shop expanded into 104, 106 and 107 North End - he had to wait for some twenty years to take 105, a bakery. The wealth Allder made allowed him to play a prominent part in the local community, on the Local Board of Health, on the council of the County Borough of Croydon for nine years and in the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-conformist.html" title="Non-conformist">non-conformist</a> church community. He supported greater rights for his workers, being instrumental in getting local stores closed for a half-day on Wednesdays. Joshua Allder died in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> leaving a store which had already expanded beyond clothing and haberdashery to sell glass and porcelain, for example.</p>
<p>His main Residence in Pampisford Road now houses Regina Ceoli RC school, and two cul-de-sacs nearby were named Allder Way, and Joshua Close</p>
<p><a name="Growth_and_decline" id="Growth_and_decline"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allders.html" title="Edit section: Growth and decline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Growth and decline</span></h2>
<p>In 1908, Allder's family sold the business to J.W. Holdron and F.C. Bearman, owners of stores in <a href="../../../p/e/c/Peckham.html" title="Peckham">Peckham</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leytonstone.html" title="Leytonstone">Leytonstone</a>, respectively. They developed the store into fifty departments with 500 staff and owned the business until 1921. It then passed to the Lawrence family, under whose control it became a limited company. In 1926, the famous North End facade was created, uniting the frontage of the premises for the first time. In 1932, the Arcade from North End to George Street was completed, which proved very popular with its varied concessions, a herald of shopping malls of the future. Allders was considered a pioneering retailer.</p>
<p>The building suffered considerable damage in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> but never closed. The refurbishment saw improvements, including the takeover of a cinema auditorium as the gift department and Croydon's first escalators in 1954. By 1958, however, the Lawrence family were forced to sell as a result of death duties incurred after the death of David Lawrence, managing director. The store was acquired by Jack &amp; Bernard Lyons' <b>United Drapery Stores</b>, owners of the Richard chain of fashion shops, John Collier, Alexandre Tailors and several department stores. The son of David Lawrence was kept on by UDS as MD. Allders continued to expand, reaching a £1 million turnover in 1958 and £3 million by 1963. Fashion's importance declined, with household items taking a greater role.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, there was considerable change in Croydon, particularly the construction of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitgift_Centre_4fe4.html" title="Whitgift Centre">Whitgift Centre</a> to the north side of Allders (into which the store expanded) and the creation of the St George's Walk development. Transport and lifestyle changes, however, led to greater competition with the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_of_London_ea44.html" title="West End of London">West End</a> and further improvements were required to modernise the store. The section of the store fronting George Street was rebuilt and expanded, retaining a Victorian facade, alongside a new addition. Rebuilding works continued into Dingwall Avenue and by 1976, Allders had 1,700 staff and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m²) of floor space. It was a Croydon landmark and the third largest department store in the UK after <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrods.html" title="Harrods">Harrods</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfridges.html" title="Selfridges">Selfridges</a>. It boasted the largest Carpet Department in Europe amongst other claims. Croydon was by this time a major retail centre. Allders immediate competitor, Kennards, was renamed <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debenhams.html" title="Debenhams">Debenhams</a> in 1973 (along with many other Debenhams stores). To compete with the central buying and advertising of Debenhams, and other larger groups, the department stores owned by UDS were all gradually renamed 'Allders'. This process began with the renaming of Shinners of <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutton%2C_London_4a32.html" title="Sutton, London">Sutton</a> in 1979 and later included Hinds of <a href="../../../e/l/t/Eltham.html" title="Eltham">Eltham</a>, Medhursts of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromley.html" title="Bromley">Bromley</a>, Pages of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberley.html" title="Camberley">Camberley</a>, Willis Ludlow of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingston_upon_Hull_19f8.html" title="Kingston upon Hull">Hull</a> and Landport Drapery Bazaar (LDB) in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. Only Arding &amp; Hobbs at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clapham_Junction_24a2.html" title="Clapham Junction">Clapham Junction</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and the furnishing store of Clover at <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkstall.html" title="Kirkstall">Kirkstall</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> retained their original identities. A new geometric logo of ten orange 'A's arranged in a circle on brown and cream coloured stationery, bags and carpets appeared across the group together with the phrase 'All that a great store should be'.</p>
<p>In 1983, the Lyons family sold the UDS Group to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanson_plc.html" title="Hanson plc">Hanson plc</a> and Allders became a flagship company of the group, with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hanson%2C_Baron_Hanson_a722.html" title="James Hanson, Baron Hanson">Lord Hanson</a> appearing on Allders' roof in TV adverts. During this time, Allders expanded with new stores opening in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basildon.html" title="Basildon">Basildon</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatham%2C_Medway_e556.html" title="Chatham, Medway">Chatham</a> and in many international airports as <a href="../../../d/u/t/Duty-free.html" title="Duty-free">duty-free</a> concessions. A new 'Fourth Floor' was built on the roof of the Croydon store to house a new Audio and Television Department and two new restaurants as well as a link into the staff areas of London House on Dingwall Avenue. The group's brown, cream and orange livery was replaced with a scheme of light blue and gold lettering on a dark blue background.</p>
<p>In 1989, a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Management_buyout.html" title="Management buyout">management buyout</a> saw the international arm spun off as a separate company. There was continued upheaval in Croydon with the complete refurbishment of the Whitgift Centre and of parts of Allders flagship store. The vast carpet department was contracted to a secondary location allowing for the creation of a new perfumery and cosmetics hall at the centre of the Ground Floor. A new Allders department store of 137,000 square feet opened at <a href="../../../w/o/k/Woking.html" title="Woking">Woking</a> in 1992. Allders plc was floated on the stock market in 1993. In September 1996 Allders purchased a number of stores from the <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Owen_be35.html" title="Owen Owen">Owen Owen</a> group that previously traded under the <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis%27s.html" title="Lewis's">Lewis's</a> and Owen Owen names. This included branches in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basingstoke.html" title="Basingstoke">Basingstoke</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/f/Ilford.html" title="Ilford">Ilford</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redditch.html" title="Redditch">Redditch</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slough.html" title="Slough">Slough</a>.</p>
<p>Shares in Allders crashed in 1998 after disappointing sales and difficulties integrating the Maples furniture group which it had acquired. Nevertheless it continued a policy of expansion and acquisition, opening a store on <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a> in London's West End and having in total 45 outlets. Problems continued however. In Croydon, there were plans to build a new shopping centre, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park_Place_%28Croydon%29_a13d.html" title="Park Place (Croydon)">Park Place</a>, on the store's current site and much of the area to the south. A new Allders would be built opposite Croydon's Town Hall. Croydon Council's partner in this plan was developer <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minerva_%28property_firm%29.html" title="Minerva (property firm)">Minerva plc</a>. In late <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Minerva was part of a new group called Scarlett Retail that bid for Allders, with <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehman_Brothers_d21a.html" title="Lehman Brothers">Lehman Brothers</a> investment bank and a management team including Terry Green, the former chief executive of <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debenhams.html" title="Debenhams">Debenhams</a> and <a href="../../../b/h/s/BHS_66e2.html" title="BHS">BHS</a>. There had also been rumours of a merger with <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Fraser_915d.html" title="House of Fraser">House of Fraser</a> or a combined bid from Allders shareholder <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hunter_1555.html" title="Tom Hunter">Tom Hunter</a>.</p>
<p>Some felt at the time that Scarlett's bid was based on Minerva's intention to acquire Allders' top site in Croydon for its Park Place project, in order to then sell the plot on to another retailer, probably <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lewis_f0ad.html" title="John Lewis">John Lewis</a>. The bid was felt by many to be overpriced. Nevertheless, Scarlett paid Tom Hunter an improved price and they landed the company in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> for about £162m ($316m). Green became chief executive and set about an overhaul of Allders' image. Much of the traditional homeware, haberdashery and clothing for middle-aged, middle-income women was reduced, with a new emphasis on young fashion and beauty products.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allders.html" title="Edit section: Administration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Administration</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2004.html" title="September 2004">September 2004</a>, Minerva announced that Allders had made a loss of £22.6m for the year to <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">30 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077705.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077705.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, blaming the speed of the transformation of the business. In December, it announced the business was up for sale. However, no interest was found in taking on the company as a whole and it was placed in administration on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. It was revealed that there was a pensions deficit of £15 million. 130 of the staff at the Croydon headquarters were laid off, including Green and other senior managers.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/r/o/Kroll.html" title="Kroll">Kroll</a>, the administrators, once again searched for buyers for the chain or individual stores. Of Allders' 45 stores, only 35 received offers, with rival retailers such as House of Fraser, <a href="../../../b/h/s/Bhs.html" title="Bhs">Bhs</a>, Debenhams and Next said to have expressed an interest. The ten remaining stores, including the Oxford Street branch, began closing-down sales on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">5 February</a>.</p>

<p>In May 2005, it was announced that the owners of <a href="../../../j/a/e/Jaeger_%28clothing_retailer%29.html" title="Jaeger (clothing retailer)">Jaeger</a> would take on the flagship Croydon store and that it would continue to trade as Allders. In the first year of operation the new Managing Director Andrew MacKenzie has turned the fortunes of the company around and has projected a £1Million gross profit for the first year. Significant investment has been made to attract back to the store its Croydon audience. It is now the only Allders still in existence.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allders.html" title="Edit section: Development Threat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Development Threat</span></h2>
<p>In April 2006, it was announced that Allders had secured an extension to their lease through to 2008 as reported in the <i>Croydon Guardian</i>: <a href="http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.742239.0.allders_safe_for_two_years.php" class="external text" title="http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.742239.0.allders_safe_for_two_years.php" rel="nofollow">Allders safe for two years</a> safeguarding the jobs of almost 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The land and store that Allders lease has regular break clauses to the benefit of the 'virtual freehold leaseholder' held by Minerva subsidiary companies for 250 years. The freehold interest is held by the Croydon Whitgift Foundation, following a deal in the lead up to the Compulsory Purchase Order with Minerva to ensure their long term financial interests (they were founded in the late 16th Century).</p>
<p>The current development agreement between Minerva and Croydon Council was amended at the time that Allders went into administration to a single phase development that includes demolition of the current Allders store and a 5 year wait until the new development is completed. This would be untenable for Allders. The original development agreement between Croydon Council and Minerva was based on a two phase development enabling Allders to stay on site until their new store was completed and fitted out. The new Conservative administration (elected May 2006) of Croydon Council has no plans to change the phasing of the development back to a single phase and are therefore (currently) prepared to see Croydon loose its unique asset, namely Allders.</p>
<p>The overall viability of the Minerva plans (1.08 Million Sq.Ft Shopping Centre) have been thrown into doubt following the building of the 1.615 Million Sq.Ft <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westfield_London_383d.html" title="Westfield London">Westfield London</a> shopping centre development in west London (white city) due to open late next year (2008) and the existing 1.6 Million Sq.Ft shopping development at <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluewater.html" title="Bluewater">Bluewater</a> to the east of London.</p>
