In other words, it was more independent than India at the time, but was not capable of declaring war on Japan in its own right.

<dd>But there is no list of declarations of war in that article; the Allies are simply a list of countries. And -- apart from the fact that it wasn't an independent country in 1941 -- I can't find evidence of a declaration of war by the Philippines in 1941.

<p>The article claims that Newfoundland was an independent member of the British Commonwealth. This is surely incorrect - at the time of the declaration of war (1939), Newfoundland was a British colony. Conversely, even though the British Indian Empire was governed from London, there was a separate Indian declaration of war (all other British colonies were deemed to have declared war upon the UKs declaration) and therefore India should be included. Not being an expert, is there anyone who can clarify this&#160;? Thanks--Ordew 15:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems you are right about Newfoundland and I have just removed it from the list of declarations. There was a separate "declaration" by the British <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_India_73ad.html" title="Government of India">Government of India</a>, but it was not like Canada declaring war. It would be incorrect to assume that, for example, during the gap between the British and Indian declarations, the Indian authorities would not have acted to impound hypothetical German merchant shipping in Indian ports. I mean the Indian military was effectively part of the British military. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 17:14, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A President and constitution does not necessarily mean independence. The title "President" was used in some British colonies. Several British colonies gained self-government under their own constitutions in the 1850s. A constitution makes a state, it doesn't necessarily make an <i>independent state</i>. The Philippines did not control its own foreign affairs or defense in 1941-45. The U.S. even had the right to absorb all of the Philippine forces into the U.S. military, which it did in December 1941. Britain had no such control over Dominion armed forces (indeed it didn't even have that power in World War One).</p>
<p>Newfoundland and <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia.html" title="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> had limited "<a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-governing_colony.html" title="Self-governing colony">self-governing colony</a>" status during World War II. (The <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_f706.html" title="Dominion of Newfoundland">Dominion of Newfoundland</a> ceased to exist in 1934.) As for foreign policy, see the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_Westminster_2e54.html" title="Statute of Westminster">Statute of Westminster</a> (1931). All of the existing Dominions had the ability to decline to take part in WW2. The Dominions had already show a willingness to disobey Britain in foreign policy, even before the Statute. And those that had ratified the Statute needed to make separate declarations of war in 1939, in order for them to be formally at war. Australia underlined this point in 1942 by backdating ratification to September 1939. South Africa, which had strong historical ties to Germany, almost stayed neutral. The Republic of Ireland, which was technically a Dominion at the time, remained neutral. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 17:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are now about 200 independent states in the world. Most of them were not independent in WW2. Many of these still contributed to the Allies in some way. We have to draw the line somewhere. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Participants_in_World_War_II_0a4c.html" title="Participants in World War II">Participants in World War II</a> article is the place for non-independent countries. I'm not sure what you mean about the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile; it was recognised internationally and lots of governments-in-exile did not control their territory. Bahawalpur seems to have been the only part of the Indian subontinent which was independent of Britain and declared war ins own right; the article <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahawalpur_District_de07.html" title="Bahawalpur District">Bahawalpur District</a> says "In 1936 Bahawalpur stopped paying tribute and openly declared independence." If someone has different information I would be interested to see it. While I agree that the "treatment of Filipinos were separate from the Americans", that is part of being a colonial country as much as an independent one. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 07:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems more accurate to place Greek's entrance into the Allied Forces around early 1941, not 1940. During the initial invasion, the Greeks held their own independantly. The Greeks were initially mistrustful of Churchill's intentions of putting Allied Forces back on European soil. Not the sort of attitude one would expect from an ally. See J.

<p>--I propose the removal of this from the "original Allies" section: "Poland never officially surrendered to the Third Reich and the Polish government in exile after 1939 continued the Polish contribution to World War II on several fronts with hundreds of thousands of members in the Polish Army in France and UK, as well as the Home Army in occupied Poland. The Soviet Union however, did not recognize the government and in 1943 organized the Polish People's Army under Rokossovsky, around which eventually it constructed the post-war successor state the People's Republic of Poland in 1952." Why go into so detailed about Poland here? This can be explained more properly in a specific article about Poland during the war effort. Here it just seemed tacked on. At the same time, I could give a whole history about Free France, and state how France was split into two governments, the de facto Vichy government which formed the armistice with Germany, and the de jure Free French government which was the continuation of the French Third Republic, in which case it is TECHNICALLY correct to state that "France" did not formally surrender, but that the split de facto "French State", as in "Vichy France", did. My point is not to add that, my point is to show that this quotation on Poland's continuing efforts following 1939 should be listed elsewhere for organization purposes. I received a message from someone complaining of this edit when I removed it from the article, so I'm explaining here WHY I think it should be removed. -Johan</p>

<p>That depends on who you're speaking to. Charles de Gaulle fully considered the Free French government as the continuation of the French Third Republic, and was his main points of discussion in such places as the Brazzaville Manifesto of 27 October 1940. This principle is precisely how he conducted himself during the Liberation of Paris; when the FFI leaders asked him to solemnly declare the reinstatement of the Republic, he refused, replying that the Republic had never ceased to exist (Is Paris Burning? - Larry Collins/Dominique Lapierre). As such, Free France was considered in the post-war world and in every French government since as the "real" de jure France, the continuation of the Third Republic. The idea that it was merely the "pre-Provisional Government" is an American notion, as during the time period, the United States recognized Vichy as the new French government (until 1943 with the foundation of the French Committee of National Liberation). (The United Kingdom only unofficially held contacts with Vichy, and considered Free France the official government of "French people continuing the war effort", but never quite muddled itself as much in these political affairs.) But in post-war France it was essentially established that Vichy France was an illegal government of traitors and Free France was the continuation of the Third Republic, and that's the way it's been seen since (in technical matters; the modern French educational system mainly teaches Vichy history, as Free France largely concerns the empire, most of which is no longer intact).</p>
<p>The designation of Free France as a continuation of the Third Republic is fairly legally established as well, considering de Gaulle was the last member of the Third Republic government to be safe from imprisonment (when in disagreement) by the Petainist coup d'etat. I should note that, if I remember correctly, Prime Minister Reynaud, who resigned because he wanted to continue the war effort from North Africa, did not officially resign (legally; rather, he merely fled and was later imprisoned); as such, Petain's coup d'etat was in fact TECHNICALLY unconstitutional (I state technically because one must keep in mind this was not at all so clear in the time period), and as such de Gaulle was TECHNICALLY correct when repeatedly stating he was the real French government. (De jure as opposed to de facto.)</p>
<p>My point is that the idea that Free France was not the direct heir to the French Third Republic (or continuation of it) is primarily an American influence, and that usually Free France is in fact considered the continuation of the Republic and the legal French government. As such, while for all practical purposes France under the French State DID surrender, the surrender itself technically did not happen because the de jure France, that is, Free France, did not surrender. It's all a matter of technicalities versus practicalities.</p>
<p>My personal opinion was that this should be left to the Free France topic, and correspondingly the discourse in the "Original Allies" section should be left to the Polish Contribution in WWII topic for organizational purposes. Perhaps leave links stating to see "Free France" and "Polish Contribution in WWII" for more information on the fates of the two Allied nations? Or, indeed, one COULD elaborate more on this subject and add the full description (such as that which I stated previously) on France to coincide with the Polish paragraph. I just don't know if that would be efficient.</p>

<dd>It's better now that there's a portion denoting the history of France during the war I suppose, but there's one thing I disagree with: the French Third Republic did not surrender. The French Third Republic was overthrown by the Vichy French State following the Petainist coup d'etat. As I said above, de Gaulle considered himself the continuation of the French Republic, and indeed so did Prime Minister Paul Reynaud (who refused to take part in the French surrender and left the government, but not officially; he was afterward imprisoned by Petain), who gave de Gaulle money before de Gaulle's June 17th flight to London, and who in his 1955 memoirs wrote: "All he did was comply with my instructions as a legitimate minister of the only constitutional French government. Of course I couldn’t guess he would be that successful while we were going head-on to a Coup d’Etat..." As such, I'm going to modify the sentence in the Wiki subsection to stating the "fall of the Third Republic" rather than its surrender.</dd>

<dd>The United Nations was the name of the Allies <b>during</b> the war. That power structure was formalized between October 1945 and the UN Security Council's first meeting in January 1946.

<dd>You know, I do not appreciate you deleting the reference as "silliness." You might think it is silly, but you are mischaracterizing a valid direct result of World War II.

<dd>The removed text in question is as follows, which I will quote so that others may judge its validity: This also resulted in these five nations being given permanent seats on the newly-formed <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Security_Council_459a.html" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a> which met for the first time on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> in the immediate aftermath of war.<sup id="_ref-UNSC-FIRST-MEETING_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UNSC-FIRST-MEETING" title="">[1]</a></sup> --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 07:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's fine to mention the US Security Council further down the page, but I don't believe that it belongs in the intro. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 08:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's no other section below where it would be easily inserted. Are you suggesting we create a section specially for the creation of the United Nations as a result of the alliances of World War II? While I would not be adverse to that, it seems like an even more significant change than to mention this as a single-line at the end of the lead paragraph. It also logically flows with the rest of the text. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 08:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It wouldn't really be such a big adjustment; we already have <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html#Declaration_by_United_Nations" title="Allies of World War II">a section on the Declaration by United Nations</a>; we probably should have more on the UN anyway, so that section could simply be be renamed "United Nations" and expanded. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 09:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Done. If you read it over, you will note that the Charter, which authorized the Security Council, was authored and signed <i>during</i> the war. It still bothers me how there was an insistence it was a post-War organization. While they did not meet formally as the UNSC until after the cessation of hostilities, all of this was produced during the war, and they met as the <i>de facto</i> leadership such as at the <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbarton_Oaks_Conference_b620.html" title="Dumbarton Oaks Conference">Dumbarton Oaks Conference</a> where the formation of the UNSC was decided. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 10:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
