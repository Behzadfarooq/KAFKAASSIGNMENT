	    <p>Nagorno-Karabagh: The world’s forgotten genocide. <a href="http://www.internationalreports.net" class="external free" title="http://www.internationalreports.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.internationalreports.net</a></p>
<p>A young Azerbaijan victim from the Nagorno-Karabagh war, 1991. As the Soviet Union weakened and fell, old historic animosities resurfaced in some of the Union’s republics. Beginning in 1988, Armenia encouraged the ethnic Armenian majority in the Azerbaijan autonomous district of Nagorno-Karabagh to seek independence and then join with Armenia. In 1992, Armenian troops invaded Nagorno-Karabagh with the help of Russian army units. They expelled all Azeri residents and destroyed towns, villages and infrastructure. They then took over the surrounding provinces, and expelled all Azeri residents. The Armenian occupation of nearly 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory created about a million refugees, over half of whom still live in unbelievably primitive conditions. The occupation and the refugees are Azerbaijan’s continuing national pain and recovering the occupied lands is the national aim. Armenians seize lands, expel Azeris with Soviet complicity "Altogether, the Armenian hunger for ever more land led them to deport Azerbaijanis from certain. areas during four different times in the 20th Century - in 1905, 1918-20, 1948-50, and in 1988. "In the 1988 deportation, more than 200,000 Azeris living in Armenia were uprooted from their homes, almost overnight. This last deportation was tantamount to ethnic cleansing - because afterwards there were no ethnic Azeris left anywhere in Armenia. To our great regret, this deportation took place under the Soviet regime, with the full armed support of the Soviet Red Army. Genocide in Khodjali,</p>
<pre>
In 1988,  pogroms began in the 126 Azeri settlements in Nagorno-Karabagh, and this form of ethnic cleansing continued until 1992. The culmination of this crisis in Nagorno-Karabagh was the tragedy in Khodjali – an overt form of genocide. This settlement of 6,000 people was destroyed overnight and 600 people were murdered overnight as well.
</pre>
<p>"The Armenians took a number of people hostages, the overwhelming majority of whom were civilians, including old people, women and children. Nine years later, some are still kept hostage. The number of bizarre medical experiments that were undertaken on these hostages indicates horrible treatment that is only comparable to that of the Nazis. "Finally in May 1992, the last Azeri settlement, the town of Shusha, was captured. That completed the occupation and ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabagh. "Taking advantage of this political chaos following our independence, the Armenians started further expansion outside the mountains of Karabagh. This led to the occupation of seven more districts surrounding Karabagh by the Armenian military forces, which were provided with very substantial support by Russian troops garrisoned in Armenia. "The overall population of these seven captured districts was about 700,000. Those areas did not have a single permanent Armenian resident. They were exclusively Azeri districts.</p>
<p>Toddlers playing with artillery shell. "The four resolutions passed later by the United Nations requiring the withdrawal of Armenian troops to withdraw from captured Azeri lands referred to these seven districts. Unfortunately, no government is paying attention to these resolutions. One million refugees still languish in desperate conditions "Thus, today in total we have about a million refugees and internally displaced people. There were over 200,000 people expelled from Armenia, about 40,000 ethnic Azeris displaced from Nagorno-Karabagh, and 700,000 people uprooted from the adjoining districts. Besides that, we also had an influx of 50,000 Iskan Turks expelled from Central Asia. "All these people are dispersed over 58 districts of Azerbaijan in some 1600 camps and areas: • 53,000 are living in tents. • 12,000 of them were placed in railway boxcars. • 30,000 are placed in various farms and other types of rural construction, some in dugouts used previously used for winter animal shelter. • 30,000 of them were placed in various educational facilities, such as schools, kindergartens. • 100,000 of the refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) are staying in unfinished, incomplete residential premises. • Another 100,000 are placed in dormitories, and the remainder are dispersed in very poor living conditions. "Certainly, there was international assistance rendered to Azerbaijan as these events took place. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was one of the first such organizations to arrive here, and then came the World Food Program. There was a very serious involvement of a number of non-governmental organizations from the US, Europe, Arab countries and Turkey. RESULTS OF ARMENIAN AGGRESSION</p>
<p>Humanitarian aid decreasing</p>
<p>"Returning to the issue of 907, since 1993 the US government has been providing financial assistance to Armenia at the rate of about $100 million a year. On the one hand we are dealing with aggression here – why is the aggressor entitled to humanitarian assistance from the US State Department? "On the other hand, Azerbaijan is the victim here: we are the nation which has had its lands occupied. We are the country that has about a million refugees and IDPs. And we are the party that has been totally deprived of any kind of direct assistance. Isn’t that paradoxical? "We have tried to show members of the Congress who support Armenia the reality of the Azeri refugees. I understand that in the US there are certain political dependencies when you get elected, and once you’re elected you can’t forget those who helped you win office. "But I say to these members of Congress: ‘You can represent someone, that’s up to you. But you can also see some real truths in our refugee camps. By denying the realities, you are really not serving the Congress, and you undermine the image of America, the most democratic country in the world. ‘The United States plays a leading role in all the issues that are concerned with the protection of human rights. Aren’t these one million refugees and IDPs human beings? Don’t they have human rights too?’ Negotiated solution sought "Since 1993 there have been efforts made to solve the problem in a political way, within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Basically, these involve Russia, the US and France - the so-called ‘Minsk Group.’ We can only note with regret that after many years of efforts, there have been no tangible results. The Minsk Group is the only body charged with the search to find a political solution to this problem. No one else is involved. “The worldwide Armenian Diaspora which actually created this situation consists of people who have carved out entire political careers from this tragic issue. Naturally, they will continue their best efforts to preserve the status quo, and to impede the development of any solution, no matter how tragic for the people of Azerbaijan.” Results of Armenian Aggression against Azerbaijan • 20,000 killed • 5,000 crippled • 700,000 displaced • 331,000 women • 235,000 children • 7,966 fatherless families • 5,316 orphans • 10 districts affected by fighting Destroyed: • 9 towns • 730 villages and settlements • 102,000 houses • 7,000 public buildings • 693 schools • 191 hospitals • 160 bridges • 166 reservoirs • 300 kilometers of roads • 2,300 kilometers of water pipelines • 15,000 kilometers of power lines • $40 Billion total damage Dedication This report is dedicated to the one million Azerbaijani refugees and displaced persons who have lived in great dignity in unbelievably primitive conditions for nearly ten years after being driven in terrible fear for their lives from the lands of their ancestors. Many others lost their lives; many have suffered unspeakable inhuman atrocities. Most of the world has forgotten they exist. Our fondest hope is that the children of these refugees will see their dreams come true of returning to the crisp mountain air and clean pure streams of their native lands before another year passes. The time for peace in Azerbaijan is now.</p>
