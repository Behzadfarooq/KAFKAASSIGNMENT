<p>The anon IP bot replaced the old picture with the new one. The older picture was far more enduring and that's why I placed it there. Lord knows when they're going to change the opening again.

<p>Actors who have participated in taping but not aired aren't current cast members. They will be when they get aired. What if someone important in the plot dies? How can one be sure the previously taped episodes won't be revised or re-recorded? The same priniciple applies for actors that are leaving. Perhaps something could happen that would postpone the leaving of the character for another month. S/he would still exist, but not be shown. Encyclopedias contain facts, not speculation. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 08:29, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We branched out the AMC History articles because they were so big. There IS a reason why this is all not on this one page...for space reasons.

 The Phil and Tara love story should be included in the 1970's portion of AMC.  Just because
</pre>
<p>the storyline took place thirty years ago doesn't mean that people don't want to read abou it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please put their storyline back in and include a separate page that is just about them and the people who protrayed them!!</p>

<p>Sorry about changing the <i>All My Children</i> page, but I think it’s an improvement. I’m a longtime fan of the show, I’ve read all the books, and have some inside sources about the program. I’m not writing anything with a bias. I thought the <i>All My Children</i> page needed the rewrite and revamping – not only to give some info about the writers and producers, but to add some interesting pictures as well. If you think the history section is too long, you could always move the opening sequence section or the actors/awards lists to another page. If you look at the OLTL page, the AMC history portion isn’t that long at all. If the readers just want storyline info read verbatim, then they could always go to ABC.com and read the yearly history there. I guess I wanted to make the AMC page at Wikipedia unique. Again, I’m not writing anything with a bias. From what I've seen in books, soap magazines, and all over the internet, is what I wrote about the "golden periods" and low periods. I didn't say these were for a fact, but were <i>considered</i> by a majority – through the soap press, through ratings, in books, and from what I've seen from a majority of fans. I don’t think that’s a “POV Mess”. I got the AMC cast picture from my ABC MediaNet account in January 2005. The other pictures I got from the AMC History site (with permission) and the Tad &amp; Dixie screencap was made by me. Why was the article about Phil and Tara deleted? Just because their storyline was thirty years doesn't mean that people don't want to read about it!</p>

<p>I am working on a project about <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Nixon_b660.html" title="Agnes Nixon">Agnes Nixon</a> but I am weary of trusting the information on imdb. Is any one away and which years she produced OLTL and AMC&#160;?

I e-mailed <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATAS_996b.html" title="NATAS">NATAS</a> requesting that info a week ago but I had had no responce - its a shame they dont have a database like the Primetime Emmys - Did you all know Agnes was nominated for an Emmy in 1973 for producing OLTL&#160;? - As far as I know she has stayed on the writting staff of AMC since its inception (I think she recently stoped being credited), therefore whenever AMC was nomianted for a writting Emmy she would have been nominated as well, right&#160;?</p>
<p>If anyone has this info please let me know</p>

<dd>Nevermind - I got the info I needed from the Emmys. Turns out Aggie has had 28 Noms and only 4 wins (if you dont cound the "Lifetime Achievement" one). <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDowew_71ec.html" title="User:Dowew">Dowew</a> 20:03, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think Agnes Nixon stopped producing her own shows in 1975, when she sold them both to ABC (not 100% sure about the date, but its definitely in the 1975-1977 time period). She owned them herself for quite awhile but the costs of producing the show proved to be too prohibitive for her -- much like Claire Labine and Paul Avila Mayer did with Ryan's Hope in the 1970s.The Invisible Man 05:00, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that some of the current cast members should be moved down to recurring. Because really, when was the last time anyone saw Ray Macdonell (Joe Martin)? Sure he's still ont he show, but he's not even there to "morally" support any characters.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It goes by who has a contract with the show. Ray MacDonnell may not be on the show a lot but he is still under contract with ABC, and therefore is not "recurring." <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">That's hot</a> 17:55, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't Susan Pratt just a "guest star" currently. I don't think it is anything long term. Plus, I am removing Julia Barr from the comings and goings unless some has an official source for her coming back. 131.156.240.89 21:24, 22 February 2007 (UTC)Jessica</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hendrickson is no longer a "recurring" or "guest star" anymore. Her return wrapped up in early February. She is not with the show any longer.131.156.240.89 00:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, neither the show nor Elizabeth Hendrickson's people will confirm or deny that the actress is still on recurring status. She is still considered under contract and cannot discuss her status. Tanisha Lynn, on the otherhand has confirmed that she has no intentions of returning to the show in the near future. As well, Julia Barr has also confirmed she is not coming back to AMC.Writerphotog 17:26, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was merely going by the fact that when her return was announced it was only a short term couple week thing. Jcar03 01:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand. Things changed during the course of her short return. Negotiations were ongoing the whole time she was in New York. I am very curious when we will hear something regarding her. But we may not until we see something (or don't) on screen sometime this year. Writerphotog 17:28, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>should we start writing some information about Megan's current storylines. There has been no mention of her other story's except the rape and the babyswitch. Shouldn't we include more of her storylines except these and comment on couplings, ratings, fan reactions as well?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, but try to keep fan reactions to a minimum because they are subjective and can conflict with the Neutral Point of View policy. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">That's hot</a> 02:01, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should we add some couple stuff as well. I think the popularity of JR and Babe and Zach and Kendell should be noted since they've been the two most popular soap couples the show has had. More so Zach and Kendell then JR and Babe as of recent but still I think theose two couples should be referenced in some way.</p>

<p>"As of July 31 2006, the show has a filmed (as opposed to taped) appearance." Right or wrong?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've heard people ask me about the new appearance. So I say it's right. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">I did "That's hot" first!</a> 20:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What's the technical difference between filmed and taped? I notice the appearance change, but can't account for it. 13:11 (EDT) September 26, 2006</p>
<p>Film is on photo matrieal used origonally (please ignore misspelling) for movies only. In 1947 they began using it to record Television broadcasts as well, known as <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinescope.html" title="Kinescope">Kinescope</a> recording. Until the 1960's all TV prodoction was done on film. Then in the early 1960's some netwroks began using videotape. Videotape is a type of magnetic tape. It was popular in the 1970's for fived days a week programs, such as soap opera for its reusablilty. Until recently all soap opreras were recorded on videotape, but tape eventually fades unlike film. Due the fact old episodes of All My Childen now look muddy due to age deteration, the producers have switched to film for its lasting qualitly. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStralia_6c8c.html" title="User:Stralia">Stralia</a> 21:00, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this tv.com link listing some recent episodes with episode numbers like <a href="http://www.tv.com/all-my-children/ep.-9587/episode/1023795/summary.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=episodessh&amp;tag=episodes;title;0" class="external text" title="http://www.tv.com/all-my-children/ep.-9587/episode/1023795/summary.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=episodessh&amp;tag=episodes;title;0" rel="nofollow">Ep. #9587</a>. That is seriously a lot of TV. I wonder if anyone has ever watched it all. Probably nto even possible at this point. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 07:36, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
