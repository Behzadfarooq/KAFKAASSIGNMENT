<p>After the cave-in at Mount Sibasio, Vaughn abseiled down to Sydney's aid. Sydney begins to cough loudly and is taken to a safehouse in Sienna, Italy.</p>
<p>After the destruction of C.I.A A.P.O and the murder of the twelve leaders of Prophet Five Sloane, Sark and Peyton rendez-vous. When there they open a box from a mysterious source in Hong Kong and inside is the Horizon. They mention an excavation team in Mongolia after using the amulet to find the location. They then turn their attention to the Intercontinental Cruise Missiles behind them.</p>
<p>After the destruction of A.P.O the team set up a temporary base of operations. After they realise the Missiles have been stolen they realise that Sloane could have just bought them on the black market as he controls Prophet Five's assets. They realise that he paid someone to steal them and find the activity in the Prophet five accounts. Using this they hack into the bank's system where was transferred to and find the thief was a man called Boris Nemikov. Rachel Gibson then steals his phone. Using the phone records they trace a phone straight back to Peyton. They corner Peyton in a lift and take her into custody.</p>
<p>Using Rachel's knowledge of Peyton they use the only thing Peyton is afraid of, snakes. From Peyton they realise that Sloane plans to target two cites with high civilian concentrations. He plans to profit of the reconstruction as Sloane owns Prophet Five's worldwide assets, he stands to make millions.</p>
<p>Sloane and Sark travel to Mongolia where his excavation teams have uncovered what they were looking for. A small building with the symbol of Rambaldi painted on top. Sloane travels down a 200 foot-long staircase telling Sark to wait up there. In the cavern Sloane sees a marble coffin with the words Milo Rambaldi etched into the Marble. He removes the horizon from the box and walks to a table on it is a hole for the horizon to fit in with two v-shapes either side of it, making the symbol of Rambaldi. He puts the Horizon into the slot it starts spinning rapidly as a great white light emanates from the sphere. Sloanes face turns bright red as he looks up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the building two workers collapse dead from a sniper. With the teams distracted Sydney runs behind the workers and into the building.</p>
<p>Sloane is now clearly shown with the mueller device emanating a red glow. The device is dripping the liquid into the horizon slowly and it is slowly filling up with bright red liquid. Sydney walks straight in front of Sloane with a gun raised to his head.</p>
<p>With Jack and Vaughn advancing outside they are ambushed by Sark.</p>
<p>Sydney walks over to the Horizon and removes it from the slot. The remaining liquid drops to the floor but instead of turing into water it maintains its red colour. Sydney about to shoot sloane in stopped by Sark marching in with Jack and Vaughn as hostages.</p>
<p>Back in the new A.P.O, Marshall and Rachel hack into the global satellite system to look for the missiles but instead find a virus that is destroying the world's defence satellites. They then realise that Sloane plans to hit the U.S with at least one of the missiles. They cannot stop the virus but can pinpoint the location it was uploaded from, Hong Kong. With this information they interrogate Peyton again. She says that they needed a partner as Sloane didn't have what he needed.</p>
<p>After this is switches back to the horizon still in Sydney's hand. After repeated attempts to get Sydney to hand over the sphere, Sydney forces Sloanes hand and he shoots Jack. During this disruption, Vaughn manages to free himself and as sydney reels from her father's pain Sloane grabs the horizon. Sydney looks at Sloane and shoots him several times. Sloane falls backwards and lands in the pool of red liquid. The horizon falls out of Sloane's hands and Sark stops the sphere and runs of with it.</p>
<p>Vaughn and Sydney drag Jack outside. They radio for a medevac unit but it is 30 minutes away. They realise who Sloane's partner is and it turns out to be none other than Irina Derevko. Irina plans to launch the missile and sydney who is in Mongolia just miles away refuses to leave her father while he is in a critical condition. Eventually, she is worn down and leaves with Vaughn to Hong Kong. As she leaves he stands up and waves sydney of, but seconds later collapses onto the ground.</p>
<p>Sark arrives in Hong Kong to give the Horizon back to Irina Derevko. She has decided to destroy the defence satellites and attack the Washington D.C and London. All defence satellites hit atmosphere when the launch protocol is initiated at 00:15:00 countdown. Sydney arrives in front of Irina, while Irina is talking about Rambaldi and the Horizon, Sloane gets up, without bullet holes, he has fulfilled the prophecy and become immortal.</p>
<p>In order to prevent Sydney stop her plans Sydney's mother, Irina, starts to strangle her with a piece of rope. Sydney is thrown into a mirror and stabs Irina in the leg with a piece of glass. Irina throws Sydney onto her desk and tries to stab Sydney with the glass, until she realises the horizon is about to fall of the desk, Irina grabs the Horizon but in doing so releases Sydney who rugby tackles Irina and they both crash through the window and onto a second roof.</p>
<p>While they both try to recover from the fall they begin talking. Irina realises Sydney is not alone. Sark, who is overseeing the launch suddenly loses all power to the computer system, as he goes to check power, Vaughn smacks him with the butt of his gun and throws him to the ground.</p>
<p>Sloane, recently revived is about to leave the underground cavern when Jack, on his last legs, appears, blocking the entrance.</p>
<p>Vaughn shoots Sark in the knee but he still claims to not know the override codes to the missiles. With the gun pointing at his head sark caves in and gives Vaughn the codes. Marshall frantically enters the code at 10 seconds left but it is still ticking it finally aborts the launch and 00:00:05</p>
<p>Irina realising the launch has failed stands up and exclaims "I can't allow you to be such a complication in my life any longer." She kicks Sydney who is still lying or the floor into the small wall surrounding the edges of the rooftop. As sydney climbs up using the wall as a support Irina kicks her again, nearly sending Sydney over the roof. As Irina tries to knock sydney over the roof for a third time Sydney ducks and smashes Irina onto the glass roof.</p>
<p>Jack shows Sloane a belt of C4, he utters "you beat death Arvin, but you couldn't beat me", he then activates the C4</p>
<p>The glass around her begins to crack under her weight. Sydney extends a hand pleading Irina to come away from the ledge, irina is about to take her hand when a few metres in front of her she sees the horizon. As the glass gains more cracks irina tries to slide along the glass. She touches the Horizon and uses her body to propel herself forward and grab the Horizon, in doing so the glass smashes and Irina is hurled through the glass and plummets to her death.</p>
<p>Jack activated the C4 killing himself instantly but Sloane who is immortal, is trapped by a large rock with the symbol of Rambaldi and is trapped for the rest of eternity in the collapsed cavern.</p>
<p>The scene then skips 7 years to a shot of Isabelle Bristow playing on the beach and noticing Dixon walking up the beach towards the house. Sydney appears from the house carrying a second child, a boy who they named Jack after her Father. We learn that Dixon wishes for Sydney to do a small assignment for him which involves Sark, who Vaughn released after Sark gave him the access Codes. Isabelle goes to her room to unpack her stuff and comes across the indicator that Sydney completed when see was the same age. Isabelle completes it in seconds clearly making way for another Alias series featuring Isabelle.</p>
<p>Alias ends with the message "Thankyou for five incredible Years"</p>
