<p>jd I'm unable to find the line refered to by "It is interesting to note that Muller? (Or is it Kat) suggested that wars should be fought by the comfortable people themselves, because they are the only ones with anything to gain from a victory of any kind."</p>
<p>There's a two page discussion on the subject of who benefits, but I can't find what's described above. Perhaps a direct quote would be better?</p>
<p>This is from my translation. <i>Kropp, though, is more of a philosopher. He is proposing that wars should be run rather like festivals, with entrance tickets and bands, along the lines of a bullfight. There, in the centre of the arena, the government ministers and generals could slug it out amongst themselves, wearing swimming costumes and armed with nightsticks. Whoever survives, his country wins. That would be much simpler and more just than this arrangement, where the wrong people do the fighting.</i></p>
<p>We all appreciate his suggestion.<i><a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumiton_9b20.html" title="User:Rumiton">Rumiton</a> 11:32, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Also a little question: Did Remarque translate the book into english himself? I have an old edition, it doesn't name a translator.</p>
<ul>
<li>The original translation was by A. W. Wheen in 1929. I know of two other translations, one by Tilman Westphalen in 1987, the other by Brian Murdoch in 1994. As far as I am aware, Remarque did not translate the book. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 20:14, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>You are right, Remarque's English remained somewhat limited. I completed an English translation of my own in 1990. It isn't published, so doesn't count as a source, but I am happy to discuss it with anyone here. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumiton_9b20.html" title="User:Rumiton">Rumiton</a> 14:04, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no good divide between the book, the film, and the recent remake of the film. some information on this would be nice, and should each be given its own page, as many other books with films based on them have been done elsewhere in wikipedia? - fruitybix 5/10/05</p>

<p><i>School Essay by WikiTikix</i></p>
<p>This is probably one of the best books I've read for a long time. I'm not really into War books, but this one was really good. The main characters are Paul Baumer, Albert Kropp, Tjaden, Kemmerach, Detering, and Katczinsky (Kat for short). There is a side character named Himmelstoss who is mean and expects respect from them because he is their superior officer. They give him none. - This story takes place on the Western Front in Germany and France. It shows how War really is. People think War is great and glorious, but this shows it isn't. The bombardments, the gas... This book really puts you in the place of Paul Baumer. - I won't tell you much about the book because you really have to read it in order to get everything from it. The part that is hard for Paul is when he goes on leave because people are asking him to tell everyone how great it is to die for your fatherland. He leaves early because he hates having everyone call him a coward because he tells the truth about War. It's awful. - There's also a movie. It's black and white movie, and was made in 1930. The movie was good, but it didn't portray the characters like I thought they'd look like. For example, Kat is chubby in the movie and I imagined him being kind of thin and wise, with a calm voice. If you are interested in watching the movie, read the book first. My teacher told me to and I'm glad I did. You get a much better idea from the book than the movie. - I really enjoyed this book. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes War stories or if you're interested in The Great War from the German's perspective. This book isn't that hard to read either. There are some tricky words, but if you can read Harry Potter, you can read this. - I suggest that you should at least look into this book. It's really great!</p>

<p>I have a character analysis paper due tomorrow on Paul Baümer. Unfortunatley, I am a prokrastinator and did not read the book. Instead, I watched the movie. I also went on CliffsNotes and Wikipedia. I hope I can pull this off. WISH ME LUCK!!!</p>

<p>Not sure what version of the book others have read but the version I have doesn't have Paul getting killed while drawing a bird. The book simply ends saying he fell before the war's end.</p>
<p>He dies drawing a bird in the latter movie, not the book...additionally i thought the book was based on the diaries of a soldier who really did die in the war...if memory serves me correct, his mother received it and had it published??</p>

<dd>No, he survived both World Wars, the second one as an exile from the Nazis. --<a href="../../../g/w/y/User%7EGwydionM_3bbc.html" title="User:GwydionM">GwydionM</a> 18:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The bird scene was part of the 1930 movie, a device to link the beginning where Paul is in school, with the end. In the book, Paul Baumer is shot just before the end of the war. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumiton_9b20.html" title="User:Rumiton">Rumiton</a> 13:49, 2 March 2007 (UTC) Rumiton.</p>

<p>I removed the spoiler because, whether it be 'Plot' or 'Synopsis', it means the same thing, and it tells the reader that they will be finding out about the story. There is no need for an ugly banner to reiderate something that is already there. This is an encyclopaedia and not anonline forum, this spoiler aren't always neccessary, especially when it clearly states that it's the plot. And just because The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is like the way you changed it to does not make it the preferred version. I welcome comments here before you revert back.

<p>In the English edition I read, the actual phrase is used at the end, where the context is obvious. It was a new translation that however made a point of using the older title.</p>
<p>If anyone has both English translations - or are there more than two - a comparison would also be interesting.</p>
<p>There is a third translation, done by me :-) but not published. Some of the German phrases just do not work in English, and the title is one. The problem is the word Neues. It means something new, but also swings towards something "newsworthy." Probably the best translation, though clumsy, would be: "Nothing of news value from the West." "All Quiet on the Western Front" is way better. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumiton_9b20.html" title="User:Rumiton">Rumiton</a> 13:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm suprised there's no section for Kropp under the main characters, Kropp was injured and had his leg amputated (much like Kemmerich). Kropp and Paul both went to hospital together (around chapter ten I think), and it is implied that Kropp would either give up and die, or actually just actively kill himself. I'm not the greatest writer, so someone else should probably right the kropp section, but I figured I should mention that he needs to be put in their. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Riphal (<a href="../../../r/i/p/User_talk%7ERiphal_51ae.html" title="User talk:Riphal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riphal_9cf4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riphal">contribs</a>) 08:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>The plot summary includes the statement: "He returns to his school where his teacher is still encouraging young men to enlist. Asked to [tell?] what the war is like, he tells them the truth and is shouted out of the classroom."</p>
<p>This event happens in the original movie, but I don't remember it and can't find it in the book itself. Did this happen in the book? If not, I propose that these two sentences be deleted from the article.</p>

<p>I expanded the section on Paul's visit home on leave, because I think it is a key event that highlights the ways in which the war has changed Paul. Also, I moved some material about the insignificance of individual battles (which was very good material) into the previous paragraph, where it seemed to fit more naturally. Finally, in the section on Main Characters, I deleted a phrase that suggested that Paul had little relationship with his mother. The expanded section on Paul's visit home suggests that he had a tender but restrained relationship with his mother, which I think is more accurate and is backed up with quotes from the book. Bruno in Columbus 01:52, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Exactly. Paul and his mother are both feeling the pain of belonging to a society and social class that does not openly express feelings. But they are there.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumiton_9b20.html" title="User:Rumiton">Rumiton</a> 13:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
