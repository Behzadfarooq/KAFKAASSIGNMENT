<p>1976 Olympics suffered an African Boycott in protest of the All Black tour to South Africa of that year. After a lot of hot air, most African teams would have called off the Boycott at the last moment had the then Chairman of the New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association, Sir Lance Cross, expressed some sort of regret/disaproval of the tour on behalf of the NZOCGA. He didn't. There was talk of kicking NZ out of the games, but instead the African teams (most of whom had actually arrived in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>) boycotted. Hence the much awaited 1500m clash between <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Walker_feed.html" title="John Walker">John Walker</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filbert_Bayi_982a.html" title="Filbert Bayi">Filbert Bayi</a> of <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> never happened.

<ul>
<li>I have added my impressions of the times (1960's-1980s) that preceded the boycott. Someone else may be able to provide a better resource than my own eyewitness memory. Perhaps we need a separate article on the 1981 Springbok tour too? - <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameron_Dewe_6432.html" title="User:Cameron Dewe">kiwiinapanic</a>

<li>We HAVE a page called "<a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_Springbok_Tour_f969.html" title="1981 Springbok Tour">1981 Springbok Tour</a>", but it redirects to this article. Such a seminal event in Southern Hemisphere history needs its own page.

<li>My girlfriend keeps threatening to write an article about the 1981 Springbok tour (although she'd be no less biased than you, Robin!) - I'll tell her that there are voices clamouring for it! —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 00:52, Aug 16, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>p.s. isn't <i>"While the 1985 Springbok tour saw major rugby fields ringed in barbed wire for Springbok games, there were no protests as political circumstances had changed"</i> just flat-out wrong? I thought the tour was cancelled after a legal challenge. Also, I think <i>"Also many African Countries boycotted the 1984 Olympics"</i> is wrong too - I think only the Soviet bloc boycotted that year. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 12:05, Aug 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find the Springbok Tours section totally incomprehensible. I don't know the history at all, so as an ignorant reader, I am completely lost. For instance,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Playing the Springboks of South Africa has become a traditional rugby competition. In the 1950s and 1960s, the South African apartheid policies had an impact on touring team selection, with Maori players not being selected for some South African tours. By the 1970s public protests and political pressure forced the New Zealand Rugby Union to either field a non-racial team or not tour. However the Springboks continued to be racially selected. As a result, the Norman Kirk Labour Government prevented the Springboks from touring during the mid 1970s. The Rugby Union protested that politics and sport should not be mixed up.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly, this has way too much passive voice. "Maori players not being selected"... by whom? Then there are phrases like "...forced the New Zealand Rugby Union to either field a non-racial team or not tour"... Huh??? Even overlooking the split infinitive here, I think you need to be a rugby afficionado to really understand this whole section. I'd fix it myself if I had any idea what it all means. --<a href="../../../p/3/d/User%7EP3d0_7b66.html" title="User:P3d0">P3d0</a> 15:03, Sep 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) failed to learn their lesson from the debacle of 1976 (where African nations boycotted the Montreal Olympics) and 1981 (the disastrous south African 'Springbok' Rugby tour of New Zealand, which deeply divided the nation to the point of unprecedented civil unrest) and proceeded to announce an All Black tour of South Africa in 1985 during South Africa's state of emergency. Thankfully the NZRFU were challenged in the high court by two lawyers who argued it was not in the NZRFU's charter to tour South Africa in such times of turmoil, they achieved an injunction and the tour was called off. The majority of New Zealanders thru ignorance and/or a sheer love of rugby (in particularly playing against their greatest rivals, the Springboks) supported all tours to and from South Africa during the aparthied regime...as an 11 year old in 1981 I supported the tour by the Springboks purely as a chance to play South Africa but as a far more worldly and enlightened 35 year old in 2005 all I can say is I want to stand up and applaud the anti-tour/anti-aparthied protesters who put their lives in danger by making a stand against racism and oppression.

<p>Long term should there be a history of the All Blacks here? Records of tours and each match, bios of each player and their record? Thoughts? -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonLyall_811c.html" title="User:SimonLyall">SimonLyall</a></p>

<dd>There definitely should be a history section. Records of games should probably go else where e.g. <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tri_Nations_d6f3.html" title="Tri Nations">Tri Nations</a> or be listed on a sub page so as to leave the main article uncluttered. Maybe a brief summary of each years tours can be made. Seeing as there are over one thousand All Blacks, player biographies should really be separate articles. Although brief mention of noteable players can be made. -- <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopsracer_cec6.html" title="User:Popsracer">Popsracer</a> 05:19, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<p>Simon - that is a huge task - records of tours, and of each match, bios of ALL players and their records already exists - Both in the Rugby Museum site, and in the official All Blacks site. Both of these website's are feed out of the same database. Probably best to link to those site's. The data is accurate and uptodate.

<p>I've had a go myself. The bulk of the text comes from a 'History of New Zealand rugby' which is available on the internet and no mention of any copyright. Bits from Planet rugby and the 2003 World Cup site have been woven in. There are also a few fragments from the official site but it is quite different from the original text.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Naming of this article</span></h2>
<p>Why was this article renamed from <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Blacks_48f1.html" title="All Blacks">All Blacks</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team_1136.html" title="New Zealand national rugby union team">New Zealand national rugby union team</a>? The <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Use_common_names_of_persons_and_things" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">current naming convention</a> says "Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict..." and to me All Blacks is the most common name. So unless someone has strong objections I'll move it back to All Blacks. Although I see some merit in keeping New Zealand national rugby union team as a redirect. -- <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopsracer_cec6.html" title="User:Popsracer">Popsracer</a> 05:19, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with the proposed move+redirect. ("National rugby" ... "Is that the NRL? Or the Sevens?") ("Rugby union" ... "Hey, we never call it that in this country!") - <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Patterson_109a.html" title="User:Robin Patterson">Robin Patterson</a> 00:24, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess the renaming happened to make all the national Rugby teams consistently named - the argument in favour would be that it makes life easier for article-writers (e.g. imagine working on a World Cup article if all the national teams had different naming styles), but a redirect would handle that just as well, so I'm inclined to agree with the "Use the most common name.." school of thought and go for <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Blacks_48f1.html" title="All Blacks">All Blacks</a>. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 00:52, Aug 16, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Seeing as there has been general support for the move back to <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Blacks_48f1.html" title="All Blacks">All Blacks</a> and no objections, I have made the move. -- <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopsracer_cec6.html" title="User:Popsracer">Popsracer</a> 01:51, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Quite rightly too. There are naming conventions that need to be followed. All Blacks is a nickname. There is <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_rugby_union_team.html" title="Australia national rugby union team">Australia national rugby union team</a> (Wallabies), <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team_0e10.html" title="South Africa national rugby union team">South Africa national rugby union team</a> (Springboks), <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_national_rugby_union_team.html" title="Argentina national rugby union team">Argentina national rugby union team</a> (pumas), etc. This is different.

<dl>
<dd>Absolute, unmitigated bollocks: This article <i>definitely</i> should be titled "All Blacks", with a redirect from "New Zealand rugby union team":
<ul>
<li><b>Practical Use</b>: Let's be practical here: how many people using this resource will be searching for "all blacks" and how many people will be searching for "New Zealand national rugby union team"? In percentages, I submit that it would be precisely 100% the former; 0% the latter. To accord with user functionality, the <i>only</i> sensible thing is to title the main article "All Blacks". Note the comment made above (two years ago) about Wikipedia naming conventions which supports this.</li>
<li><b>"All Blacks" is NOT just a nickname</b>: In any case "All Blacks" <i>is</i> the official name of the team, as per the New Zealand Rugby Union, which has taken great pains to protect its trade mark in the name - witness the website, and the two words under the silver fern on the test match all black jersey: "All Blacks".</li>
<li><b>"New Zealand National Rugby Union Team" is a poor description in any case</b>: And if we're getting down to brass tacks, "New Zealand National Rugby Union Team" is neither an official description of any sort, nor an accurate one (for one thing it doesn't differentiate the All Blacks from the Cavaliers, New Zealand A, the U21s, or arguably the NZ Universities or the NZ Maoris for example) - strictly speaking the All Blacks are actually the "New Zealand Rugby Football Union First XV". But no-one - not even the NZRFU - refers to the ABs in those terms. There is only one team called the All Blacks, and <i>everyone</i> knows which team that is. Why not use that as the article title?</li>
<li><b>Existing Naming Conventions should be changed</b>: Not only should this article be changed, but so should the other you cite be titled "Springboks", "Wallabies" and "Pumas" respectively. (and "Azurri" and "les Bleus"). The home nations teams, by contrast, don't have "nicknames", so need to be treated differently. The currently used naming convention makes no sense, as in each case these are not official nor particularly accurate titles (for the same reasons as above). By the same logic, the article about the band who recorded <a href="../../../%28/i/_/%28I_Can%27t_Get_No%29_Satisfaction_0d39.html" title="(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction">Satisfaction</a> should not be titled "<a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>" but "British invasion Rock 'n' roll band who aped delta blues and had a singer who studied at the London School of Economics". What possible good would that do? <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 23:44, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The page was moved again. So I have moved it back to All Blacks for now. It is by far the most common name, and thus, the artivle's title should reflect that. Commentators, publications, websites, media and so on, all use the name All Blacks. It should not be moved to <i>New Zealand national rugby union team</i> purely because all the other nations use that title. This has also been discussed numerous times, so people should just be moving it to <i>New Zealand national rugby union team</i>, because as far as I know, an understanding has been reached that the page should be <i>All Blacks</i>. No on refers to them as New Zealand. All Blacks is by far the most common name. <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 06:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have a particularly strong desire to change the name but on the who I agree with Duncharis. Anybody searching for 'All Blacks' would automatically redirected to 'New Zealand national rugby union team' in any case. The advantage of 'New Zealand national rugby union team' is that the casual observer will instantly know what the article is about. 99.99% of Kiwis know who the All Blacks are, 99.99% of rugby union fans know who they are but only a minority of the world's population do.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 13:56, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nice try, but that huge majority of the world's population who doesn't know who the all blacks are would be pretty much exactly the same huge majority who didn't know what rugby union was and wouldn't be looking it up in the first place. End the day, "All Blacks" is not only the most widely used label for the team, it's also the team's official name. If there is a redirect from NZ national team, everyone ought to be happy. How on earth this can be even a topic for debate is beyond me. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 20:53, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also prefer the standardised naming convention. Argentina's team isn't at <i>los pumas</i> neither is the Aussie team at <i>Qantas Wallabies</i> or <i>Wallabies</i> or SA at <i>Springboks</i>, nor would I support such moves. This article should be at <i>New Zealand national rugby union team</i>. In official programs, the name <i>New Zealand</i> is used, not the <i>all blacks</i>. In the Rugby World Cup, the side that represents New Zealand is officially the New Zealand side, not the <i>all blacks</i>.--<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 21:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The diference is that the Wallabies and Pumas are equally as well known as Australia and Argentina, whereas NO ONE calls the All Blacks New Zealand. Changing the article's name would be misleading to people who are not rugby fans. Its All Blacks, not New Zealand. The name is legendary.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lots of people refer to the All Blacks as 'New Zealand'. I've yet to see All Blacks used on a scoreboard or on an official fixture list. Official World Cup websites use 'New Zealand'.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 22:21, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with GordyB on that point - loads of people, particularly outside NZ, call the team New Zealand, as that is the team's name. When the ABs play Scotland, for example, the match is between Scotland and New Zealand. Clearly 'All Blacks' is very widely used and is one of the team's official names, so people need to be able to reach the article by using either name, but maybe uniform naming across all national teams makes most sense. New Zealand has had a national rugby team since before the term All Blacks was used, and if the team name was sold in future so they were known as The News Corp Sheep-Molesters, it would still be the New Zealand National Rugby Union Team.<a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippo43_7f9b.html" title="User:Hippo43">Hippo43</a> 17:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thought on this topic, which I think is very important. Although I instinctively feel All Blacks should be the name for this page, there <b>is</b> a real difference between the two names - the All Blacks aren't only, as Cvene64 stated, "the New Zealand Rugby Football Union First XV". The All Blacks were [until very recent tours] also the team which played non-international games on tour. Hence Zinzan Brooke, for example, has played 58 times [58 tests] for 'the New Zealand national team', and another 42 for the All Blacks. A quick look at the official All Blacks site <a href="http://stats.allblacks.com/atoz.asp?group=A" class="external autonumber" title="http://stats.allblacks.com/atoz.asp?group=A" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> shows numerous players who have played several matches for the All Blacks but have never played for the New Zealand national team in an international match.</p>
<p>As the 2 names are not exactly equivalent, I have to agree with GordyB and Duncharris that strictly speaking we should not use All Blacks as the main name for this article.<a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippo43_7f9b.html" title="User:Hippo43">Hippo43</a> 13:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All national teams used to play tour matches (ie. non-internationals). The Lions still do - see 2005 Lions Tour. There is no difference - it's still the Lions or the All Blacks whether they're playing against Manawatu or Harlequins. The two names are exactly equivalent. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisiate_1b7e.html" title="User:Lisiate">Lisiate</a> 23:53, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The British Lions always used the same name and gave the same kind of cap whether they were playing a provincial team or a test match. NZ / AB did not. Re-read Hippo43's post. I would also add that the name 'All Blacks' isn't exclusively the NZRU's (it goes without saying that THE All Blacks are by far the best known) - In Wales Neath are known as the All Blacks. There are dozens of other minor clubs with this name.</dd>
<dd>I suggest we vote on it, have an admin seal the result and just leave it at that.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 12:57, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lisiate, of course you are right that all national teams used to play non-test matches on tour, but you are wrong to imply that it's the same thing to play an international match as to play Harlequins. Playing against Harlequins is not an <b>international</b> match, and the team which plays against Harlequins is not the New Zealand international side. The NZRU explicitly recognises this in recording Tests and non-test matches separately for each All Black.</p>
<p>The 2 names are not <b>exactly</b> equivalent - this article starts with "the All Blacks is the name of New Zealand's international rugby union team". Players such as Chris Tregaskis (described in his official All Blacks bio as "judged to have been of not quite international standard" <a href="http://stats.allblacks.com/Profile.asp?ABID=896" class="external autonumber" title="http://stats.allblacks.com/Profile.asp?ABID=896" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) are All Blacks, having played non-test matches, but have never played for "New Zealand's <b>international</b> rugby union team". I am fairly sure the likes of Tregaskis would trade all their games against teams like Harlequins for one international match. The 2 terms have slightly different, albeit overlapping, meanings. By all means have a separate article which covers the All Blacks in both senses, or cover the issue in this article, but the naming of this article should be consistent with other countries' international teams.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out before, other international teams officially play against 'New Zealand', not against 'The All Blacks'. A quick look at the IRB's website <a href="http://www.irb.com/EN/Fixtures+and+Results/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irb.com/EN/Fixtures+and+Results/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> shows that South Africa played New Zealand, not the All Blacks, last weekend.</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that voting on this is the answer, as weight of numbers shouldn't be the way to get your point of view 'approved' here. As I understand it, verifiablility is more important on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippo43_7f9b.html" title="User:Hippo43">Hippo43</a> 18:59, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>More on this - the NZRU's own website has the title "Welcome to the official website of the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team" - the New Zealand All Blacks, not the All Blacks. Also, their own results page <a href="http://www.allblacks.com/fixtures/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allblacks.com/fixtures/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> shows the team's name as New Zealand, so the arguments above that "<b>noone</b> calls them new Zealand" are obviously nonsense.<a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippo43_7f9b.html" title="User:Hippo43">Hippo43</a> 19:11, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think more benefits would come from having it as All Blacks rather than New Zealand. Although it would keep every national page in line, it migh tnot confuse anyone, but it is a way weaker term than the All Blacks. I know you would have to be an idiot not to realise, but personally, if I saw New Zealand national rugby union team, Id be like "...?...Oh, the All Blacks".<a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarrasawa_fefa.html" title="User:Narrasawa">Narrasawa</a> 10:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you name the page All Blacks shouldn't you also use Springboks and Wallabies for SA and Australia? 'All Blacks' might be uniformly used in New Zealand but not here in England; I know nobody under the age of 40 who calls them the 'All Blacks'. It would be more consistent to call the article New Zealand national rugby union team the same as all the others.

<p>Mjefm, don't you think that the fact the name <i>All Black</i> has trickled through culture so much so that it influenced the name of every other NZ sporting team a representation of how much the name is engrained into culture? Also, I don't know where everyone is from, I know two of the guys from the ru project who dont like the current name, GordyB and Grcampbell are (I think, correct me if I'am wrong) from the UK? Like, I just don't think you guys realise how big the name is in Oceania, or the southern hemisphere for that matter. The "nickname" has most definantly superseded <i>New Zealand</i> in general description of the team. You rarely hear them being called New Zealand, and I dont think saying All Blacks is not used on a scoreboard or the rwc site is that relevent - those are official records! This is an encyclepedia...thus...<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>: <b>When choosing a name for a page ask yourself: What word would the average user of the Wikipedia put into the search engine?</b>. Guys, we really got to go by that, as opposed to the fact that all other nations have a ...national rugby union team name. And please can we not have an offical vote, as that is all it is, a vote, instead of a rational discussion. I raised good points at Tri Nations, but I dont think they were even read by the admin, and thus the move failed because people had come along and just "voted" instead of responding to what I said. Anyway, I just thinklk there are way more benefits to having it at All Blacks, there is a redirect, so anyone who types in New Zealand is fine, whats the problem? <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 13:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There should be mention to the pregame ritual the All Blacks take part in before each game.</p>

<li>There is - it is called the haka. <a href="../../../m/y/n/User%7EMyNameIsNotBob_b89a.html" title="User:MyNameIsNotBob">MyNameIsNotBob</a> 06:54, May 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Though the haka should really be called a prayer not a war dance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are a number of articles on the Haka on the Internet. The consensus seems to be that the version of the Haka performed by the All Blacks is the "Ka Mate". The Haka seems to be described as a dance that does not involve weapons (so is not a "war dance") and can cover everything from welcome to hostility. I guess a hostile Haka could be seen as a war dance of sorts, but the history and translation of the Ka Mate would suggest that it's much more a thanksgiving, however there is an extremely "loose" translation (based more on tradition than transliteration) which suggests a challenge. Personally, I'd say there are probably better interpretations of it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For the record, weapons or no, the haka <i>is</i> a war dance. It is performed in front of - and <i>at</i> - the opposition, in the same way it was used by many polynesian people before going into battle, and has the aim of scaring the bejesus out of the opposition/enemy. (Typically, praying doesn't have quite the same effect). This is why one should freely ignore anyone (particularly a New Zealander*) who complains that "insufficient respect" is shown to the haka. It is a war dance. It is ones enemy's prerogative to show or fail to show respect to ones pre-war rituals. In rugby, as in war, if you fail to show sufficiuent respect to your opponent, you find out the hard way - you don't need a hand-wringing liberal to make the point for you.

<p>The Haka seems to have been performed for a very long time by the All Blacks, but different versions may have been used at different times. There's references to some versions using mats and other props, for example, which wouldn't make much sense with the current form. There are apparently criticisms amongst purists that the current dance mixes in other Maori dances and therefore isn't really Haka. Early New Zealand teams seem to have included a lot of Maori, so I think we can assume those were "correct".</p>
<p>Since the article is about the All Blacks and not about the Haka, it wouldn't make sense to put a vast amount of detail in. Anything I've noted above that is personal opinion OR could be considered provocative is inappropriate for the article and is noted here PURELY for the purpose of illustrating the areas of uncertainty. I would like to suggest that the little that is certain be added, though. JD</p>

I know that the Ka Mate haka was used prior to 1987, but the sentence says "usually been." Prior to 1987 and Wayne "Buck" Shelford, the All Blacks performed many different haka (see <a href="../../../h/a/k/Haka_of_the_All_Blacks_fef4.html" title="Haka of the All Blacks">Haka of the All Blacks</a>). In 1987, the Ka Mate became the AB "standard" and thus the one "usually" performed before a game.

Being selected for the All Blacks is only the greatest honour that a Kiwi <b>rugby union</b> sportsman can achieve, because I'd class revieving an olimpic medal, or the NZ sportsperson of the year award as a higher achievement and therefor a greater honour. -- Faded_Mantis 06:31, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lions results</span></h2>
<p>Just on the topic of Lions results please be aware that the All Blacks have actually played the Lions 38 times. A couple of sites including allblacks.com only list tours up to 1930. There were actually 4 other recorded tests between the two teams. Three in 1908, and one in 1903. Here are 3 sites I could find that actually have the right figure at 38 played, 29 won by NZ and 3 draws. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELummie_02bc.html" title="User:Lummie">Lummie</a> 13:29, 18 November 2005 (UTC)<br />

The British Lions (now known as the British and Irish Lions) made their first fully inclusive tour in 1930 of New Zealand. The composite teams that toured NZ in 1904 and 1908 were not fully representative of the 4 teams that now make up the B&amp;I Lions.</p>
<p>Great Britain in 1904 - Not endorsed by Irish Rugby Union<br />
Anglo-Welsh in 1908 - the Scottish and Irish Rugby Union's refused to support the tour.</p>
<p>The result's on <a href="http://stats.allblacks.com" class="external text" title="http://stats.allblacks.com" rel="nofollow">stats.allblacks.com</a> are the official breakdown of test matches by the All Blacks as endorsed by the NZRU. They show the correct breakdwon of test matches. I think that the WIKI should follow that what is recognised by the NZRU, and not by any number of other 'stat' site's that are not official. --<a href="../../../b/m/r/User%7EBMR789_649c.html" title="User:BMR789">BMR789</a> 21:16, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some famous All Blacks</span></h2>
<p>Why this list? Probably <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonah_Lomu_a42c.html" title="Jonah Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> is the only famous person on this list. Some of these people would not even be known outside New Zealand. Examples of famous people in sport may be <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schumacher_8477.html" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/g/Olga_Korbut_d882.html" title="Olga Korbut">Olga Korbut</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pele.html" title="Pele">Pele</a>.

<p>I took the list from the list of famous rugby union players as a starting point. The idea is that people should add to the list.</p>
<p>As for not being famous outside NZ, I'm English and I know most of them are. Lomu is on a different planet in terms of fame from the rest being well-known by people in rugby union playing nations who aren't interested in rugby union. However he would be total unknown in South America, India or China, there are no rugby players in the same category of fame as Schumacher, Korbut or Pele.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i><b>I'm English and I know most of them are...</b></i>" - Surely you didn't mean that most of them are "English"? No, on the contrary - most of them are stolen from the South Sea Islands. New Zealand how are ye! I don't think the All Blacks are chokers, but there is a fair amount of gagging after their silly dance on the pitch. Is this inflammatory?--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 23:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. But half this list I have personally never heard of. Maybe because I am not English. They are so famous that there is no article for them. I think the list is a disgrace and an insult to the great All Blacks. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Stuart_3d55.html" title="Bob Stuart">Bob Stuart</a> is not on the list. He won a lifetime achievement award from the IRB, was captain of the All Blacks, coach of the All Blacks and gave a lifetime of support to the game. Bob may not be as trendy as <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Carter_85d5.html" title="Dan Carter">Dan Carter</a>, but has done more for the game, that's for sure. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Scott_4273.html" title="Bob Scott">Bob Scott</a> is not there.

<p>I think the converse action is required, actually, and I have taken it. Any All Black who has a Wikipedia article about himself is, by Wikipedia's own definition, notable, and an All Black who doesn't, isn't. Therefore, I have deleted those that don't from this list - this was tough action considering some of these men were boyhood heroes of mine. However, this <i>must</i> be right: otherwise, an entry simply says "xxx" is notable" without giving any grounds for that notability. Anyone who disagrees with these deletions (and on their merits, I can certainly see a case for including Lochore, Dalton, Bunce, Tremain and Whetton, and others who <i>aren't</i> currently on the list (Ron Jarden, Tane Norton, Wilson Whineray, Keith Murdoch, Robbie Deans, John Mitchell for starters) should <i>first</i> create an article about the player, and then cite them here. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 22:14, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe we should come up with some form of criteria for the Notible All Blacks section, and maybe some qualities that would require a player to be on the list. The big one is that they have a wikipedia article on them, but another would be All Black captain's? I think if they have captained a test (maybe a minimum of 2 or 3?) then they should be included. Please add to this list.

<p>I believe they were listed in there because they are not just famous as an All Blacks but because some of them I would say are/were WORLD-CLASS Players during their playing days.. (<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonmar_5c49.html" title="User:Donmar">peads</a> 04:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)).</p>
<p>Like I said before, there is a clear and obvious criteria for this list: the player having an article of his own on Wikipedia. All Black captains may deserve a wikipedia article, but until they have one, they have no place on this list. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 00:17, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some sort of criteria is definitely needed, and the criteria should be narrow enough that only a <i>reasonable</i> number of players are listed in the section. What is reasonable? My feeling is somewhere around 20 to 25. We don't need to list every All Black here, that is what <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_Blacks_24e2.html" title="Category:All Blacks">Category:All Blacks</a> is for. Some suggestions for criteria, in order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those with widespread international media coverage (ie Jonah)</li>
<li>Those in the International Rugby Hall of Fame</li>
<li>Those who have notable achievements outside of rugby (eg as an MP or in business)</li>
<li>Those awarded honours (MNZM or MBE, or if that includes too many players then ONZM or OBE)</li>
<li>Those who played in most tests over a long period (8 years?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts on these criteria?</p>
<p>Of course anyone on the list should have a reasonably thorough article. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 00:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not aware of the All Blacks breaking any rules on player selection. I always find it a curiousity that NZ are accused of stealing players that are in many cases born and bred in NZ or at least moved to NZ at a very young age. If none of these players were selected some would call it racism, often the same people who would accuse them of player theft.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 13:54, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The debate is generally raised because many players who would be eligible for playing for say Samoa, Fiji or some of the other pacific islands tend to play for the All Blacks for a variety of reasons. It is quite unusual because an article the website Planet Rugby wrote showed that many of the other major countries are guilty of stealing talent. The other thing is that these players are not "stolen" as these players have to sign contracts. They are free to play for who they want. Also if they are not from New Zealand they generally have to play for at least 3 years before they become eligible so its not easy with the large amount of talent from NZ means its not like NZ has to steal, but occasionally foreign players will be selected. Much like Australia. I mean people should note guys like George Gregan, Mark Gerrard, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Wendell Sailor, Lote Tuqiri, Morgan Turinui could all be eligible for other south pacific teams but play for Australia. Fact is NZ had a few high profile names in the past and present and that seems to mean somehow NZ is the only to point the finger at. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELummie_02bc.html" title="User:Lummie">Lummie</a> 14:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many players are eligible to play for more than one country - the eligibility rules are fairly generous. There are players in the All Blacks who are eligible to play for another country as well as New Zealand, but who have chosen to play for New Zealand. There are also New Zealand-born players in a number of other national rugby teams, including Australia, Wales, Scotland and Italy. It's hardly any great scandal or controversy, and if anyone thinks that "the ABs have a reputation for twisting the rules", I suggest that you follow the advice below the edit box, and base that claim on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">sources</a> before trying to add it to this article. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 13:44, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There are 12 All Black Captains that do not claim a secondary school on their CV.

<dd>It's also possible that the school that they'd attended simply wasn't recorded (or the record has been lost). Looking over some of the bios at allblacks.com I see this is the case for Dick Roberts (captain in 1914) and Jimmy Tilyard (captain in 1920) and probably some others.
