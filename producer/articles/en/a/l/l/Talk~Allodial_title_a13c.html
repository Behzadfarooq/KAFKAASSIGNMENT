	    <p>This article has significant inaccuracies, in particular insofar as it relates to English law (there aint no such thing as British law -- ghastly notion). The historical section is an awful pastiche and has some howlers (we didn't have Dukes until after Quia Emptores for example) but gives the wrong impression of how things worked.</p>
<p>Also, as used in English law, "Allodial Land" means something (land which has no lord) which does not easily fit with the idea of an "allodial title", we have to clarify how the phrase has developed in meaning in the US to make this NPOV. Perhaps a Scottish lawyer could assist with allodium there.</p>

<p>Help! Can someone who knows more about wikipedia please undo the last merge!!!! I spent some time getting the allodial article vaguely accurate. Now that has all been wiped out into this mess of an article with (as I said) lots of inaccuracies. I notice very little has been carried over from the other article to here and the action was done without proper consulation. Also all the talk is lost.</p>

<p>A big problem with this article (and with the previous article merged into it) is that the "allodium" of the feudists was something very different from what this article is pleased to call "true allodial title."</p>
<p>An inaccuracy: Bankrupcies are purely a matter of Federal law; any protection of assets (under whatever name, by whatever theory) from such proceedings must arise under Federal law. Nevada has no power to do so.</p>
<p>Also, it is not the nature of allodial title that prevents its alienation, so much as that the law, having had, over most of a thousand years, no cause to notice such a thing, provides no form whereby it might be done. Once allowing that it might be in private hands, there is nothing about allodial title that is incompatible with descent, for example; rather, any notice the laws of descent might take of "true allodial title" would depend upon statutes yet to be enacted.</p>

<p>BTW, you can get back to the original "Allodial" page (and its talk) by clicking on the "Redirected from" link at the top of this article. To see that link, though, you will first need to try to retrieve the article under its original title. Or, if you want, I can paste it over here.</p>

<p>The article states that the U.S. obtained New Mexico, California, and Arizona by conquest. Obviously this was true as a practical matter, but... technically, these lands were obtained by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo_5b1c.html" title="Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> that ended the war. Since I believe that treaty contained provisions relating to land ownership, it seems as we should be going down the legal route here. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> 17:54, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am a U.S. lawyer who wandered onto this article through reading the article on bailments. This is one of my first postings here so excuse any inadvertent screwups. I never heard of allodial title before. The content of the article seems inaccurate. Wikipedia is certainly universal. I believe legal principles should be meticulously stated. The jurisdiction is important to mention. Heaven help any nonlawyer who reads this article and relies on it for knowledge. Another objection to the article is that the writing lacks clarity. It certainly isn't a sexy topic but I'm an Anglophile. I love reading about the merry old days in mother England. 75Janice 22:30, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hahaha!!!! That is funny! Who is insane enough to think that there is a "Limited Allodial Title"??? A "Limited Allodial Title" would be the same as "Limited Complete Title", hehe!<br />
I also think this article is very biased against people who actually own their property. How can you misuse complete ownership? The fact that we don't pay tax on our property just means we own it; and the reason you pay tax on yours is because you do NOT own it. It is simple, and you guys should study some law before you go out slandering property owners!<br />
One more thing, if you are so ignorant you somehow believe having an Allodial title and not paying property tax is wrong, then you will have a big problem with the government; because the government owns the Allodial title to "YOUR" property! 68.118.212.46 21:49, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Few citations from the article as it is now: <i>"... free and clear of any encumbrances, including liens, mortgages and tax obligations ..."</i>, <i>"... absolute property ... without ... acknowledgement to a superior ..."</i>, and <i>"... in the United States most lands are allodial ..."</i>.</p>
<p>If someone has a property, is (s)he responsible to the state and is (s)he obliged to pay property taxes or not? Does the property owner have full/complete power over his property, or should obey court orders, search warrants, etc.? Not to talk about mortgages at all.</p>

<p>Why is there a section on equity? That has (surely) nothing whatsoever to do with land tenure and therefore allodial title. Its a pretty confused section at that! The "Proof of Ownership" section, as well as being highly misleading, seems to have nothing to do with the article at all. Surely what is relevant is what follows: namely the Treaty of Paris and how land was treated in the US following its break with Great Britain and thus how allodial title (which did not exist in England and Wales) came to exist in the US? I am keen to delete the two redundant sections unless anyone objects. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:47, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to the Treaty of Paris section of this article, it resulted in the creation of allodial title in the US. I'm not a US lawyer, so I have no really clear idea of whether that is right, but that's what it says here. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 08:55, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read the text of the treaty. There's no reference to allodial title. I'm beginning to wonder about the content of this article as a whole. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgri_a5f5.html" title="User:Algri">Alan</a> 12:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not to mention that what is stated in the article sounds rather unlikely, anyway: <i>England</i> [sic] <i>agreed to give up any Crown rights to the land, and agreed that all land in the American colonies was held in allodial title</i>. It rather goes without saying that "Crown rights to the land" would be given up, as this is virtually inherent in the notion of conceding independence. And the notion that the treaty would stipulate the nature of property title seems absurd even before reading the text of the treaty; what would be the point?! <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverhelm_8708.html" title="User:Silverhelm">Silverhelm</a> 16:47, 9 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>
