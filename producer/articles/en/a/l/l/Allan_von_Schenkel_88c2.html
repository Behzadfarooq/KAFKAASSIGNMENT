	    <p><b>Allan von Schenkel</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>) is an American <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_bass.html" title="Double bass">double bassist</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance_art.html" title="Performance art">performance artist</a>, music promoter, and composer. He is a self-described "creative bass soloist", and, since the beginning of his music career in the early 1990s, has performed on the double bass with dozens of small and large ensembles, several duet groups with pianists, and completely solo work. He has developed connections with many important personalities in music, including <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Hoiby_9351.html" title="Lee Hoiby">Lee Hoiby</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoko_Ono_397a.html" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_von_Schenkel_88c2.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Schenkel grew up near <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Shasta%2C_California_9cc7.html" title="Mount Shasta, California">Mount Shasta, California</a>. He attended <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shasta_College_dc07.html" title="Shasta College">Shasta College</a> in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redding%2C_California_4731.html" title="Redding, California">Redding, California</a> from 1993 to 1996. During this period of his life he concentrated on composing. His compositions include experimental works for a variety of different instruments. Though most of his composition projects are currently on hold so he can fully dedicate his energy to giving virtuosic bass performances, Schenkel claims that he has composed over three hundred musical works. Schenkel studied composition with Dr. Richard Fiske, a conductor and the gifted student of <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadia_Boulanger_bdcb.html" title="Nadia Boulanger">Nadia Boulanger</a>. He also studied with renowned pianist Ellen Southard.</p>
<p>In 1996, Schenkel relocated to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansing%2C_Michigan_86b2.html" title="Lansing, Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a> to study at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a> from which he eventually received a masters' degree in <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_and_Information_Science_f29d.html" title="Library and Information Science">Library and Information Science</a>. By this time, though he is accomplished on many instruments, he decided to dedicate himself fully to the double bass. In 2005 he relocated to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> area, where he still resides.</p>
<p>Though best known as a performer of contemporary classical music, Schenkel has performed nearly every other style of music, particularly traditional classical music, and world music. His main mentor on the bass has been <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Karr_95f8.html" title="Gary Karr">Gary Karr</a>. He also studied with one of his other mentors, Stefano Sciascia in Italy from 2002 to 2003. He prefers to give recitals rather than make recordings. He explains this by saying "I feel a strong desire to reach out to others. This is the essence of music &#160;— the joy of communicating directly with a live audience." However, he has recorded at least 2 CDs.</p>
<p>Since 2004, Schenkel has expanded his career to include promoting contemporary music for the double bass from around the world. Having always performed with musicians from many different cultures, Schenkel contacted more than 100 composers from dozens of countries and commissioned works for the double bass. He has commissioned works from composers in Italy, Greece, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Israel, Denmark, Ukraine, Belgium, Russia, Japan, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Hungary, Norway, Slovakia, England, Australia, Puerto Rico, South Africa, Iceland, Vietnam, Philippines, Spain, Argentina and Romania. These works come from a variety of different styles of music. He has performed in Italy, Spain, Canada, Mexico and throughout the United States. Now located in Washington DC, he plans to continue solo performances, commissioning new pieces for bass, and exploring new dimensions in sound and musicology.</p>
<p>Since his move to Washington DC, he has concentrated on performing at museums, embassies, and private gatherings, though he has also performed at many other types of venues. His most well-known performance was in November 2005 at the Cosmos Club, when he performed the works of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Hoiby_9351.html" title="Lee Hoiby">Lee Hoiby</a>, together with the composer himself.</p>
<p>In 2006, renowned composer and artist <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoko_Ono_397a.html" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a> wrote a peace for Allan von Schenkel, titled “Secret Piece II” to be premiered at the <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hirshhorn_Museum_c5ea.html" title="Hirshhorn Museum">Hirshhorn Museum</a>. Secret Piece II and many of the other peaces that Schenkel has been performing recently are, according to him, just as much art as music. This has made Von Schenkel a notable <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance_art.html" title="Performance art">performance artist</a>, and he has already exhibited his talents in this area at several museums. These art works involve Schenkel using the double bass in what he claims are innovative ways, such as turning it upside down and making unusual sounds with it. Since the beginning of his career, Schenkel has attempted to lead an expansion in the popularity of the double bass while also exploring its musicological nature and expanding its uses. He believes that his entry into the world of performance art may be an important step in this process.</p>
<p>In 2006, Schenkel formed the Basso Moderno Duo, along with pianist Kristen Williams. Schenkel has become even more active in music since then, and has concentrated most of his musical work on this project.</p>
