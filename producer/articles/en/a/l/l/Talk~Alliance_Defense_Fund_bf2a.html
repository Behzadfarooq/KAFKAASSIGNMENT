<p>I think you are right that "pro-life" and "pro-choice" are the right terms to use. I haven't been able to discover any truly "neutral" terms for those factions; there is always a superficial push and pull going on about how each group wants to define the other, but I think those terms are standard enough to not be significantly controversial at this point. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarkingdoc_2a20.html" title="User:Barkingdoc">BarkingDoc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Pro-life" and "pro-choice" are inherently POV terms and designed as such. "Anti-abortion" or "pro-abortion" is more accurate and more neutral, IMO.207.69.137.35 18:45, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Im fairly certain both of those terms are Pro-life biased. At least with pro-life and pro-choice the positive sounding connotations for each might just cancel eachother out. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 18:02, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's talk about the evidence for deceptive practices by the ADF. Here's the website put up by parents at the school: <a href="http://www.stevenscreekparents.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.stevenscreekparents.org/" rel="nofollow">www.stevenscreekparents.org</a>. Here's some coverage from the <a href="http://www.svcn.com/archives/cupertinocourier/20041222/cu-coverstrip.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.svcn.com/archives/cupertinocourier/20041222/cu-coverstrip.shtml" rel="nofollow">Cupertino Courier</a>, the local paper in town. The <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_Mercury_News_715d.html" title="San Jose Mercury News">San Jose Mercury News</a> ran articles with substantially the same information, but you need to be a subscriber to read them. Some wikipedian asked in their edit comment if this could just be an honest mistake. First note that the claim in the press release headline was extraordinary and highly inflammatory and should have been checked carefully. Second, an organization with integrity would correct its mistake as soon as it was known, but you can <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=3218" class="external text" title="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=3218" rel="nofollow">still find the bogus headline today on the ADF site</a>. There really is no way you can consider this an honest mistake -- it's fully intentional. I think to have a complete understanding of the ADF's goals and how it operates, we need to show the full spectrum of their tactics. I personally consider this type of intentional deceptiveness to be unethical (especially for a group that claims a goal of promoting "Truth"), but perhaps others would consider it normal and acceptable behavior. --69.228.92.139
<dl>
<dd>Well then, im not sure what way i've done it then, but I still prefer to give the ADF the benefit of the doubt. Of course, my opinion in this case doesn't really mean anything in terms of the article, but I do think that the section shouldn't just state "their deceptive practices", it needs to say who claims it, and I doubt any of those references have found proof positive that the ADF was indeed fully cooperating in a deceptive practice. The first link doesn't sound like a very good source, but the newspapers sound fine, and you can certainly mention how the information on the ADF page is still not conforming with how the newspapers write the story. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Take a look at the article now, I've added references which may allay some of your concerns (although probably not all). The most informative website I've found on this episode is the one put up by parents of the Stevens Creek Elementary School students <a href="http://www.stevenscreekparents.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stevenscreekparents.org" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> -- understandably they parent's have done the most legwork because it was their kids who went through the ordeal, it was their cash-strapped school district that had to foot the legal bills, and it was their community that got slimed in the worldwide press. I also added a link to the <i>Cupertino Courier</i>, the hometown paper which covered the aftermath effects on the community. I agree it's a good idea to substantiate who is claiming ADF was deceptive -- one good source is the press release put out by the parents' group which uses the term "<b>proven falsehood</b>".<a href="http://www.stevenscreekparents.org/pr021605.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stevenscreekparents.org/pr021605.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> And yes, the parents are willing to make a statement that this could no way have happened unintentionally -- see the reporting from the <i>Los Altos Crier</i>, another local paper, their is a spokesman of the parents' group who asserts "<b>You don't get to this place by accident. It had to be deliberate and planned.</b>"<a href="http://www.latc.com/2005/01/05/schools/schools1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latc.com/2005/01/05/schools/schools1.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I'll revise the article accordingly, being sure to state the source as the kids' parents. --69.228.92.139 01:59, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you quite understand, the reason I say that this information should be attributed to the sources rather than just stated as fact in the article is because it is in the <i>source's opinion</i> that it is a proven fact, the only way to really prove it as a fact would be to somehow raid the ADF offices and find proof. I'm not saying your sources are horrible and shouldn't be used, (Though I might personally find their assertions to be rather baseless, and I suspect the first one might not qualify as extremely authoritative) i'm simply saying the article shouldn't say "The ADF engaged in a proven falsehood", but rather, "So and so sources have attributed the ADF's actions as unethical, labelling their claims as "Proven falsehoods"" or something to that equivalent, though it sounds like you may already have the idea. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 02:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have dropped "deceptive" from the text &amp; have followed your recommendation to use verbatim quotes from attributed sources. Thanks for your suggestions. I've added an inline quote from the parents group that expresses their opinion of the ADF -- the reader can decide for himself what to make of these irate parents. The <i>Williams vs. Widmar</i> case is an important one in understanding the whole picture of the ADF and I think the article is much more balanced now that we have a critical outside view of the organization to counter-balance ADF's own view of itself (this article started out almost entirely consisting of stuff taken from the ADF website -- hardly a source of unbiased information!). Bit by bit, edit by edit, we can hope we are getting closer to the truth (the one without the capital "T"). --69.228.92.139 04:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you mind horribly if we remove the first sentence, it's the part that is basically saying "The ADF has engaged in ebil!" <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 04:27, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>The ADF has occasionally resorted to questionable ethical behavior in its quest to tilt the cultural landscape towards a right-wing Christian worldview.</i>"</dd>
<dd>to:</dd>
<dd>"<i>The ADF has been accused of resorting to questionable ethical behavior in its quest to tilt the cultural landscape towards a right-wing Christian worldview.</i>"</dd>
<dd>If you've got a better way to introduce the paragraphs that follow, go for it. The journalist in me insists on having a summary statement of some sort to prep the reader for what's coming. This is especially important for something complex like this where the background has to be given first before the ADF role can be understood.</dd>

<p>"in a quest to tilt the cultural landscape towards a right-wing Christian worldview." Does anyone think this part seems quite slanted?

<dd>Well, to his credit, (Or her) he did fix a spelling mistake in his last edit&#160;:/. But the one thing I don't get, he clearly seems to be editing to insert the ADF's personal definition of everything into the article, (I assume to make it more pro-ADF, there's so many editors making the same edit over and over, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> seems a bit wasted here) yet removes the links to two of the court cases the ADF was involved in, and won't stop deleting the link to the Day of Truth website? <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 18:35, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section called "ADF ethics questioned" is seriously flawed.</p>
<p>1) It goes on and on and on about something being labeled as "banned" but was not actually "banned" in reality, although it was restricted.</p>
<p>2) It does this for a single instance of a claimed ethics violation.</p>
<p>3) Similar cases of labeling things as "banned" do not get such treatment in other articles. For example, in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Library_Association_00af.html" title="American Library Association">American Library Association</a>, so-called "Banned Books Week" is not even mentioned, even though "Banned Books Week" is 25 years old, is pumped into every public library in the USA, and almost none of the books claimed to be banned has actually been banned. "Banned Books Week" is a total and complete fabrication designed to convince the public that no books should be kept away from children, no matter what the law says or no matter what common sense says or no matter how highly sexualized the book may be. But nobody on the ALA page has, like here for the ADF, a huge section about the nitty gritty details of exactly how and why the ALA is unethical. In fact it doesn't even register at all. The question of ethics is not even raised.</p>
<p>I suggest this section be removed in its entirety for the reasons of lack of consistency with similar treatment in other articles, and for the reasons stated above. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a> 01:06, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a>, your line of reasoning certainly differs from mine and I can see why we don't see eye-to-eye on this article. Let me respond to each of your points so you can see how I look at this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, the claim that the Declaration was banned comes directly from the ADF. It was the title of their press release. I quote: "Declaration of Independence Banned from Classroom". That was both malicious and false. Not only was it not banned, it was not restricted. Where did you get the idea it was restricted? In the end the ADF agreed the original school policy was correct and in need of no changes. That comes directly from the statement agreed on by both sides when the ADF elected to drop the case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, yes this is only a single incident, but thanks to the ADF publicity machine it was a very widely disseminated and highly publicized incident. Try googling "Declaration of Independence Banned" and you can see the impact of what the ADF did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third, I am not impressed by your argument that since nobody is complaining about the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Library_Association_00af.html" title="American Library Association">American Library Association</a>'s "complete and total fabrications", there should not be any mention in this article of any ethics lapses on the part of the ADF. Ethically, isn't this argument the equivalent of the shoplifting teen who pleads with the store security officer that he should go free because he knows some other kids who shoplifts all the time and never gets caught? What would happen if the store security guy though about it and agreed "good point!" and let the kid go? If the ALA is telling malicious lies, or lies that stoke unwarranted over-reaction, I say <b>go put the truth on the ALA page, instead of preventing it from being put on this page</b>. Both organizations (and the shoplifting kid) will be better off in the long run if we hold them accountable for their actions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My final point is actually a request. You may find the actions of the ADF in this case to be ethically acceptable. Please consider that not everyone may look at the same facts and reach the same conclusion. If you delete the negatives and only allow positives to be said about the ADF, you deprive others of the opportunity to judge for themselves. -- <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 13:58, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Technopilgrim, guess what. I actually agree with you! So the entire set of information regarding this incident maybe should not be forgotten. I say it is worth a sentence, and definitely not a separate section. Let's be honest -- this section on this single incident is a significant portion of the article as it exists now. Certainly that cannot be encyclopedic. I am suggesting, therefore, that all that writing is not encyclopedic. A sentence or two, yes, but not that huge thing. And I agree that the <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46476" class="external text" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46476" rel="nofollow">info should be added to the ALA page about the Banned Books Week hoax</a>, perhaps with a single citation to get the reader started. But certainly I will not write a big. long, separately labeled section about how unethical the ALA is. Which brings up another point.</dd>

<dd>The claim that this ADF incident is unethical is in itself POV. Perhaps hyperbole at a minimum might be better, but to say it's unethical is overreaching. Look, people like one of the Kennedy family have been saying if the world does not stop polluting the world will end in 10 years. And that was over 20 years ago. Yet no one is saying he is unethical, at least for that. Claims that the ADF is unethical are POV and are not encyclopedic.</dd>

<dd>By the way, I never implied the ADF is ethical; as you can see, I am merely reacting to the obvious bias, POV, and nonwikiness of the huge section on this single incident as it currently exists. It's like taking an article on Jesse Jackson then making the most significant section about how unethical he was to father a secret child -- providing gory detail as to exact how, what, and who said what and when. That would be nonencyclopedic. Similarly, this huge section you defend is similarly nonencylopedic.</dd>

<p>WOW! I am now reading the link to the case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino%2C_California#Stevens_Creek_Elementary_lawsuit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino%2C_California#Stevens_Creek_Elementary_lawsuit" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and I find the facts there differ from the facts here! In fact I now question the truthfulness of the information in this section that I am calling into question. For example, "With the assistance of the Alliance Defense Fund, Williams alleged that the school had violated his rights when principal Patricia Vidmar began to screen the handouts that he intended to give to his fifth-grade class during lessons on the history of the United States." .... "The handouts included quotations from the Declaration of Independence...." So the facts show only quotations were questioned, not the whole thing as this section suggests. Further, "Unfortunately for the school district, the Associated Press incorrectly reported that Williams was alleging that he was being prevented from teaching the Declaration of Independence. Conservative websites and such commentators as Alan Keyes ([1]) played up the story as a blatant instance of hostility to religion. These interpretations were based on the Alliance Defense Fund press release." Well, well, now it appears the AP "incorrectly" reported. Is the AP to be considered unethical now?</p>
<p>So now I argue the material should be pulled for failure to be factual. I'm still working on the substitute section. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a> 20:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. In the Litigation section I would add the following to replace the entire section called into question:</p>
<p><br />
In November 2004, ADF filed a lawsuit (<i><a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupertino%2C_California_5b42.html#Stevens_Creek_Elementary_lawsuit" title="Cupertino, California">Williams v. Vidmar</a></i>) on behalf of a <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupertino%2C_California_5b42.html" title="Cupertino, California">Cupertino, California</a> elementary school teacher against his school principal and school board members. The ADF issued a press release entitled "Declaration of Independence Banned from Classroom", a title that caused considerable controversy. In August 2005, the plaintiffs settled out of court. Per the official statement by both parties, no change was necessary to school policy. Several days later the plaintiff teacher resigned from the school district and left the state<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>That is my opinion of what's factual, non POV, relevant, encyclopedic, and wiki-correct. Do you agree? Make the changes if you do - that would be appropriate under the circumstance. Let's see what others think. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a> 21:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>I object to those changes</b> I would like proponents of the change to state the following: 1. The Central Change sought: 2. The main stream citation used to add the language: 3. The reason this change is necessary and significant 4. Is there an argument you can think of to remove this addition, and if so, now is your time to get first chance to say why it is not valid.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I also disagree with the short version as it strikes me as not far different from what the ADF PR department would write if they had the chance (of course their <i>first</i> preference would be to completely delete the section). I think this is one of those articles where you have to let both sides take a good swing at conveying their perspective. Look, the main bulk of the article was originally derived from the ADF's own website. That is hardly an unbiased source, and the detail is quite extensive, but I'm not for trimming it down because it does give one side of the picture (and I enjoy the jazzy stuff about how the apprentice system develops green lawyers into Constitutional law wizards, etc., I think that's interesting).</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But for readers to understand the <i>whole</i> picture about the ADF they need to know that from time to time, the ADF hits below the belt. Intentionally. It's how they play the game. Is ADF unethical? Well, a whole bunch of people in California think so. And readers need to understand why they think that way. But to really understand this incident (especially because it doesn't match the unabashedly enthusiastic tone of the rest of the article) the reader needs to hear the story in some detail.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If I thought the incident was the mistake of a junior partner, I'd agree with your general feeling -- everybody makes mistakes, it doesn't deserve a lot of space. But I don't believe this incident can be interpreted that way -- this was done intentionally, and willfully, just as the Cupertino parents assert. So the incident deserves a full recounting, at least in my opinion. As I said above, it's not bad to bring these things into the light of day, whether you are a fan or a critic of the ADF. -- <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 22:56, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a problem though with that train of thought, you say it was done intentionally "as the Cupertino parents assert", but what if their wrong? Yes, it was pretty silly for the ADF to mis-represent this, but I don't see how we can compleatly confirm that it was clearly intentional to lie on the ADF's part. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 23:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it was an unintentional mistake -- a screw up -- the ADF would have issued a correction, or at least pulled the defamatory press release from their website. Their failure to do so is what really made it clear where the ADF was coming from, at least in the eyes of the Cupertino parents. It's not hard for me to understand their perspective. There are more links to the statements by the parents organization (which cut across political and religious lines), if you check out some of the links on the <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupertino%2C_California_5b42.html" title="Cupertino, California">Cupertino, California</a> page. Plus it's rather hard to believe that a smart bunch of guys like the ADF legal team, could have somehow <i>accidentally</i> never checked into the facts of the case until a week or two before the trial (when the ADF dropped the whole thing -- and why would they do <i>that</i> if there was a real substance to their case? -- certainly not because the school district had deeper pockets for legal fees you can be sure of that!). --- <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 23:19, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's also possible that, since the ADF is pretty mixed up in all the wheelings and dealings of the United State's political structure, they felt pressured not to issue a correction, hoping the issue would go away. Of course, that's not ethical either, but the point is that the possibilities are numerous, and we can't just state "The ADF purposefully issued a false report" unequivocally. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 21:02, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay. Let's take a poll.</p>
<p>Who is in favor of removing that giant, overwhelming section on a single incident of alleged ethics violations and replacing it with several sentences in the Legal section that recount the problem but without the nonwiki bloat and POV?</p>
<p>SafeLibraries.org says yes, make the change. What say you all? --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a> 04:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, no one is responding. Further, in history, I see the section has been cut out and restored, so clearly it is still problematic. So I'll soon use my proposed method of cutting out the section but including several sentences in the section for legal issues. This section on ethics being questioned clearly dominates the articles, is clearly POV, is clearly not encyclopedic, is an obviously a point of contention. So I will do as originally suggested above soon, then the POV-check tag can be removed. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a> 00:31, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not white-wash the ethics section in your proposed fashion. The silence you have received for your poll does not indicate a dissastisfaction with the article, but rather that your proposed changes do not deserve further comment than they already received above. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> has rasised serious objections and you never responded to his requests. I also answered your objections point by point, to which you did not respond at all. Your proposed editing actions are entirely in keeping with what the ADF publicity department would put out, and directly violates Wikipedia's NPOV policy. Please respond why you think <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a>'s requests are unreasonable, and please confirm that you understand that it is the ADF that claimed the Declaration was <b>banned</b>. Read their press release. Your point that the Declaration wasn't really banned is exactly what needs to be made clear to the reader -- the ADF is quite willing to resort to slander from time to time, in keeping with their own brand of ethics. -- <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 01:24, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It did provide all the link to the source of where information come from, including tv company, newspaper etc. Without detail information on the lawsuit, the current "ADF ethics questioned", I have to agreed that its neutrality is questionable, lacking "the otherside of the story" from non-ADF source regarding reference material.--John Siu 16:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually I am not sure how to make this section more neutral without heavily quoting court docunment and present court exhibits. The only website found doing this is eriposte. However, regarding the suit, it only present exhibits (discription only, no photos), and lecking on other information, like in court argument, court transcript, etc. Things that actually happen in courtroom. Maybe a link for the whole court procceding, transcript will do some balance, but I have no idea how or where to find that.--John Siu 16:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
