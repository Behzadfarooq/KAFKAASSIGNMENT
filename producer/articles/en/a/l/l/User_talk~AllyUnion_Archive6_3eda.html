<p>Sorry. It can be explained by my desperation. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 15:43, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quite frankly I am a little confused. From your comments at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EMeta-templates_considered_harmful_053c.html#Scope_creep" title="Wikipedia talk:Meta-templates considered harmful">Wikipedia talk:Meta-templates considered harmful#Scope creep</a> it looks like you are endorsing <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a>'s overwrought and distorted description of the stub creation process. So instead of getting a substantive response to my comments, Netoholic just adds a "me, too" post, and then accuses me of trolling and deception as well. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 20:27, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I specifically added in the suggestion to use "subst:" at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Wikipedia%7EMeta-templates_considered_harmful_c554.html#Alternatives" title="Wikipedia:Meta-templates considered harmful">Wikipedia:Meta-templates considered harmful#Alternatives</a>, but <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> deleted that. Personally, I also think that his suggested alternative of using lists instead of the topic stub is completely unworkable and that should be deleted from the page. If I either add back in the suggestion to use "subst:" or delete the suggestion to use lists, however, I am sure that Netoholic will just revert and then heap more abuse on me, since calling anyone who disagrees with him a troll seems to be a standard tactic with him (he accuses <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItai_a5d4.html" title="User:Itai">User:Itai</a> of trolling on the same talk page, for example).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also believe that there are significant problems with the direct use of meta-templates, but I found Netaholic's description of the topic stub creation process was so exaggerated that I found it difficult to believe or trust anything that he said. It was <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">User:Jamesday</a>'s careful description that gave the details for the problems with meta-templates that convinced me. (I also think that it is highly hypocritical for Netoholic to be worrying about the possibility of DOS attacks using meta-templates when his edit warring over templates and meta-templates has the same effect.) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 22:59, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Concerning the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_comic_and_cartoon_characters_98f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of comic and cartoon characters">cartoon character list VfD</a>, isn't 9 of 15 votes for deletion (60%) less than the required 70% for consensus? I'm not especially concerned about this list (even though I voted to keep it), and won't miss it now that it's gone, but this strikes me as encouraging the "simple majority consensus" argument that I've seen misused elsewhere. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 07:16, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My judgement calls are based on how far apart the delete and keep votes are. If they are even, one vote apart, I tend to call it no consensus. If it is 2 votes apart, it depends on the situation. If it is 3 or more, then I consider it as consensus to whatever is leading. The deletion process doesn't mention any set percentage of how much a vote is necessary in order to delete it. If there were a percentage, we might have a lot of junk articles around... because then a strong consensus would be required to delete any article... -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:32, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, thanks for the quick reply! I'm not sure I agree with such slim margins, but I'm certain I don't have your experience with such judgment calls, and I'm a believer in not being straitjacketed by numbers and immutable policies.

<dd>No problem. You'd have to consider that the English Wikipedia is very large, and we try to keep junk out of the system.

<dd>You'd also have to consider, if we didn't have slim margins, a lot of articles would have to go through renomination process, especially when you can clearly see a need for deletion. Although I disagree with your particular list, I didn't vote on it, therefore I have to be non-biased when going through these deletions. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:48, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AllyUnion: You wrote: <i>I wish to assist you with your bot request. Could clarify the problem for me? Below is what I understand. Please correct me if I'm incorrect.</i></p>
<p><i>In the article, Communes_of_the_province_of_Brescia, there are links to several articles in a list format of: * [[Article]] or *[[Article]]. You want each article in this to make sure that all articles in the taxobox is linked correctly as: [[Regions of Italy|Region]]</i></p>

<p>Hey, this template doesn't work!<br />
<b>* <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Pestszentl%C3%85%E2%80%98rinc_9e24.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/PestszentlÅ‘rinc">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/PestszentlÅ‘rinc</a></b><br />
I wanted to link to the above, but the deletion template doesn't work. Are these characters really so nasty? At least I can link (above) to the article with the faulty title, and from that page you can reach its "Votes for deletion" entry. The problem is more than obvious... --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 01:26, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe it's easier if I copy the appropriate "Votes for deletion" message:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article obviously has an incorrect character in its title, so it should be deleted. (There is an article with a well-formed title on the same topic, <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pestszentlorinc.html" title="Pestszentlorinc">Pestszentlorinc</a>, it contains all the information mentioned in the previous article.) --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 00:54, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note: redirect would also be possible, and this way users perhaps wouldn't feel necessary to create a new article with a "more precise" name. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 01:35, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
<p>."</p>
<p>and for your help, but that's what I had done (as I read in the VfD instructions), and it didn't work for me -- that's why I asked for help. It still doesn't work really well for me: the template itself works though, but its link is red and it links to a new, non-existent page: Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/PestszentlÅâ€˜rinc whose title is even worse than the title in question. (BTW, I use Opera 7.54u1. I wonder if the fixed link works well for you.) Anyway, I hope that whoever wants to visit the page, will be able to do so sooner or later...</p>

<p>Thanks for the reminder. Like what I have mentioned at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html#A_time_of_crisis" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">a time of crisis</a>, the recent discussion involves understanding of the complicated political and legal statuses of the entities.

<p>Hi AllyUnion,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you for help. I have posted reports on continuous and extremely malicious acts of vandalism by anon user 84.154.xx.xx in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress</a> but unfortunately and rather surprisingly to me, received no feedback from admins and no reaction and punishment followed against the vandal. Could you please help me with this issue?

<dd>AllyUnion, just wanted to quickly thank you for introducing a temporary vandalism protection in <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavids.html" title="Safavids">Safavids</a> page. This anon user 84.154.xx.xx. now started to vandalize and insult me in <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">my userpage</a>, but this again shows his lack of civility combined with feeble helplessness.

<p>Hi AllyUnion. Now, when you put page protection to the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavids.html" title="Safavids">Safavids</a> page, this anon 84.154.xx.xx switched on to my userpage and simply terrorizes me with his stupid insults. Today he vandalized <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">my userpage</a> (see page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tabib&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tabib&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>) 3 (THREE-!) times, this time operating under IP # 84.154.50.175. Before that he also vandalized my user page several times. He not only vandalizes the page, but writes explicit personal insults. He even dared to insult me publicly again in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html#84.154.104.16" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia vandalism in progress</a>.

<p>I would like to assist you in creating this bot. I will need some specifications in what exactly you intent for it to do and I assist in designing one for you to operate. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 04:46, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bot will take data from the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/" rel="nofollow">CIA World Factbook</a> and insert the values into <a href="../../../m/i/l/Template%7EMilitary_f2ca.html" title="Template:Military">Template:Military</a>, which will then be applied to the individual "military of..." articles. For example, the template at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Afghanistan_bb8b.html" title="Military of Afghanistan">Military of Afghanistan</a> contains data from <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html#Military" class="external free" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html#Military" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html#Military</a>. I've never used a bot before and don't know the technical limitations and the specifics of operating one. Presumably, it will just generate the template wikicode and I'll insert them manually? I would like to have the template applied, with fresh CIA data, to all the military of articles. This could be expanded to other articles in wikiproject countries like demographics. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Ji</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang">ang</a> 06:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It can either one of two things:
<ol>
<li>Use, for example, based on the Afghanistan data, {{subst:military|age=22 years of age (2004 est.)|availability=6,785,414 (2004 est.)|service=3,642,659 (2004 est.)|reaching age=263,406 (2004 est.)|dollar figure= $61 million (2003)|percent GDP= 1% (2003)}}. This means that the taxobox is hardcoded into the page, rather than including the template into the page.</li>
<li>Use it without the subst: tag, meaning it uses the template on the page with the facts and information based on the CIA page.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The specifics of operating one is that you must get it approved at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a> first before using it. However, because this is a yearly thing, I don't think you necessarily need it approved.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the technical limitations... There is two I can forsee. The bot would need a list of the article names with cooresponding URLs. We're not certain for 100% that the URLs will stay static year to year. The second one is the color issue.</dd>
<dd>However, I have solutions for this:
<ol>
<li>The bot is actually manually run and manually assisted</li>
<li>The article and URL is entered manually (prompted part of the program)</li>
<li>The color number is also requested by the bot</li>
<li>Any additional text to be added.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>There is one requirement on your part. You must have Python 2.3 installed on your system, as it will be using the pyWikipediaBot framework. I will assist you in the details of how to set up the framework for your needs.</dd>
<dd>Also, it can update and replace existing taxoboxes / templates / insert in the top of the article. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:19, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
