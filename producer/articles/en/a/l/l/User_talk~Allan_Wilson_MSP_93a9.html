<p>Just a quick note: you have been making some odd spelling mistakes for an MP - such as <i>deputes</i> not <b>deputies</b> and <i>catagory</i> not <b>category</b>.

<p>Hi. It seems your Wikipedia user name resembles that of Allan Wilson, the Scottish politician. To prevent unfortunate cases where pranksters pretend to be someone famous, our user name policy (at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a>) requires that such accounts be blocked (the part where it says "Names of well-known living or recently deceased people"). We do, however, realise that some (regrettably only a very few) of such cases are infact the <i>real</i> person named; to that end, can I ask you to email info-en-q@wikimedia.org (mentioning this discussion at "User talk:Allan Wilson MSP") from your official email address and confirm that you really are Mr Wilson, or that you're editing on his behalf. The people who handle that email list will then be able to unblock this account. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope you'll understand why we need to be careful in this regard. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 20:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is nothing short of ridiculous, a classic example of <b>Party Political Smearing Tatics</b> as pointed out on the "Talk Page" of <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> on that very subject. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> has now fallen foul of the very same crime.</p>
<p>While <b>"Allan Wilson"</b> may very well be some sort of <b>Famous Person"</b>, <b>"Allan Wilson MSP"</b> is also a <b>"Member of The Scottish Parliament"</b>.</p>
<p>I am employed by <b>"Allan Wilson MSP"</b> as <b>"Administrator of his online Presence"</b> and have been in that position for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>Recently, Members of The Scottish Parliament <b>(MSP's)</b> were recently made aware of <b>"Party Political Smearing"</b> tactics being deployed on "wikipedia.org/" where an "editor" connected or sympathising with one particular "Political Party" edits the pages of members of an "Opposing Political Party" in an effort to "degrade" or otherwise "smear" the target "Member". Members were therefore advised to create accounts for themselves in order to be able to monitor, identify and "Respond" to such tactics.</p>
<p>These smear tactics are often cunning in their nature so as to avoid the scrutiny of other editors and often take the form of simply "deleting" important information or data, changing ones status, and changing or deleting information within the text in order to "paint a different picture" of the target.</p>
<p>A recent example of this was the deletion of the entire "Personal" page of one user (Allan Wilson MSP). There was absolutely no reason for this, it was his personal page.</p>
<p><b>THIS TATIC GOES ONE STEP FURTHER IN BANNING HIM COMPLETELY</b></p>
<p>As a result of the <b>"Party Political Smearing"</b> going on at "wikipedia.org/", Allan ask me to monitor and "DEAL WITH" any such happenings on this site in respect to his name, position and status.</p>
<p>To that end, accounts were created for the following users, user names by which he is most commonly known; These accounts are: User Name: Allanwilson User Name: Allan Wilson User Name: Allan Wilson MSP</p>
<p>You are likely to experience many more such incidents as Members get a handle on what is going on here and learn how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Members of The Scottish Parliament have better things to do and simply do not have the time to deal with things such as this at this level, it would consume <b>ALL</b> their time if they even <b>THOUGHT</b> about it. They employ staff to do this for them. I am one of that staff, Administrator of his "Online Presence". A typical <b>MSP</b> would not have the slightest clue as to how to go about dealing with what is happening to them on this site.</p>
<p>Members of The Scottish Parliament are not "amused" by what is happening here. Let one watch very carefully what they are doing here. Party Political Smearing on "wikipedia.org/" has to be brought to an end and this is a clasic example of it in action.</p>
<p>Would you believe that User Allan Wilson MSP is as of now even dissalowed from even responding to <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> by email concerning that so called users callous actions.</p>
<p><b>SO LETS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE, REMOVE THIS BAN AT ONCE</b></p>

<p>and think. I hardly believe Wikipedia (not "wikipedia.org/') is difficult to use, and anyway, a degree in computer science is very different from being proficient in using the Internet.</p>
<p>First please stop starting random words with capital letters. It's annoying and people will think you're Eddie Segoura. Also, don't SHOUT, and don't <b>BOLD THINGS LIKE THIS</b>. You seem to have mastered that part of wikitext fine! It has been explained clearly above why your account has been blocked, and how to go about removing the block. However, if you read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">our biographical article guidelines</a> you will see editing an article about yourself (<i>or instructing someone else to do this for you</i> is not allowed, and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Role_accounts" class="extiw" title="m:Role_accounts">m:Role accounts</a> are also prohibited. So, I don't think the account should be unblocked, as (Scottish) Members of Parliament have no reason to edit their own articles, or order changes to be made. Correcting inaccuracies is okay, obviously.</p>

<p>There is no logical comment to that. That is my style and this is my "User Talk Page" (sorry about that) (I have been a "Technical Author" for 25 years so know something about it) The same applies to those who complain about "spelling". One should note the differences in spelling in the "English" (UK) dictionary compared to the "US" dictionary.</p>
<p>The purpose of this member is <b>NOT</b> to carry out discussions pertaining to "editing" etiquette but to simply protect ones self against smearing tactics or incorrect statements in articles pertaining to him.</p>
<p>There is <b>NO OTHER</b> purpose.</p>
<p>ALL Members have been advised to do this and it has been propagated throughout the Parliament.</p>
<p>This specific issue has been noted as an example for the concern as have others involving other Members.</p>
<p>Members of the Parliament certainly <b>DO</b> have the right to protect and defend themselves, whatever the source. They have a "Legal" department to ensure that right.</p>
<p>The page you mention; <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Role_accounts" class="external free" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Role_accounts" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Role_accounts</a> This does not exist&#160;????</p>
<p>Not going to get into a discussion about it but you seem to think it is ok if someone edits the page of a Member of Parliament (an elected Government Official) calling him (for example) a "Ding Bat" and that the target has absolutely no right to do anything about it.</p>
<p>I think others might disagree with you on that point.</p>
<p>(The Member certainly isn't going to be too "chuffed" about it either) (chuffed by the way is a "Scottish" term)</p>
<p>Yes, I have learned "some" things about "Wikipedia" coding techniques but it remains a fact that a typical professional person (a medical doctor if you like) would not have a clue as to how to defend or respond to "incorrect" things being said about them.</p>
<p>You think that is fare?</p>
<p>Hopefully not, but that is the way it is and we are doing our best to learn the system and we <b>WILL</b>.</p>
<p>However none of this is the intent or purpose of these discussions. Lets keep the dialogue limited to the point in question.</p>
<p>The issue is resolved (for the time being).</p>
<p>Status-quo remaining equal, nothing more will be said about it until an issue arises warranting it..</p>
<p>Members will be monitoring articles pertaining to them.</p>
<p>Case Closed...</p>

<dd>Right, I will try to address your concerns in a civil manner, unlike that in which they were given!</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Spelling</b>: The spelling concerns were neither American or British English; just plain made up!</li>
<li><b>Editing one's own article</b>: Just don't do it, and don't instruct others to either. I said earlier that of course, factual inaccuracies may be corrected.</li>
<li><b>Role accounts</b>: My apologies, my mistake, though with a little searching and common sense you could have found it yourself, I'm sure!</li>
<li><b>Other points</b>: Please, being rude will get you nowhere here! Comments like <i><b>NOW LETS GET THIS RESOLVED AND STOP THE SILLY CARRY ON'</b> will not endear you to the Project. Now please just email the address above from an official email address as instructed,</i> and you will be unblocked! <i>Simple eh? Otherwise, it seems you're just a childish imposter...of an MSP?

<p>"£2.50 please sir" said the bus driver to AW MSP. "You think that is fare?" he replied. "I know that's the fare" he replied, "I drive this fucking bus!" "So, £2.50 it is" said the conductor. "SO LETS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE!" said Allan vehemently.</p>

<p>I am new here trying and willing to learn and learning fast.</p>
<p>First lesson, be extremely careful what you say and how you say it, don't ever use bold and use a spell checker that knows how to spell in the editors language. (I use the AOL one, don't know what language that is, obviously not to the liking of some)</p>
<p>I am here as are others in my position mainly to monitor and respond to incorrect, misleading, defamatory or otherwise down right smearing in articles pertaining to Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>However, it turns out I (we) also have a contribution we can make regarding new or currently empty articles on the subject. Who else is there better equipped to do so.</p>
<p>Like who else would know the precise detailed job description of a Cabinet Minister other than that minister, his boss or perhaps a couple of other ministers, none of whom are represented here or are proficient or have the time required to respond or contribute here themselves.</p>
<p>I truly hope I can share the following here without the sky falling in on me again.</p>
<p>(there seems to be some very sensitive people out there looking for problems)</p>
<p>Yes, I am starting to learn.</p>
<p>I had been sort of wondering (very quietly without comment of course) why it was the "Admins" were allowing Gary's last rather strange comment, foul language and all, to stand while bringing the wrath of God down upon me. Well, I have been enlightened.</p>
<p>I have subsequently been extremely fortunate to have received a number of private "off the record" statements detailing in great detail how things work, countless links and all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, seeing how one cannot voice there concerns here, I dare not even hint at there contents here for fear of further reprisals, and that is a shame.</p>
<p>What I think might be safe to say (hopefully) is that the vast majority of the people, admins, editors or whatever, are good decent people. There are however some really bad apples out there.</p>
<p>It only takes one bad apple to stink up the whole barrel.</p>
<p>The problem facing the good apples is much the same as mine, the good apples can do or say nothing against the bad apples for fear of being trashed by the often higher ranking bad apples who as a result end up running the show. That is really quite a shame but nothing can be done about it.</p>
<p>Armed with all this new-found knowledge I will do my very best to live within the newly learned rules and do my very best to stay well clear of the bad apples scrutiny, though I don't agree with being banned for using <b>bold</b> on my talk page or where I feel it is necessary. Hopefully someday the good apples may get control back.</p>
<p>I hope this is satisfactory to all concerned.</p>

<li>Stop complaining.

<p>On 24 June 2006, the following paragraph was removed from the biography of Allan Wilson MSP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wilson_%28MSP%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wilson_%28MSP%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wilson_%28MSP%29</a> by editor B G Wilson:</p>
<p><i>He is married and has two sons. Outside politics he was a keen footballer and a well known member of the Ayrshire football fraternity.</i></p>
<p>I can see no reason why it should have been removed and request it be reinstated for the following reasons;</p>
<p>The biography of many members contain short statements such as this and I can see no reason why Allan Wilson's biography should be singled out as being any different.</p>
<p>To cite but a few of the many cases in point as an example;</p>
<p><b>Frank McAveety</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAveety" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAveety" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAveety</a></p>

<p><i>She was married twice: firstly to Donald Bain in 1968 and secondly to fellow MSP Fergus Ewing in 1983, who is the son of Winnie Ewing.</i></p>
<p>I would ask, what makes the deleted paragraph in the biography of Allan Wilson any different than those?</p>
<p>Though I see no reason for having to do so, if someone feels the need to further "qualify" the removed statement, that can be very easily accomplished by the addition of a few words as follows;</p>
<p><i>He is married, Lives in Kilbirnie, and has two sons.</i> Having previously held the position of Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, outside politics he is a keen footballer and a well known member of the Ayrshire football fraternity.</p>

<dd>Allan, or Allan's assistant, I am going to add back in that wee bit, because it is perfectly legitimate, and frankly quite elementary biographical data. Nothing controversial!! However, I feel that we really do need to provide a citation (please see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) in order to put in adjectives like "well-known"; and what, exactly is a "member" of a football "fraternity"? Eg, does Allan actually hold any positions of responsibility or honorary positions within any club or association? If he does, then great: we just state the facts. If not, then we need a reliable source for the description "well-known member of the Ayrshire football fraternity". Best wishes. Yes, I know Wikipedia is a pain in the a***, but it doesn't take <i>that</i> long to get to know the ropes. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 15:12, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mmmm... please do not go to any bother, because quite frankly we are not going to give a long list of directorships or positions held by Allan (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7EListcruft_3123.html" title="WP:Listcruft">WP:Listcruft</a>). Just one example of a position he holds within the "Ayrshire football fraternity" will be quite sufficient. I would much rather that we improved the actual "meat" of the article, ie. his politics, rather than start expanding on his hobbies!!!

<p><b>source for the description</b></p>
<p>Hello, Don't know if I should put this on your Talk page or ours, I will try it here first.</p>
<p>Below is a reference to qualify the statements in question. As requested, only one of his positions is singled out. All the background is there, just pick out what you need to qualify the "well known in fraternity bit" which was in question. Wasn't looking for the specific naming of any position actually. Was quite happy with just the "he is well known in the fraternity" bit which is mentioned in many places. But there is no problem with naming a position if you feel it necessary.</p>
<p>Yes, he does hold a position of responsibility within a club - he is the chairman.</p>
<p>This reference should qualify all the requirements including the "well known" bit. It cites the source which has a wide distribution and mentions all the names and places and people who can serve as a reference for the information. It was also printed in other publications and I can get the names of those if need be.</p>
<p>I can also supply other references that mention the material in question which should substantiate the being well known part if need be.</p>
<p>You can extract whatever data you require out of the following and assemble it in whatever format it needs to be. I don't think we need to write a book on it though, we were quite happy with the few words that were there in the first place. Given that, you are quite right, there is plenty to be said about his political achievements though, somehow, I have the feeling they wouldn't last long.</p>
<p>Ok, I have ratted on too long (I love writing), herewith the reference:</p>
<p>A press release in the Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald, a local newspaper distributed throughout North Ayrshire and the offshore islands of Arran, Millport and Cumbrae an area comprising some 300 cities and towns.</p>
<p><b>New Sports Club Formed in Kilbirnie Under Chairmanship of MSP Allan Wilson - 16th January 2006</b></p>
<p>Ten football clubs have come together under the chairmanship of local MSP Allan Wilson to form a Community Football Club in Kilbirnie.</p>
<p>At a meeting in the Garnock Labour Club convened by SFA Regional Manager Richard Wilson and supported by Kilbirnie Ladeside JFC, Kilbirnie Ryeside under 21's and Kilbirnie Ladeside youth teams at under 17,16,13,12,11,9 and 8 levels all agreed to reconstitute themselves as Kilbirnie Community Football Club.</p>
<p>"I have long advocated the formation of such a club and I am pleased to have been asked by the local teams to chair the new club committee" said Mr Wilson.</p>
<p>"Incorporation also provides the opportunity to secure funding assistance from other public agencies and private sponsors and the means to use that money for the mutual benefit of the clubs and the community alike" said Mr Wilson.</p>
<p>SFA Regional Manager Richard Wilson concurred saying, "The Scottish Football Association are delighted to support the formation of Community Clubs and I was very enthused at how committed all present at the meeting were to the development of such a club in the town of Kilbirnie. The SFA in partnership with North Ayrshire Leisure currently delivers a very successful Community Programme in the area, under the guidance of John Brown and Barry Scott. Their expertise and knowledge in the area of club development will be an invaluable resource that the club will be able to tap in to over the coming months.”</p>

<p>Given all the gory details noted above, (I tend to be a bit "wordy" at times, sorry about that)</p>
<p>Can we say, simply;</p>
<p><i>He is married, has two sons, and lives in <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilbirnie.html" title="Kilbirnie">Kilbirnie</a>.

<p>We would be quite happy with that and could move on to adding "meat" to the article (should we dare).</p>
<p>On that note, see you have added some links, that is great. There is one more that can be added to complete the linking process. (sorry, can't do it myself, rules you know, rules rules rules, ba humbug)</p>
<p>On the line <i>In October 2004 he was appointed Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.</i> There is a link to an article for "Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Minister_for_Enterprise_and_Lifelong_Learning" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Minister_for_Enterprise_and_Lifelong_Learning" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Minister_for_Enterprise_and_Lifelong_Learning</a></p>

<p>The biography for <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Wilson_%28MSP%29_35c0.html" title="Allan Wilson (MSP)">Allan Wilson (MSP)</a> fails to account for half Allan Wilson's life, (over thirty years worth). The missing information directly relates to his current Parliamentary activities. (he is a member of their football team and has been for the past 3 years or more). It was his football background which prompted his appointment to Deputy Minister for Culture and Sport, a previous position he has held.</p>
<p>Similar such statements are allowed in other MSP's biographies, for example;</p>
<p><b>Frank McAveety</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAveety" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAveety" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAveety</a></p>

<p>I have been working to find an acceptable solution to this issue. I therefore propose the following statement be inserted as an acceptable and qualified compromise:</p>
<hr />
<p><i>He is married to Alison, has two sons, Craig and Scott, and lives in <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilbirnie.html" title="Kilbirnie">Kilbirnie</a>.

<hr />
<p>In email communications with <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">user:ESkog</a> regarding the above proposal, he has responded;</p>
<hr />
<p><i>The paragraph about personal information. It looks like this has already been partially resolved by "Mais oui!" - but I think the rest of the information you cite is also well-written and encyclopedic. You are welcome to add that information to the article yourself.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>Before I do that, it would be nice if someone else done it instead of me for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Omitting such basic details could be considered discriminating and a personal insult especially when other biographies are allowed to publish such information, including in some cases a persons (MSP's) previous court appearances which have nothing to do with their positions.</p>
<p>The statement proposed in this case at least relates to his current Parliamentary activities and his activities within his Constituency. It is also a rather short and to the point statement and solves the "well-known" and "fraternity" wording issue which necessitated these changes.</p>

<p>Someone is trying to change my password and it is not me. I have received 5 separate email messages stating my password had been changed due to the request of someone at IP address 212.219.240.212 which is not mine.</p>
<p>This IP address is assigned to an organisation in the UK. It is likely someone in this organisation is attempting to use my login details to carry out editing tactics which would be detrimental to my position and indeed my user name.</p>
<p>While your safety precautions have in this case prevented this, it is nonetheless a worrying issue for someone in my position and should require further investigation.</p>
<p>Would someone therefore please advise me on how to go about the identification of this individual and what measures can be taken to prevent further such attempts by this person.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<dd>Don't worry; the messages go to you, not whomever clicked the password reminder email. That person is no nearer to knowing or changing your password than they were beforehand, and that won't change no matter how many times they click the link. Wikipedia cannot "investigate" further; Wikipedia knows nothing more about the person who clicked the link than their IP address, which you already know. You may consider contacting the IT people at Angus Council, who appear to own that IP space (per <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=212.219.240.212" class="external free" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=212.219.240.212" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=212.219.240.212</a>). -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 14:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Only thing i'd add is if your password isn't <a href="../../../p/a/s/Password_strength.html" title="Password strength">strong</a> then it's a probably a good idea to make it so.
