<p>The story of the foundation of All Hallows' School must be set against the rudimentary "pioneer" education system and bitter sectarian disputes in Queensland education during the 1850s and early 1860s. According to Johnston (1982, p. 104), until 1860, "secondary education tened to receive a fairly low priority in state thinking - which was not surprising since the provision of a primary level was so difficult, to difficult to manage". He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>There were no state innitiatives to provide its own system until 1912. Secondary education, seen as a perquisite of middle-class life, suitable for the children of business and professional men and established pastoralists, was allowed to be offered by private and church bodies</i> (1982, p.104)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1860, the year before the foundation of the school, however, landmark <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislation.html" title="Legislation">legislation</a> was passed by the juvenile Queensland colonial parliament providing for the functioning of the first private "<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammar_schools.html" title="Grammar schools">grammar schools</a>" within the colony. This legislation gave a legal green-light for the foundation of a secondary schools by both Catholics and other non-state bodies. As a result of this legislation, <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipswich_Grammar_School_3fa2.html" title="Ipswich Grammar School">Ipswich Grammar School</a> openned its doors to become the first grammar school in Queensland in 1863.</p>
<p>In a time of deep <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarian.html" title="Sectarian">sectarian</a> divisions, the legislation greatly worried the Catholic hierarchy of the colony, especially Bishop Quinn who believed that the wealthy of the young colony would be greatly advantaged under the new legislative regime. Under the Grammar Schools Act (1860), the provision of 1000 pound by a new grammar school's governing body to develop the school would then result in various forms of government aid. Wealthy members of the community were able to raise such a subscription with relative ease and, as such, would be able to perpetuate a cycle of affluence. Demographically, many of Queensland's poorest residents at this time were both Roman Catholic and of Irish immigrant stock - reflecting a worldwide pattern at this time. Eminent Queensland historian <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Fitzgerald_870f.html" title="Ross Fitzgerald">Ross Fitzgerald</a> points out that until well into the twentieth century "the majority of (Queensland Catholics)... belonged to lower socio-economic groups" (1984, p 12).(It should be noted that in 1860, not one member of the Queensland Parliament was a Roman Catholic and that a number of sitting members of parliament quickly moved to enrol their children at the new grammar schools.) As a result of the legislation, grammar schools opened throughout the 1860s and 1870s in, not only <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipswich%2C_Queensland_aeba.html" title="Ipswich, Queensland">Ipswich</a> but also, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toowoomba%2C_Queensland_4c08.html" title="Toowoomba, Queensland">Toowoomba</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryborough%2C_Queensland_a474.html" title="Maryborough, Queensland">Maryborough</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockhampton%2C_Queensland_c9f1.html" title="Rockhampton, Queensland">Rockhampton</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townsville%2C_Queensland_aacf.html" title="Townsville, Queensland">Townsville</a>. Little under the legislation was specifically targeted to relieve the burdens of educating the poor of Queensland and among these, the poorest and most disadvantaged were often women who had yet to receive the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franchise.html" title="Franchise">franchise</a>.</p>

<p>Contrary to the development of most schools, All Hallows' School, as the first Catholic secondary school in Queensland, sought to serve those less fortunate in colonial society while operating under the same legislative framework as the more affluent grammar schools. It was in these early years that a strong social justice agenda was embedded into All Hallows' School. Serving poorer, often Irish, Roman Catholic, immigrant women in the area of Fortitude Valley, the School did not raise the required subscription for government aid and, in a time of bitter <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarianism.html" title="Sectarianism">sectarianism</a> within Queensland, the school maintained a fierce independence in curriculum from what was seen by many within the Catholic community as attempts by a hostile secular government at interference. A leading supporter of the Sisters of Mercy in this approach was the controversial Bishop James Quinn.</p>
<p>It should further be noted that the early Mercy Sisters and their students at this time played a significant role in the development of women's rights within Queensland and contributed to what has become a strong feminist tradition within All Hallows'. The details of the specific origins of All Hallows' highlight the concerns of the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisters_of_Mercy_c8d6.html" title="Sisters of Mercy">Sisters of Mercy</a> for the plight of the working poor in colonial Queensland. All Hallows' began in 1861 as a plea from a future student to Mother Vincent Whitty of the Sisters of Mercy to become a boarder in the cottages next to the convent on Charlotte St., where the Sisters were residing. It was this student that reputedly provoked a thirst for the education of women within <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Vincent_Whitty_af5a.html" title="Mother Vincent Whitty">Mother Vincent Whitty</a>, and the desire to create a community united under the goal of promoting "Dieu et Devior" â€” "God and Duty" in Queensland's young women. This student, along with 16 other boarders from various socioeconomic backgrounds, had become the pioneers in a long tradition of the education of women within <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows%27_School_2b77.html" title="Edit section: All Hallows' moves riverside - The relocation to Duncan's Hill">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">All Hallows' moves riverside - The relocation to Duncan's Hill</span></h3>
<p>In 1863, with pupils and Sisters growing in numbers, it was soon realised that a suitable place for a convent must be found. It was envisaged that a small House of Mercy would be established on the site of what would become All Hallows' School. <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a> saw the transfer of the party from a small structure adjacent to what is now Saint Stephen's Cathedral to Adderton House overlooking the Brisbane River from high upon Duncan's Hill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The Bishop has lately purchased the finest house and situation in Brisbane for a convent. The purchase money is 6,000 - where it is to come from I know not - but I trust God will send it. As soon as we get into it, we are to commence a House of Mercy...hahaha The constant influx of Emmigrants renders a House of Mercy desirable but it will not be a big one...</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mother Vincent Whitty marvelled at the position of the new house in a way that many visitors to the school have done since 1863. Writing to Ireland with news of the move to Duncan's Hill she stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I wish I could give you an idea of the beauty of the situation of this house. The view of the river from the Balcony is lovely and in the distance the thick bush, is here and there cleared away, with the town at one side of the River, it certainly is very beautiful.</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Adderton House was originally constructed in 1858 by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Petrie_ba56.html" title="John Petrie">John Petrie</a> for Dr. George Fuller (Mahoney, 1985 p.6). The school was given the official name of All Hallows' by Mother Vincent Whitty who, while well acqauinted with <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows_College_5509.html" title="All Hallows College">All Hallows College</a> in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, named the new Brisbane school after a seventh century church - All Hallows-by-the-Tower in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, England. <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows-by-the-Tower_c1ed.html" title="All Hallows-by-the-Tower">All Hallows-by-the-Tower</a> is the earliest parish church in London and Mother Vincent Whitty was well aware that the Dublin College was named for the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory.html" title="Priory">priory</a> on which it was built, which in turn was named after this other famous London landmark.</p>
<p>The Adderton House, at present, still resides on the school grounds along with other heritage buildings such as McAuley Hall, Main Building (a prominent turreted structure overlooking the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_River_6d2b.html" title="Brisbane River">Brisbane River</a>) and St Ann's. Adderton still remains at the heart of the school as a reminder of the core beliefs and traditions aiming to be upheld and promoted.</p>

<ul>
<li>The school is often known as All Hallows', or AHS (the initials).</li>
<li>All Hallows' is a Brisbane landmark, located at the northern end of the famous <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_Bridge_aad3.html" title="Story Bridge">Story Bridge</a> and on the periphery of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortitude_Valley_444c.html" title="Fortitude Valley">Fortitude Valley</a> entertainment precinct. As such, AHS is often pointed out as part of tours throughout Brisbane.</li>
<li>There are over 1,300 girls at All Hallows' (approx. 180 girls in the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows%27_Middle_School_c36c.html" title="All Hallows' Middle School">All Hallows' Middle School</a> and approx 240 girls in each year level from 8â€“12).</li>
<li>The AHS middle school (grades 5/6) opened its doors in 2006 and then will build up to grade 7 in 2007 for the first time since 1979.</li>
<li>The current principal, Ms. Lee-Anne Perry is the first member of the <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laity.html" title="Laity">laity</a> to become headmistress of the school. (That is to say she is not, and has not, been a member of a religious order.)</li>
<li>The school anthem is <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Toussaint_a362.html" title="La Toussaint">La Toussaint</a>, more commonly known as "Angeli" which is part of the opening line.</li>
<li>Some nuns still live on the grounds, in the convent, and are voluntarily responsible for some of the gardens.</li>
<li>The school's chapel is one of the oldest in Brisbane and is a very popular wedding venue.</li>
<li>The school motto was formulated in 1911, as part of the 50 year celebrations. It is unusual as most schools opt for Latin mottos, signifying the strong French influence in the school's early years.</li>
<li>The Middle School building is McAuley Hall, which underwent massive renovations in 2005.</li>
<li>Other buildings include the Chapel, Main Building, Aquinas, Loretto Hall, Mercy Hall, St Anns, St Bridget's, the Potter Building and the Whitty Centre. Almost the entire school campus is listed upon heritage registers with the Queensland government. (This listing includes the large <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moreton_Bay_Fig_2907.html" title="Moreton Bay Fig">Moreton Bay Fig</a> trees in the centre of the school. These figs provide a habitat for numerous <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Brushtail_Possum_2f0c.html" title="Common Brushtail Possum">brushtail possums</a> which can be seen regularly at night time on the grounds and from time to time during daylight hours.)</li>
<li>The school has in recent years reaffirmed its place as one of the leading academic institutions for girls in Queensland. Students of All Hallows' School have regularly achieved extremely high OP (<a href="../../../o/v/e/Overall_Position_13cc.html" title="Overall Position">Overall Position</a>) scores and an exceedingly large proportion of All Hallows' students achieve excellent grades upon graduation. These high standards reflect positively upon the efforts of the students, the quality of the teaching staff, the resources offered at the School and the supportive ethos of the Mercy Sisters.</li>
<li>AHS has an extremely strong tradition in fostering cultural pursuits. Numerous choirs, dance ensembles, bands (ranging from classical to alternative rock), public speaking, visual arts and debating awards are regularly won by AHS students.</li>
<li>Sporting pursuits are strongly encouraged at All Hallows'. A wide variety of sports are offered including swimming, water polo, athletics, cross-country, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> (soccer), <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futsal.html" title="Futsal">futsal</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touch_football.html" title="Touch football">touch football</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netball.html" title="Netball">netball</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, basketball, rowing, tennis, volleyball and fencing.</li>
<li>All Hallows' girls are know for their strong commitment to and support for social justice causes. Such activities reflect a desire to follow truly in the example of the Mercy Sisters. A huge variety of social justice activities take place within AHS including fundraising for, and assisting, <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Vincent_De_Paul_Society_dc85.html" title="Saint Vincent De Paul Society">Saint Vincent De Paul Society</a>, environmental groups, coffee brigade, landmine clearance and well construction in Cambodia, women's education in Afghanistan, and migrant tutition within Brisbane.</li>
<li>Embracing technology, All Hallows' students and staff make use of an extensive list of electronic / information technology aids to learning. Pocket PCs have been incorporated into many classes. Interactive whiteboard technology has been progressively introduced to many rooms. <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thin_client.html" title="Thin client">Thin client</a> technology is used throughout staff facilities. An online learning environment known as <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moodle.html" title="Moodle">Moodle</a> Blue (which includes forums, monitored chat, electronic quizzes etc) has been integrated into the curriculum to support the learning styles and needs of many different students.</li>
<li>Many teaching staff at All Hallows' are extremely highly qualified. Many staff take on roles supporting the Queensland Studies Authority, hold post-graduate qualifications, are continuing university studies, and / or are active in professional bodies. Each year, All Hallows' supports the training of teachers (both State and Catholic) through placement of large numbers of student teachers, teacher associates and education interns.</li>
<li>The school opted to have a slightly different uniform for the middle school than for the senior school. While the senior school has a blue blouse with a calf length matching blue skirt, brown shoes and white socks; the middle school had calouttes in place of the skirt and blue socks with the same shoes. This has led to the nick-names of "white socks" for the senior school and "blue socks" for the middle school. The transition from blue to white socks is considered by students to be a significant "rite of passage" within the school.</li>
<li>The school is closely linked with its "brother school", <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Joseph%27s_College%2C_Gregory_Terrace_e77d.html" title="St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace">St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace</a> (more common known as Terrace).</li>
<li>The school itself, the buildings, the grounds and the famous 'rock wall' surrounding the school are all heritage listed.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows%27_School_2b77.html" title="Edit section: Houses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Houses</span></h2>
<p>All Hallows' has a vertical (mixed aged) House structure. This structure is central to the pastoral and organisational culture of All Hallows' and is fully integrated into the life of the school. The structures of the House system encourage healthy relationships, interaction across all year levels and a strong sense of student responsibility and belonging. Every student (and staff member) belongs to one of eight houses. These houses are named to reflect a significant person or place within the history of the school. Each house is designated a 'sporting' colour.</p>
<p>The eight houses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Adderton</b> â€“ Green (named after Adderton House building on the school grounds)</li>
<li><b>Coolock</b> â€“ Blue (named after the house in Ireland where Cathrine McAuley lived)</li>
<li><b>Gorry</b> â€“ Gold (named after Queensland born Mercy Sister <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Gorry_4df5.html" title="Jane Gorry">Jane Gorry</a>)</li>
<li><b>Loretto</b> â€“ Pink (named after long serving school principal Sister M. Loretto Flynn. Principal: 1916, 1933-1959)</li>
<li><b>McAuley</b> â€“ Silver/Grey (named after the founder of the Mercy Order, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_McAuley_edb3.html" title="Catherine McAuley">Catherine McAuley</a>)</li>
<li><b>Mercedes</b> (pronounced "<i>mer-say-days</i>" as per the traditional Spanish pronunciation) â€“ Orange (The Spanish word for Mercy)</li>
<li><b>Tighe</b> â€“ Purple (named after the first enrolled student at AHS, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Tighe_fcd0.html" title="Annie Tighe">Annie Tighe</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Whitty</b> â€“ Red (named after the first principal of AHS, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Vincent_Whitty_af5a.html" title="Mother Vincent Whitty">Mother Vincent Whitty</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Houses at All Hallows' are all named after significant role models, qualities or locations which have contributed to the development of the School. Each house is divided into seven "home groups" led by teaching staff. Home groups are an important building block for the positive relationships which exist between all members of the community at All Hallows'. These home groups meet each morning and for regularly timetabled extended periods. As a result of this structure, staff and students at All Hallows' build relationships which assist students (and their families) to resolve problems which may emerge during adolescent years. Each of the Houses is led by a House Co-Ordinator who, in turn, work closely with the Deputy Principal (Students) and other support staff including a school psychologist. (The school psychologist is available by appointment to all students, staff and members of the community.)</p>
<p>Throughout the year, numerous Interhouse and Intrahouse Competitions are held. The most significant Interhouse Competitions include: Swimming, Cross Country, Debating, House Choir and Athletics. Each house holds its own range of intrahouse activities largely organised and led by students. These activities include: Girls' Nights In, Social Justice work, team building activities and initiative challenges. Many emphasise the fun and importance of belonging to and working within groups. Student house leaders often ensure that pride is built within their house by encouraging home groups to compete for Intrahouse Trophies (such as the well-known <i>Whitty Cup</i> and the <i>Gorry Grail</i>).</p>
<p>Each house is ably led by supportive student house leaders. These leaders hold captaincy positions within their house. Each house has an overall House Captain, and House Captains for Social Justice, Sporting and Cultural pursuits. These house captains work alongside the two All Hallows' School Captains and members of the Student Council to ensure a clear student voice is heard within the organisation of the school. Captaincy positions are highly prized and respected by All Hallows' girls due to the responsibilities they carry and the significant honour of being offered such a role.</p>

<p>All Hallows' School is a school with many and varied traditions that help give a richness to the education of the girls who attend it. Since 1861, these traditions have developed a life of their own.</p>
<p>Some traditional aspects of the school daily life include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Ann Street Gates are never closed</i>. This represents the "open-ness" of the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisters_of_Mercy_c8d6.html" title="Sisters of Mercy">Sisters of Mercy</a> and their desire to welcome all. Next to these gates is the Almonry from where the Sisters of Mercy served the needs of the poor during the early decades of the school's existence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Students celebrate each other's birthdays with gifts of a single flower</i> (often a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerbra.html" title="Gerbra">gerbra</a>). The origins of this tradition are unclear but certainly this tradition continues to this day with girls often seen carrying single flowers. Gerbra flowers have grown on the school campus in a variety of areas around the convent for many years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The school Angelus bell rings to this day at Midday</i>. The bell is traditionally rung by year 10 students and is rung to a distinctive pattern. The bell (called "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Borromeo_5112.html" title="Charles Borromeo">Charles Borromeo</a>" in honour of the saint by the same name by boarders in the 1880s) was donated to the Sisters of Mercy by Dublin lawyer Charles Cavanagh and was hung in its current location in 1882.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The "Welcome" Cup of Tea</i>. With its origins somewhere in the early days of the All Hallows' history, it is traditional for guests to be welcomed to the school with a cup of tea. It has been suggested that the priority placed upon this welcoming "ritual" began with Mother Vincent Whitty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Senior Badge Swapping</i>. On the final day of school for graduating seniors, a ritual of senior badge swapping takes place in which the outgoing Year 12 students (emotionally) "commission" their successors in the current Year 11 classes (the future Year 12s).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Jump'n'Jive</i>. The unofficial warcry of All Hallows', this chant is performed by students at, before or after significant school events. It is especially common as a "wishing" of good luck or congratulations and verbalises a sense of student pride in their school and/or their achievements. Traditionally, Jump'n'Jive is performed by groups of students with arms linked over each others shoulders to form a circle. As the chant is performed, students bounce to the rhythm of the words. Occasions when this warcry is performed include at swimming carnivals, after athletics and cross-country meets, prior to rowing regattas, on the final day of graduating students (performed both by graduants and the "new" senior class), after significant group victories or individual achievements and after inter-school football matches. The special occasion of the Senior Graduation Mass provides a particularly powerful demonstration of this student tradition. Assembled on the lawn of the Terrace, after their final Eucharist as a group, all girls in the senior class (approximately 240 girls) circle and perform the Jump'N'Jive , watched on by parents and staff.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Ghost Stories and "The Tunnel" Myth</i>. Given the age of the school and its long and interesting history, numerous student based stories can be traced back generations. The story telling of often completely fictious myths about the school seems almost a tradition at All Hallows'. Ghost stories centred upon the upper storeys of Main Building (the location of boarders' dormitories during the late 19th and early 20th centuries) are commonly told by older students to younger students who in turn pass these along to a new generation, while a completely implausible story of a tunnel stretching between All Hallows' School and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Joseph%27s_College%2C_Gregory_Terrace_e77d.html" title="St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace">St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace</a> has circulated for decades if not longer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Naming of Buildings</i>. Numerous buildings and locations in the school are known by traditional names which stretch back into the early history of the School. Students are familiar with place names such as St Patrick's Corridor, The Walk, The Old (or Boarders') Kitchen and so on. In many areas of the School, traditional room name's are still mounted on walls as a reminder of the traditions of the School and the earlier uses of the rooms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Inaugural Mass and Commissioning of School Leaders</i>. Originally held in St Stephen's Cathedral, the Inaugral Mass is now annual held during February at the grand <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Hall_d778.html" title="Brisbane City Hall">Brisbane City Hall</a>. This is a formal eucharistic celebration incorporating commissioning of staff, parents and students into their roles. This event mark the formal commencement of school captains and house captains period of office. These key leaders receive their badges on this day from the Head of the Queensland Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy. Leaders in All Hallows' follow a model of leadership reflecting the traditions established by Catherine McAuley.</li>
</ul>
