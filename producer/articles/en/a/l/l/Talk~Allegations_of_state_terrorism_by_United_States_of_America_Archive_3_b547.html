<h2><span class="mw-headline">Debates about content</span></h2>
<p>Lets discuss each section and attempt to come to a rough consensus.</p>
<p>I took the highly unusual step of cutting and pasting ever single comment which is relevant to every section, then I archived the earlier talk page.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to debate these sections, but I think we need to come to a consensus about what this article should include, and what it should not include, <b>First</b> see <a href="#What_is_terrorism.3F" title="">#What is terrorism?</a> to comment. <i>This worked very well with another controversial page, the predecessor to: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_military_history_events_9542.html" title="List of United States military history events">List_of_United_States_military_history_events</a>.</i></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Title of the article</span></h3>
<p>After this AfD, i am going to merge this article with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a>, I think that is the general consesus. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 03:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly disagree with this move. The term "American" terrorism is vague and ambiguous, and to me, it almost sounds like a racial slur. This article is about acts that the government of the US has undertaken. Calling it "American" accuses the population as a whole of these aledged crimes. I would equally object to an article such as "Jewish terrorism" or "Arab terrorism", however, "Terrorism by Israel" or "Terrorism by Egypt" (with good content) would be acceptable and NPOV. Material from <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a> could be moved here, however.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 11:38, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For a while <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a> was stable as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism_%28term%29.html" title="American terrorism (term)">American terrorism (term)</a>, as part of some deal involving <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, if I remember right. It has been about the use of the term in contemporary discourse. The name was changed at the end of May. If it is just going to be a collection of anectdotes chosen to convince readers of the US' essential moral equivalence with Al-Qaida, I have no preference what title is used. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:18, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if we can narrow it down to one article, then it is easier to keep all the radical POV pushing in one place. According to certain perspectives, virtually any recognized government entity could be found to have committed some manner of terrorists action. I suppose for a title requirement, moving American Terrorism to this article is more accurate though I stated the opposite on the Afd.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 19:33, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the AfD is to keep I'd recommend keeping it as-is as the name. Precedent has been set to keep the other "State terrorism by..." articles, as should this one stay. It's really nothing to do (as said above) with POV pushing or anything silly like that. From my comment just now on AfD: "Nothing POV about this title, or State terrorism by Canada, State terrorism by Sweden, State terrorism by Ukraine, State terrorism by Japan, State terrorism by Israel, or State terrorism by India. The "domestic" viewpoint--that is, the 'home' view of the government or local media of that nation--has no role in determining what is considered state terrorism, really. Would domestic Canadian media or government in 99% of cases even refer to it's actions as state terrorism? Or any other nation? Of course not. To call the US article POV and unsalvageable is simply patriotic bluster. I love America, I live here, but if a sanctioned United Nations court said something we did for example is terrorism, guess what? It's terrorism. Editorial/domestic POV has no place in the content or name of an article. Facts are facts--whether they are locally disliked facts are irrelevant, I'm unhappy to admit. The article needs to stay, as do the others from the original forking based on this."</p>
<p>Simply put, each of the articles has merit as they exist now, and I'll politely remind everyone we are not here to support a pro-Syria, pro-Libya, or pro-United States viewpoint--anyone here for that is here for the very wrong reasons. We're here to build a factually accurate encyclopedia based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and the others. Whether the source of the RS is not to one's taste is utterly irrelevant and not for consideration--does it meet RS by the written policy?

<p>--- I like <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a>'s idea of calling this article "<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_9a2f.html" title="Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America">Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America</a>", and I think this naming should be applied to all countries. Why? Because who _proves_ such a thing? Do we have international trials for national governments that sponsor state terrorism? If not, then we never had anything proven. Further, it's clear that getting people to agree on a definition of state terrorism is problematic. That's why I think this series of articles, if they concentrate on noteworthy, well-sourced <i>allegations</i>, will be much easier to develop in an NPOV manner. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 03:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey stevie I am really glad you brought this up. This was one issue that I wanted to tackle with this article.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunatly, I have to disagree with the name change. First of all, in regards to your question: <i>Do we have international trials for national governments that sponsor state terrorism?</i> See <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua_v._US_5999.html" title="Nicaragua v. US">Nicaragua v. US</a>. Second, Allegation is a weasel word, please see <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. Instead, is there any name that we can come up with which relays the idea of terrorism, but is less controversial?</dd>

<dd>Look, whether y'all like it or not the simple fact is that the United States is a huge sponsor of terrorism around the world, and it is more than obvious to anyone familiar with late 2oth c.

<dd>Only last week the U.S. *sent* **bombs** to aid Israel in its **openly** **acknowledged** campaign to terrorize the Lebanese population; in doing so, it became a participant, whether stateside Americans want to admit it or not. These are opnely acknowledged, stated **facts** that both Israeli and U.S. media widely broadcast. It's widely acknowledged that those bombs weren't targeting military installations, that they *couldn't* target military installations, and that they were targeting Lebanese civilian infrastructure with the strategic intent of terrifying the Lebanese citizenry into moving against Hizb'ullah. By *any* definition of terrorism, that qualifies.</dd>

<dd>So -- yes, i disagree with "American Terrorism"; i am an American, and i had no part in any of those actions and actively opposed them. I instead think we should use the quite neutral term "State Sponsored Terrorism: United States". Make "State Sponsored Terrorism" a new category, and anyone who wants to add incidents and events under that heading can do so. We should also have "State Sponsored Terrorism: Iran" and "State Sponsored Terrorism: Israel" and "State Sponsored Terrorism: Indonesia" and "State Sponsored Terrorism: China" and so on, one for each country, as the Wiki community sees fit. But watering this page down with some nonsensical "Allgeations of...." is just tripe for the dogs, introduced because certain American sensibilities are offended by the stark realities of their nations' activities abroad.</dd>

<dd>Your position is not supported by the facts. Let's look at your claim that the U.S. gave bombs to Israel and therefore constituted some form of terrorism. Ignoring your skewed observation of Israels acts of self-defense, the weapons the U.S. gave were precision guided munitions. This was to limit collateral damage. Israel had plenty of dumb iron bombs. The U.S. has plenty more. But the decision was to send Israel precision weapons so that collateral damage would be minimized. This is the exact opposite of terrorism. -- <a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 09:52, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hah! Skewed? Let's see: Israel starts a war in Lebanon 30 years ago, and then when the civilian population organizes militias to defend themselves against it Isreal then retreats. As it retreats, Israel refuses to sign a peace treaty with those same militias because it would mean giving back the land they had stolen from their peoples. Then, 5 or 6 years after retreating from the occupation, the Hizb'ullah capture a military target in the still ongoing conflict and hold it as leverage in their bid to get back the stolen land and their imprisoned compatriots. Now, you claim that the Israelis were acting in *defense*?? That they were acting in **defense** when they decided to bomb the entire country, specifically targeting civilian infrastructure that has nothing to do with the militia in question?</p>
<p>It is your viewpoint that is skewed, not mine.</p>
<p>My position is not only incontrovertibly supported by the facts, but twenty years from now people will be learning it in schools around the world. Talk to someone from Asia who pays attention to these events and 95% of them will agree with me, whether from Taiwan, Japan, the Filippines, Indonesia or Mainland China. Terrorism is the use of violent force to create terror; warfare is, instead, the domination of a country through violent means. In other words, Terrorism is when the PLO or Hamas or the United States says "If you don't accede to our demands, we will make your lives so miserable, increase the horror in your daily affairs to such a great degree that you will eventually be forced to accede." Warfare, by contrast, is when a military targets another nation with the intent of taking control of that terrirtory. The militaries move in, fight it out, and the last one standing on the battlefield is the winner.</p>
<p>Israel and the United States did *not* bomb Lebanon with the intention of occupying it. They did *not* target the Lebanese military, and most of their bombs fell on apartment blocs, bridges, electrical plants and hospitals -- *not* Hizb'ullah bunker. The Israelis openly stated that they were bombing the Lebanese population with the intent of "turning them against" Hizb'ullah; you can't get a more perfect definition of Terrorism than that. The fact is that the Israeli government retreated from its goal of "eliminating Hizb'ullah" quite quickly, and then spent twenty days bombing the people of Lebanon in a terrorist act.</p>
<p>It's obvious that you have never bothered to learn any of the relevant facts here, otherwise you'd know that it was the Israelis -- not Hizb'ullah -- who started this war, some 28 years ago or so, and so it is Israel who is the aggressor, not Hizb'ullah. The organization was created specifically as a reaction and protection against Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>Finally, the "precision guided" munitions were a small part of the overall package sent to Israel. Moreover, it doesn't matter whether your bomb is laser-guided, pinpoint accurate to the 2d centimeter - if you are knowingly targeting a civilian electrical plant, bridge, hospital or apartment bloc without any military value whatsoever, then you are by definition using terrorist tactics.</p>
<p>Your assertions have no merit whatsoever. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">User:Stone put to sky</a> 13:12 Taiwan Time</p>

<dd>Like most of your statments Tom, I agree in part, disagree in part. <i>Another thing to remember is, an encyclopedic <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">definition of terrorism</a> does not come from a dozen random guys who chose to edit Wikipedia one day.</i> I agree. That is why I provided encyclopedic definitions. What would you suggest instead Tom? I am trying to get a viable comprimise. Thus far you have provided a lot of critism of my comprimises, and provided no alternatives of your own. The way you dismiss my idea, your statment makes it sound like I am attempting to write a new dictionary, and place my name on it. I am attempting to avoid future edit wars, and focus our work. Terrorism is a vague term, as you showed by your <a href="#Links" title="">#Links</a> above.</dd>
<dd><i>We absolutely do not get to craft our own definition of terrorism, or to vote on the definition we like best.</i> Actually, we can. No matter what people claim, wikipedians vote for things all the time, and decide via consensus what should be included and what should be excluded from articles. As you showed with your <a href="#Links" title="">#Links</a> above, there is a wide variety of defintions on terrorism. What terrorism are we talking about here? Are war crimes terrorism? Is all torture terrorism? I don't see an answers to those questions from you. If we don't decide on a defintion, ever war that America has ever been in can be included in this list. NYC is wondering if we should include the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasoki. Should we? If we should why? If not why shouldn't we?

<p>Can we agree what this article is going to cover? Can we agree that, staying true to its title, it will cover allegations of state terrorism? I hope we do and if so, that means that non implemented things, or opinions that are clearly not applicable, should go. As an example I deleted the Yugoslav court case. It might not have been pretty, or necessary, for the Clinton admin to go into Yugo, but it was a military operation, not terrorism. Note to that the "court" took no action.

<dd>Terrorism is impossible to define because it is in the eye of the victim. If Al Qaida bombs me I say it's terrorism, they say its war. If I bomb them I say its war, they say its terrorism. In reality, all war has an aspect of terrorism in it - remember 'shock and awe'? The stated aim was not just to defeat the Iraqis but to demonstrate US power through a demonstration of violent power. But it doesn't matter. Wikipedia's opinion of terrorism is Original Research.

<dd>We had a similar issue on another article and I proposed that attacks such as car bombings and suicide bombings were in fact the method of freedom fighters / terrorists to declare and enact war. However their status and the fact that they do not follow the Geneva Convetion makes them terrorists.

<dd>Nonsense. The Geneva Conventions exist, and explicitly state that militaries are not to target civilians nor civlian infrastructure. Now, we all know that happens, but to pretend that there is no consensus on what is and is not allowable in wartime is to simply pretend stupidity. There exist conventions which we all agree are wrong; one of those conventions states that if a state military is going to fight a war against another state military, then it will limit its targets to militaries and their instalations and won't send its armies out to murder all the farmers and taxi drivers it can get ahold of; another is that militaries won't target dams, electrical plants, and clinics in an attempt to murder civlilians; another that it won't carpet-bomb civilian areas that have no military value.</dd>
<dd>All of these strategies have been exploited by the U.S. within the last twenty-five years or so, sometimes repeatedly. Pretending like "It's war, so it doesn't matter what one does" is just wrong. Moreover, when the U.S. shot down the Iranian airliner, the United States were *not* in any sort of a state of war.</dd>

<dd>Further, the IRA, Hamas, PLO and Hizb'ullah all consider themselves *militaries*; who made you God King of the world to declare that they aren't? Certainly, now that most of their goals have been met the IRA has achieved a good measure of legitimacy. So who can say they were illegitimate or non-military? If it weren't for Hizb'ullah, then right now Southern Lebanon would be overrun by a hostile, racist Israeli military that, if what happened last time is any measure, would proceed to indiscriminately imprison and impoverish the native population while stealing their land at every given opportunity.</dd>

<dd>Terrorism is defined by *tactics*, and the simple fact is that state militaries utilize terrorist tactics far more often and pervasively than to groups that are identified solely as "terrorist organizations". When the Israeli military bulldozes over a family's house that's been standing for over 100 years, and buries alive a grandfather or two underneath it, then *that* is terrorism. When the United States pays torturers and militas in Nicaragua to move into villages and murder every male above the age of 15, then *that* is terrorism.</dd>
<dd>Terrorism is the use of terror as a tactic in the cause of war, and when defined as such it becomes more than obvious that Nation-States -- including the United States -- make use of terrorist tactics far more often than non-state organizations.</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">What should this article cover?</span></h4>
<p>Okay, maybe asking to define terrorism in the wrong approach, because thus far both Tom and User:Seabhcan, two ideological opposites, seem to think this is pointless. How about we approach it this way:</p>
<p>Does terrorism in this article deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>political assinations? Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars, page 197: "In his discussion on terrorism, Walzer gives examples of political assassinations. These, however, cannot be considered acts of terrorism. While they are definitely violent acts, the targets are not chosen at random but are government officials. Unless the average person is a government official there will be no real fear for their own safety. The fear comes from not knowing whether or not they will be next with the distinct possibility that they could be."</li>
<li>war crimes?</li>
<li>torture?</li>
<li>accidental military actions?</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally think the following <b>should be included</b>&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>torture</li>
<li>Many covert CIA actions, but not all covert CIA actions</li>
<li>military campaigns which "intentionally" target civilians</li>
</ul>
<p>The following <b>should not be included</b>&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>political assinations</li>
<li>war crimes</li>
<li>accidental military actions</li>
<li>military campaigns which target "legitamate" military targets, but accidently kill civilians.</li>
</ul>
<p>...should we try to reach a consensus on each section now, or wait? Because when I write this list of what should and should not be included, certain sections automatically stay, and certain sections seem to drop out. Do we include accusations by other countries that the US is conducting terrorism, as long as we state in the article? Is this allowed as long as we clearly begin the section by stating that <i>"Country x accused the US of terrorism..."?</i> I think we should. What do you all think?</p>
<p>Maybe instead of trying to define which general acts <b>are</b> terrorism, it would be easier to define what general acts <b>are not</b> terrorism.</p>

<dd>None of the above, first section, are acts of terrorism. An act of terrorism is when you specifically target civilians. Political assassinations are .... political assassinations, political figured are normally religious or governmental leaders. War crimes are war crimes, events taking place during the course of a war, declared by act of congress, are not acts of terrorism, unless specifically targetting civilians to instill terror. Covert CIA actions proven to target civilians, meaning kill them purposely are acts of terrorism and state sponsored terrorism. Covert CIA actions not targetting civilians is not terrorism. Torture is not terrorism if the person is not being tortured to instill terrorism on a larger scale. If they are publically tortured or annouced publically to be tortured or some combination that involved inflicting fear on a civilian populace then its terrorism. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps this whole debate about what terrorism is, is not necessary. This is accustations of terrorism. All we need to document are other notable groups - states, NGOs, for example, that have accussed America of terrorism. Whether or not it is terrorism is not our concern.

<dd>The burden isn't on Wikipedia to proove or disproove whether it WAS terrorism, it's an article about accusations leveled against the United States of America. However, there are certainly going to be refutations of the same and comments about them from the US State Department, the White House, various press secretaries through history, the United Nations, major media groups reporting on the things I just mentioned, and so on. If you do some research you will likely find some. As mentioned above by me, the role of Wikipedia is not to bash a country, nor to support a country. It's to have articles about notable events, things, and people.

Why would you assume that any accusation by anyone at all would be listed here? Are there any other articles in wikipedia where any random non-notable crackpot with something to say is included in a related article, or are you just being disingenuous?

<dd>The problem with accusations of terrorism, if you read this article, is there is not many. Most of the articles being used as sources only list one person making the accusations, at times not even someone qualified, such as Chomsky, or at other times no such accusation existing. The second paragraph in the Cuba section does not have a single source stating the act was terrorism or the US sponsored terrorism ... Why anyone would not consider this a POV article when its sole focus is to create a soapbox for single accusations is beyond me. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 17:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

The dominant users of wikipedia are Americans, and there is an overwhelming American bias and outlook. There are so many pages which have pro-American stances, subtly and openly. After all of the arguments about wikipedia policy, we finally get to the <b>real</b> reason that you have with the page, <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a>: you don't want to create an "anti-american page". I have asked people before, not to fling around the "anti-American" label, which is counter productive. I haven't called anyone or anyone's ideas here an imperialist, jingoist, apologist, or facist, and I never will. Labels are simply boxes which we place others in who do not have the same beleifs that we do. These boxes create walls that hinder understanding. Please don't state that you are striving for NPOV. I don't buy that, because I am not striving for NPOV either, none of us are. All of us are attempting to push our own value system and beliefs into this article. Those who deny it the loudest, usually are the biggest POV warriors. I simply want a fair balance of two different conflicting view points: a leftist view, and a conservative one. Is that asking for much? If we are truly going to have a balanced article, that means you and other conservatives like you are going to have to start researching the subject matter, and adding counter views to this page.</dd>
<dd>&gt;Deleting content and hiding your ideology behind wikipedia policy is simply not an option anymore. You can either do the research, and counter these claims with research of your own, or you can continue to delete, and this page will be protected forever, which means your POV will continue to be marginalized and shrink even more from this article. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and as an encyclopedia every word needs to be backed up with verifiable sources. We on the ideological left have provided numerous sources, yourself and others like you, have contributed none. The exception has been TDC, who actually reads these sources and changes the sources to not only met his own POV, but to more closely match what the article says, bringing more balance to the article, and MONDO, who added a large portion of researched text. Everyone else, including yourself <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a>, has hid their own POV behind wikipedia policy, and contributed nothing to the article itself.</dd>

If this article had 100 sources, I am willing to bet it would not be satisfactory to you. I believe you start with the premise that America is the land of opportunity, a country which spreads freedom and democracy around the world, and those few times America does attrocious things, they are "mistakes" and anomalies. This is what is called <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_civil_religion.html" title="American civil religion">American civil religion</a>. It is a belief system that most Americans have to a certain degree, some more than others. I simply don't believe in this ideology. I believe that America has had gross human right violation and killed millions of people in its history, and keeps millions more in terrible poverty. Can we reconcile these two beliefs? Probably not. But I sure am going to try. The first step is for you to define terrorism. Not American terrorism, but terrorism in general. If country A kills civilians in country B, and this is labeled terrorism, then if country X kills civilians in country Y, then this should also be labeled terrorism.

<p>There seems to be some dispute as to whether to include Operation Northwoods under the Cuba section or the Within the US section of this article. US Terrorism was perpetrated against Cuba (Operation Mongoose = the Cuba Project) and is well documented (e.g. National Security Archive). So far I know, there is no evidence that Operation Northwoods terrorist acts proposed by the Joint Chiefs against targets in the US were carried out (thanks to the civilian leadership under JFK nixing the proposal). So the Within the US section should only have the acts proposed but not carried out in Northwoods. --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 22:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Actually, the Northwoods material is not that important to the story, and the shielding of terrorists in Miami is only a footnote itself - so there isn't any need to argue about it.

<p>There is alot of A+B=C type of logic in this article, some sections use references that dont even cite terrorism. Furthermore there is a connection being drawn between unlawful combat and terrorism, with only Chmsky's opinion to support them as the same thing. Claims like the US commited acts of terrorism need more then Chomsky's opinion to support them. Cases such as Yugoslavia do not even state terrorism nor are their any sources calling it that, the case was further dismissed. Please follow WP:OR and do not link statements, find sources that do the linking.

<dd>I would advise for now leaving unlawful combat, since the definition of terrorism does allow such things to be covered. It would be better to focus on where sources are being misinterpreted or additional conclusions being drawn - clean out the easy ones that can't be argued with at all.</dd>
<dd>Extrodinary conclusions need very good, strong and relibable references, rather than simply more than one. A single reference can be applied, as long as it is good. Technically, every statement needs more than one reference.</dd>

<p>The problem I have with unlawful combat being linked to terrorism is the only source being provided for them being the same thing is a person who is not a lawyer. While Chomsky is popular he does not even have a law degree to be offering a legal opinion on equality of terms. Further since such a claim is being used to link two lawsuits to acts of terrorism, the claim needs to be supported by more then a sole source. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If one source covers both and it's a very good source, that's fine by me. More sources are always good, but requiring more than one can get you into the land of endless escalation. Chomsky is a world-renowned scholar, and calling something 'terrorism' isn't a legal statement, actualy - considering that the word has very few formal definitions. What we need is good sources by him, rather than interviews - ideally peer reviewed. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 17:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think some users are confused about the purpose of this article. Wikipedia's role is not to 'prove' US terrorism one way or the other. It is to present a collection of cited facts, beliefs and opinions. If we could only present scientifically provable information then there would be no article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, for example. Chomsky may not be a lawyer, but his opinion carries a great deal of weight around the world and is thus notable. We don't have to prove a person's connection to something else. Wikipedia is not a court of law. If notable opinion and publications suggest there is such a connection, then it is notable and should be included. If we were to prove or disprove something, no matter how conclusively, it would be Original Research, and should be published elsewhere. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 18:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dont know what you are talking about, one of the items removed had no sources that claimed a terrorist attack happened, so it was not presenting even beliefs or opinions to that affect. As for Chomsky he is not a lawyer, therefore he is not a person of expertise in the field he is discussing, and not appropriate for citing. Also the section basically takes the word of one man to link every unlawful combat case to being terrorism, a man that is not even a legal expert. I do not mind you putting peoples opinions but they need to be widely held opinions, not just Chomskys opinions, especially when defining a legal term. Do you want this to be a good article, or a list of things Chomsky thinks are terrorism? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, if you are going to debate this, I want you to find a defintion of terrorism which states that terrorism is <b>not</b> the <b>unlawful use or threatened use of force</b>. Otherwise, the dictionary defintion of terrorism stands. Further, I see no one citing any sources which state that Nicaragua vs. US is not terrorism. I await those sources, otherwise I am considering a RfC about this page, complaining that not one single person deletionist has added a single source, and are allowing their own POV to cloud the discussion. Add sources, or don't respond. Your personal opinion has no weight here. I will not play this game anymore.

<p><i>In 1988 <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_Air_Flight_655_6aeb.html" title="Iran Air Flight 655">Iran Air Flight 655</a> was shot down by the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Vincennes_%28CG-49%29_736c.html" title="USS Vincennes (CG-49)">USS Vincennes</a> while enroute from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandar_Abbas_9c31.html" title="Bandar Abbas">Bandar Abbas</a> to <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubai.html" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> killing all 290 civilian passengers. The US said the the crew of the Vincennes had mistaken the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A300_46d5.html" title="Airbus A300">Airbus A300</a> for an F-14 fighter. A later US enquiry agreed with this, attributing the event to human error. In 1989 Iran took the US to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Court_of_Justice_d564.html" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a> over the incident. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/igeneralinformation/ibbook/Bbook8-1.59.htm| title=Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)| accessdate=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US chose to settle out of court, paying Iran $61.2m compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first =| last =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =| month =| title =1988: US warship shoots down Iranian airliner| journal =BBC News: On This Day, 3rd July | volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/3/newsid_4678000/4678707.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite settling out side of court, the Iranian government continues to dispute the US version of events, calling the action a 'crime'. It is supected that the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockerbie_bombing.html" title="Lockerbie bombing">Lockerbie bombing</a> was masterminded in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first =| last =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2000| month =July| title =Iran remembers US 'crime'| journal =BBC News| volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/815779.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;</i></p>
<p>Ther problem with the iran vs. US dispute is quite sinmply that terrorism is a lousy word. It is used by people and governments the world over the describe something they disagree with, with very little consistancy. Now, I feel the iran Vs. US section is certainly within the spirit of this article, since Iran clearly still believe that the attack was on purpose and they refer to it as a crime, and there are accusations from elsewhere of a 'secret war'. Clearly, these actions fall under the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">Definition of terrorism</a>.</p>
<p>As single action we cannot call this terrorism (as none of the references explicitly call it that), as that would be additional reasoning. However it does serve a vital part in the article, in my opinion. Either we need a new section, a new article, or a renamed article ('Missuse of US force and funding', off the top of my head, is a suggestion). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 21:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do get to rename the article, however, so as to bring facts within the article's remit. <i>That</i> is not original research. Original research in this case would be, as you said, stating something not called terrorism as terrorism.

<p>I think it is inevitable that we need to call a RfC, the first step towards arbitration. I will wait a few days and see if the third party mediators have any luck.</p>
<p>I don't think this group is going to agree on anything. The minute we unprotect this page, the same group of people are going to delete large sections and use wikipedia policy dubiously to push their POV. I have seen it a million times before, usually on other web blogs, and sometimes here, but never this bad on wikipedia. See: <a href="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/12903.html" class="external text" title="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/12903.html" rel="nofollow">Top Ten Dodge List:Tactics to employ if you're in a logical debate and logic has not sided with you (for any number of reasons), and you are nevertheless unwilling to change your argument or opinion</a>. The tactics that the some users use can practically be checked off, one by one from this list.</p>
<p>I think every section of this article has been deleted at one time or another by a few disruptive wikipedians. They have cited opinion on this page, dressed up as wikipedia policy, repeatedly, but nothing else.</p>
<p>I have seen pages be severly restricted, and those who were involved in the original war, and who break the strict rules after one warning get booted for a day to a month. It is obvious that some wikipedians here will continue to abuse the "edit this page" button without administrative supervision.</p>
<p>The irony is that the RfC and arbitration will only hurt the those who want to delete this article, not those who attempt to contribute to this page, but I am willing to bet they will not change their behavior one bit. Although these users seem proficent in wikipedia policy they don't seem to know much about the actual sections themselves, because they have never cited a single source.</p>
<p>I hope some wikipedians begin to start contributing to this article.Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 22:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I would encourage you to move forward with Rfc and Arbitration expeditiously. We must get to the point where everyone understands the relevance of Wikipedia policy.

<dd>We would never have found ourselves here. There is a small group of people who have deleted large sections of this page, and contributed nothing to this page. You happen to be one of these people, instead of naming names, I simply add the term "deletionists". Would you prefer I list every person who deletes large sections of this article, instead of using this term? If your actions are so agrssive: AfD, deletions of other peoples work, with no contributions, I don't know what you expect, a thank you, an invitation to dinner? Your uncomprimising behavior has caused a lot of disruption on this page this past month. You have avoided many opportunities to comprimise, wikipedia suggestions to avoid dispute, and many attempts at consensus building. Instead you have added 3 words and deleted 1,867 referenced words, with no clear consesus on the talk page. Then you are surprised when people revert your deletions, and get upset about them. If you are going to be a POV warrior, you need a little thicker skin.</dd>

<dd>Disagreements over whether something is approached the <i>Neutral Point Of View</i> (NPOV) way can usually be avoided through the practice of good research. Facts (as defined in the <i><a href="#A_simple_formulation" title="">A simple formulation</a></i> section above) are not <i>Points Of View</i> (POV, here used in the meaning of "opposite of NPOV") in and of themselves. A good way to help building a neutral point of view is to find a reputable source for the piece of information you want to add to Wikipedia, and then <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite that source</a>. This is an easy way to characterize a side of a debate without excluding that the debate has other sides. The trick is to find the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">best and most reputable sources</a> you can. Try the library for good books and journal articles, and look for the most reliable online resources. A little bit of ground work can save a lot of time in trying to justify a point later.</dd>

<ul>
<li>I would like to see the name of this article changed. This will solve a majority of the dispute. I would like a third party to arbitrate what is included and excluded in this article. I would like certain users, who have only deleted referenced sections, and added no material at all, to verify their accusations with citied sources. The sources in this article met two of the three requirements of an article: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>, but lack NPOV. I would ask wikipedians to either balance out the article with their own verified sources, or to cite why they are deleting these large verified sections. Those editors who have actually added content to this page, have met the burden of two of the three requirements for an article. I invite those wikieditors, who have previously only deleted material, to add researched material to balance out the article. As per <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#A_vital_component:_good_research" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#A_vital_component:_good_research</a>...<i>The only other important consideration is that sources of comparable reputability might contradict.

And, when available, give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.</i> I invite all wikiusers to strive for balance in this article, by researching these sections and adding research which helps balance this article. No matter what we do, sections continue to be deleted, so I requested this page be protected, requested this RfC, and requested a mediator, this has stopped a major edit war, with 3RR's etc. Nothing that the editors who contribute to this article do seems to be working and as a result, I have unfortunatly been impatient. Because I get flusttered, I have asked a lot of pointed personal questions about the editors themselves, which I suspect maybe against wikipedia policy (I can't actually find the policy--I am sure some of the other editors will). In my defense I can only say that in heated edit wars such as this, it is important to try and understand users underlying reasons for disrupting a page, I was attempting to get at the core problem: I see wikieditors using wikipolicy to push their own POV because the content is disagreeable and offensive to them. See <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_FAQ_00b9.html#Morally_offensive_views" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Morally_offensive_views</a>. Some wikiusers have not made "a concerted effort to apply our non-bias policy consistently" instead they have deleted large portions of verified text, and added nothing to the article itself.

<li>It's a false premise. The article itself is based on a premise that is neither justified nor correctable. This is left-wing equivalnt to an article that would be titled "Allegations that Bill Clinton beats his wife" and the supporters of the article want "deletionists" to provide evidence to balance it out. The article is fatally flawed from it's concept. There is no coherent policy of terorrism that is outlined in the article, there is no leadership or "terrorist" chain-of-command in the U.S. outlined. There is no founding history that is a part of every other "terrorist" organization. It is simply a random list of events that certain contributors deem to be terrorism and that they attribute to the United States. As such it is not encyclopedic, just an anti-American blog. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 04:46, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have made edits. I made the Honduras part NPOV. The problem is that once the truth is revealed and balanced it is no longer terrorism and was (rightfully) deleted by another editor. This is the fundamental problem. Once the items are "balanced" there is no reason to keep them in a one-sided article. And I said the <i>article</i> was an "anti-American blog".

<li>I'd also like to mention that Stone's diatribes precisely illustrate what this article is going to be, a POV pusher's magnet of people who equate a wartime, legitimate act of Israel or a legitimate act of the US with the indiscriminate blowing up of pizza parlors and civillian airliners. If this article is ever going to be taken seriously and loose it's NPOV tags and show civil discourse between editors it needs to stick to what it should be in an encyclopaedia. An article about acts of terrorism commited by the government of the United States, terrorism that fits the word. Acts that have been commited and have been called terrorism by reliable sources or where convictions have taken place. Funny thing is that this article will somehow then seem to wither down to almost nothingness, thinking quickly the only thing I can come up with that would qualify <i>might</i> be Wounded Knee. If this article does not do that it will forever be a collection of accusations, allegations and anti-American diatribes. I have said before in AfD's and elsewhere, any article that deals in allegations or accusations is inherently unencyclopaedic and should not be published on an encyclopaedia that wishes to be taken seriously.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 14:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The indiscriminate blowing up of hotels and <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubana_Flight_455_a41f.html" title="Cubana Flight 455">civilian airliners</a> is exactly what I intend to discuss in this article when I have a moment. I am presently on holiday and thus separated from my usual cabinets of sources and snippets - but I'll be back on the case in time. These are acts described as terrorism by reliable sources and where convictions have taken place. Acts that are alleged to have been supported by the US and have been described as state terrorism at the UN general assembly. In other words, the very basis of this article. I've brushed around this issue about four times on this talk page but it seems to have been obscured by a whole lot of bollocks about wounded knee and the meaning of "terrorism". There are significant allegations of engagement in state terrorism levelled against the United States in Cuba 1960-97 (and beyond). Just as Ronald Reagan accused Cuba of engaging in State terrorism in 1984. That both nations have made these allegations is not in question, or in doubt. They just need to be detailed (Cuba is on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_acts_labelled_as_state_terrorism_sorted_by_state.html" title="List of acts labelled as state terrorism sorted by state">List of acts labelled as state terrorism sorted by state</a> page so get to work) and everyone needs to calm down.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 15:32, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Alleged</i> to have been, <i>described</i> at the UN... The cuban accused the US and the CIA had <i>knowledge</i>. That does not constitute an act of terrorism carried out by the United States. This one could be an iffy but I will state again, it is nothing more than allegations. The act was carried out by non US nationals. That the groups were linked to the CIA or that the CIA had knowledge does not mean they authorized it or helped carry it out. This is something that is rightly covered in <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubana_Flight_455_a41f.html" title="Cubana Flight 455">Cubana Flight 455</a> but does not belong here.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 15:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

RE: <i>thinking quickly the only thing I can come up with that would qualify</i> might <i>be Wounded Knee.</i> You stated above that their were other sections you would want to keep, have you changed your mind now? <i>it needs to stick to what it should be in an encyclopaedia.</i> And who gets to decide this? We all do. That is why building a consesus is paramount. We need comprimise, deleting large sections of text repeatedly is not comprimise, it is the beginning of and edit war. Until some editors accept that this article will continue to exist on wikipedia, then we are going to continue to have problems. RE: <i>If this article is ever going to be taken seriously and loose it's NPOV tags and show civil discourse between editors it needs to stick to what it should be in an encyclopaedia.</i> I think the best way that this article can be taken seriously is by a balance between two opposing views. That means deletionist editors start contributing to the article. with references which support their POV. <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#A_vital_component:_good_research" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#A_vital_component:_good_research</a>...The only other important consideration is that sources of comparable reputability might contradict. In that case the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches of the same topic exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: divide space describing the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources. And, when available, give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.

<p>I'd like to remove reference to ST911.org in this sentence in the first section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As prominent 9/11 Scholar for Truth Dr. Daniele Ganser of the ETH Zürich states,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Ganser's research was not in any way connected with ST911.org. In fact this organisation wasn't even formed until nearly two years after his research was published. He is now a member, yes, but this sentence implies that the research is somehow connected with ST911.org.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to remove the "weasel words" tag from the end of the Gladio section. This sentence is a quote. If someone has a problem with the weaselness of the words they should write a letter to the Italian Senate.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 15:59, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ganser's association with a group of well know crackpots, including Lyndon Larouch BTW, goes directly to his credibility as a source in the article, considering the bulk of the material on Gladio is derived from his research. I don’t know why the weasel word tag is there, but the Italian Senate, according to the source, had nothing to do with the report. The report was issued by the Italian Left Democrat party, who had their own Soviet financed stay behind armies (<a href="../../../p/c/i/PCI_c89b.html" title="PCI">PCI</a>). <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 16:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is easy to remove the "weasel words" tag, which I added, simply site who said the sentence. I would suggest not saying the Italian Senate, since TDC pointed out that only certain members of the senate said this. I think the <i>As prominent 9/11 Scholar for Truth</i> is TDC's attempt to discredit Ganser. I think it should be removed. TDC and User:Seabhcan, can we comprimise? TDC, we remove the <i>As prominent 9/11 Scholar for Truth</i> and User:Seabhcan states the report was issued by the Italian Left Democrat party? TDC has repeatedly stated that much of the Gladio information is a fraud, which is not even mentioned in the Gladio article.

<p>How about calling it <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_the_United_States_461d.html" title="Terrorism in the United States">Terrorism in the United States</a>, rather than American terrorism? There is already <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism_in_the_United_States_4a58.html" title="Domestic terrorism in the United States">Domestic terrorism in the United States</a>, so semantically it fits and makes sense. The article scope can then cover a variety of topics with a broad scope. The "confirmed" and sourced content from this article (i.e. stuff either the US did or didn't do, allegations, court stuff, etc.); history of US terrorism (vs. us, for, etc.); linguistics, depiction in media, the whole nine. Thoughts? As we're doing it specific to the United States, I think it is important that "United States" remain in the title. American terrorism or Terrorism in America is improper usage, as it could be taken to encompass "Terrorism in the Americas" and so forth; we're not talking about Canada, or Mexico, or Central or South America. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 16:12, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why not provide sources before running off and renamnig the article. That doesnt change the fact that the information is unsourced which is why its getting removed constantly. Instead of renaming the article, provide sources proving the content is even worth of being mentioned in the capacity of the US and terrorism, as acts commited by or accusations of or acts supported by etc. You state you keep repeating yourself, probably because you keep ignoring that this article needs sources and its the problem I have with it. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 17:15, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources</span></h2>
<p>I suggest, people go find some sources to support this article. Renaming the article to fit the lack of information does not make much sense, however renaming it to something that sounds more factually secure when the article lacks proof of even allegations seems pointless. It will have even less of a leg to stand on. Are you reading what people are saying? They are saying there is no proof of even allegations and instead you want to rename it to something that makes it seem more factual? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:30, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zero, my goal isn't just the title, but the scope of the article. Terrorism in the United States would be a good article, as it could cover attacks against us, alleged things, history, depictions in US media, impact, everything.

<dd>You basically want to rewrite this article into a much larger scope, then rename it. Hopefulyl this includes finding sources for much that is lacking sources, if not you are still left with the same content that will just be removed for lacking sources but in a larger article with a different name. I do not mind this, however if the information taken from here has the same problem when added elsewhere, its probably not going to fix anything. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:42, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For instance in the new article Nicaragua vs. United States has the same problem there as here, its based solely on taking Chomsky, who is not a lawyer, nor has a law degree in interpreting Unlawful combat into terrorism. This is probably then going to be extended to the other court case, where once again a non expert in the field is being used to justify transforming a legal definition, a legal charge into something else. Chomsky should not be the sole source for calling all acts of unlawful combat to being equal to terrorism, he isnt even a source as he has no law degree or law training. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:45, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again the Cuba section as well, none of the source provided regarding the extradiction of Luis Carriles support the US was sponsoring terrorism. The same problem of a lack of support exists. These issues need to be addressed before anythnig is renamed, the problem is they are not verifiable for even allegations, much less factual proof of anything.

<dd>Not only that, but even if they were employed by the CIA at the time, they might have planted these bombs on their time off. In fact, seeing that the CIA would never do anything bad, and exist only to promote love and happiness around the world (remember that the US' main export in fiscal year 2005 was 'brotherly love'), then by definition, these guys, if indeed they do exist, could not have be CIA members. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 16:57, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Listen, if there is evidence, not speculation mind you, but evidence that Possada and Carriles were indeed working for the CIA as they were Circa early 60's, then you have a case, but there exist no such information, and the information from GWU's NSA archive only reinforces the fact that the CIA had nothing to do with these two in 1976. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 20:18, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The court ruling does say terrorism, it says the Senate approved the funds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Senate approved the supplemental appropriation, but the House of Representatives did not. In the Senate, two amendments which were proposed but not accepted were: to prohibit the funds appropriated from being provided to any individual or group known to have as one of its intentions the violent overthrow of any Central American government; <b>and to prohibit the funds being used for acts of terrorism in or against Nicaragua.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court ruling also goes on to state"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finds that the United States of America, by producing in 1983 manual entitled Operaciones sicologicas en guerra de guerrillas, and disseminating it to contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to the general principles of humanitarian law&#160;; but does not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been commited are imputable to the United States of America as acts of the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
So as you see the court ruling did not find America guilty of terrorism, it found that the Senate actually specifically said they cannot use terrorist attacks and activities and the court found that actions taken by the Contras, while maybe encouraged by the US, was not found to be acts by the US. Can we move on now, there is obviously no proof linking the US to terrorist attacks and this incident, unlawful combat is not terrorism. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You seem to be unfamiliar with Wikipedia so let me explain, an article needs supporting evidence that makes it verifiably true from reliable sources. We as editors cannot say the court said it was terrorism, simply because we found a definition of "terrorism" that is similar to a definition of "unlawful combat", especially when the first has many many definition, thats cherry picking information. Also WP:OR states that we cannot do A+B=C, which is exactly what we would be doing by stating the two definitions are similar and so the court stated it was terrorism. I see you can post alot but you fail to understand basic principles of Wikipedia. I have accepted the court ruling as proof the event happened, however the source does not call it terrorism and so its not a source of proof of terrorism. The dictionary definition cannot be used as a source because it violates WP:OR for you to link the two. Furthermore the only one linking the two is Chomsky who is not a law professor and not an expert in the field of law, so he is not qualified to be a source here of what a legal definition actually means. When you have relevant questions instead of your AGF violations I will address you further, I am not sure why you seem to be unable to grasp this idea since its been pointed out by 3 editors to you now and you keep asking the same circular questions. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:39, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Number 1: I am a Wikipedia user. (Meets #1 for original research)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Number 2: Chomsky has been previously published. (Fails #1 for original research)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Number 3: Chomsky is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Source_2caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Source">reliable source</a> in my opinion, (we will discuss this later)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can argue that Chomsky is not a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Source_2caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Source">reliable source</a> but that does not mean that me quoting Chomsky is original research, because Chomsky has been previously published. You have too have <b>all</b> conditions 1 and 2 and 3 for the information to be original research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So therefore, the Chomsky quote meets the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> bar. The only question now is, is Chomsky a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Source_2caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Source">reliable source</a>. I would suggest from now on arguing that Chomsky is not a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Source_2caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Source">reliable source</a>. To state that me quoting Chomsky is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is factually incorrect.

<dd>Chomsky is not a journalist, it actually explains in WP:RS and WP:V that journalists are allowed to make those kinds of statements because they are understood to be consulting people who do have law degrees, journalists doing it without consultation of anyone, if this can be proven, are not to be excepted. So as you see Chomsky does not meet WP:RS for this assumption. So since your whole argument is based on <b>"journalists who are not law professors comment on law all of the time"</b> I point you to WP:RS for more information regarding that. Its in the section titled "Law". --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:32, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also the things I stated I would not respond to you about and should be moved to my talk page, was your constant pandering for an apology, which i still will not reply to. Selective quoting only hurts an arguement. Some would say lots of things from looking at your userpage ...

<dd>You seem to be unfamiliar with Wikipedia so let me explain, an article needs supporting evidence that makes it verifiably true from reliable sources. We as editors cannot say the court said it was terrorism, simply because we found a definition of "terrorism" that is similar to a definition of "unlawful combat", especially when the first has many many definition, thats cherry picking information. Also WP:OR states that we cannot do A+B=C, which is exactly what we would be doing by stating the two definitions are similar and so the court stated it was terrorism. I see you can post alot but you fail to understand basic principles of Wikipedia. I have accepted the court ruling as proof the event happened, however the source does not call it terrorism and so its not a source of proof of terrorism. The dictionary definition cannot be used as a source because it violates WP:OR for you to link the two. Furthermore the only one linking the two is Chomsky who is not a law professor and not an expert in the field of law, so he is not qualified to be a source here of what a legal definition actually means. When you have relevant questions instead of your AGF violations I will address you further, I am not sure why you seem to be unable to grasp this idea since its been pointed out by 3 editors to you now and you keep asking the same circular questions. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:39, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps its time to take another straw poll on the content, people can simply give their opinion on what items should stay and what should go.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should we archive the comments?</span></h2>
<p>How would you all feel if we archived the old comments above <a href="#What_should_stay_in_the_article.3F" title="">#What should stay in the article?</a> A kind of fresh start while we build a straw poll.</p>
<p>I was considering archiving <a href="#What_should_stay_in_the_article.3F" title="">#What should stay in the article?</a>, but I think this could serve as a sort of one example of a straw poll.</p>
<p>We could archive everything above <a href="#Non_content_related_issue" title="">#Non content related issue</a> if wanted.</p>
<p>Either way, I won't do anything until we get a "yes" or "no" from at least two people.Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 01:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Straw polls</span></h2>
<p>I took the liberty of setting up a sub-page. I had the idea for this and then read that Zerofaults was planning similar and after consultation set it up. See Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America/strawpolls (Thank you for the move Travb). Hope this looks ok, I've never done this before.</p>
<p>I suggest we give it 4 days perhaps or a week at most to get a feeling of what is or isn't supported while contentious issues or when there's no clear consensus polls can be given some more time. I remind everyone again that this isn't a blind vote and Wikipedia policy still applies. Feel free to add polls or comments to this if you want.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask everyone who states an opinion to do so with some brevity and to not let this degenerate into another heated debate. There's always this talkpage for more indepth discussions. This is just to get a consensus going, not to rehash debates.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 21:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC), comment added 00:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Debating</span></h2>
<p>I have debated for the past couple of days of just abandoning this page. Those who created this page have stopped posting days ago, one went on a wikivacation citing "childness". And only myself and those who wanted this page deleted remain. I learned a lot about wikipolicy (and how others use it), and how to make a kewl graph, so it is not a total loss.
