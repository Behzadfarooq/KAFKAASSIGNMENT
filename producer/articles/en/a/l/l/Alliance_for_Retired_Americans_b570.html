<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_for_Retired_Americans_b570.html" title="Edit section: Founding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Founding</span></h2>
<p>The labor movement in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> had promoted health insurance for the poor and indigent since the 1920s. But little legislative interest had been taken in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Labor_d658.html" title="American Federation of Labor">American Federation of Labor</a>'s proposals.</p>
<p>The political environment began to change in the late 1950s. The <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_449c.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> administration began to study the needs of the aged, and liberal Republicans began to support health insurance for the elderly. As President Eisenhower's administration drew to a close in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, planning began for the first <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_Conference_on_Aging_5b6b.html" title="White House Conference on Aging">White House Conference on Aging</a>, to take place in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>.</p>
<p>The by-now merged AFL-CIO held some influence in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> White House. <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, then an undersecretary in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Health%2C_Education%2C_and_Welfare_1d3e.html" title="United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare">United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare</a>, was planning a political career and wanted to be on good terms with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Meany_e7ab.html" title="George Meany">George Meany</a>, president of the AFL-CIO. It was Rockefeller who had primary responsibility for planning the upcoming conference. Meany, meanwhile, assigned <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Cruikshank_97e7.html" title="Nelson Cruikshank">Nelson Cruikshank</a>, director of the AFL-CIO's Department of Social Security, to closely monitor Rockefeller. When it came time to appoint a chair for the conference, Cruikshank suggested <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kean_ff93.html" title="Robert Kean">Robert Kean</a>, a liberal Republican congressman from New Jersey. Although Kean had not supported national health insurance previously, he had supported labor on several <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_%28United_States%29_305c.html" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a> votes, had not opposed national health insurance, was open to new ideas, and sat on the powerful <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means_5c2b.html" title="United States House Committee on Ways and Means">House Ways and Means Committee</a>. If the White House Conference on Aging were to recommend national health insurance legislation, having Kean's imprimatur would be important. Kean was also not likely to use the power of his chairmanship against labor in the conference's hearings or votes on its final report.<sup id="_ref-Shapers_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shapers" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Working with Rockefeller and his staff, the AFL-CIO then was able to get national health insurance assigned to the committe on income maintenance. The assignment was critical to the AFL-CIO's strategy for moving federal legislation forward, for the AFL-CIO had decided (as a matter of legislative strategy) that any bill should be offered as an amendment to the Social Security Act rather than as a stand-alone law. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Medical_Association_5470.html" title="American Medical Association">American Medical Association</a> (AMA), which vehemently opposed any national health scheme for the aged as "<a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialized_medicine.html" title="Socialized medicine">socialized medicine</a>", was intent on stacking the Conference's committee on health with its representatives in order to block any health insurance discussion.<sup id="_ref-Shapers_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shapers" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, events that occurred during the 1960 presidential election actually helped boost Cruikshank's chances at the Conference on Aging.</p>
<p>During the 1960 presidential election, the AFL-CIO worked to build a coalition in favor of national health insurance for the aged. As <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">Senator John F. Kennedy</a> stacked up primary wins, the AFL-CIO convinced the Kennedy team on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a>, 1960, to establish a 23-member group called "Senior Citizens-for-Kennedy." The goal of the group was ostensibly to help the candidate develop policy proposals on health care for the aged. Rep. <a href="../../../a/i/m/Aime_J._Forand_d7a7.html" title="Aime J. Forand">Aime J. Forand</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">D</a>-<a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a>) was named chair of the group.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Kennedy won the election, the AFL-CIO used the coalition built by Senior Citizens-for-Kennedy to push its agenda at the 1961 White House Conference on Aging. The AFL-CIO coordinated the work of these groups during the conference. It established a communications center, and mobilized witnesses and votes as needed. Whenever health insurance for the aged was brought up in any committee other than the Social Security committee, the proposal was voted down or declared out of order. When the Conference voted on its final report, the AMA was surprised to find a health insurance proposal part of the recommended legislative package. The AFL-CIO coalition had grown to more than 500 groups, and attempts by the AMA to strike the proposal from the report were easily defeated.<sup id="_ref-Shapers_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shapers" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The success of the AFL-CIO coalition during the 1961 White House Conference on Aging led Forand to suggest that an organization be formed to push for similar legislation in the future. The American Association of Retired Persons (<a href="../../../a/a/r/AARP_a898.html" title="AARP">AARP</a>), founded in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, did not have a substantial membership yet.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_National_Committee_458c.html" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> and AFL-CIO then worked together to transform the Kennedy group into the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC). The new organization was formally announced in July 1961. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Auto_Workers_1a7e.html" title="United Auto Workers">United Auto Workers</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Steelworkers_6c15.html" title="United Steelworkers">United Steelworkers</a> pushed their retirees to sign up as members, and both unions as well as the AFL-CIO contributed seed-money to finance the group. Forand, who had retired from office in 1960, became the NCSC's first president and William Hutton, a public relations official with the AFL-CIO, its first executive director.<sup id="_ref-Shapers_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shapers" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ball_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ball" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In April <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, President Kennedy met with leaders of NCSC. The meeting led the president to declare each May as "Senior Citizens Month" (now Older Americans Month).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> It was a sign of NCSC's growing influence.</p>
<p>NCSC was instrumental in passing Medicare. It back a number of (admittedly abortive) legislative efforts, held rallies (including one gigantic, nationally-televised event at <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, organized letter-writing campaigns, and attacked Medicare's opponents by bombarding them with mail and picketing their offices. The assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963 proved fortuitous for Medicare's legislative chances. President <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> considered old age health insurance to be a much higher priority than Kennedy.<sup id="_ref-Ball_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ball" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>A shift in NCSC's strategy proved crucial in helping to build support for Medicare as well. NCSC began a major education campaign among middle-aged people, working to raise awareness of how burdensome hospital bills for the elderly could be. Medicare's passage in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a> was very close, and NCSC's efforts were considered instrumental in its enactment.<sup id="_ref-Ball_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ball" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>By the early 1970s, NCSC had grown to more than 2,000 state and local affiliates across the United States.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, NCSC funded its activities largely through the use of federal funds. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, President Johnson signed the Older Americans Act. Title V of the act created Operation Mainstream, which funded part-time employment for under-employed people aged 55 or older. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Operation Mainstream was renamed the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP). The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Labor_8b38.html" title="United States Department of Labor">United States Department of Labor</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> chose NCSC as one of the organizations designated to operate SCSEP. NCSC called its program the Senior Alert, Industrious, Dedicated, Energetic Service ("Senior AIDES").<sup id="_ref-SSAI_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SSAI" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although about 90 percent of NCSC's funds were spent on Senior AIDES, the organization stayed very active politcally throughout the 1970s. NCSC was particularly active in lobbying for anti-inflationary measure to protect seniors' incomes, and led an energy policy coalition to protect seniors from high energy costs.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>NCSC became embroiled in presidential politics again in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1980_d6ba.html" title="United States presidential election, 1980">1980</a>. Senator <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Kennedy_7459.html" title="Ted Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> strongly wooed NCSC in his ultimately-unsuccessful bid to win the Democratic nomination, going so far as to invite NCSC to hold its next national convention in the White House.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>NCSC became even more politically active in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. The organization fought a number of battles over funding for Social Security and Medicare, inflation and economic policy, heating and energy policy, and affordable housing for the elderly.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, Congress enacted the Environmental Programs Assistance Act. Within the act was a program called the Senior Environmental Employment (SEE). This program provided funds for people aged 55 or older to be employed by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency_8a4b.html" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> EPA with the ability to respond more rapidly to emergency situations and provide ongoing support for long and short-term projects. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, NCSC became a recipient of SEE funds as well.<sup id="_ref-SSAI_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SSAI" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The same year, NCSC started its first <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_action_committee.html" title="Political action committee">political action committee</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, NCSC began the process of spinning off its government-funded senior employment and housing programs. It established a new division called the National Senior Citizens Education and Research Center (NSCERC), which continued administer the SCSEP funds. The two organizations later formally separated, although many NCSC board members continued to serve on the NSCERC board. (NSCERC later changed its name to Senior Service America, Inc.)<sup id="_ref-SSAI_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SSAI" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Decline.2C_scandal.2C_reorganization_and_name_change" id="Decline.2C_scandal.2C_reorganization_and_name_change"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_for_Retired_Americans_b570.html" title="Edit section: Decline, scandal, reorganization and name change">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline, scandal, reorganization and name change</span></h2>
<p>By the mid-1990s, however, NCSC was in organizational trouble. In the 1980s, it claimed to have 5 million members. But these membership figures, never verified, began dropping. Beginning in 1994, NCSC shed 100,000 members a year. The organization claimed only 250,000 members in 2000.<sup id="_ref-Greenhouse_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhouse" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1996, NCSC became embroiled in a scandal which severely tarnished its reputation. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Carey_%28labor_leader%29_97ab.html" title="Ron Carey (labor leader)">Ron Carey</a>, president of the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teamsters.html" title="Teamsters">Teamsters</a> union, was running for re-election against <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_P._Hoffa_9e77.html" title="James P. Hoffa">James P. Hoffa</a>, son of the famous missing Teamsters president <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hoffa_c99c.html" title="Jimmy Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a>. According to court documents, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, 1996, Carey allegedly approved a Teamsters union donation of $85,000 to NCSC. NCSC forwarded half the money to the November Group, a direct-mail company. The November Group, which was in the employ of the Carey re-election campaign, then allegedly used the money to send out 1.7 million pieces of pro-Carey literature. The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_laundering.html" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a> scheme also involved Citizen Action (a left-wing political action group), Project Vote (a minority and low-income voter registration project) and NCSC.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup> The total amount of funds distributed to the three groups amounted to $735,000.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[14]</a></sup> A federal court ordered a re-run of the election, resulting in Carey's defeat. Although Carey was found not guilty in a federal court, he was stripped of his union membership and permanently barred from the union.</p>
<p>In May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, the AFL-CIO executive council voted to dissolve NCSC, and reform the group as the Alliance for Retired Americans. The Carey re-election scandal severely damaged NCSC's reputation, hampering its ability to advocate effectively on behalf of its members. But labor leaders also wanted to reform the group as a tax-exempt nonprofit to which tax-deductible donations could be made. The reorganization also meant that AFL-CIO members could now automatically enroll their retirees as members rather than ask them to sign up. The "new" organization was officially launched in May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since its relaunch in 2001, ARA has been very active politically. It made a large number of political endorsements in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> mid-term elections, and fought against the Republican-endorsed Medicare prescription drug benefit, tax cut for the wealthy, and President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s Social Security reform plan.</p>
<p>ARA has also clashed with AARP. ARA has often said it is not a competitor with AARP, and that it wishes to work in cooperation with the much-larger seniors' group. However, during the 2003 debate over the Medicare prescription drug benefit, ARA broke with AARP and publicly criticized AARP's leaders for being out of touch with seniors and caving in to financial incentives (AARP offers a number of health insurance products, some of which might have suffered had a more generous prescription drug benefit been enacted). More recently, ARA has taken to calling itself the voice of "retired workers," suggesting that AARP's membership is wealthy and that the organization does not fight for middle-class or poor seniors.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Structure_and_governance" id="Structure_and_governance"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_for_Retired_Americans_b570.html" title="Edit section: Structure and governance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Structure and governance</span></h2>
<p>Membership in ARA is defined quite broadly. Members of NCSC were automatically made charter members of ARA, giving the new organization a sizeable membership base. Any retired union member is eligible for membership in ARA. Retired workers who were not union members may become full members as well.</p>
<p>ARA's dues are low, but payment of dues is made in a unique manner. Member dues are $2 a year. But the dues of retired union members are paid by each national union (with a cap of $100,000, which is adjusted annually). Most AFL-CIO unions pay the dues out of their budgets, rather than assess their retirees or members a special fee to pay the dues. Non-union retirees pay dues of $10.00 a year.</p>
<p>ARA members are the governing body of the organization. The membership meets in a national convention every even-numbered year. The membership elects a president, a secretary-treasurer, a community-based executive vice-president, and six community-based board members. There is no provision for proprotional representation within ARA; every member may attend the national convention and vote, and sponsoring unions may send as many delegates as they choose. The membership also discusses and approves policies, and raises voluntary donations for the organization's political operations.</p>
<p>Between conventions, ARA is governed by a national executive board. The 12-member board includes the six community-based directors as well as six directors appointed by the affiliated AFL-CIO unions.</p>
<p>ARA has four executive officers as well. These are the president, secretary-treasurer, community-based executive vice-president, and an executive vice-president appointed by ARA's affiliates. These four officers oversee the day-to-day operations of the organization. ARA also has an executive director, who oversees the staff and implements the policies of the organization.</p>
<p>In 2006, ARA's officers were:</p>
<ul>
<li>George Kourpias, president. Kourpias was president of NCSC at its "dissolution" and is a retired president of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Association_of_Machinists_and_Aerospace_Workers_76db.html" title="International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</a>.</li>
<li>Ruben Burks, secretary-treasurer. Burks was secretary-treasurer of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Auto_Workers_1a7e.html" title="United Auto Workers">United Auto Workers</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Rodriguez_4803.html" title="Pedro Rodriguez">Pedro Rodriguez</a>, community-based executive vice-president. Rodriguez is executive director of the Action Alliance of Seniors Citizens of Greater Philadelphia, an ARA affiliate.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Trumka_bb6e.html" title="Richard Trumka">Richard Trumka</a>, appointed executive vice-president. Trumka is secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.</li>
</ul>
<p>On May 1, 2001, ARA hired Ed Coyle to be its executive director. Coyle was formerly the national director of Radio Fair America, a media monitoring group.</p>

<p>ARA also sponsors a separate Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund. The Fund has its own board (although it is interlocking to a significant degree with ARA's), staff and budget. The Fund's primary activies are threefold: To conduct research and produce publications on public policy issues of importance to retired citizens; to build state ARA affiliates by assigning staff, training state staff, and build state retiree coalitions; and to build coalitions of retiree, community, worker and nonprofit groups to support the work of the Fund and ARA. The Fund also conducts a biennial "education conference" for ARA members every election year, as well as a number of other educational and training conferences, seminars and workshops.</p>
