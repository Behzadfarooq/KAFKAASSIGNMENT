<p><i><b>All My Children</b></i> (<b>AMC</b>) is an American <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> that has been broadcast Monday through Friday on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">TV</a> network since <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. Originally a half-hour in length, the show expanded to an hour in 1977. It is recorded at ABC's television studio on West 66th Street in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. As of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the show has a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_stock.html" title="Film stock">filmed</a> (as opposed to <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">taped</a>) appearance.</p>
<p><i>All My Children</i> was created by <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Nixon_b660.html" title="Agnes Nixon">Agnes Nixon</a>. Although Nixon had previously created <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Life_to_Live_efbc.html" title="One Life to Live">One Life to Live</a></i> for ABC following her success as head writer for <i><a href="../../../a/n/o/Another_World_%28television_series%29_9554.html" title="Another World (television series)">Another World</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guiding_Light_5b16.html" title="The Guiding Light">The Guiding Light</a></i>, <i>All My Children</i> was her first love and first major creation. She set the show in <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Valley%2C_Pennsylvania_63e8.html" title="Pine Valley, Pennsylvania">Pine Valley</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, a small suburb of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>The title of the show refers to the brotherhood of man. Nixon believed that it doesn't matter who one was, what one looked like, or where one was from — for every human being was a child of God. The poem at the start of the <i>All My Children</i> photo album reads:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;">

<p>The poem, which epitomizes the goal of <i>All My Children'</i>s storytelling, was penned by Nixon herself.</p>
<p>With the death of core cast member <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Warrick_a755.html" title="Ruth Warrick">Ruth Warrick</a> in January 2005, two original cast members, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_MacDonnell_e612.html" title="Ray MacDonnell">Ray MacDonnell</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Lucci_e4d8.html" title="Susan Lucci">Susan Lucci</a>, remain.</p>
<p>At one time, the program was so popular that it was the most widely-recorded television show in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and once had an audience that was estimated to be 30% male. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-5,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-5,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The show ranked #1 in the daytime Nielsen ratings from 1978-1979. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, <i>All My Children</i> was the #2 daytime soap opera on the air. Today, the show averages about 3.3 million viewers.</p>

<p>In the 1960s <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Nixon_b660.html" title="Agnes Nixon">Agnes Nixon</a>, then head writer for <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">The Guiding Light</a></i>, tried to sell a property called <i>All My Children</i> to <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, then <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>, then NBC again through the auspices of sponsor <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procter_%26_Gamble_32aa.html" title="Procter &amp; Gamble">Procter &amp; Gamble</a>. Despite her success and sponsor support, it was not until the start of 1970 that her brainchild finally aired.</p>
<p>Nixon strived to create a soap that was topical, and could illustrate social issues to the audience. She wanted all this while also injecting regular humor into the script. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional "Pine Valley" on a map: situated just outside of Philadelphia, it was a mere hour-long train ride from New York City.</p>
<p>From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her protégé, <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisner_Washam_7ba4.html" title="Wisner Washam">Wisner Washam</a>. He was groomed by Nixon to take the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, like creating and launching <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Loving_%28TV_series%29_f6fe.html" title="Loving (TV series)">Loving</a></i> in 1983. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine_Broderick_c7ce.html" title="Lorraine Broderick">Lorraine Broderick</a> and Margaret DePriest also had brief stints as head writers in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The show's first action took place around several families and characters. <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoebe_Tyler_Wallingford_45af.html" title="Phoebe Tyler Wallingford">Phoebe Tyler</a>, who fashioned herself as "Queen of Pine Valley", was the definition of a rich snob. There was also single mother <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Kane_191d.html" title="Mona Kane">Mona Kane</a> and her <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_donna.html" title="Prima donna">prima donna</a> daughter, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Kane_eb13.html" title="Erica Kane">Erica</a>. Contrasting this was the stable <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Martin_ad5b.html" title="Joe Martin">Martin Family</a>, who have long been thought of as the symbolic foundation of <i>All My Children</i>.</p>
<p>If Phoebe was the "Queen of Pine Valley", then <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Lucci_e4d8.html" title="Susan Lucci">Susan Lucci</a>'s Erica Kane was definitely the "Princess". Kane's first scene in Pine Valley will live in infamy. She spelled out to her mother everything she was looking for in a husband, establishing her ambition and her knack for rich men. But deep inside, Erica was nursing the scars of her abandonment by her father, successful film director Eric Kane. At the same time, her father's life in Hollywood was the driving force for her longing to leave Pine Valley. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates Tara Martin (<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Lynn_Gorney_7c45.html" title="Karen Lynn Gorney">Karen Lynn Gorney</a>) and Phil Brent (<a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hatch_%28actor%29_7cda.html" title="Richard Hatch (actor)">Richard Hatch</a>), Erica found out that Phil was not <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Martin_%28AMC%29_face.html" title="Ruth Martin (AMC)">Ruth</a>'s son, but the son of Amy (<a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary_Prinz_579e.html" title="Rosemary Prinz">Rosemary Prinz</a>). In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.</p>
<p><i>All My Children'</i>s first success was its telling of young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing just that.</p>
<p>The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked #17 out of 19 soaps. Despite this, its audience was building with each passing year, which kept both Nixon and ABC happy.</p>
<p>The show was unique for its use of the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. Before <i>All My Children</i> debuted no show, let alone daytime soap, had discussed the war in any depth. There was the character of Phoebe, a conservative, and Amy, a free-spirited liberal, both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When the character of Amy left, Ruth took over as the anti-war voice. Her early 1970s protest speech won <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Fickett_6d87.html" title="Mary Fickett">Mary Fickett</a> the first ever <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> given to a soap performer back in 1972. Later in the show's run, Phoebe became more liberal.</p>
<p>In 1973, Erica Kane made the decision to have an abortion. What made the abortion extra-controversial was Erica's reason for doing it. She wasn't having it done because her health was in jeopardy, but because she didn't want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story got much media attention, especially since <i><a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a></i> had been decided just a few months before the story began airing. Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switch-boards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case. The controversy didn’t hurt ratings, which rose from an 8.2 to a 9.1 Household rating.</p>
<p>Phoebe's husband Charles (<a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Franklin_b892.html" title="Hugh Franklin">Hugh Franklin</a>) had gotten close to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Kane_191d.html" title="Mona Kane">Mona Kane</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Heflin_a6e4.html" title="Frances Heflin">Frances Heflin</a>), Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital. The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralysis.html" title="Paralysis">paralysis</a>. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorcée and Mona became the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal started the longtime Phoebe/Mona rivalry.</p>
<p>When Eileen Letchworth, who played Margo Flax Martin, was contemplating a facelift, she talked it over with Agnes Nixon. Not only was Letchwoth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Mooney_f146.html" title="William Mooney">William Mooney</a>). Margo’s facelift in 1974 was one of the first major storylines on television discussing cosmetic surgery and its psychological effects.</p>
<p>In June 1976, the character of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooke_English_2541.html" title="Brooke English">Brooke English</a> showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon after clashed with Erica over Tom Cudahy and Mark Dalton. Since then, Brooke has feasted on many of Erica's left-over men. Also, in 1976 was the introduction of fan favorite Myrtle Lum Fargate (<a href="../../../e/i/l/Eileen_Herlie_2d33.html" title="Eileen Herlie">Eileen Herlie</a>).</p>
<p>By the late 1970s the show had risen to the top of the ratings. A new addition in 1979 was the arrival of aristocratic <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmer_Cortlandt_f41a.html" title="Palmer Cortlandt">Palmer Cortlandt</a> (aka Peter Cooney) (<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Mitchell_%28actor%29_9b59.html" title="James Mitchell (actor)">James Mitchell</a>), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock, and his overprotected daughter Nina (<a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Miller_65fe.html" title="Taylor Miller">Taylor Miller</a>), who, to Palmer's chagrin, caught the fancy of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Warner_8dec.html" title="Cliff Warner">Dr. Cliff Warner</a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bergman_cb00.html" title="Peter Bergman">Peter Bergman</a>). Palmer did everything in his power to break up the couple, included telling Nina she was going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teamed up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne (Linda Gibboney), who confronted Cliff about fathering her son. But this was temporary, because Sybil was murdered by Sean Cudahy (Allen Dysart). During the murder trial, Nina was astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt (<a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_Spencer_bf32.html" title="Gillian Spencer">Gillian Spencer</a>), whom she believed to be dead, was in fact alive and living in Pine Valley as 'Monique Jonville'. To complete everyone's shock, Myra acknowledged that Daisy was her daughter. AMC also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Gardner_96d8.html" title="Ray Gardner">Ray Gardner</a>.</p>

<p>The early '80s is considered by many to have been a golden period for the show. Younger characters, such as <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_and_Greg_2c23.html" title="Jenny and Greg">Jenny and Greg</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Delaney_1617.html" title="Kim Delaney">Kim Delaney</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Lau_f355.html" title="Laurence Lau">Laurence Lau</a>), Liza (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcy_Walker_3fd7.html" title="Marcy Walker">Marcy Walker</a>), Liza's best friend Amanda Cousins (<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Bearse_0ce9.html" title="Amanda Bearse">Amanda Bearse</a>), <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_and_Angie_8b9f.html" title="Jesse and Angie">Jesse and Angie</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/r/Darnell_Williams_b796.html" title="Darnell Williams">Darnell Williams</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbi_Morgan_d0d9.html" title="Debbi Morgan">Debbi Morgan</a>) and a now-grown-up <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tad_Martin_3cb1.html" title="Tad Martin">Tad Martin</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_E._Knight_fbf1.html" title="Michael E. Knight">Michael E. Knight</a>), who was now legally Ruth and Joe's son, entered the scene and drew large followings.</p>
<p>The storyline involving Liza plotting to win Greg back after he left her for Jenny was a huge fan favorite, as was the Jenny/Greg pairing. The legend of "Tad the Cad" was born when Tad Martin took Liza Colby's virginity, then simultaneously began having sex with her mother, socialite Marian Colby (Jennifer Bassey), who eventually was sent to prison and returned to marry Stuart Chandler (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Canary_1551.html" title="David Canary">David Canary</a>).</p>
<p>Jenny and Jesse's summer in New York City was so well received that it allowed the program to reach #1 in the ratings for 10 weeks during the summer of 1982.</p>
<p>On the not-so-younger side, Jenny and Tad's natural mother Opal (<a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Lyman_bd92.html" title="Dorothy Lyman">Dorothy Lyman</a>) was also added to the canvas, where she opened the Glamorama salon and spa. Opal greatly showcased <i>All My Children</i>’s attempt at humor and satire. Powerful businessman <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Chandler_46b0.html" title="Adam Chandler">Adam Chandler</a> and his twin brother Stuart arrived in town and became frontburner characters.</p>
<p>The character of Erica began to take on a larger-than-life role by the '80s. This was evident with her writing an autobiography, "Raising Kane", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister (Deborah Goodrich) accused her of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Goodart), her former lover and boss, she went on the run fleeing to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Hills_6b23.html" title="Hollywood Hills">Hollywood Hills</a>. She did this all while posing as a nun. Many remember her forest encounter with a grizzly bear after she escaped a kidnapping attempt made by Adam. The character would go on to marry over 10 times (with her most recent wedding taking place in June 2005).</p>
<p>The show made their first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983. <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricia_Pursley_cc38.html" title="Tricia Pursley">Tricia Pursley</a> played the divorced Devon McFadden who believed she was falling in love with her psychiatrist, Lynn Carson (played by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Pescow_2482.html" title="Donna Pescow">Donna Pescow</a>). Lynn admitted to being a lesbian, and Devon admitted her crush. Other soaps and television shows had done stories hinting at <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a>, but never <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, much less with women.</p>
<p>The show intelligently tackled the issue of drug use when Mark LaMura's character, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Dalton_997a.html" title="Mark Dalton">Mark Dalton</a>, became addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica staged an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practiced a "tough love" policy that had Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed how to hold an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation.</p>
<p>Controversy hit in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker (<a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Wheeler_012e.html" title="Ellen Wheeler">Ellen Wheeler</a>), who would later fall in love with <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Chandler_5686.html" title="Stuart Chandler">Stuart Chandler</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Canary_1551.html" title="David Canary">David Canary</a>). The character was revealed to have <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. Through visits by Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> from her husband, Fred, who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy would be attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skye_Chandler_0156.html" title="Skye Chandler">Skye Chandler</a>. The tragedy of the attack showed the extremes of violence that was occurring everyday to victims of the disease. Cindy married Stuart and he adopted her son Scott. She died early in 1989 in one of the soaps most watched episodes.</p>
<p>By 1989, ABC wanted changes at <i>All My Children</i>. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but many felt that the program had lost its unique sense of humor. Agnes Nixon and Wisner Washam, who had both written the show since the '70s, were faced with a merry-go-round of executive producers, starting in the mid-'80s when producer Jacqueline Babbin left. Jorn Winther was hired to executive produce the show. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. This would mean adding a mixture of <i>both</i> social issues and also the intelligent satire that the show had been known for.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/e/l/Felicia_Minei_Behr_e9d6.html" title="Felicia Minei Behr">Felicia Minei Behr</a> was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan%27s_Hope_fd59.html" title="Ryan's Hope">Ryan's Hope</a>, Behr was familiar with <i>All My Children</i>, having been a crew member dating back to 1970. Behr welcomed the input of both Nixon and Washam. In the eyes of Agnes Nixon, the show finally had a stable executive producer. Behr worked with Nixon and Washam, crafting a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie between the characters of Tad and Dixie (<a href="../../../c/a/d/Cady_McClain_8b13.html" title="Cady McClain">Cady McClain</a>), with whom Behr saw much chemistry between. By this time, the show also found a hit couple in Cecily and Nico (played by Rosa Nevin and <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Benard_941c.html" title="Maurice Benard">Maurice Benard</a>).</p>
<p>ABC was pleased with Behr; Agnes Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. The program was faced with many actor defections during this time, including longtime favorites such as <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bergman_cb00.html" title="Peter Bergman">Peter Bergman</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Miller_65fe.html" title="Taylor Miller">Taylor Miller</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbi_Morgan_d0d9.html" title="Debbi Morgan">Debbi Morgan</a>, but Behr countered this by bringing back other favorite characters from the past -- Opal (this time played by <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Larson_a5b2.html" title="Jill Larson">Jill Larson</a>) and Billy Clyde Tuggle (the former pimp who first made his big splash in the '70s). Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica found him working as a clown in a traveling circus.</p>

It has been suggested that <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chandler_Family_8e0e.html" title="The Chandler Family">The Chandler Family</a></i> be <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">merged</a> into this article or section. (<a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAll_My_Children_aeed.html" title="Talk:All My Children">Discuss</a>)</div>
<p>At the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around #4 in the ratings, by 1990 the show had inched up to the #3 spot. ABC chose <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megan_McTavish_82cf.html" title="Megan McTavish">Megan McTavish</a>, a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_writer.html" title="Head writer">head writer</a>. She was promoted to head writer in 1992, with Nixon serving as Executive Head Writer.</p>
<p>Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genie_Francis_7ecb.html" title="Genie Francis">Genie Francis</a>)’s <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>, Mona’s <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in the soap magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the 'Who Killed Will?' mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendall_Hart_d4b2.html" title="Kendall Hart">Kendall Hart</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar_8a56.html" title="Sarah Michelle Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>), who was revealed to be the product of a rape that happened to Erica on her fourteenth birthday, was a major rewrite, but still a popular story in the eyes of many. The Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during this time as well.</p>
<p>Tad and Dixie were now very popular The show had other couples with large followings during this time: Erica and Dimitri (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Nader_b554.html" title="Michael Nader">Michael Nader</a>), Trevor (<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kiberd_14f8.html" title="James Kiberd">James Kiberd</a>) and Natalie (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Collins_a0be.html" title="Kate Collins">Kate Collins</a>), and Hayley (<a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Ripa_60b6.html" title="Kelly Ripa">Kelly Ripa</a>) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Borlenghi_afbc.html" title="Matt Borlenghi">Matt Borlenghi</a>, Brian L. Greene).</p>
<p>Many fans consider the early 1990s to have been a second golden period for the show, often comparing it to the late 1970s/early 1980s.</p>
<p>However, by the early-mid-1990s, some of McTavish's storytelling received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of AMC. After the O.J. Simpson trial pre-empted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and <i>All My Children</i> was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former associate head writer <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine_Broderick_c7ce.html" title="Lorraine Broderick">Lorraine Broderick</a> was tapped by Behr as the new head writer.</p>
<p>Broderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning AMC to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her biggest successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Ford_Center_3654.html" title="Betty Ford Center">Betty Ford Center</a>), and also the story of a homophobia over a gay high school boy and a history teacher. But with the ratings still stagnant, ABC fired longtime executive producer <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felicia_Minei_Behr_e9d6.html" title="Felicia Minei Behr">Felicia Minei Behr</a>, and brought in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesca_James_6c5b.html" title="Francesca James">Francesca James</a> (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a voodoo arc with the popular Noah and Julia (<a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Hamilton_Cobb_3260.html" title="Keith Hamilton Cobb">Keith Hamilton Cobb</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Penny_f9d2.html" title="Sydney Penny">Sydney Penny</a>), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the "real" Santa Claus, and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.</p>
<p>Despite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on AMC, Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish. The first major story McTavish tackled was ironically one created by Broderick, <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Montgomery_7ec9.html" title="Bianca Montgomery">Bianca Montgomery</a>'s <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_nervosa.html" title="Anorexia nervosa">anorexia</a>. The character of Bianca, Erica's young daughter, was checked into a facility to treat the disease. Apart from the anorexia story, McTavish's tales were plot-driven and made severe, implausible alterations to the show's history such as the resurrection of Erica's lifetime-love, Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy). In 1998 the show, yet again, got a new executive producer, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Dadario_Burke_d9a2.html" title="Jean Dadario Burke">Jean Dadario Burke</a>, taking over from <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesca_James_6c5b.html" title="Francesca James">Francesca James</a>. She would become known to many speculating fans as a weak producer with little vision.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/d/Cady_McClain_8b13.html" title="Cady McClain">Cady McClain</a>, who had left the show as Dixie in 1996, returned to the delight of her fans, but other storylines -- involving ghosts, poison tattoos, Nazi art, and a sperm switch -- were all busts. By the start of 1999, with <i>All My Children</i> being voted as the 'Worst of 1998' by Soap Opera Digest magazine, McTavish was once again fired.</p>
<p>As ratings began to fall in the late 1990s, ABC convinced Agnes Nixon to make a brief return. Many long-running actors, such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Nader_b554.html" title="Michael Nader">Michael Nader</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kiberd_14f8.html" title="James Kiberd">James Kiberd</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Mattson_4182.html" title="Robin Mattson">Robin Mattson</a>, left their roles. Nixon decided to write a story that would breathe new life into the show and be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the revelation that <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Kane_eb13.html" title="Erica Kane">Erica Kane</a>'s daughter Bianca was a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a>. She admitted the truth to her mother in December 2000. Despite the many flaws during this period, the show found mild success in the pairings of newcomers, Leo (<a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Duhamel_ac07.html" title="Josh Duhamel">Josh Duhamel</a>) and Greenlee (<a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Budig_464a.html" title="Rebecca Budig">Rebecca Budig</a>).</p>
<p>Starting with the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> episode, <i>All My Children</i> is being shown in the simulated film look which has drawn some viewer criticism (this look had previously been seen on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Channel_faad.html" title="Disney Channel">Disney Channel</a> sitcoms, such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_So_Raven_8a2e.html" title="That's So Raven">That's So Raven</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Montana_%28TV_series%29_600f.html" title="Hannah Montana (TV series)">Hannah Montana</a></i>). It is still shot on videotape, like other soap operas but they apply a digital process in post production which edits out every other frame, giving the show a distorted faux film look. Previews in the end credits are still seen in the normal unprocessed video. Hand held cameras were heavily used as well, but are now being used less often.</p>

<p>After even more staff turnover in recent years, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megan_McTavish_82cf.html" title="Megan McTavish">Megan McTavish</a>, who wrote the show for most of the '90s, again returned. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, which included the controversial rape of Bianca.</p>
<p>Gone upon McTavish's latest return was <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Dadario_Burke_d9a2.html" title="Jean Dadario Burke">Jean Dadario Burke</a> as <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_producer.html" title="Executive producer">executive producer</a>, being replaced with <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Hanan_Carruthers_214e.html" title="Julie Hanan Carruthers">Julie Hanan Carruthers</a>.</p>
<p>Under McTavish, ratings bounced from the middle of the pack and the bottom. McTavish resorted to quick thinking and stunt casting to lure back long-time viewers. Various characters returned to the show after long absences, including <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Santos_b6c9.html" title="Julia Santos">Julia Santos</a> (<a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Penny_f9d2.html" title="Sydney Penny">Sydney Penny</a>) and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Marlowe_Dillon_4a93.html" title="Janet Marlowe Dillon">Janet Dillon</a> (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Collins_a0be.html" title="Kate Collins">Kate Collins</a>, who was originally slated to return for a brief stint and was eventually given a contract. The most notable, however, was the long-kept secret of <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cady_McClain_8b13.html" title="Cady McClain">Cady McClain</a>'s return as the iconic Dixie Cooney Martin. The news of her return was spread just two weeks before she appeared on viewers' screens again. In a very unpopular move the writers chose to kill off Dixie only a year after her return</p>
<p>A controversial storyline had Erica's thought-to-be-aborted son come to Pine Valley.</p>
<p>In August 2006 after months of speculation it was confirmed that fan favorite <a href="../../../e/d/e/Eden_Riegel_16d4.html" title="Eden Riegel">Eden Riegel</a> would be reprising her <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy</a> winning role of <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Montgomery_7ec9.html" title="Bianca Montgomery">Bianca Montgomery</a>. Since departing the show in February 2005, Eden has returned for three limited guest appearances but this time signed a contract of undetermined length with the show.</p>
<p>In 2006 the show began a storyline about a transgender character that involves Bianca and the rock musician Freddie 'Zarf/Zoe' Luper.</p>
<p>In December 2006, AMC introduced a storyline where the women of Fusion began being killed by a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a>. Simone and Erin were the first two victims of the serial killer, with Danielle Frye being the third. When the "Satin Slayer" attacked Danielle, she saw him/her before collapsing. Josh Madden and Babe get to Danielle before she died, and got her to the hospital, but she was unable to identify her attacker. Her father had her moved to Hawaii for her recovery, and to get her away from the killer. Dixie Cooney Martin was the fourth victim of the "Satin Slayer". Although Babe Chandler was the intended victim, Dixie accidentally ate the poisoned food, and succumbed to the drug. Dixie's spirit visited Jamie and J.R. as well as Tad, and she realized that Kathy was her Kate, before moving on to the afterlife. Weeks later Babe was to fall victim to the Satin Slayer. Her bodyguard had been killed behind her car and as she went to check on him, the Satin Slayer got hold of her and plunged a syringe into her neck causing her to suffer the same fate as her co-workers and mother-in-law, or so it seemed. It was later revealed that Babe was indeed alive and in hiding. It was revealed in February 2007 that Alexander Cambias Sr. was The Satin Slayer. The story continues...</p>
<p>It was officially announced February 2007 that Megan McTavish has been fired, information about her successor will be forthcoming.</p>

<td>With the premiere, the opening was simple: a camera slowly zooms in on a leather-bound photo album as a female hand (it is Agnes Nixon's) enters the shot to open the album. On the first page of the album, the title is shown in calligraphic type. Until at least June 1970, the hand turned to a second page, crediting <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary_Prinz_579e.html" title="Rosemary Prinz">Rosemary Prinz</a> as a "Special Guest Star". Prinz, at the time, was the cast member with the most soap opera experience, and crediting her in the beginning was used a way to coax her fans to tune in. She left after six months on the show, and the second page was eliminated from the sequence.
<p>This set ran until <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a> 1990, making it one of the longest-running packages in soap history. The theme music used with this version was written by Dina Dore and her daughter Carlina Paul. It went through several arrangements, as in the beginning it was a soft lullaby-type tune, but as time progressed, it was more sweeping and cheery.</p>

<td>The show's next sequence debuted during the week of the 20th anniversary in January 1990. The new opening kept the photo album theme, of course, but expanded on it. It began with the camera panning across a desk featuring framed pictures of longtime cast members (specifically, Joe and Ruth Martin, Adam and Stuart Chandler, Brooke English, and Phoebe and Langley Wallingford).
<p>This dissolved into a series of animations in which still pictures of each cast member hovered into piles on the desk. It ended with a portrait of lead actress Susan Lucci slowly sliding onto a page in the photo album, as it closed to reveal the title in an Old English type on the cover. Occasionally, the title would disappear from the cover and a sponsor's logo would be in its place, with the announcer doing an ad for the sponsor. Felicia Minei Behr (who was All My Children’s executive producer from 1989-1996) was responsible for this opening, and thought a change was desperately needed to bring the show into the '90s.</p>
<p>As popular as the opening was (it proved to be an innovative idea in that the set-up allowed everyone from contract cast members to recurring cast members to be included), the theme music was even more popular. Written by legendary television composers Robert Israel and Billy Barber, it began with a perky melody. A slightly remixed version of this theme debuted in 1993 with a quieter, slower arrangement at the beginning and tuned to a more mid-90's pop theme, that lasted until 1995. The theme song was identified with the show's years of the early '90s.</p>

It featured stills (later live action video in July 1996(Locket), (Pearls) 1997) of each cast member fading in and out of a white background while various images, including galloping horses, house exteriors, pearl necklaces, and pink roses, crossfaded throughout the headshots. Susan Lucci was again given a nod as her picture was always first and was the only one in the sequence to be framed (with a silver picture frame). At the end, Agnes Nixon's hand-written epigram for the show crossfaded in the background just as the photo album did. In Spring 1995 a new theme debuted to replace the January 1995 themes, that a began with a series drums and a piano playing, leading into a saxophone, piano, and strings leading the theme. In August 1997, a quiet piano arrangement debuted that lasted to the summer of 1998 when a new upbeat version that included the ending version would debut. In the first week of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> the along with the opening updates was modified music with a series of a few more instruments included in the opening.

<td>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">October 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, after seven and a half years of the "white opening", a new opening made its debut. Of course, it featured the photo album, but unlike the other openings, the photo album was constantly seen throughout. It began with a closeup of the album (with the title on the cover) as it opened. The Agnes Nixon epigram is seen on the front page, but the screen fades into the montage of cast member headshots, all done in live action. The photos were already on their pages in the album and as each face was shown, the name of the character was scrawled on their page in the book, similar to what many people do with their own family scrapbooks. Yet again, Susan Lucci is paid homage by being at the end of both versions of this opening. This time, however, she shared that honor with David Canary, as he was in both openings as well, as Adam Chandler in one and Stuart in the other. The music for this opening was a much-loved update of the 1990-1994 theme by Robert Israel and Billy Barber. There were two music versions of this opening. The first version was a quiet, fast tempo that lasted for two weeks when replaced by a more dramatic theme that lasted until May 2004.
<p>The opening went un-updated from December 2002 to June 2003. The show reportedly had difficulty when attempting to update this opening; for the first six months it was in use there were no updates despite many cast changes. Several cast members left the show and remained in the opening for months. When the opening finally was updated in June 2003 to feature new stars such as William Devry and Marc Menard, their images were blurry and of very poor quality. Also many shots had become brighter and were zoomed in, and the pages had a much lighter hue.</p>

<td>After barely a year and a half of the previous opening, the show debuted another on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. This opening was styled after the commercial break bumpers that were present on all of ABC's serials at the time. One Life to Live and General Hospital's openings were done in similar ways to the All My Children opening.
<p>The new opening generated mixed opinions from fans. The pros of it were that many pictures from the show's past, including montages of classic Susan Lucci and Ruth Warrick headshots and a wedding portrait from Edmund and Maria (John Callahan and Eva LaRue)'s 1994 wedding, was seen at the beginning. Also in favor was the updated version of the classic early '90s theme song. Cons were Ryan's shot was after Erica Kane, which many felt that place belonged to Alicia Minshew's Kendall Hart. The All My Children book letter font was in Monotype Corsiva rather than the traditional Old English Text and the book was in a different red hue.</p>
