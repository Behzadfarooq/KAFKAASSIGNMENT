<p>Cameron is a member of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_House_4ae0.html" title="Gregory House">Dr. Gregory House</a>'s team of handpicked <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist.html" title="Specialist">specialists</a> at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton-Plainsboro_Teaching_Hospital_e406.html" title="Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital">Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital</a>'s Department of Diagnostic Medicine. She is an <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunologist.html" title="Immunologist">immunologist</a> and was hired by House six months prior to the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_%28House_episode%29_2474.html" title="Pilot (House episode)">pilot episode</a> (implied in the un-aired version of the pilot). Prior to working at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton-Plainsboro_Teaching_Hospital_e406.html" title="Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital">PPTH</a>, Cameron was a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_intern.html" title="Medical intern">medical intern</a> at the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayo_Clinic_6cea.html" title="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a>, and was one of the top students in her class in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_school.html" title="Medical school">medical school</a>. House explicitly told her that he chose her for her looks: he believes that a pretty girl who went into medicine shows greater dedication than an ordinary-looking student because a pretty girl could have used her looks to get an easier job.</p>
<p>Cameron is currently working for House under a medical <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fellowship.html" title="Fellowship">fellowship</a>, along with Drs. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Chase_46b1.html" title="Robert Chase">Robert Chase</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Foreman_787e.html" title="Eric Foreman">Eric Foreman</a>.</p>
<p>She is by far the most empathetic member of House's team and possesses the best <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedside_manner.html" title="Bedside manner">bedside manner</a>. She is also known for her <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honesty.html" title="Honesty">honesty</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sincerity.html" title="Sincerity">sincerity</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">idealism</a> and possesses a strong moral and ethical center. Cameron is hesitant and unwilling at times to do House's bidding in which she is required to lie or deceive their patients (cf. "<a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeping_Dogs_Lie_%28House_episode%29_300d.html" title="Sleeping Dogs Lie (House episode)">Sleeping Dogs Lie</a>", "<a href="../../../i/n/f/Informed_Consent_%28House_episode%29_e66d.html" title="Informed Consent (House episode)">Informed Consent</a>)" and has gone head-to-head with her boss before on several occasions on the issue. She has also shown extreme reluctance to relate bad news to patients or their family (cf. "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Maternity_%28House_episode%29_e144.html" title="Maternity (House episode)">Maternity</a>," "<a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceptance_%28House_episode%29_8c8d.html" title="Acceptance (House episode)">Acceptance</a>").</p>
<p>In Season 3, Cameron has proved to be far more assertive in her beliefs and actions, and is more willing to employ House-like tactics (without any prompting) in order to get the job done. Despite this, her consistently good intentions have not changed and her loyalty to House has proved unquestionable as he was previously under investigation for alleged <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addiction.html" title="Drug addiction">drug addiction</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_trafficking.html" title="Drug trafficking">trafficking</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allison_Cameron_%28House%29_c6d4.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Despite her kind and earnest nature, Cameron has undergone extremely <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_trauma.html" title="Psychological trauma">traumatic</a> experiences in her life. According to a conversation between her and House in "<a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidelity_%28House_episode%29_5923.html" title="Fidelity (House episode)">Fidelity</a>," she fell in love and married when she was 21. However, the marriage lasted only six months ending with her husband's death due to <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thyroid_cancer.html" title="Thyroid cancer">thyroid cancer</a> that had <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metastasis.html" title="Metastasis">metastasized</a> to his brain. She also revealed to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wilson_%28House%29_8845.html" title="James Wilson (House)">Dr. James Wilson</a> that she had met her husband shortly after he was diagnosed and that if they hadn't married, he would have died alone (cf. "<a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceptance_%28House_episode%29_8c8d.html" title="Acceptance (House episode)">Acceptance</a>"). In another surprising confession to Wilson, she told the latter that she fell in love with her late husband's best friend, Joe, but never acted on her feelings (cf. "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_%28House_episode%29_e337.html" title="Spin (House episode)">Spin</a>").</p>
<p>Cameron's marriage is again spoken of in "<a href="../../../f/i/n/Finding_Judas_dd5f.html" title="Finding Judas">Finding Judas</a>," as she was being questioned by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Tritter_d41f.html" title="Michael Tritter">Michael Tritter</a> (who had earlier frozen her <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_account.html" title="Bank account">bank account</a> in accordance with his investigation) about the reasoning behind her decision to protect House. Tritter spoke of an incident ten years ago involving a <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">calculus</a> exam in which she would have gotten an A had she not spoken up about a marking error, and attempted to use that story as an opening to talk about her late husband. She quickly cut in and warned Tritter not to go there. Tritter then observes that she used to be a person who did the right things and that House had changed her.</p>
<p>Her husband is again mentioned when Dr. Foreman was goaded into a conversation about it by Cameron in "<a href="../../../i/n/s/Insensitive_%28House_episode%29_5be3.html" title="Insensitive (House episode)">Insensitive</a>" after he expressed unspoken disbelief that she had the real thing as they were hitherto discussing their social lives. She had previously expressed a want to amend her lack of one when she has the time and Foreman scoffed at this remarking that if it's anything a "a good-looking woman can have", it's a social life. When she informs him that she's refusing to settle, her colleague's reaction lead her to mildly chastise him for judging the relationship she had with her late husband. This leads to an outburst from Foreman who claims that even though she married a dying man and that the sacrifices she made to be with him were huge, they were at the height of her love for him, declaring that "commitment is only commitment when it has no expiration date" and that she should only ask for sacrifices when she's been in a long-term relationship. His tirade ends, however, when he sees how much he has hurt Cameron assuring her that he wasn't criticizing by way of apology.</p>
<p>In another nod to her short-lived marriage, Cameron encountered a homeless man with inoperable <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> in "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Day%2C_One_Room_6707.html" title="One Day, One Room">One Day, One Room</a>" in the clinic and admits him. Her attempts to offer him <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palliative_treatment.html" title="Palliative treatment">palliative treatment</a> are refused repeatedly as her patient believes he will bring some meaning to his life if he dies in pain, convinced it is his punishment for leading a wasted life. He requests she be by his side (<i>"I need you to remember me. I need someone to remember me."</i>), and she acquiesces to this, though she tells him she will not watch him suffer. After he passes away, she is seen cleaning him with a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_cloth.html" title="Terry cloth">terry cloth</a>, taking on the role usually relegated to <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse.html" title="Nurse">nurses</a>.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, Cameron was invited to move to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> by Dr. Sebastian Charles, a world-renowned <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activist.html" title="Activist">activist</a>, a fellow immunologist, and patient, and then later, on a date, in "<a href="../../../t/b/_/TB_or_Not_TB_3c2a.html" title="TB or Not TB">TB or Not TB</a>." She confided in <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Robert_Chase_8ca5.html" title="Dr. Robert Chase">Dr. Chase</a>, who expressed his doubt that she would go out with Dr. Charles despite their mutual attraction and instant connection, simply because he wasn't House. At the end of the episode, she declined both offers.</p>
<p>In "<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting_%28House_episode%29_1ac6.html" title="Hunting (House episode)">Hunting</a>," a man infected with <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> coughed blood into Cameron's mouth and eyes, putting her potentially at risk for contracting the disease. In order to get her to take her final HIV test, House told her <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_love_you.html" title="I love you">he loved her</a> out of the blue; her mouth dropped open in shock and House quickly swabbed the inside of her cheek, and told her that she would get the results the day after. By the end of the episode, Cameron finds out that House had actually opened her test results before she had a chance to find out herself, justifying his actions by citing the letter's confidentiality and that he had simply "wanted to know." (cf. "<a href="../../../n/e/e/Need_to_Know_%28House_episode%29_7d8d.html" title="Need to Know (House episode)">Need to Know</a>")</p>
<p>Cameron's friendship with <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Eric_Foreman_427d.html" title="Dr. Eric Foreman">Dr. Foreman</a> became strained after she accused him of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarizing</a> her article for a medical journal after his article was published in "<a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeping_Dogs_Lie_%28House_episode%29_300d.html" title="Sleeping Dogs Lie (House episode)">Sleeping Dogs Lie</a>." Her frustration and anger were further exacerbated by her peers' indifference (especially House's) to the entire affair. She eventually confronted Foreman and apologized for the angry way she had treated him, claiming she didn't want to damage their friendship. Foreman coldly replied by informing her that their relationship was purely professional, and they were by no means "friends." However, in a later storyline ("<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_House_episodes_22f4.html" title="List of House episodes">Euphoria</a>," Parts 1 &amp; 2), when Foreman was dying from an unknown disease, he apologized for his prior actions (including exposing Cameron to the disease on purpose which led her to go to the patient's house in an effort to find the source despite it being declared off-limits several times by House). Although she didn't accept his apology initially (fearing it was a knee-jerk reaction to his impending death rather than one made in sincerity), she recanted her position before he was put into a chemically-induced <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a>. Foreman also named her his medical proxy while he was incapacitated, giving her the right to allow a white-matter <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biopsy.html" title="Biopsy">brain biopsy</a> to be performed on him, despite House's vehement objections. Though Foreman thanked Cameron when he woke, she, House and Rodney Foreman (Eric's father) could only look on in horror at the end of the episode as his brain experienced a left-right reversal when House did a check-up on his motor skills.</p>
<p>Cameron and House clashed in "<a href="../../../f/o/r/Forever_%28House_episode%29_6353.html" title="Forever (House episode)">Forever</a>" as Foreman returned to work two weeks later, unable to remember how to make <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>. Though there were no more reversals, Foreman proved to be a thorn in their boss's side by refusing to argue with him during diagnostic sessions and also with his new bright outlook on life. This drew ire from Cameron who believed House was pushing the neurologist too hard too fast, which, in turn, led the former to accuse her of feeling guilty for doing the biopsy. This accusation was repeatedly denied.</p>
<p>Drs. <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Cuddy_315a.html" title="Lisa Cuddy">Lisa Cuddy</a> and Wilson incurred Cameron's wrath in "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Cane_and_Able_7aa8.html" title="Cane and Able">Cane and Able</a>" when Cameron found out about their deception of House involving a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadriplegic.html" title="Quadriplegic">quadriplegic</a> man Cuddy treated using his diagnosis. The latter had previously given up on the case (a rare event for House) and sent the patient home before Cuddy took a chance and successfully treated him prior to his departure (cf. "<a href="../../../m/e/a/Meaning_%28House_episode%29_5fe2.html" title="Meaning (House episode)">Meaning</a>"). Cameron, incensed, over her and Wilson's adamant stance that he was going overboard with his diagnostic measures which led them to hold back the truth to teach House "some humility" pressed the issue and gave her superiors an ultimatum: tell House the truth or she will. Cuddy later had her hand forced into confessing when House gave up the Department's present case at the time too. It is currently unknown if House knows that Cameron knew the truth before he did.</p>
<p>In "<a href="../../../i/n/f/Informed_Consent_%28House_episode%29_e66d.html" title="Informed Consent (House episode)">Informed Consent</a>," Cameron was torn regarding assisting Ezra Powell's (the episode's patient) wish to die for the duration of the episode, and this kept her from participating in much of the diagnostic procedures. House, in turn, subtly directed her to discover an article Ezra, a noted <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> researcher, wrote for a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_journal.html" title="Medical journal">medical journal</a> decades ago about his unethical use of babies as test cases. His assumption that this would lead her to change her mind infuriated Cameron who, despite her disgust, still believed Ezra had a right to live just like any other person. When all of their efforts to diagnose Ezra were laid waste, House finally lets loose at her and heatedly demanded that she do her job by getting him a skin sample. Cameron later achieves this by simply slicing off Ezra's skin sans <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anesthesia.html" title="Anesthesia">anesthesia</a> and with no prior warning after confronting him about the article in which the latter expressed no regret regarding his actions. This act only served to gain her Ezra's respect, who praised her for finally taking a stand. The ensuing <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biopsy.html" title="Biopsy">biopsy</a> only revealed what he had suspected (and believed all along): he was terminal; his <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amyloidosis.html" title="Amyloidosis">illness</a> untreatable. Later in the night, Ezra mysteriously dies only thirty minutes after being declared stable. Cuddy easily believes that House is behind it despite his denial the morning after but as she walks away, there is a look of recognition on House's face and Cameron is seen in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapel.html" title="Chapel">chapel</a> with a tear-streaked face. House puts a comforting hand on her shoulder, and quietly tells her that he is proud of her. Thus, we are led to believe that Cameron <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">assisted the patient's suicide</a>.</p>
<p>Cameron fought for her patient's rights (a severely <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obese.html" title="Obese">obese</a> man) in "<a href="../../../q/u/e/Que_Sera_Sera_%28House_episode%29_8eab.html" title="Que Sera Sera (House episode)">Que Será Será</a>" with an intensity that not only surprised House (who goes on to discuss this with Wilson) but also Cuddy when she breaks a <a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a> machine after their <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comatose.html" title="Comatose">comatose</a> patient wakes up and thrashes around in panic whilst they were performing tests on him. Though Cuddy is quick to blame it on House, Cameron speaks up and admits that it was her doing, justifying her actions by pointing out that the hospital would have been sued if proper care had not been given since his condition is a legally-registered disability. After their patient is discharged and tries to leave the hospital premises, he falls through the lobby's glass window, taking Cameron down with him. Later, it transpires that she had drugged him before he left saying that she didn't think he was fit to leave the hospital. The patient, on the other hand, becomes deeply agitated when she suggests the problem might be <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabetes.html" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a> and refuses to co-operate if any treatment suggested is related to his weight. Later, House realises that their patient's hands are <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clubbing.html" title="Clubbing">clubbed</a> and suggests <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-ray.html" title="X-ray">x-raying</a> them, which confirms his diagnosis of terminal <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>. Cameron breaks the news to him, and has an encounter with House at the end of the episode where he concedes defeat and finally questioned her about the importance of this patient. She wryly referenced his thoughts about her in "<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Hurts_%28House_episode%29_8a70.html" title="Love Hurts (House episode)">Love Hurts</a>" (<i>"I like damaged people, remember? Explains everything I do."</i>) when House alludes that she cares more because she's seen someone else go through a similar experience and then later tells him, "Sorry to disappoint you, sometimes the answers just aren't that simple."</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Robert_Chase_8ca5.html" title="Dr. Robert Chase">Chase</a> has always been attracted to Cameron, and this was explored early on in the series when Foreman catches him looking at her longingly in the lab (cf.

Foreman later informs her about the new development in their team dynamic claiming she now has "total control" over her relationship with him simply because she questioned if sex could kill in a diagnostic session. Cameron later took advantage of this by cornering him in the department's office and apologized for being glib when she was talking about sex before and immediately launched into a breathless tangent when a wide-eyed Chase tells her that they don't have to talk about it.</p>

<p>Foreman walks in after this encounter, and Cameron, seeing him in a mirror, promptly acts as if nothing has happened, saying casually, "Hey Foreman, what's up?". Later, Chase attempts to ask her out but she cuts him off with a firm "no" before he can finish his question.</p>
<p>Cameron was exposed to <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> in season two after a patient coughed blood into her mouth and eyes (cf. "<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting_%28House_episode%29_1ac6.html" title="Hunting (House episode)">Hunting</a>"). This led Chase to reach out to her by offering to take her out for a drink to relax as she was put under a course of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiretroviral_drugs.html" title="Antiretroviral drugs">antiretroviral drugs</a>. The patient, on the other hand, was baffled as to why she was still so calm about her predicament after he apologized and later told her that contracting HIV might have been the best thing that happened to him since he now lives his life to the fullest. Later, Cameron called Chase to her apartment and he was taken aback when she suddenly kissed him. Prior to their <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-night_stand.html" title="One-night stand">one-night stand</a>, he discovered that she had stolen some of their patient's <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meth.html" title="Meth">meth</a> from the lab and gotten high. Though he initially resisted her advances, Cameron told him "not to turn into a good guy on me now".</p>
<p>Their tryst was swiftly exposed by House the morning after during a diagnostic session after he observed an unravelled Cameron. Later, she and Chase met in the locker room and though they mutually agreed that the sex "didn't suck", he tells her that it shouldn't happen again.</p>
<p>In season three, Cameron proposes a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_relationship.html" title="Casual relationship">casual relationship</a> to Chase after he wishes her a Happy <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentine%27s_Day_56e9.html" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a> (cf. "<a href="../../../i/n/s/Insensitive_%28House_episode%29_5be3.html" title="Insensitive (House episode)">Insensitive</a>"). This takes him by surprise and she justifies her request by making the argument that it would be "convenient" since they already work together and referenced their one-night stand and how they "didn't get weird about it". Chase sarcastically remarks upon this saying that she views him "like microwave pizza" and asks her what happens if he's offended by her judgment of his character.</p>

<p>The first allusion to their burgeoning relationship is made in "<a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Wit_%28House_episode%29_fecd.html" title="Half-Wit (House episode)">Half-Wit</a>" when House observes them in the morning, takes note of their wet hair and asks them if they had showered together. Cameron and Chase immediately deny this which leads their boss to deduce that a "double negative" means yes. Later in the episode, they break into House's apartment to find evidence to confirm Cameron's suspicion that something is wrong and Chase suggests having sex in their boss's bed (to which she expresses incredulity) when she tells him the bedroom is down the hall. Chase questions her knowledge about House's home and she covers by responding, "Where else would the bedroom be?"</p>
<p>Their relationship intensifies in "<a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Secret_%28House_episode%29_1d4b.html" title="Top Secret (House episode)">Top Secret</a>" as Chase and Cameron have clandestine sex all over the hospital whilst on the clock, surprisingly at Cameron's lead. This leads Foreman to be suspicious when he discovers them missing at the sleep laboratory where they were supposed to be monitoring a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polysomnogram.html" title="Polysomnogram">polysomnogram</a>. He later questions the both of them and when he expresses his doubt that they were getting coffee, Cameron tells him outright about their midnight activities though Foreman doesn't believe her and finds the thought utterly hilarious. Chase, perturbed, later tells her that they're not doing it at work again expressing his belief that she wanted to get caught and particularly give House a reason to be jealous. Cameron vehemently denies this, claims that she is over House (repeatedly) and reminds him that all they're doing is "uncomplicated sex". His fear comes true by the end of the episode when House catches them making out and undressing, under the pretense that he's throwing out old files in the janitor's closet.</p>

<p>Confused by House's seemingly apathetic stance on their affair, Cameron discusses with Chase as to why he hasn't attempted to create trouble for them yet (cf. "<a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetal_Position_%28House_episode%29_70e3.html" title="Fetal Position (House episode)">Fetal Position</a>"). Chase looks upon her concern with bitterness likening her curiosity about their boss's non-reaction to annoyance that House doesn't care that she's no longer available. Cameron's soon proved correct, however, when House blows their secret out of the water informing Cuddy (who attempts to dissuade Cameron from continuing the relationship, albeit hypocritically) and later, Foreman (who has a heart-to-heart with Chase). Emotions continued to run high throughout the episode when even Emma, their patient and a renowned <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">photographer</a>, tells Chase to keep a photograph of Cameron that she took when he expresses interest in it. Though he feigns indifference, she calls him out and tells him that she noticed the way he looks at her. She takes a photo of him while he is looking at it fondly and then quietly thanks her for the gift. Cameron later comes upon this picture as she's packing up Emma's equipment after her discharge and is awed by how he looks in it, saying, in an amazed voice, "She got you to--glow." Chase evades the compliment by quipping: "I always glow". <a name="Dr._Gregory_House" id="Dr._Gregory_House"></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_%28House_episode%29_2474.html" title="Pilot (House episode)">pilot episode</a>, Cameron asks House why he hired her, and he reveals that he did so because "you are <i>extremely</i> pretty." House says that beautiful women don't go to medical school unless they are as "damaged as they are beautiful," and surmises that Cameron is damaged.</p>
<p>Cameron's emerging feelings for her boss can be seen as early as in "<a href="../../../d/a/m/Damned_If_You_Do_%28House_episode%29_c2e0.html" title="Damned If You Do (House episode)">Damned If You Do</a>," where she showed extreme trust in House's leadership to the team and gave him a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> gift towards the end of the episode, despite his hostile reaction to her "just being nice", but later finds a gift for herself left sitting on her office chair.

<p>However, the episode where Cameron's interest becomes extremely clear is "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_%28House_episode%29_e4f2.html" title="Control (House episode)">Control</a>," in which she asked him whether he liked her, and House replied, "No." However, House's behavior sometimes goes contrary to this claim.</p>
<p>In "<a href="../../../m/o/b/Mob_Rules_%28House_episode%29_0a79.html" title="Mob Rules (House episode)">Mob Rules</a>," Cameron admitted to her feelings for House to Dr. Chase who comforted her by pointing out that their boss didn't like anyone and then went on to marvel that she, ironically, was the only person who <i>did</i> like him.</p>
<p>Things became increasingly tense in the Department in "<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_%28House_episode%29_df4c.html" title="Heavy (House episode)">Heavy</a>," as House revealed that he was being made to fire one of them by the end of the week as office politics came into play, pitting the three colleagues against each other. There was a heated exchange between Cameron and House in the pathology laboratory as he implied that she had made a mistake administering the correct medicine to their patient and she accused him of stalling on having to make a decision. Cameron would later go on to confront him about his nonchalant behavior, in which she quietly threatened to leave her job to "make it easy on everyone." House called her out on her bluff and replied that, "Maybe she should." By the end of the episode, Cameron is seen writing up her <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curriculum_vitae.html" title="Curriculum vitae">CV</a> in the lab.</p>
<p>Despite House's agreement to promote hospital board chairman <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Vogler_2ed1.html" title="Edward Vogler">Edward Vogler</a>'s new drug for his pharmaceutical company, in exchange for his Department to remain intact (cf. "<a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_Model_%28House_episode%29_7b04.html" title="Role Model (House episode)">Role Model</a>"), things ended in disaster as he embarrassed his employer in a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrocodone.html" title="Hydrocodone">Vicodin</a>-fuelled diatribe against the drug at a public presentation. Earlier in the episode, House had privately asked Cameron why she liked him. The conversation led nowhere as House bitterly accused her of psychoanalyzing him when she attempted to deflect the question. At the end of the episode, Cameron stopped by House's apartment to tender her resignation which he initially questioned as "another noble self-sacrificing gesture." She disagreed and revealed why she liked him: that he did things because it was right and not to help people as she had originally thought. House rejected Cameron's attempt to shake hands as a proper goodbye, prompting her to say that there were only two ways she could deal with their current situation and she was exercising the one option of which she was in control. House was visibly upset when she left his home.</p>
<p>With the departure of Vogler from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton-Plainsboro_Teaching_Hospital_e406.html" title="Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital">PPTH</a>, House attempted to bring Cameron back to work in "<a href="../../../k/i/d/Kids_%28House_episode%29_020d.html" title="Kids (House episode)">Kids</a>." Cameron literally shut the door in his face the first time round as his replies as to why he wanted her back didn't impress her. By the end of the episode, House was back at her front door, asking her to come back to work despite her acceptance of a new job. He offered her more perks at work and was thrown off when Cameron replied that all she wanted was "dinner", clarifying that it couldn't just be "a meal between two colleagues." She wanted a real date.</p>
<p>Despite an uncharacteristic show of romance by House (he bought her a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corsage.html" title="Corsage">corsage</a>), the date did not go well as Cameron rejected his attempt at small talk to instead try and gain an insight as to what her emotionally crippled boss feels about her (by (mistakenly) using <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freud.html" title="Freud">Freud</a>). House responded:</p>

<p>The return of House's former girlfriend caused the relationship between House and Cameron to be placed in the back burner for the rest of the first season and half of the second season. While it was clear that Cameron still harbored some feelings for House, the future remained uncertain for the two characters despite the departure of Stacy from the show's canvas and a few "tease scenes" by the producers throughout the second season.</p>
<p>In the second season finalé, "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Reason_%28House_episode%29_c0ec.html" title="No Reason (House episode)">No Reason</a>," viewers gained an insight into House's mind when he hallucinates subsequent to being shot. During his hallucination, his subconscious has Cameron keep a vigil by his bedside for two days after his surgery and later, House uses a complex surgical machine to begin to undress her in the midst of treating a patient. When he awakens as he's being transported to the emergency room, House entrusts Cameron to inform Cuddy that he wants <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketamine.html" title="Ketamine">ketamine</a> to relieve the pain in his leg and enable him to walk without a cane.</p>

<p>In the third season opener, "<a href="../../../m/e/a/Meaning_%28House_episode%29_5fe2.html" title="Meaning (House episode)">Meaning</a>", House asked Cameron out on a date in his first week back at work. Bewildered and flustered, she declined his invitation, citing a list of reasons. Cameron stopped with a sigh to point out that he was smirking at her as she was saying no. Bemusedly, House declared that it was because she was "full of crap" and accused her of only being interested in him when he was still a "sick puppy." Cameron, in response, smirked and replied that he was still not healthy, limp or no limp, and promptly walked away from him. House smiled and watched her go.</p>
<p>In "<a href="../../../f/i/n/Finding_Judas_%28House_episode%29_fa2f.html" title="Finding Judas (House episode)">Finding Judas</a>", Cameron denies that she's in love with House as she's being questioned by Detective Tritter. He makes the observation that although House is "unhinged", "unethical" and "does what he wants with no concern for others", she remains steadfastly loyal to him anyway.</p>
<p>Cameron visited House at his apartment in "<a href="../../../m/e/r/Merry_Little_Christmas_%28House_episode%29_2b81.html" title="Merry Little Christmas (House episode)">Merry Little Christmas</a>" to discuss their patient's condition and found her boss <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detox.html" title="Detox">detoxing</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-injury.html" title="Self-injury">cutting himself</a> in order to release endorphins and lessen his leg pain. She tended to his wounds but still flatly refused any entreaties for Vicodin after he tried resisting giving her his medical opinion without it. Cameron also pleaded with House to stop his drug-seeking behaviour expressing confidence that he could go without it and pointing out that he'd stayed clean for months after being shot. The latter's only retort was that it was only because "it had something to do with the absence of pain".</p>
<p>Cameron gave House a hug in "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Words_and_Deeds_%28House_episode%29_faa0.html" title="Words and Deeds (House episode)">Words and Deeds</a>" after finding out that he had offered Wilson an apology. House seemed to tense, not knowing how to respond, and finally said, "Excuse me, I have to go back to jail."</p>

<li>Cameron once mentioned to House that she was not an only child (cf. "<a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternity_%28House_episode%29_e21b.html" title="Paternity (House episode)">Paternity</a>"). Chase confirms this in the third season, telling Foreman that Cameron "already has an older brother." (cf. "<a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetal_Position_%28House_episode%29_70e3.html" title="Fetal Position (House episode)">Fetal Position</a>")</li>
<li>There have been theories that she might have <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">lost a child</a> once, as a result of her behavior in "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Maternity_%28House_episode%29_e144.html" title="Maternity (House episode)">Maternity</a>." In fact, House took it upon himself to violate her privacy and pull her medical history in "<a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidelity_%28House_episode%29_5923.html" title="Fidelity (House episode)">Fidelity</a>." Though there was no note that she had ever been pregnant (due to the lack of prescription to pre-natal vitamins), some belief to the contrary remains.</li>
<li>Cameron is an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheist</a> (cf. "<a href="../../../d/a/m/Damned_If_You_Do_%28House_episode%29_c2e0.html" title="Damned If You Do (House episode)">Damned If You Do</a>," "<a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_Model_%28House_episode%29_7b04.html" title="Role Model (House episode)">Role Model</a>"). Despite this, she has been seen seeking solace in the hospital chapel in "<a href="../../../i/n/f/Informed_Consent_%28House_episode%29_e66d.html" title="Informed Consent (House episode)">Informed Consent</a>," though this could be attributed to the peaceful nature of the institution.</li>

This was revealed during a conversation she had with House when she asked him if he would give up a baby's life to save a loved one. While House was of the opinion that it depended on the prognosis of the latter, Cameron replied that she couldn't do it. He, in turn, immediately assumed that she had "found religion" to which she asked him if one had to be religious in order to believe a fetus is a life.</li>
<li>Cameron is the only regular character that hasn't been in every episode of the show to date. She was missing primarily in "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babies_%26_Bathwater_e89f.html" title="Babies &amp; Bathwater">Babies &amp; Bathwater</a>," stemming from her resignation from the hospital.</li>
<li>She is the only member of House's department thus far to meet his parents, John and Blythe, when they stopped by to see him. They later invited her to come along for a drink with them but she declined. House would later thank Cameron for doing so, and then went on to compare her to his father whom he has issues with saying they both possessed an "insane moral compass" and that it was a "crappy quality for a dad." (cf. "<a href="../../../d/a/d/Daddy%27s_Boy_%28House_episode%29_46bc.html" title="Daddy's Boy (House episode)">Daddy's Boy</a>"). Interestingly, Cameron is also the only member of House's department who has not had a parent meet House.
