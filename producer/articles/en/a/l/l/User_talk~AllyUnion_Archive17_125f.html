<p>This bot is adding the inactive template to projects which already have it, simply because they are still categorised in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProjects_7fef.html" title="Category:WikiProjects">Category:WikiProjects</a>, due to a prior consensus that they should be dual categorised so as to make them more readily viewable.

<dd>You do realize that keeping them in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProjects_7fef.html" title="Category:WikiProjects">Category:WikiProjects</a> means that the bot has to traverse additional pages it doesn't need to?

<dd>I'm not arguing the rights and wrongs of that consensus, I wasn't even party to the consensus, I'm just pointing it out. People felt it wasn't unnecessary clutter, but that the projects were more readily viewable and likely to be restarted if they were dual categorised, and that it would prevent creating duplicate projects. I'm not sure people were aware of the bot at that time, perhaps the bot hadn't been set up for that task back then. Maybe if the bot was set up to check if they were already labelled with template:inactive, that would solve the problem? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 09:36, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I've started going through the list of admins to see if the active/inactive can be updated and wound up noticing instead who is and who is not using edit summaries (cause it sort of sticks out). Just to let you know, you're use of summaries is practically not there (though you are commenting on User pages a lot where it feels less necessary). Anyhow, just a thought on contributions. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:18, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you're obviously very active! As I said, I started out thinking I'd update the semi-active and inactive lists and got diverted toward edit summaries. My thinking is that edit summaries are becoming more of an important criterion on RfA and if we are going to evaluate potential admins on this basis it's only fair to expect it of established admins. Of course, I'm only at A on the main list and probably won't have the energy to make it through 600... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:57, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AllyUnion. Please can you stop adding more articles to the list on the AfD. Why not just say "all articles about individual cricket matches"? As it is, the page is going to become unnecessarily massive. If you want a comprehensive list, could you not place it there, where it is causing ridiculous numbers of changes to my watchlist.

<p>On the same topic, can I ask why in the world you felt the need to renominate these articles, when this has been discussed before? Even if the topic is worth discussing again, at least do it properly, not stating that all the articles are merely short stub paragraphs, and then including in the list not only short paragraphs on minor games, but long descriptions of some of the most memorable Test Matches of recent times. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> <a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">(talk)</a> 16:18, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, I randomed one stubbish cricket article, and I thought, wow, why is this here? It had no AFD record, and I don't particular take part in AFD anymore, so how should I've known there was a prior discussion? Then I found the whole large category of them. And I saw that many of them were just like the first one I randomed. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:38, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for writing the bot and merging the content. There's one little problem, though - the reason why the articles were transcluded in the first place was because the content appeared on four pages, not one. As a result, the three other pages have now been turned into, effectively, a MASSIVE page with the content on 8-30 April repeated about fifty-odd times. So don't click <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frizzell_County_Championship_Division_One_in_2005_6c80.html" title="Frizzell County Championship Division One in 2005">Frizzell_County_Championship_Division_One_in_2005</a>, since it'll just hang there forever. So I've really got two options: Reconstruct the pages from the list of subarticles under each tournament's page - or ask you kindly to revert the changes, so that I can merge in the content using subst, and then run the bot again (without the merge of 8-30 April). Your call. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 14:59, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><s>What the hell is wrong with you? why did you block me again? Unless you are a total idiot (which I don't think you are) you should know that blocking my bot would block me as well, I have explained what is going on, and am in discussion with Noisy. Blocking isnt a "punishment" for when you unilaterally think someone has done something wrong, you are treating me like a vandal. You had absolutely no reason to block me again, I had not reactivated my bot, not that I wasnt within my rights to. I am really shocked at your behaviour.

<p>Hhhmm, on closer inspection you only blocked my bot once (well twice, but a few minutes apart), Nandesuka blocked it later, but the autoblock message when I tried to edit a page definately said it was you that blocked me, must be page caching or something.

<dd>Ok someone else has unblocked it now.

<p>The border disputes between Poland and Lithunia were one of a very small number of issues that were explicitly excluded from the Entente Treaty. (i.e. Lithuania retained the authority to have its own policy on this issue rather than having a shared policy with the other countries). Whilst these were a failure of the Entente in a technical sense (if the Baltics had a true single defence policy then they would have a single voice on this issue too) it is not the reason why they failed to retain their independence from Germany and the Soviets (which was the ultimate aim of the Entente).</p>

<dd>Admittedly this is "dates" instead of "years", but that's splitting hairs. I'm definitely opposed to making it 1-14 June 2005 English cricket season - that's patently nonsensical, since a season lasts much longer than 14 days. I think the current name signifies that the the 1-14 June pages are extensions of the 2005 English cricket season page in itself, which is just a short season wrap-up for people who need that.

<p>Quick suggestion - when your bot closes the daily Articles_for_Deletion/Log page, could you also have it update the date at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion</a>?

<dd>Well, there's a lag between those the two events.

<dd>The new day link is added 7-8 minutes before midnight of UTC. The log itself is closed around 1 minute after midnight of UTC. Are you telling me that for whatever reason, when you click that link past 00:00 UTC, that it still a day behind? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 21:39, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Next time it happens, I'll write down the times. I believe that yes, I was past 00:00 UTC and still was directed to the old page - as I recall, each time it happened, the new day's log already had 10+ entries on it. It seems odd that I'd hit that 8-9 minute window twice in three days, but I guess it's possible. Thanks. | Keithlaw 21:42, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings! I hope you're well. Thanks for adminstering the date polls and for your updates. However, I think the current poll is far less functional than its predecessor: the prior poll provided options for users to choose from, hopefully allowing a clear consensus to form or be identified. Instead, the current poll has too many options for voters to choose from, possibly causing confusion and an ambiguous result.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'd like to participate, but the current poll seems very unwieldy and I wanted to inform you of my concerns. Thoughts? In any event, thanks again! E Pluribus Anthony 03:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi AU, note the above user is not referring to anything to do with the previous dispute, but because I subst:'ed a template on a page, which <i>has</i> been agreed on <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">here</a> and has been mentioned on the bots page, he now seems to accept that the subst: is ok.

<dd>For countries/regions with the terms "Republic" or "Islands" in their short name, correct grammar is "Flag of the Czech Republic", not "Flag of Czech Republic". Image names are expected to follow the same naming rules as article, AFAIK, so this grammar mistake should be corrected, and it'll be much easier with a bot. Furthermore, I've managed to upload basically all the national flags in svg format, and those should replace the earlier png versions, so the bot could be put to further use...

Cheers! <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:lightgreen"><i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 19:45, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if you have been paying attention but there has been some discussion on FPC <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_picture_candidates_3c66.html#BrokenSegue.27s_compromise" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured picture candidates">here</a> about deleting the discussion period in favor of the new peer review page (and other misc. changes). I would like your input because I don't know if you would have to modify your bot (we could just comment out the section and it would never bother with it) or perhaps you have somthing to add to the discussion. I 'm waiting for a few more FPC regulars to comments before making the changes . <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 22:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
