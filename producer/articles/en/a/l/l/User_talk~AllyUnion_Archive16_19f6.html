<p>Sorry for my not-so-good english.</p>
<p>Can you set up the SandBot clean up and put text "{{Ole hyvä ja tee muokkauksesi tämän rivin alapuolelle}}" (whitout quotes) to the <a href="../../../../fi/h/i/e/Wikipedia%7EHiekkalaatikko_47d8.html" class="extiw" title="fi:Wikipedia:Hiekkalaatikko">fi:Wikipedia:Hiekkalaatikko</a>?

<dd>I confirm that fi-wiki Sandbox is located at <a href="../../../../fi/h/i/e/Wikipedia%7EHiekkalaatikko_47d8.html" class="extiw" title="fi:Wikipedia:Hiekkalaatikko">fi:Wikipedia:Hiekkalaatikko</a> and it should <i>always</i> include the template {{Ole hyvä ja tee muokkauksesi tämän rivin alapuolelle}} as the first line of the page (currently it also has some extended HTML comments, but those are not really practical since most newcomers don't understand them anyway).</dd>
<dd>The fi-wiki approval process for bots is located in English at <a href="../../../../fi/b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBotit_18e8.html" class="extiw" title="fi:Wikipedia:Botit">fi:Wikipedia:Botit</a> and it's pretty straigthforward. I've already put up a section <a href="../../../../fi/b/o/t/Keskustelu_Wikipediasta%7EBotit_071d.html" class="extiw" title="fi:Keskustelu_Wikipediasta:Botit">on the talk page</a> in Finnish about SandBot where I have outlined that Sandbot will periodically blank the Sandbox and enforce the template header. Now we'll wait for a week and see if anyone objects; if not, then the fi-wiki community approves Sandbot to protect fi-wiki against evil vandals&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkoM_27aa.html" title="User:MikkoM">MikkoM</a> 17:27, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool, thanks, and though some collaboration on bots sounds both fun and useful, and I can certainly think of some interesting things to do with live replication of the database, I don't think I have any need for access right now. I didn't know this existed though, so I'm bound to think up some mad ideas and want access soon. 23:50, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, thanks for the invite. Whenever I can back home, I would have more time to work with everyone on it. At the moment, I'm just getting Cfd out of backlog.

<p>Hi, I was wondering if you would mind stopping by meta and endorsing Whobot. They just put the bot section request back up, due to the bug with not being able to assign admin/bot status. I see some other language sysops signed some requests, thought it might speed it up a bit, as Whobot has been extremely buzy trying to clear the backlog on CFD. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions#en:User:Whobot_.28Whobot.40enwiki.29" class="extiw" title="m:Requests_for_permissions">m:requests for permissions for whobot</a>.

<li><b>24-Hour Valley Kitchen Family Restaurant</b></li>

<li>It is right across Highway 8 from the Town and Country Resort and Convention Center</li>
<li>It is very casual and comes highly recommended by the hotel desk. Entrees are $8-$15. They have a wide menu: They have breakfast all-days, salads, burgers, steaks, echilladas, pies, that sort of place.</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that you have (machine?) translated edit summary messages of Sandbot in finnish. Althought the intention is good, the result is hilarious and total nonsense (see <a href="http://www.engrish.com" class="external free" title="http://www.engrish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.engrish.com</a> and you might get the idea). It would be much clearer in fi if you use only english messages or ask correct translations from someone who knows finnish. <i>Cleaning the sandbox</i> would be in finnish <i>Hiekkalaatikon siivous</i> and <i>Enforcing sandbox header.</i> translates to <i>Hiekkalaatikon otsikon palautus</i>. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarriv_f36c.html" title="User:Harriv">Harriv</a> 11:54, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I see it's a mess. Unfortunately I don't have much time these weeks to deal with such. At first glance, it appears to be a mix of two things... <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">User:SimonP</a> deleted a bunch of articles without closing the VFD noms. And the Pending Deletion Bot deleted some other things a couple months later, which is likely when the Block Compress Bug was fixed.

<p>My Perl isn't that terribly strong when it comes to web forms, nor is my Python. What I want to do is to create a form that would assist in AFD closures... Well, I know the python Wikipedia bot framework has a working delete function... --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:20, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, it's pretty easy to interpret web forms. If you're doing your CGI script in Perl, you get a bunch of name-value pairs, either in $ENV{"QUERY_STRING"} or on STDIN, depending on whether you made the submit method GET or POST, respectively. Then you just need to do whatever wiki edits you need to do, and print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n", followed by the HTML for the result page you want the user to see. The name-value pairs you get as input correspond to the &lt;INPUT&gt; (and similar) tags in the HTML of your form. If you're looking for Perl code that pretends to fill in web forms (like the delete page), comparing the postPage() subroutine of <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPearle_6f07.html" title="User:Pearle">User:Pearle</a> (source is posted on the wiki) to the Wikipedia edit form. The interesting part is what your AFD-assistant form is going to look like. Will it pull in a debate and then have buttons for DELETE, KEEP, NO CONSENSUS, MERGE, REDIRECT, etc.? -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:45, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The edits should be done under your own username, meaning that it would have log in as yourself. The trick of the matter here is that it we'd have to either stick with Perl and implement all the functions we need, or attempt to implement it by piping to python to use the framework. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:07, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What functions do you need? The Perl framework now has functions to upload and download things, and has exception handling, meaning it will not just die if a upload/download operation fails, but rather will try again. It has features for reconciling two different versions (say in case of edit conflict) but I did not try this one. When the perl client uploads/downloads stuff it writes to the disk, but it can be rather easily modified not to do that. Anything else needed? <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 08:25, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's a list of things that I use in the Python wikipedia framework, and by the way, I don't have to install 16 or 20 different modules just to get the Python framework to work: It parses categories for me, it gets a page, it posts a page, it deletes a page, &amp; it parses the page's history for me. Those are principly the functions I use. I'd like to have access to a move page, to protect a page, &amp; to parse the upload history. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:36, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They are not 16-20 modules, rather around 6. It can get a page, post a page. It does not delete a page, or parse page's history. I have my own small function which gets the contents of a category, by parsing the output of wget. One can rather easily make it parse the page hisory I would think. I wouldn't know how to implement deleting a page or protecting a page. So right, the WWWW::MediaWiki package is rather limited, so probably calling Python from Perl via a system call is the way to go. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 09:45, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, AllyUnion. I just wanted to confirm that the NotificationBot is up and running. I've updated the message for <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotificationBot_Mind_Benders_85d8.html" title="User:NotificationBot/Mind Benders">Mind Benders</a> and scheduled the cron for this Wednesday, <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>. On a separate note, since you're such a proficient 'bot programmer, I have an idea for a new bot. Would it be possible for a bot to update the vote tallies in RfAs maybe twice a day? The vote tallies are almost always behind, and a bot could do that work easily. Finally, I'd like to award you the <b>Barnstar of innovation</b> for your wonderful 'bot work. Keep up your great work! <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">W</a><sub><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">S</a></sub> 22:08, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have some questions about the pywikipedia bot which I have been using, you seem to be something of an oracle when it comes to these matters.</p>
<ol>
<li>When using touch.py you need to use an underscore instead of space. Is this a bug or needed (so you can put in extra arguments)?. For example:
<ul>
<li><code>python touch.py -ref:Template:Scotland subdivisions</code> doesn't work, but</li>
<li><code>python touch.py -ref:Template:Scotland_subdivisions</code> does.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When running solve_disambiguation.py, there is a delay while I wait for the program to save my edit to the server. Is there a way for the next entry to be popped up while I'm waiting for the last edit to be sent, I'm on dial-up and it gets quite frustrating waiting.</li>
<li>Back with touch.py. The program waits about 50 seconds (eg: "Sleeping for 55.5 seconds") between edits. Is this time reasonable? I understand that you can't bomb the server with edits, but almost a minute is slower than manual operation. Cheers for the help, --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 16:01, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Python would be reading the parameter, "-ref:Template:Scotland subdivisions" as two parameters passed into the parser. You will need to quote it like: <code>python2.3 touch.py -ref:"Template:Scotland subdivisions"</code></li>
<li>There is, but that would have involve changing the code. The way to properly do this would be to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thread_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Thread (computer science)">thread</a> the code such that it went to save your edit while you got the next page. Unfortunately, I and many others, don't particularly like writing threading code because it's difficult and is a bother to maintain.</li>
<li>The time restriction is set higher for unapproved bots supposely. The throttle exists for people to not be able to circumvent that and that the bots don't create a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial-of-service_attack.html" title="Denial-of-service attack">Denial-of-service attack</a>.
