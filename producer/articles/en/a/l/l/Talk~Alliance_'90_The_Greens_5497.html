</dl>
<p>I still prefer the "more conservative and less liberal political view", because the left-right-axis is still a very strong dimension in German politics. If we name the differences, we should have a closer look at the break-away-process of the Ecological Democratic Party (ÖDP). I'd agree with feminism (and abortion, which I'd see in German politics of the 1980s as a sub-issue of feminism in general), and possibly also gay rights. I don't think marijuana legalization was a topic in the 1980s. All four points could be summarized under the German terms like "liberale Bürgerrechte" or "liberale Gesellschaftspolitik". I tried to summarize them with "less liberal political view", which might lead to misunderstandings. BTW: If we sort the events chronological, the ÖDP break-away should move a bit to the top.</p>
<p>Let's have a look what the political scientist Joachim Raschke is saying about the ÖDP in his standard book about the early greens, <i>Die Grünen, wie sie wurden, was sie sind</i>. He writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"[...] Der rechte Flügel vertrat einen Wertkonservativsmus, der Ökologie als Gattungsfrage verstand und über die gesellschaftspolitischen Grenzen gewissermaßen nicht mehr sprechen wollte (wies dies im bekannten Gruhlschen Diktum ['Die Grünen sind nicht links, nicht rechts, sondern vorn', T.W.] festgehalten ist). Auf dem rechten Flügel bildete die GAZ die 'stärkste organisatorische Säule'. Die GAZ verweigerte ihre Auflösung auch noch nach der Gründung der Grünen und setzte die Grünen von außen mit progammatorischen Forderungen unter Druck. Innerhalb der Grünen hatte sich eine Arbeitsgemeinschaft Ökologischer Politik gebildet, die die Konservativen zusammenschloß. Auf dem Dortmunder Parteitag im Juni 1980 unterlag der konservative Flügel der Mitte-Links-Mehrheit -- wie zuvor schon in Saarbrücken -- und bildete im Juli die Grüne Föderation. Sie war eine Zwischenetappe auf dem Weg zur 1981 gegründeten Ökologisch-Demokratischen Partei (ÖDP), die die bürgerlichen bzw. konservativ-ökologischen Gruppierungen in einer separaten Partei zusammenfaßte." (S. 144f.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To summarize the main point: The Ecological Democratic Party was the result of leftists victories in the Dortmund and Saarbrücken party conventions, which lead the right faction ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Ökologische Politik") to form it's own party. This became the ÖDP. Raschke characterizes thes ÖDP als "bürgerlich" (bourgeoise) and "konservativ-ökologisch" (environmentalist, with conservative values, but not aiming at changing the civil society). -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe"><i>till we</i> <small>☼</small>☽</a> | <a href="../../../t/i/l/User_talk%7ETillwe_233f.html" title="User talk:Tillwe">Talk</a> 08:40, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regardless of how strong the single left-right axis is in German politics in general, the ÖDP is unique because it does not fit into it. On some issues such as the environment and trade, it is as "left" as the Greens, but combines this with issues that are otherwise considered "right". This is not the same as being "to the right". So I removed the "right-wing faction of the party". I also replaced "feminism" with "abortion" since that is where the real difference lies. --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 16:30, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd disagree. This sounds like a ÖDP partisan point of view. So I changed it a bit back (not all). -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe"><i>till we</i> <small>☼</small>☽</a> | <a href="../../../t/i/l/User_talk%7ETillwe_233f.html" title="User talk:Tillwe">Talk</a> 16:10, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We'll get there eventually. Please do not restore "feminism" unless you can cite how the party's platform differs substantially on it (other than abortion). (PS, I'm not a member or supporter.) --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 05:13, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have restored feminism. I do not know if you speak German, but if you do so, have a look at <a href="http://www.oedp.de" class="external free" title="http://www.oedp.de" rel="nofollow">http://www.oedp.de</a> and compare it to <a href="http://www.gruene.de" class="external free" title="http://www.gruene.de" rel="nofollow">http://www.gruene.de</a>. On the ÖDP page, if you browse for political issues and positions, women are only mentioned in relation to family politic and better situation for children. On the green page, you'll find feminism everywere. On the green page, it is a political issue on itself, the Greens have even a position in their board especially responsible for feminism and womens politics, annually womens conferences, and so on. I'm pretty sure that the differences were even bigger in the 1980s. -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe"><i>till we</i> <small>☼</small>☽</a> | <a href="../../../t/i/l/User_talk%7ETillwe_233f.html" title="User talk:Tillwe">Talk</a> 13:22, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The lesser emphasis does not amount to a difference in policy. Please cite a nontrivial contrast in policy in the two parties' platforms. --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 01:15, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, the ÖDP didn't had much chance to show how they would actually do what they are talking about, lacking seats in Länder parliaments or goverments. But even if one only looks at the actual political positions as formulated in the party programmes, the differences are obvious. Feminism doesn't mean: "do not discriminate against women", but it means "do actively something to promote political, social and economical rights of women". If you agree more or less on the later definition, it would be very difficult to find ÖDP positions. If you know otherwise, please cite them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW: I rolled back the changes, on the on hand because of this feminism/abortion issue, on the other hand, because I really think it would be confusing (and BHauck(?) is right about this) to speak in an article about Bündnis 90/Die Grünen in reference to the ÖDP as green party, even if it formally is correct. Even the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_Democratic_Party_1bbb.html" title="Ecological Democratic Party">Ecological Democratic Party</a> article doesn't refer to the ÖDP as green party (and doesn't say anything about them valuing feminism). -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe"><i>till we</i> <small>☼</small>☽</a> | <a href="../../../t/i/l/User_talk%7ETillwe_233f.html" title="User talk:Tillwe">Talk</a> 11:16, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I still don't see any evidence of substansive differences on "feminism" other than abortion. In fact, quite the opposite. It calls for "gerechtere Familienleistungsausgleich" (more just division of work within the family), "Chancengleichheit von Frauen und Männern" (equality of opportunity for women and men), and "Förderung der Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf für Frauen und Männer" (support for the right balance between carreer and family for women and men). <a href="http://www.passau-stadt.oedp.de/passau/zusammenleben.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.passau-stadt.oedp.de/passau/zusammenleben.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (This is the platform of one of the local chapters, but it is representative of the party as a whole.)</p>
<p>And the ÖDP is not a green party? What does the Ö stand for then? Bhuck was not disputing the characterization as a green party, merely objecting to your phrase "the role non-ecological themes should play in the Green party".</p>
<p>Your assertions that the party is "right of the middle" are not convincing. "Sonne statt Atom" (solar energy instead of atomic)? "Ökologisch-soziale Marktwirtschaft" (ecological/social democracy)? These represent the core principles of the party, and most people wouldn't consider them "right wing". --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 15:28, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I interpret the Passau programme different. "Gerechterer Familienlastenausgleich" doesn't mean more just division of work within the family, but more founding for families thru the state. Equal opportunities for women and men -- which party doesn't want this? And the work-life-balance for women and men still is centered on the family. Compare this with the notion in the actual green party programme:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(p. 105) Towards a gender-equitable society</dd>
<dd>ALLIANCE90/THEGREENS are committed to the equal rights of women and men in all spheres of life. Feminism, the women’s movement and the personal commitment of women are essential sources of Alliance/Green politics. The equal participation of women and men in our political work has been a key factor in our political self-definition. Policies on women have been, and still are, a topic that cuts across all subject areas, aiming to make the world women and men live in fit the diversity of their actual situations and interests. This makes policy on women a policy for the whole of society, one which analyses and changes power structures with a view to gender justice. Our policy on women culminates in a new policy on women, men, gender and society. For us, gender justice means a vision of democracy, freedom and human equality that goes well beyond the measure achieved so far. [...] (see: <a href="http://archiv.gruene-partei.de/dokumente/grundsatzprogramm-english.pdf" class="external free" title="http://archiv.gruene-partei.de/dokumente/grundsatzprogramm-english.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://archiv.gruene-partei.de/dokumente/grundsatzprogramm-english.pdf</a> )</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is far more than "better jobs for women and more time with kids for men", rhetorically almost every party today subscribes to. And it was a still greater difference in the 1980s.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>ÖDP as a green party: I don't say ÖDP isn't "a" green party. I only say it is confusing to speak about "green party" in an article about Alliance 90/The Greens meaning ÖDP and The Greens. BHuck commented similiar by changing this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rigth to the middle: Environmental or ecological concers are neither left nor right, so "Sonne statt Atom" doesn't mean ÖDP is left-wing. And ökologisch-soziale Marktwirtschaft is a clear market oriented programme. Of course, the left-right-dimension in politics is something that is not clearly defined. Typical "left" positions could mean left in regard to state instead of market (then the early green were left, the greens today are not), or it could mean left in regard to civil liberties. In the later sense, I'm still convinced that The Greens are left and the ÖDP isn't. But in the article, one thing is: we speak about the 1980s parties, not the parties of today. The other thing is, I'm merely citing an outspoken expert on green politics, that is Raschke (and others would agree, I'm sure).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I reverted your changes, again. But I hope we find a way to solve this peacefully without growing into an edit war! -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe"><i>till we</i> <small>☼</small>☽</a> | <a href="../../../t/i/l/User_talk%7ETillwe_233f.html" title="User talk:Tillwe">Talk</a> 16:05, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Left/right: It depends on your perspective, of course, but I am comparing with the two large parties. Your arguments actually support my assertion that "left/right" is not a valid way to characterize the ÖDP or green politics in general.</p>
<p>"Feminism": I don't dispute a difference in emphasis, but this is still not a substantial difference in policy.</p>
<p>I think your shortening is probably the right solution, but the "right wing" that is left still needs balance, so I removed it too.</p>
<p>Please do not simply revert changes; suggest alternate solutions instead. --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 17:05, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "left/right" business is too complicated to mention in half a sentence; it should remain in the ÖDP article. --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 02:47, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I removed this:</p>
<p><i>They also tended to identify more closely with a culture of protest, such as the demonstrations against the Pershing missile deployment, against nuclear power, or against the construction of a new runway "Startbahn West" at Frankfurt airport, where their members frequently clashed with police forces</i></p>
<p>Please read the ÖDP party platform. The two parties are essentially the same in their opposition to nuclear power and environmental issues such as noise and air pollution, and many ÖDP members have taken part in protests. --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 16:57, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree the ÖDP is against nuclear power and noise pollution. The extent to which ÖDP members have been involved in protests is somewhat dependent on the character of those protests, and this gets to the cultural point I am trying to address. The Greens in the 1980's (yes, obviously, twenty years later, things have changed, as the Greens have become more part of the "establishment") were often engaged in overt conflict with the police, for example, while ÖDP "protests" tended to be much more "polite" and respectful of authority. Did ÖDP members chain themselves to rails to stop transports to Gorleben? Did they get arrested for cutting through fences surrounding military installations? This is an important cultural difference for the historical period under discussion, which I think we should adress in some way. I will try to think of a different way to phrase this.</p>
<p>Also, though, while I'm sure some Greens in the 1980's favored unrestricted immigration, I doubt this was what Green party members like Otto Schily were working for. Your phrasing regarding the position of gay and lesbian rights also underplays the differences or rather hides the fact that this was not at all a priority for the ÖDP. <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuck_37fe.html" title="User:Bhuck">Bhuck</a><a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuck_37fe.html" title="User:Bhuck">Bhuck</a> 14:25, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding protests, I don't know. Your latest changes are not unreasonable, but this is more how a Green Party member would characterize the split than an ÖDP member. I have left them but made a change in the ÖDP article. --<a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErauch_b839.html" title="User:Erauch">Erauch</a> 00:34, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>PAGE NOT MOVED -- as there was no <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> for the move</b> per discussion below. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I thought I post a question first. It is unusual for names to be literally translated from the original version to English. I send an email and asked the German Greens about their name in English, they wrote back and said they call themselves in English "German Green Party" and not some literal translation such as "Alliance '90/The Greens". I think it would be best to move it to that name in that case, see also <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_Green_Party_3b31.html" title="Austrian Green Party">Austrian Green Party</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Social_Union_of_Bavaria_236f.html" title="Christian Social Union of Bavaria">Christian Social Union of Bavaria</a> for a similar cases. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 14:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd prefer having the article under their german name with redirect from "German Green Party" and possibly without a redirect from the actual literal translation. --Schizoschaf 15:18, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can either post the email they send where it states that the party calls itself "German Green Party" or post it here. I am in favour of moving to the correct name instead of some translation which is not even official. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 17:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think not including Alliance '90 distorts the history of the party. Furthermore official press releases of the party like <a href="http://www.gruene.de/cms/archiv/dok/10/10873.alliance_90the_greens_declaration_on_the.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gruene.de/cms/archiv/dok/10/10873.alliance_90the_greens_declaration_on_the.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> uses "ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS". As does their site's <a href="http://www.gruene.de/cms/default/dok/145/145642.english_info.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gruene.de/cms/default/dok/145/145642.english_info.htm" rel="nofollow">English section</a> and the translated version of their political program. So I oppose the move. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 17:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Sorry, I can't see any english information on the first link on the official homepage from Bündnis 90/Die Grünen. Shouldn't we change it to the European party? --<a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeissmann_b8f2.html" title="User:Weissmann">Weissmann</a> 03:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you look at</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales</a></p>
<p>you will see that party was formed some six years prior to the German Green Party, so it is factually incorrect to say that the German greens are the oldest Green party.</p>
