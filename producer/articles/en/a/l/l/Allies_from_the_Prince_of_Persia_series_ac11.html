<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_from_the_Prince_of_Persia_series_ac11.html" title="Edit section: Farah in The Sands of Time">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Farah in <i>The Sands of Time</i></span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Prince_of_Persia%7E_The_Sands_of_Time_e6f0.html" title="Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time">The Sands of Time</a>, Farah is the beautiful daughter of the Maharaja of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. After her father's kingdom had been attacked by King Sharaman of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> she is kidnapped by one of the Persian invaders and is kept as a slave. She is also one of few survivors who were not changed when the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sands_of_Time_0554.html" title="Sands of Time">Sands of Time</a> were released. This is mainly because of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medallion_%28Prince_of_Persia%29_7ee1.html" title="Medallion (Prince of Persia)">medallion</a> she is wearing. She initially detests the Prince for not only capturing her and her kingdom, but also for being responsible for unleashing the Sands of Time. Yet, they are forced to work together to undo the Prince's mistake and ensure that the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemies_from_the_Prince_of_Persia_series_32b9.html#The_Vizier" title="Enemies from the Prince of Persia series">Vizier</a> does not use the Sands of Time for evil. Over the course of the game, as Farah and the Prince cooperate, they become very close to each other, yet neither of them dares to speak the love they feel for each other. The tension that exists between the two ultimately culminates into a romance. Farah is angry when the Prince hesistates to undo the Sands of Time at the last moment, where he questions her trust and loyalty. Their brief conversation gives the Vizier time to blow them into a tomb.</p>
<p>It is highly hinted upon that the couple had sexual intercourse, but due to the fact that the Prince awakens right before they kiss, the gamer is left to assume that the sequence was a mere dream. He awakens upon the top of a tomb (where the two had originally fallen), only to discover that the Dagger of Time is missing, along with his sword. Not only that, but Farah herself has gone missing as well. Protected by the medallion, he chases the young woman throughout the ruins of the Tower of Dawn upon realizing she plans to use the Dagger to fix time herself. Unfortunately, the Prince arrives too late to save Farah from being knocked over the edge of a hole in the floor above the Treasure Vault of the tower. He grabs hold of the blade end of the Dagger in a desperate attempt to save her, but Farah lets go upon seeing the Prince grimacing in pain and bleeding over the dagger. She whispers a single word as she dies, the same word that opened the door to the dream sequence. The Prince is unable to save her from death. Upon defeating the hordes of Sand creatures Farah was originally battling against, the Prince puts the Sands back into the Hourglass. All that has happened becomes forgotten (by all but the Prince) and Farah will have no recollection of their romance, as time will reverse itself to the events prior to the game.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, it is implied that the Prince is telling a story of some sorts to somebody. The introduction cinematic shows him entering someone's room and explaining the concept of time. Lines spoken during the game when the Prince dies ("No, no, no, that didn't happen..." - "No, she didn't die, may I start again?") and when the game is saved ("Shall I start the story from here next time") further suggest the Prince is narrating a story. After the Sands of Time are returned to the Hourglass and the Prince visits Farah in her bedroom, it is revealed that the Prince was telling the story to Farah, and that the tale was actually the events of the entire game that was just played. This was done with the intentions of warning her about the attack and her traitorous adviser, the Vizier.</p>

<p>After the Prince defeats the Vizier, Farah questions why he opted to tell her "such a fantastic story" over the truth that her father's trusted informer would betray them, obviously in disbelief over Prince's tale. He kisses her out of passion, but she is outright offended by his bold move. The Prince, realizing his mistake, rewinds time with the power of the Dagger for one final time and then hands her the mystical weapon. Before he leaves, Farah asks him his name and the Prince simply replies, "Just call me, 'Kokolukia'". He vanishes, leaving Farah in a state of surprise and realization. "Kokolukia" was her secret word that her mother uttered whenever Farah was scared to make her feel safe. At one point in the game, Farah explains the secret word and its significance to the Prince. Thus, his uttering the word in the final cinematic is intended to suggest to Farah that his story must be true. Otherwise, there is no possible way he could have ever heard or even known of the significance of the word before.</p>

<p>Although Farah is delicate and gentle, she helps <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prince_%28Prince_of_Persia%29_7753.html" title="The Prince (Prince of Persia)">the Prince</a> in fighting monsters with her bow. Despite her help she can also sometimes cause trouble by missing and hitting the Prince instead if he gets in her line of fire. There are some humorous lines of dialogue for this. Farah will yell "Sorry!", and later in the game after she offers to cover the Prince as he advances, in an exasperated tone he replies "Please don't. You're liable to hit me."</p>
<p>Due to her thin physique, Farah can also slide through cracks in walls and trigger switches the Prince cannot reach.</p>

<p>Although events chronicled in <i>The Sands of Time</i> never occurred, seven years have passed since we last knew Farah. Over time, she has become a little wiser - and has matured as a person. Farah has been taken to Babylon against her will. Imprisoned by the merciless Vizier who ravaged India, Farah was not simply locked up in a dungeon. Instead, she was placed inside a cage and carted around as one of his "pets", being forced to watch as her city was destroyed while she was rendered completely impotent in the face of such a monstrous act. This guilt eats away at her - and motivates her quest once she inadvertently meets the Prince in Babylon.</p>
<p>Before all of this, she spent her days alternating between the pursuit of knowledge (and has taken an intense interest in politics and history) and honing her battle skills. She continued to favor the bow - considering distance combat far more effective. Graceful and quick, though lacking The Prince's acrobatic prowess, she's more than capable of handling herself. And when overwhelmed, she's often able to escape, thanks to her superior running skills. She also retains the ability to squeeze through even the smallest cracks and remains quick-witted and clever. Having spent years amongst the nasty back-biting nobles of the Indian court, she's learned how to stand up to the cruelest of them. She's fiercely independent and resents any pretense of chivalry, which she views as nothing more than thinly veiled chauvinism. She aimed to prove someday that women have just as much right to political power as men, although it isn't revealed if she feels the same way after the events of The Two Thrones is over.</p>
<p>Farah helps guide the Prince out of the dream world created by the Dark Prince. Telling him to, "<i>stop chasing this shadow, turn away, leave this place</i>". The shadow screams for the Prince to turn back as he ascended a staircase, leading up towards a bright cleansing light. Farah waits on the Prince as he comes to, celebrating that it is all finally over.</p>
<p>As the two look out over Babylon, Farah asks, "<i>Prince, there's still something I don't understand...how did you really know my name?</i>" The Prince smiles, tucking the ever loose strand of hair behind her ear, as he begins to tell her the story that began "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time:" "<i>Most people think time is like a river, that flows swift and sure in one direction, but I have seen the face of time, and I can tell you, they are wrong. Time is an ocean in a storm. You may wonder who I really am and why I say this. Come, and I will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard...</i>" This seems to hint that the whole Sands of Time trilogy is the Prince telling Farah this story at the end of "Two Thrones."</p>

<p>The Old Man has been watching over <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prince_%28Prince_of_Persia%29_7753.html" title="The Prince (Prince of Persia)">The Prince</a> since he was a child. He treated The Prince as his own son, also sometimes acting like his mentor.</p>
<p>He appears only in cutscenes, and appears to be very wise, and he knows a great deal about the Sands of Time and their creation place, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Island_of_Time_27bb.html" title="The Island of Time">The Island of Time</a>.</p>
<p>In the Two Thrones, he gathers the remaining citizens of Babylon to fend off the Vizier's army long enough for the Prince and Farah to enter his castle.</p>

<p>Kaileena and the Prince first meet when Shahdee (for reasons unknown at the time) struggles to kill her. The Prince beats Shahdee and asks Kaileena for information, but she is secretive at first. When she meets him later in the game, she frequently tells the Prince not to continue his journey as she announces that his fate cannot be changed. Although she says this, she helps him throughout the game, giving him swords and knowledge about the castle's towers which are used to open the door to the empress' room. The Prince continues his journey despite her advice against it. When the prince opens the door, it is revealed that Kaileena herself is the Empress. She had sent Shahdee to kill him and even cursed his sword. They fight and she is killed, releasing the sands. When the Prince puts on the mask of the Wraith he is given a second chance to change his fate. By not gaining all the life upgrades, the player is presented with a false ending in which Kaileena is killed yet again. However, by gaining all the life upgrades, the player gets the water sword and the true canonical ending, in which the player must defeat the Dahaka instead, working alongside Kaileena and saving her in the process.But in the next game she was killed by the Vizer.</p>
