<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_B._DuMont_f78b.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>DuMont was born in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. At the age of 10, he was stricken with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio.html" title="Polio">polio</a> and was quarantined at his family's <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Parkway_%28Brooklyn%29_723a.html" title="Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)">Eastern Parkway</a> apartment for nearly a year. During his quarantine, his father brought home books and magazines for the young DuMont to read while bedridden. At this time, DuMont developed an interest in science, specifically wireless <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> communication, and taught himself <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morse_code.html" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>.</p>
<p>His father bought him a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_radio_receiver.html" title="Crystal radio receiver">crystal radio receiver</a> which he assembled, took apart, reassembled and rebuilt several times. He improved his set each time he rebuilt it and later built a transmitter, while his father obtained the landlord's permission to erect a 30-foot high <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transceiver.html" title="Transceiver">transceiving</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antenna_%28electronics%29.html" title="Antenna (electronics)">antenna</a> on the roof.</p>
<p>While recuperating from polio, DuMont was advised to <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming.html" title="Swimming">swim</a> to regain the use of his legs. In 1914, the family moved to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montclair%2C_New_Jersey_be68.html" title="Montclair, New Jersey">Montclair, New Jersey</a>, where there was an indoor year-round pool available at the local <a href="../../../y/m/c/YMCA_8c40.html" title="YMCA">YMCA</a>. He graduated from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montclair_High_School_%28New_Jersey%29_6207.html" title="Montclair High School (New Jersey)">Montclair High School</a> in 1919, and went to <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute_4b45.html" title="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy%2C_New_York_514c.html" title="Troy, New York">Troy, New York</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Radio_operation" id="Radio_operation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_B._DuMont_f78b.html" title="Edit section: Radio operation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Radio operation</span></h3>
<p>In 1915, DuMont became the youngest American to obtain a first class commercial radio operator's license at age 14. The following summer, he worked as a radio operator aboard a coastal steamer making runs from New York to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Providence%2C_Rhode_Island_49f3.html" title="Providence, Rhode Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>. As the summers went by, he made his way to the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> and, after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, where, during the summer of 1922, he was stuck in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> for months because of a dock workers strike.</p>
<p>After graduating from Rensselaer in 1924, DuMont worked at the Westinghouse Lamp Company in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomfield%2C_New_Jersey_a439.html" title="Bloomfield, New Jersey">Bloomfield, New Jersey</a>, in charge of <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_tube.html" title="Vacuum tube">radio tube</a> production. While there, he increased production from 500 tubes per day to an astounding 50,000 tubes per day. Management decided to give him a $500 bonus, a small raise, and the "Westinghouse Award", an award devised to recognize his accomplishments. The "Westinghouse Award" was later presented as a scholarship award to high school seniors showing promise in a field of science.</p>
<p>By 1928, DuMont was searching for new opportunities and was wooed by Dr. <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_De_Forest_5d04.html" title="Lee De Forest">Lee De Forest</a>, a radio pioneer who developed the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audion_tube.html" title="Audion tube">audion tube</a>, the original voice amplifier for radio reception. De Forest had a checkered career as an inventor and had several failed business ventures. DuMont was hired as vice president and production manager for radio tubes. Here he came in contact with a mechanical television, one that De Forest had purchased from <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._Francis_Jenkins_f375.html" title="C. Francis Jenkins">C. Francis Jenkins</a>, another radio pioneer. DuMont worked to improve television transmission and reception and went to De Forest asking for funds to build a long lasting cathode ray tube for television reception. De Forest denied DuMont's request as De Forest's investors were demanding better returns. Subsequently, DuMont resigned at the same time that De Forest sold his radio manufacturing business to David Sarnoff at RCA.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_B._DuMont_f78b.html" title="Edit section: Later projects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later projects</span></h3>
<p>DuMont then started his own company, <a href="../../../d/u/m/DuMont_Laboratories_02a7.html" title="DuMont Laboratories">DuMont Laboratories</a>, in the basement of his <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedar_Grove%2C_New_Jersey_c0c7.html" title="Cedar Grove, New Jersey">Cedar Grove, New Jersey</a> home, building long-lasting cathode ray tubes. In 1931, he sold two tubes to two college science laboratories for $35 each.</p>
<p>In 1932, DuMont proposed a "ship finder" device to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Signal_Corps_e8de.html" title="United States Army Signal Corps">United States Army Signal Corps</a> at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Monmouth_ce7e.html" title="Fort Monmouth">Fort Monmouth</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, that used radio wave distortions to locate objects on a cathode ray tube screen—he had essentially invented <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a>. The military asked him, however, not to take out a patent for developing what they wanted to maintain as a secret, and so he is not often mentioned among those responsible for radar. He did, however, go on to develop long-range precision radar to aid the Allies during WWII. As a consequence the French Government knighted him in 1952.</p>
<p>During the early years of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, DuMont received special government contracts to provide large 36" wide cathode ray tubes. These special tubes allowed scientists working on the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_Project_aaa1.html" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a> to study the action of accelerated electrons.</p>
<p>DuMont produced black and white televisions in the 1940s and 1950s that were generally regarded as offering highest quality and durability. Many of these premium sets included a built in AM/FM radio and record player.</p>
<p>The DuMont Television Network was not an unqualified success, being faced with the major problem of how to make a profit without the benefit of an already established radio network as a base. After ten years, DuMont shuttered the network and sold what remained of his television operations to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kluge_de71.html" title="John Kluge">John Kluge</a> in 1956, which Kluge renamed <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metromedia.html" title="Metromedia">Metromedia</a>. DuMont's partner, Thomas T. Goldsmith, remained on Metromedia's board of directors from this time all the way until Kluge sold the stations to the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Television_Stations_Group_06c9.html" title="Fox Television Stations Group">Fox Television Stations Group</a>.</p>
<p>DuMont sold his manufacturing operations in 1960. The television manufacturing division was sold to <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerson_Radio_35d3.html" title="Emerson Radio">Emerson Radio</a>. His research laboratory became part of Fairchild Camera and later developed <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor.html" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_circuit.html" title="Integrated circuit">microchips</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Noyce_2ee7.html" title="Robert Noyce">Robert Noyce</a>, founder of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a>, originally worked for DuMont as an engineer. In the late 1950s, the Dumont laboratory, now owned by Fairchild, developed the original <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitron.html" title="Trinitron">Trinitron</a> color picture tube, under a subcontract.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_B._DuMont_f78b.html" title="Edit section: Awards and later life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Awards and later life</span></h3>
<p>DuMont was the first to provide funding for educational television broadcasting. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, among them the Cross of Knight awarded by the French Government, the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Alger_Award_4932.html" title="Horatio Alger Award">Horatio Alger Award</a>, the Westinghouse Award, and the DeForest Medal.</p>
<p>DuMont died in 1965 and is buried in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Hebron_Cemetery%2C_Montclair%2C_New_Jersey_ac0c.html" title="Mount Hebron Cemetery, Montclair, New Jersey">Mount Hebron Cemetery</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montclair%2C_New_Jersey_be68.html" title="Montclair, New Jersey">Montclair, New Jersey</a>.
