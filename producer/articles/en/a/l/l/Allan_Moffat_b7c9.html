<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Moffat_b7c9.html" title="Edit section: 1965 to 1971">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1965 to 1971</span></h2>
<p>Moffat first entered the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Touring_Car_Championship_706f.html" title="Australian Touring Car Championship">Australian Touring Car Championship</a> (ATCC) in 1965, driving a <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotus_Cortina_fd6b.html" title="Lotus Cortina">Lotus Cortina</a>. By 1969 he had become a regular competitor and his bright red <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>-sponsored <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Am_Series_fd2f.html" title="Trans-Am Series">Trans-Am</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> was unmistakable at circuits around Australia. He would go on to win 101 ATCC races in this car between 1969 and 1972.</p>
<p>Although Moffat and many other drivers raced Mustangs for ATCC competition - the five ATCC titles from 1965 to 1969 were all won by Mustangs - this car was ineligible for the Bathurst 500 (later changed to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathurst_1000.html" title="Bathurst 1000">Bathurst 1000</a>) which was restricted to Series Production cars, and Moffat made his debut in that race in a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Falcon_59f5.html" title="Ford Falcon">Ford Falcon</a> XW GTHO Phase I in 1969. He and co-driver Alan Hamilton finished 4th.</p>
<p>The following two years would see Moffat come into his own as one of Australia's most dominant race drivers, and the Falcon GTHO as an almost unbeatable car. For 1970, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> had made significant improvements to the Falcon XW GTHO Phase II over the previous year's model and Moffat, racing without a co-driver, took the car to two crushing victories in the 1970 and 1971 Bathurst races. In 1971 he became the first driver to lead the Bathurst 500 from start to finish while driving the famed Ford Falcon XY GTHO Phase III.</p>
<p><a name="1972"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Moffat_b7c9.html" title="Edit section: 1972">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1972</span></h2>
<p>Moffat looked headed for an historic third straight Bathurst victory in 1972 when Ford unveiled plans for a "Phase IV" Falcon GTHO, even faster and more brutal than the Phase III which Moffat had taken to victory in 1971. The Australian press caught wind of these plans, however, and headlines across the country screamed, "160mph Supercars On Our Roads!" Facing pressure from the media and government not to produce this car, as entering it at Bathurst would also require at least 200 units to be sold at dealerships in Australia, Ford scrapped production of the Phase IV and forced Moffat and other Ford drivers to resort to year-old Phase III cars for Bathurst that year. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Brock_efce.html" title="Peter Brock">Peter Brock</a> won the race that year for arch-rival manufacturer <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden.html" title="Holden">Holden</a>, after wet weather and brake dramas hobbled the Fords, and he and Moffat would establish a rivalry of their own in the years to come.</p>
<p><a name="1973_to_1980"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Moffat_b7c9.html" title="Edit section: 1973 to 1980">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1973 to 1980</span></h2>
<p>In 1973, the Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS) changed the rules for ATCC and Bathurst cars to allow racing modifications (prior to 1973, cars had to be showroom-standard and could not be modified). Ford, smarting from the Phase IV controversy the year before, withdrew their factory teams from competition at the end of 1973, and forced Moffat and others to form their own privateer teams, despite having assisted Moffat to victory in both the ATCC title - his first ever - and at Bathurst (with co-driver Ian Geoghegan) that year. Moffat was the first winner of the Bathurst race following its conversion from a 500-mile event to 1000km.</p>
<p>Moffat struggled through the 1974 and 1975 seasons. He failed to finish Bathurst in those years, and was only moderately competitive in ATCC races. In 1975 he drove a <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a> 3.0CSL with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Redman_0544.html" title="Brian Redman">Brian Redman</a> to win the <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebring.html" title="Sebring">Sebring</a> 12-hour.</p>
<p>Although he failed to finish Bathurst again in 1976, Moffat returned to drive his Falcon GT full-time in the ATCC that year and won his second title, despite the setback of a transporter fire which destroyed his race car, with several rounds left to run.</p>
<p>Moffat re-established his dominance in 1977. He won his second consecutive ATCC title that year, the third of his career, but this performance was overshadowed by the crushing 1-2 victory of Moffat and team-mate <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Bond_6063.html" title="Colin Bond">Colin Bond</a> at Bathurst. By the mid-point of the race, Moffat and Bond led by over six laps from the rest of the field. Late in the race, Moffat's car encountered brake problems and had to slow, allowing Bond to catch up for the cars to complete the final lap of the race side-by-side and cross the finish line in tandem, with Bond allowing Moffat to stay barely in front. This moment is remembered as one of the most famous in Australian motor sport history, and still regarded by many as Ford's finest hour. The following year Moffat received an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> in 1978 for exceptional services to motor sport.</p>
<p>Moffat was unable to repeat his 1977 successes over the following three years. He retired from the 1978, 1979 and 1980 Bathurst races (his last in the local Ford product) and did not win the ATCC title in those years as Holden began to gain a manufacturer's edge with their <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torana.html" title="Torana">Torana</a> A9X, which was lighter and more nimble than the heavy Falcons.</p>
<p>In 1980 he competed in various cars and in various countries. He drove a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porsche_934.html" title="Porsche 934">Porsche 934</a> turbo to win the Australian Sports Car Championship. He also drove at the <a href="../../../l/e/m/LeMans_7fe5.html" title="LeMans">LeMans</a> 24-hour race, sharing a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porsche_935.html" title="Porsche 935">Porsche 935</a> turbo with Indycar legend <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Rahal_a674.html" title="Bobby Rahal">Bobby Rahal</a>, where they were forced to withdraw whilst in fourth place. He also did a guest drive for the Marlboro <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden_Dealer_Team_89ab.html" title="Holden Dealer Team">Holden Dealer Team</a> taking 3rd place in the Sandown 400km race. The event was marked by the fact that it was Moffat's second only time in a Holden and that he was driving in the same team as his arch rival Peter Brock.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Moffat_b7c9.html" title="Edit section: 1981 and beyond">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1981 and beyond</span></h2>
<p>Much to the dismay of his mostly Ford-biased fans, Moffat left the "Blue Oval" brand in 1981 to drive a <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Stuyvesant_2e63.html" title="Peter Stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>-sponsored <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazda.html" title="Mazda">Mazda</a> <a href="../../../r/x/-/RX-7_67bc.html" title="RX-7">RX-7</a> as both the ATCC and Bathurst began to exhibit a shift towards lighter touring cars with less raw power. Moffat drove the RX-7 to four consecutive top-six finishes at Bathurst between 1981 and 1984, and won his fourth and final ATCC title in 1983. Moffat also competed at the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona.html" title="Daytona">Daytona</a> 24-hour race in an RX-7, taking a class win in 1982 with co-drivers Lee Mulle and Kathy Rude. That same year he again competed at LeMans in a factory RX-7-based sportscar, achieving taking a class win. In 1985 he took his own RX-7 that he campaigned previously in Australia to Daytona for the 24-hour race, sharing the car with Australian drivers Gregg Hansford, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Bartlett_%28race_driver%29_1197.html" title="Kevin Bartlett (race driver)">Kevin Bartlett</a> and Peter McLeod.</p>
<p>After sitting out the 1985 Australian season Moffat returned to Bathurst for three more years in 1986, 1987 and 1988, the first in a Holden <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden_Commodore_6efa.html" title="Holden Commodore">Commodore</a> with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Brock_efce.html" title="Peter Brock">Peter Brock</a> and the final brace in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Sierra_c50f.html" title="Ford Sierra">Ford Sierras</a> with <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosworth.html" title="Cosworth">Cosworth</a> engines. These cars dominated the ATCC circuits for most of the late 1980s and won Bathurst twice in 1988 and 1989. In 1987, after Peter Brock split with Holden, Moffat purchased the VL commodore that Brock had intended to take to Europe to compete in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Touring_Car_Championship_a338.html" title="World Touring Car Championship">World Touring Car Championship</a>. In the first round of the 1987 WTCC, held in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monza.html" title="Monza">Monza</a>, Italy, Moffat and his co-driver, ex-HDT driver John Harvey, took a surprise opening round win as a result of the leading BMW M3's being disqualified. Later that year Moffat and Harvey drove the same Commodore to 4th place outright and a class win at the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spa_24_Hours_8c30.html" title="Spa 24 Hours">Spa 24-hour</a> race.</p>
<p>Moffat's last race was in 1989 driving with <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klaus_Niedzwiedz_86e4.html" title="Klaus Niedzwiedz">Klaus Niedzwiedz</a>, winning the Fuji 500km race in Japan. He retired from competitive motor racing that year. He has since worked as a TV commentator and a spokesman for BMW and appears at various Ford club events across Australia.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, he received Australian citizenship in a ceremony at the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Grand_Prix_e5ce.html" title="Australian Grand Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> Corporation offices in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. He had been eligible for citizenship since the early 1970s but, in his own words, "one way or another I never followed it through." The citation itself was given by his old friend and sparring partner, the late Peter Brock.</p>
