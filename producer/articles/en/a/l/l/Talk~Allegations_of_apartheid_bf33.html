<li>The article is 49 kilobytes long. This may be longer than is preferable; see article size. (as of this edit)</li>
<li>The section is quite decent in terms of sources and overall structure and could stand alone.</li>
<li>It would be nice to put the appropriate categories on the section such as <a href="../../../c/u/b/Category%7ECuba_3f83.html" title="Category:Cuba">Category:Cuba</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/b/Category%7ECuban_society_4427.html" title="Category:Cuban society">Category:Cuban society</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/u/Category%7ETourism_in_Cuba_0667.html" title="Category:Tourism in Cuba">Category:Tourism_in_Cuba</a>.</li>
<li>It would be appropriate to better integrate it into Cuba-related articles (such as <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism_in_Cuba</a>) since it has more in common with Cuba that it has with apartheid.</li>
<li>Of course a small blurb should stay with a pointer to the main article.</li>

<dd>Thanks for the compliments on that section, which I wrote. In my view, this article isn't all that big yet, and certain sections (that I haven't written) aren't properly sourced, particularly the one on Northern Ireland, so it might get smaller. However, since you've raised the issue, do you think <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> also be "better integrated" into the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> articles, since it has more to do with Israel than with Apartheid? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jayjg, I am all for coherency across articles. Integration, in my vocabulary, does not mean merging -- it means smartly separating content by topic such that one can navigate a domain of knowledge with ease. Thus <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> would take into account that there is significant criticism of the way tourists are kept away from real Cuban life and point people to the appropriate article that deals with it in depth if they are interested. The Tourism apartheid article would show awareness of the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> article with content appropriately distributed. Thus I guess, if you can explain what you mean by "better integrated" in the context of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> article and the rest of the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> articles, I can better respond. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 22:30, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it seems obvious to me that the whole "Israeli Apartheid" thing is really part of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_coverage_of_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_4cba.html" title="Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> or some related propaganda-war article. Regarding a new article, even if one made sense, wouldn't the title have to be something more neutral? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 01:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually think the Cuba apartheid section, which thankfully is just about the best sourced Cuban related piece of work I have come across on first encounter since my time at wikipedia, should have it's own article.</dd>

<ol>
<li>It can be integrated more with the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a> article in the fashion that I believe Bhouston is inferring.</li>
<li>It allows for discussion and work on the specific subject matter of that article only - Cuba is a complicated place, and I have no doubt that some points will need to be addressed and discussed. It's also on my long Cuba to-do list. It would make life easier if it had it's own place.</li>
<li>It can be linked from here with the usual summary style and "See main article".</li>

<p>I think it would be somewhat disproportionate to have a Tourism in Cuba article that is 4/5th about "Tourism apartheid". It is quite long for an entry in this article however so it would be logical to spin it off. As Ben mentions, if we spin off the article we can add it to various Cuba categories where as adding <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa_3d19.html" title="Apartheid outside of South Africa">Apartheid outside of South Africa</a> to, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Category%7ECuba_3f83.html" title="Category:Cuba">Category:Cuba</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Category%7ECuban_society_4427.html" title="Category:Cuban society">Category:Cuban society</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/u/Category%7ETourism_in_Cuba_0667.html" title="Category:Tourism in Cuba">Category:Tourism_in_Cuba</a> wouldn't make much sense.

<dd>The "tourism apartheid" issue does represent a large part of the story about Cuban tourism, though you are correct that at present it would slightly dominate the meagre present page. For now it would be right to seperate from this page it if you feel the section is too large now, leaving a sourced summary here based on Jayjg's research - and I'll take a look at the Tourism page over the next week or so, and try to pad it out with more info. Then it may be an idea to merge the Cuban apartheid and tourism pages together, when there is more equal weight given to other areas. I hope I've made sense?--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 05:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can just shake my head at the torture to which we're putting the term "apartheid" here - I am against apartheid, I am against the way Cuba treats its people and students, but soon everything that involves any separation can be charaterized as apartheid. Corporate apartheid, when executives have their own suite in office buildings, religious apartheid when men and women sit separately in religious services, etc. Seems to me we should focus on the relevant phenomena, rather than trying to label it with an overused term. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Leifern, I respect your opinion, but we should document the debate as it occurs in reliable sources, not reframe it to meet our sensibilities and our own preferred terms (because that would consistute original research.) --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 14:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 14:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fundamental problem is that people can compare any practice - legitimate, warranted, moral, or not - with "apartheid" without worrying too much about the validity of the comparison; then if it gets picked up by popular culture, there is a justification for creating a Wikipedia article about it. In the process, both the actual phenomenon of apartheid and the practices compared with it lose currency and precision. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 21:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have created a neutrally titled, "allegations of" article, which I propose we make the main article, and then scale back the Cuba discussion on this article space. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 18:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, can we change the name of this to <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_apartheid_in_Cuba_abe7.html" title="Tourism apartheid in Cuba">Tourism apartheid in Cuba</a> pronto, the title Allegations of apartheid in Cuba is misleading in the extreme. We're talking about exclusive hotels here, not townships and racial segregation. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 19:01, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still think the content should remain in this article as there are too many spinoffs going on, imo.

<dd>I can accept the "Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba" name, but please keep in mind two things:</dd>
<dd>1) It is not just called tourist apartheid", but also "tourism apartheid" and sometimes "economic apartheid" and even "cuban apartheid", so "Allegations of apartheid in Cuba" was actually more accurate.</dd>
<dd>2) It is far more than just hotels; it is also things like restaurants, beaches and medical services. Please understand what Cubans themselves are saying: <i>The cousin and his friends talked about the places they cannot go, the hotels and beaches, the discos that now require dollars. "It's like South Africa," the cousin's friend said.

<p>I find it strange that the second largest section is about something that doesn't even fit the definition of apartheid given at the beginning. Which racial group is dominating&#160;? The tourists&#160;? I don't think so. Much of what is described as tourist apartheid in Cuba is little different to what happens in many countries - those with money have access to things that those without money don't. It is only really because this goes against the Cuban government's stated socialist principles - and because the US government pours money into propaganda against Cuba - that this has become an issue. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 07:26, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But don't you think that the terms risks becoming so loose as to denature its real meaning&#160;?

<p>I don't believe the actual material on the page is presented in a POV way - the term is in widespread use and thus deserves to be explored. Though there are certainly opportunities here to broaden the viewpoint, including counter-point material and sources that refer to similar cases throughout the Caribbean. One of the problems that I believe Beardo is inferring here, Jayjg, is that many people, including some of the sources in the article have simply a misplaced view of a land they have never visited. That is not our problem of course, we need only report what they say. But special care should be taken at wikipedia on a unique circumstance, users such as Beardo - who probably knows Cuban life and society better than any source given on the page - and certainly more than myself are worth listening to when judging whether a page has POV issues. Though having claimed that there are issues, it is really his role to address them with sources a job that is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Beardo has touched upon some of the fundamental problems with the representation of Cuba on wikipedia. The high US demographic of Wikipedia editors - added to the magnitude of US sources on Cuba - divided by the travel restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba and deliberate misinformation put forth by US governments (this is not a conspiracy theory by the way it is acknowledged by the US government itself) - can create an unbalanced equation which is difficult to rectify.</p>
<p>As I say though, I don't think the material on this page is presented in a POV way. It merely catalogues the usage of a term in a neutral fashion, whether we agree with the term or not. But it would be interesting if the page carried opposing views. That is if they can be found.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 17:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not that I agree with the plight of malaysian women, but that really isn't a type of apartheid. the afrikaner word <i>Apartheid</i> means seperateness. While women are disadvantaged and treated fairly poorly compaired to men, it is not a type of apartheid. Discrimination is a better word.

<li>The phrase "Global Apartheid" is used by some on the left to describe the first-world's policies toward the third-world (which would presumably include South Africa, or at least most of that country). The concept cannot be said to exist "outside of South Africa".</li>

<dd>Apartheid describes a specific set of laws and practices implemented in South Africa. All these other uses describe various kinds of alleged discrimination outside the literal South African experience. Therefore the inclusion makes sense.

<dd>They were perma-stubs, part of a large concept, and, as has been explained long ago, "Sexual apartheid" meant different things, and things not described as "sexual apartheid" were included in there, and, in fact, the entire article was lifted from this very article in the first place. Just because I research and add information to this article, and Homeontherange then copies it to another stub, is not a reason that that stub should exist. If "Sexual apartheid" and "Gender apartheid" should be around, then you might as well have a separate article for every section on this page; why not have a Saudi apartheid article, for example - the information in there is considerably more detailed than the two merged stubs (one of which was all of three sentences). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:20, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why on earth not? Why is a division based on sex or gender more logical than one based on practices of countries?

<p>This article is a grabbag of dissimilar things which have in common only the word "apartheid". It's practical function, therefore, is to hide rather than bring out into the open ie as a semi-hidden desository. This sort of format makes proper use of Cats awkward (what does it mean to have "Apartheid outside of South Africa" listed in the gender category. Why would anyone looking at that category check out this article under this title). The article should be broken up into component parts by theme (eg sexual apartheid, religious apartheid) or by country. Indeed, much of this article is already duplicated at <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_segregation.html" title="Sex segregation">sex segregation</a>. The duplicated parts should be removed from this article and replaced by a link.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I recall, Jay advocated and helped implement the breaking up of this article into component parts and redirection of this article a year or so ago. That he has the opposite position today is curious. Perhaps he can explain why he now thinks he was wrong? 74.98.232.18 14:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Of course critics of the term are going to say things critical of the term, and calling it "poisoning the well" doesn't mean these statements shouldn't be in the article. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 14:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The disputed sentence is quite obviously being used to delegitimize the analogy and its proponents. It might be possible to include a truncated (and less hyperbolic) sentence dealing with the perspective of critics, but leaving the sentence out entirely is equally valid.

<dd>If you're going to use Adam and Moogley as a source, you could add something closer to what they say about who uses the term. But if you start adding individual names, then in fairness we'd have to add names showing who has objected to it (and the ones objecting far outweigh the ones using it, both in numbers and in terms of their academic qualifications), and before you know it, we'll have the article right here.

<dd>Melanie Phillips is being used as a source in a footnote, not being named in the lead. If you want to add Desmond Tutu in a footnote, go ahead. You're trying to talk the allegation up by including Tutu, which in a sense is fair enough, but it means the other POV will have to include named adherents too, and then as I said above, before we know it, we're reproducing the article. Also, Tutu has compared so many things to apartheid, which would arguably need to be mentioned, but again we're into a length problem. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

The cited source only claims that 'The majority is incensed by the very analogy and deplores what it deems its propagandistic goals.' It does not present research or citations substantiating this claim, but just lists two examples. It does not state that criticism stands 'on the grounds that it is historically inaccurate, antisemitic propaganda, and a political epithet used to justify terrorist attacks against Israel'; these remarks are plucked together from a few other sources. <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyus_c4c3.html" title="User:Qwertyus">Qwertyus</a> 03:06, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet another strange revert. Because the section is supposed to be a 'very brief summary', notable proponents of the 'Israeli apartheid' thesis are not to be mentioned, yet the responses of anti-semitism and justification of terrorism remain (even though are hardly informative, since they are commonly used against just about any criticism of Israeli policy). The current 'summary' is a summary of responses, rather than a summary of the use of the terms. <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyus_c4c3.html" title="User:Qwertyus">Qwertyus</a> 15:45, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are experts in this very area of study; perhaps the only experts in the world.

<dd>Experts have to be able to communicate their findings. If they are unable to do this, due to writing on behalf of an academic audience for example, we must look to try to interpret what they are saying. So if Adam and Moodley talk about a majority of academics and journalists who have used the term, they presumably have produced a summary establashing this, I do not know if it has been published, I have not located one at the link provided. But they then go onto list only two examples in support of this "majority" view, and many more examples of the two other <i>minority views</i>. Which I find puzzling. It may be self-evident to them that this is a majority, it does not look so cut and dried to this reader. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 22:06, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>In light of the endless controversy over the brief "Israel" section in this article, and the constant contention over the "main" article <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> (of which this is supposed to be a summary), I wonder whether we really need this section at all. I realize that having a summary such as this is the normal practice, but I have to wonder whether it is worth it in this case. Why have the controversy going on in two places when it can be going on in just one? In fact, why magnify the controversy, as will inevitably occur (and has occurred) in the case of a summary that is only three or four sentences? As an example, there is enough contoversy over what to say about President Carter's book in the article about the book, and I am sure the book is mentioned in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>, so why do we need to have yet <b>another</b> controversy, that is, whether the book is important enough to be mentioned in this brief summary? In this unusual case, wouldn't it be better just to have the cross-reference to the main article?</p>
<p>Recognizing that this proposal is probably contrary to some style guideline somewhere, I am not going to make this change unless there is a real consensus. I am trying to reduce controversy, not multiply it. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:55, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that the summary at present violates NPOV, however any attempt to modify this summary is reverted back to the contentious version. I would support having no summary, just a link to the article in question, in the light of this. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 10:42, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed and done. Why clutter the article with the POV tag and a contentious summary where there is a whole article which better explains the term. --<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 15:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had hoped to get more comments on this, from a variety of viewpoints, but now I guess we will see what happens with it. It would be a sad commentary on Wikipedia if the only way to achieve consensus on a summary is to blank the summary, but that may very well be the case. As I said earlier, this topic is already the source of debate in the main article and several related articles, it does not need to be debated here as well. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 17:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jay uncommented what I had commented out as not supported by the referenced source. I'll re-add the link to <a href="http://www.axt.org.uk/essays/Phillips.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.axt.org.uk/essays/Phillips.htm" rel="nofollow">the article online</a>, but here's the paragraphs I believe people are refering to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a refusal to report the genocidal nature and intensity of the attacks being perpetrated against Israel. Instead, Israel’s attempt to defend itself and stop the terror is represented as a desire for vengeance or punishment—tapping into the ancient prejudice that the Jews are motivated by the doctrine of ‘an eye for an eye’—or sheer malice against the Palestinians.</dd>
<dd>Israel’s behaviour is equated—obscenely—with Nazi Germany or South Africa under apartheid, comparisons grotesquely at variance with the demonstrable facts. And, increasingly, people are saying that Israel should not exist at all, thus denying to the Jewish people alone the right of self-determination. When Israelis are terrorized by mass murder, outrage in Britain is muted on the grounds that ‘they had it coming’. Instead, more sympathy is expressed for the so-called ‘suicide bombers’ who have perpetrated the carnage, on the grounds that they are in ‘despair’ because of the way Israel has treated them. The gross imbalance and unfairness of these views can only be explained by antisemitic prejudice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see how you get from that to "[The phrase] has been ... used to justify terrorist attacks against Israel" without very generous reading between the lines. Of course quote mining won't solve the outstanding POV problem of only presenting the most outlandish critical view here. (Phillips hardly seems very academic here; how can you talk about the British attitude toward terrorism and not mention <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">Ireland</a> even in passing? And I don't see how she can say Palestinian attacks rise to the level of <i>genocide</i>. But I digress.) -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 05:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a very interesting article. If you were to provide the lable of Apartheid to current Australian practices regarding the Aborigines then could you not also equally apply this tag to people who are from other low socio economic areas? The Aborigines receive a greater share of public money compared to the unemployed, migrants and other 'disadvantaged' groups. In reality it seems this article is just a piece of very biased social commentary.
