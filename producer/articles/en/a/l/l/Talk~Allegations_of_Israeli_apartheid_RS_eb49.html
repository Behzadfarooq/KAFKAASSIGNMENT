<li>By sources of which at least some are considered partisan. What I mean with this is that if you allow a partisan souce to debunk things, you should allow those same sources also confirm things. It can not be selective, either they are accaptable, or they are not, but not when it suits.

<li>I am afraid it would be practically impossible to find neutral sources acceptable to both sides in the divisive and emotional Arab-Israeli conflict - and that is another reason not to exacerbate it with propagandistic defamatory namecalling.

<li>Sure, they should have that right, but I think it is not fair to allow that only for one side, and so if we would allow opponents to the term to use partisan sources to counter <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, than we also have to allow proponets to use partisan sources to counter <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I am only asking for symmetry in the arguments. It is easy to eliminate a source that one does not like, and include the sources than one likes, but I think the rules for inclusion/exclusion of sources should be equal to everybody. I am not saying that we can or cannot include sources as you mentioned above (because <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> leaves some space for that, by using clear qualifyers), that is up to the editors, but I do not allow different sets of rules for different sides of the debate. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 01:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Quotes: "South African law professor Prof. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dugard_1217.html" title="John Dugard">John Dugard</a>, the special rapporteur for the United Nations on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, has written in a report to the UN General Assembly that there is 'an apartheid regime' in the territories 'worse than the one that existed in South Africa.'" "Dugard, a law professor from South Africa, was a member of a Truth Commission at the end of the apartheid regime, and was appointed by the UN in 2001 as special rapporteur for human rights in the West Bank and Gaza. He called for a general arms embargo against Israel in May, in response to the IDF operations in Rafah, similar to the arms embargo imposed on South Africa in 1977."</dd>

<dd>Title: Apartheid misses the point</dd>
<dd>Quotes: "The very use of this terminology has become a mark of leftist radicalism, and the angry denial of the validity of such a comparison now testifies to Zionist patriotism. It's unnecessary to add that an objective comparison or a discussion on the feasibility of comparing two such different phenomena is nearly impossible to find, and if anyone dares go into those issues, he is judged by his conclusions: If he finds points of similarity he will be pegged as an anti-Semite, and if he emphasizes the differences, he will be defined as a fascist."
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - this is a great synopsis of the overall situation. I would recommend that we include it in the resulting article. If nothing else, the article can be about why the comparison is so problematic and the various people and discussions that have arose on it. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 05:31, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quotes: "The Israeli worldview ranges between two extreme schools of thought: an apartheid regime in the occupied territories, on the one hand, and the desire of some Israelis for an Israel as "a state of all its citizens," on the other. The policy of apartheid has also infiltrated sovereign Israel, and discriminates daily against Israeli Arabs and other minorities. The struggle against such a fascist viewpoint is the job of every humanist. However, in the long run, neither the policy of apartheid nor the "state of all its citizens" will be possible in a future Israeli society: The first eliminates the democratic component in the definition of the state, the second eliminates the Jewish component."</dd>

<dd>Title: Refusal for the sake of democracy</dd>
<dd>Quotes: "Some argue that refusal to obey military commands for political-ideological reasons undermines the democratic process. It is hard to quarrel with this argument, but I wonder if we would have accepted it in the case of a white South African refusenik during the apartheid era. I tend to think not. I wonder if, in spite of the differences between South African apartheid and our situation, there is not also some similarity. One country inhabited by two populations - one enjoying all rights and protections, while the other is denied basic rights and is controlled by the first. What could be more undemocratic than that? What democracy are we defending when we denounce those who act, according to their ability and understanding, against such injustice? If the duty of a soldier is to protect democracy, maybe it is these defiant pilots who are the ones protecting Israeli democracy."</dd>

<dd>Title: Patriot games</dd>
<dd>Quotes: " "The family prefers Jerusalem to Berlin, and Etkes himself says that the past few years have made him more of a patriot than ever before. "I agree with two slogans of the settlers: `fight for home' and `don't give them a state.' I am here to fight for our home and to save it from becoming an apartheid state." The first time Etkes was offered the job he now holds he was not enthusiastic. Not all of the positions espoused by Peace Now were his cup of tea. For example, he supports refusal to serve in the territories, contrary to the movement's official stance. But when the offer arrived a second time, 18 months ago, he did not hesitate: "I realized that all the theoretical debates among people on the left are irrelevant, that the only way to fight for our home is to go into the field and do battle against the apartheid situation that is being created there."

<dd>The Olmert quote below would be the third -- it seems to be in response to Qureia's threats and others. Olmert puts Qureias threats into a context in that framing the battle as one against apartheid is implicitly directing the end goal towards a binational solution. To me, I find that informative since others, such as B-Tselem, use the term apartheid in reference to just policies within the occupied territories without actually pushing for a binational solution. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 14:37, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is, of course, a much cleaner struggle, a much more popular struggle - and ultimately a much more powerful one. For us, it would mean the end of the Jewish state.'"</dd>

<dd>Title: "Abusing 'Apartheid' for the Palestinian Cause"</dd>
<dd>Author: Gerald M. Steinberg (Op-Ed, August 24, 2004)</dd>
<dd>Quotes: <i>"Although the comparison between Israel and the apartheid regime that ruled South Africa is entirely fictitious, the demonization efforts are propelled by repeating and reinforcing this analogy. The attempt to label Israel as an illegitimate "apartheid state" is the embodiment of the new anti-Semitism that seeks to deny the Jewish people the right of equality and self-determination among the nations.<br />
The South African strategy is not simply based on rhetoric, academic boycott calls, and waving placards at Israel-bashing demonstrations so common in Europe and elsewhere. There is a vast network of powerful non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty, Christian Aid, and their Palestinian and Israel Arab allies, that are the main channels for spreading the big lies of "war crimes" and "apartheid." Similarly, the repetition of the rhetoric of demonization by Palestinian and Arab officials in the media helps to propel this strategy."</i></dd>

<li>Falah, G. W. 2003. Dynamics and patterns of the shrinking of Arab lands in Palestine. Political Geography 22:179-209.
<dl>
<dd><b>Abstract</b>: This paper seeks to sketch a number of geographical patterns pertaining to the ongoing process of confiscation of Palestinian-Arab land in Israel and the 1967 occupied territories. It points out a geographical pattern and process of "enclaving" and "exclaving", a form of spatial apartheid and exclusionary zoning which was adopted during the pre-state period of Jewish settlement and has continued down to the present day. The centrality of land possession and its transfer to Jewish national and state ownership is shared by almost all political classes in Israel. Even during key points in peace negotiations over the past several years, land confiscation never ceased nor was interrupted. The present paper employs the term "shrinking" to underscore that land confiscation is a continuous process in Palestine/Israel. This of course has both political and social ramifications for the type of state Israel seeks to be, declaring its desire to live in peace and harmony with its own Palestinian citizens and Palestinians elsewhere once a peace deal has been reached. Seen from the perspective of land, its control and use, this paper argues that there is no other alternative in achieving peaceful resolution between Jews in Israel and Palestinians except a return to square one: redefining a new geography for Palestinian villages and towns in Israel and for those many hundreds of villages which were demolished and have since been obliterated.

<dl>
<dd><b>Abstract</b>: The Palestinian state remains an internationally endorsed project, yet an increasingly difficult one to implement. By analyzing the territorial, legal, and demographic developments that took place in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip over the past ten years, this article assesses the extent to which the prospective Palestinian state has become unattainable. A comparison between the South African apartheid experience and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is made to shed light on the ways in which the Palestinian territories are becoming analogous to Bantustans. While historical comparisons are never exact or prescriptive, they raise interesting parallels whose implications need to be considered, if not altered, in any attempt to materialize the project of viable Palestinian independence.

<dl>
<dd><b>Abstract</b>: This article subjects to normative-theoretical scrutiny the common claim that Israeli Zionism is 'like' South African apartheid. Drawing on a range of historical and sociological evidence, it shows that this claim (or accusation) is substantially justified in two senses. Firstly, Israeli Zionism is, in many areas, morally bad in the same way as apartheid; secondly, where it is different from apartheid in character, it is in some respects anyway as bad - that is, the difference is not invariably morally favourable to Israeli Zionism. 'Israel proper' (within its pre-1967 borders) is neither much like nor as bad as apartheid. The justification of the analogy only becomes clear when we view Israel and its occupied territories as a single political entity. The article argues that we are justified in so viewing them.

Elle prend cependant différentes formes. L’usage radical et systématique de l’analogie vise à condamner l’Etat d’Israël et le sionisme dans leur nature même. Cette approche infondée est aisément réfutable par l’analyse comparée des deux systèmes politiques et sociaux, y compris la discrimination des Arabes israéliens par rapport à celle des non Blancs en Afrique du Sud de l’apartheid. L’usage conjoncturel à visée critique ou constructive de l’analogie s’applique quant à elle exclusivement au traitement des Territoires occupés par Israël et fait référence à la politique du «&#160;grand apartheid&#160;» et ses bantoustans. Bien que s’appuyant sur quelques éléments communs, cet usage de l’analogie ne résiste pas à une analyse technique et contextualisée des ingénieries territoriales et politiques. Là où le «&#160;grand apartheid&#160;» relevait d’un système politico-territorial profondément raciste mais de nature postcoloniale, la politique israélienne vis-à-vis des Territoires occupés et plus généralement le sionisme contemporain, apparaissent comme un nationalisme de pratique coloniale, au sens étroit du terme (primat de l’appropriation foncière et de l’annexion sur les autres formes de domination). Les perspectives de résolution du conflit font également l’objet d’approches comparatives qui s’intéressent à l’expérience sud-africaine. Là aussi l’analogie entre les deux situations offre peu de points communs sur lesquels s’appuyer pour concevoir les modalités d’un compromis géopolitique et d’une réconciliation. En revanche, le rapport renouvelé au territoire et à la souveraineté, esquissé à Genève, relève d’un post-sionisme territorial qui semble porteur de solutions. fredpays Fredpays 12:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC) fredpays</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Abstract</b>: The authors ground their reflections on gender and the complex realities of the second Palestinian intifada against Israeli occupation in the political processes unleashed by the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian rule, noting that the profound inequalities between Israel and Palestine during the interim period produced inequalities among Palestinians. The apartheid logic of the Oslo period - made explicit in Israel's policies of separation, seige and confinement of the Palestinian population during the intifada and before it - is shown to shape the forms, sites and levels of resistance which are highly restricted by gender and age. In addition, the authors argue that the Palestinian Authority and leadership have solved the contradictions and crisis of Palestinian nationalism in this period through a form of rule that the authors term 'authoritarian populism', that tends to disallow democractic politics and participation. The seeming absence of women and civil society from the highly unequal and violent confrontations is contrasted with the first Palestinian intifada (1987-91), that occurred in a context of more than a decade of democratic activism and the growth of mass-based organizations, including the Palestinian women's movement. The authors explore three linked crises in gender roles emerging from the conditions of the second intifada: a crisis in masculinity, a crisis in paternity and a crisis in maternity.

<dd><b>Abstract</b>: Investigates the conditions under which the Palestinian-Arab minority lives in the Jewish State. It concludes that discrimination against this minority is political, legal, social, and economic. In the process and over the years, the Palestinians of Israel have become not only stateless but in most cases landless refugees in their own homes. Similarities between Israel's discriminatory practices against its Arab minority and of South Africa against its Black population are many and have been recognized by many countries as well as by the United Nations.

<li>Quotes: (1) "I would like to warn against an unthinking use of this misleading analogy between Israeli policy and that of the defunct apartheid regime in South Africa. It is theoretically false and politically harmful. To be sure, the two have many features in common. Both are perniciously racist; both impose a degree of separation between ethnic groups. [...] But the point is that they belong to two distinct species of the genus. [...]The decisive difference between the two species was what was to become of the dispossessed natives." (2) "And make no mistake: this is not going to be like a Bantustan, more like a series of Indian Reservations. Conflating this with apartheid in fact misses the most essential point. Incidentally, it can also backfire: defenders of Zionism can easily show that the Palestinian citizens of Israel, while not enjoying equal rights, are nevertheless considerably better off than Black Africans used to be under apartheid." (3) "But, much more importantly: talk of Israeli 'apartheid' serves to divert attention from much greater dangers. For, as far as most Palestinians are concerned, the Zionist policy is far worse than apartheid. Apartheid can be reversed. Ethnic cleansing is immeasurably harder to reverse; at least not in the short or medium term."</li>

This is a place which is under military occupation (which hopefully would end) but we already have many articles about the occupation and the territories, no need for a new one. Israel never annexed any parts of the territories (excpet Jerusalem where Palestinians are either residents or citizens and can drive where they want on every road) so don't confuse between an area under military occupation to an apartheid which is something that inherntly decribe what is inside a specific country. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 05:52, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <u>if we look at Tutu's own words</u> we see that he continually use the phrase <b>"The apartheid government"</b> which point out that even in the eyeys of Tutu, the <b>apartheid government that ruled South Africa</b> is <u>unique</u> other wise he would call the Israeli government by the title apartheid (which he clearly reserve for use in this article only to South Africa).</li>
<li>It seems that it is the guardian editor (and not Tutu himself) who gave the article by Tutu the catchy headline "Israeli apartheid" – Tutu himself indeed compare the suffering of Palestinians in west bank checkpoints to the suffering of blacks in south Africa and I can understand his sympathy to their situation, however in the west bank there is military rule and no one deny the need for that area to be free of occupation. Being an occupier force in the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_territories.html" title="Palestinian territories">Palestinian territories</a> (which Israel is and hopefully stop being such an occupier) does not make it "an apartheid state"</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is a word in Hebrew that is used for "racial segregation" it is "Hafrda Bein Gizi'it" all the other uses of "Hafrada" are "speration", "demarkation" "spliting and distancing from one another (one at each side") etc...</dd>
</dl>

<p>The athorative Hebrew dictionery (Eben Shoshan) sais:</p>
<p>Hafrada&#160;: distancing one thing from another such as seprating between church and state, speration between husband and wife who end their marrige. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 06:44, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to eliminate references which don't say or quote anyone saying that there is such a thing as Israeli Apartheid. We've put in a lot of hard work, but let's not flood the page.Timothy Usher 04:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Timothy, I think you need to create a heading for <b>"sources using the word Israeli apartheid without offering any scholarly proof"</b> <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 05:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zeq, I haven't gone through them all - and won't be able to tonight - but it's starting to look like that would make an excellent title for this entire page. What is really needed here is for a reliable source to treat Israeli apartheid as fact, not quoting an unreliable source as using the phrase. It is a common point of invective, so there are <i>apprearances</i> in reliable sources reporting on such invective, but that's not enough. The reliable sources are careful to keep their distance from these charges.Timothy Usher 05:30, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition to sticking to reliable sources, we must be careful to watch out for the usage of the exact term "Israeli apartheid" rather than a mere usage of the words "Israel" and "apartheid" in the same piece of writing.

<dd>I do not necessarily agree that only mentions of the phrase "Israeli aparthied" is allowable. I currently favor transforming the existing article into one that tries to classify and discuss and put into context the various types of allegations of apartheid in Israel. I made this comment below. It really does seem that many motives are unnecessarily conflated together and that is why it is, as a single monolithic subject, so difficult to find any consensus. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 15:55, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Timothy, you're being pedantic. The exact phrase "Israeli apartheid" isn't a prerequisite, what is necessary is the idea that either there is an "apartheid" in Israel or that Israel may develop a form of apartheid. As long as the word "apartheid" is used, or there is a direct reference to South Africa prior to 1991, it doesn't matter if the source says "Israeli apartheid". "apartheid Israel". "apartheid state" (in relation to Israel) or some other variation. Of course, if you insist on pedantism we can just rename the article Apartheid (Israel).Homey 17:35, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"...what is necessary is the idea that either there is an "apartheid" in Israel or that Israel may develop a form of apartheid."</dd>

<p>So maybe the article should be titled, "Israeli apartheid (idea)"? Perhaps with a daughter article "Potential Israeli apartheid"? Such titles aptly sum up the problems inherent to this article.Timothy Usher 03:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Does one agree that the jewish people desrve to have a state&#160;?</li>

<dd>From my recent readings it seems there are multiple uses of the allegations of apartheid. In some cases there is overlap with Zinoism is racism and some of it also falls into advocating for a <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binational_solution.html" title="Binational solution">binational solution</a>. Other cases apply it to the humanitarian situation just within the occupied Territories. The claim has also been made by at least one professor who specialize in international law. I am unfortunately going to be busy for the rest of the week. I've backed up the current contents of this article so feel free to go nuts on whatever direction you want to go. I should say that I actually think some middle ground is possible. I am leaning towards an article entitled "Allegations of Apartheid in Israeli" which classifies and discusses the various ways the allegation is used, by whom and for what purposes and it would include criticism of each use by the appropriate parties. I think it would be very informative since it would help clears up what are currently many conflated motives, etc. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 15:21, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
