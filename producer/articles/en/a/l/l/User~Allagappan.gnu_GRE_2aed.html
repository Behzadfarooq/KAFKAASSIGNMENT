<p>This had to start somewhere sometime.So here it begins.. Disclaimer: We would be giving valuable tips and guidelines for MS aspirants.These are based on our experience or rather..the inexperience in the process of applying for MS.Some of the fundaes may be unpalatable to the junta,So bear with us. If you believe you have come to NITT for the purpose of getting a job, donot read further as it might not suit your interests. If you believe that you are writing GRE just because others are writing,you may also close this window. This series is mainly intended to give an eyeopener for the GRE/TOEFL tests and the application procedure which ensues. It is very disappointing to see that NITT which boasts of being second only to the IITs has very few junta serious about pursuing higher studies in general, MS in particular. So we hope to infuse enthusiasm amongst the junta by shedding some light on the entire process right from booking your GRE dates to I-20. To begin with we give you some useful links.</p>

cont. from part I</p>
<p>The entire process is irritating not merely because of the work involved but also because it is only at the end of the process that we seem to have a much better grasp of the entire procedure. In one sense the irritating nature of the process is because it’s composed of several small steps unlike say, the CAT or GATE in which the written test dominates. Couple this with the fact that the money involved is much greater simply because our currency’s exchange rate when compared to that of the dollar is huge.</p>
<p>In the ensuing posts we will try to enumerate certain factors guys should bear in mind when the application process starts. This is not a general guide but our own views over the entire process.</p>
<p>Lets start where it should start&#160;: THE GRE.</p>
<p>When we went to write the examination, it seemed to us that this was THE step in the entire procedure. Students go into the exam thinking a good score in the exam often is sufficient to obtain an admit from a good university. We would say that this is necessarily not the case; quite frankly often it is to the contrary. A good GRE score definitely helps but it has to be balanced by good academic records and other requisite materials. A lack of a competitive score (especially in the verbal section) can be offset by projecting other components of your application packet.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the difficulty level of the exam has increased in the last year or so. The quantitative part used to be a cakewalk previously but the standard has definitely increased. We would not say its tough but if anything it is far more challenging. This is by far the most important section and a competitive score is essential. The verbal section of the exam is pretty difficult and quite honestly you have to hope lady luck shines on you. Of late words have not been confined to the Barons word list and so you just have to hope that the first few questions atleast are from possible sources of knowledge.</p>

<p>Hi Sudharshan,</p>
<p>Hope you don't mind me adding some personal points to your great description of the GRE.</p>
<p>Well, people do have a lot of doubts about the preparation part. Though the quants part has been said to be tough, any guy who has qualified through the pre-engg entrance exams can get an 800 in them with little practice. You only have to refresh your basics, and do some GRE model papers.</p>
<p>And about the verbal part, i better share my experience. My verbal score was not as high as my third Reading Comprehension went very bad. I got 3 out of 4 questions wrong. And as far as i have discussed with friends, the Reading Comprehension is the toughest part in the Verbal section of the GRE. Anyway, u do have to be thorough with your word lists in the first place. But doing well will definitely require a lot of luck as Sudharshan said, and a lot of practice too(much more than that for the quants section). You have to do the whole of Barrons before you proceed to any other book, and the most recommended book after Barrons(according to me) would be the BIG BOOK published by ETS. It will definitely give you a lot of much-needed practice.</p>

Quantitative section is the most important section for engineers. High scores are a must in this section (&gt;760 is a very good score, 740 might sometimes deny you a chance in most of the top colleges).It is needless to say, coming to NIT is itself an indicator of good aptitude. So it should be possible for us to crack this section.The googly comes in the form of data interpretation questions which require good concentration (while seeking the answers from the graph) more than anything else. Rest assured the quants section should be a cake walk for Nittians.</p>
<p>If you are aiming for a top university , an overall high GRE score is a must. It is difficult to define what a “high” score is but 1450 with a split of 780 + 670 is just about ideal.</p>
<p>The time required for preparation is really up to a person but 3 months is an average estimate. Beyond a certain point the wordlists stagnate and it is just a question of tests. We would advise you to undertake as many tests as you can (even if it means you haven’t finished the wordlists completely)</p>
<p>As we said at the outset improving your vocabulary ideally should not be confined to the wordlists (Barons) alone. It is vital to remember that your long-term vocabulary is what often bails you out. So start building your vocabulary in earnest. Books such as “Word power made easy” and “All about words” will certainly help you to widen your vocabulary base. A significant means of developing your vocabulary is by studying the roots of the words. We realise that this is often tedious but it is an immense source of confidence.</p>

<p>This is one query which all serious candidates will face.</p>
<p>Is there an easy method to remember the wordlists?</p>
<p>I once started with the wordlists but lost my enthu because each of them seemed to be an uphill task. Then I felt either there should be an easy way out or they are not as important for GRE as we feel.</p>
<p>And can anyone tell why ETS keeps such a high emphasis on mugging words when even they know people will neve use most of those words in real life?</p>
<p>Just pushing the discussion further...</p>

<p>PostPosted: Mon Mar 28, 2005 1:33 pm Post subject: A good question Anna Reply with quote Dear Arpit, Good question.Actually the only easy and logical way to "learn" the word lists is to do what the ancestors say- "Go to the roots". Yes the only answer to atleast guess the most appropriate meaning of a word is to know its roots. As you would probably know, almost all of the English words have their origins in other languages.So try to get hold of as many roots as possible.A thorough reading of books like All about words and Wordpower made easy should do it. So go latin,Greek,french and even sanskrit. There is yet another way of learning things..by relating the words to stuff which you would have already known.For eg. suppose you encounter a word, say, ebullient. Go back to your physical chemistry where we have learnt something known as "Ebullioscopic constant" related to boiling points of liquids.Thus the word ebullio refers to something which bubbly(boiling) and the word ebullient means to be highly enthusiastic(bubbly basically). Eventhough the former method demands more effort, learning the roots would help build a very strong base on which you develop. The latter method works only for a very small niche of words and thus is not very effective. As you say Arpit, there is no point in mugging these words.Eventhough you dont make use of most of the words in daily life, learning them can be very useful in knowing where you stand(self-assessment) and actually learning new words is fun. Sorry for making this such a long post..guess it would have answered most of you guys queries</p>
<p>TOEFL: Nothing much to say bout this, just for the sake of completeness, here it goes.It is often an exercise of temperament in the sense it is really patience that decides how well you perform. At times it seems so trivial that you often wonder what it actually tests. It is particularly for students who do their learning in the native language so it is generally a breeze through.</p>
<p>It’s a mere formality. Book any convenient date. Writing TOEFL before GRE can give you a good feel of the examination center and computer based testing. Few hours of preparation before the date of the exam will do.Most of the universities will demand a score of 213(some of them 250), which is really easy to get.Its just a piece of cake and 270+ is easily manageable.Again remember to choose universities carefully for free score reporting.</p>
<p>SEARCHING UNIVERSITIES TO APPLY TO: All said and done this is by far the most important step because this is when the economics of the process sets in. At some point an honest evaluation of oneself is critical to the entire process. In an ideal word, all of us would want to graduate from a university of repute but this just doesn’t happen. Apart from assessing ones own credentials, an honest evaluation of one would involve studying the competition around you and your economic ability. Most top universities generally cost a lot more and this has to be factored in. For example if you are financially not sound it makes little sense in applying to universities in the IV league, Stanford and WiscMad. Hence just decide on such factors before jotting down your universities A few important tips should go here:</p>
<p>1.The US consulate conducts free weekly seminars for students to help them in choosing colleges. Surely attend at least one of them so that you will get a fair idea about applications. They have the latest information about all colleges and you can become a member to use their library. 2.You must always have the first and the most important factor at the back of your mind – your financial constraints. Before you start thinking about colleges discuss with your parents about the money you can afford to spend on your masters. This is vital and most of the students just don’t understand the importance of finance when they apply. Even if you can afford a huge sum of money for your higher education, you must be wise to make the right investment on your education considering your future prospects and opportunities. 3.You can apply to costly universities but make sure the department you apply to is well funded. The best departments in good universities are generally funded. Funding should be your second most important factor in choosing the college. 4.Look at universities that have lesser fees. There are a few universities that are cheap and are highly ranked (egg: Texas Austin). 5.Browse through as many universities as you can – look for funding the department gets and the companies that fund the research projects. Here is where team work plays.Get into groups and collect data such as research areas,funding scenario,number of indians,minimum requirements, etc. We will tell bout the rationality behind these shortly. 6.Don’t ever apply to universities where you don’t satisfy GRE and academic prerequisites (not average scores). 7.Most students prefer to use US News, which gives a ranking of universities on certain criteria of its own. Use it but believe us it is not the Bible and don’t ever apply on the basis of ranking alone. These rankings provide a rough idea about where a university stands w.r.t faculty and research compared to others. If your chance of getting aid is low and the university is costly we would strongly urge you not to apply even when the university is highly ranked. 8.The most efficient applicant will apply to 1 or 2 top colleges and get full financial assistantship. But that is not the way it normally works. We would advice you to apply to a minimum of 4 colleges and a maximum of 8 colleges.</p>
<p>To summarize the above: Choose a set of colleges based on A.your scores, abilities, financial capability B.rank, fees and funding available to the university.</p>

<p>PostPosted: Sat Apr 02, 2005 11:10 am Post subject: Reply with quote If i might add something..</p>
<p>In light of my own experience, i feel there is another factor which you should consider while choosing your university. If you have a particular specialization/area-of-interest/field in mind and want to pursue graduate studies in it, then make sure that there are atleast 3-4 profs working in your field in that particular university.</p>
<p>The graduate admissions committee invariably consists of only professors. Besides other things, candidates are selected on a need-basis. If a prof feels he need more students to assist him in his current area of research then he will pick up only those students who have similar areas of interest. If your interests dont match with any of the profs then there is no reason for them to pick you up even if you are the best student in the world!</p>
<p>Another reason why you should do so, is from the placements point of view. If the university you chose is particularly good in your field, then thats the best deal you could probably get. Suppose Univ X is good in field Y then only the Y group of the Company Z will visit X to recruit students for the field Y. They wont even look at students in A,B,C fields because they dont consider X good in A,B,C.</p>
<p>So think hard and find out which field you want to specialize in. This if for your own good.</p>

<p><br />
BOOKING A DATE:</p>
<p>Most of the students prefer June, July and August. We would personally advice you to write it as early as you can (mid June to early July is ideal). This leaves you at an advantage with regard to planning ahead. This might sound trivial but many approach the GRE with the mindset that postponement is always an alternative. This apart from being a complete waste of money greatly affects your confidence when you actually take the test. Therefore to even contemplate this action is foolish. Even more ridiculous are statements that go around stating that writing the GRE at a particular place(say Bangalore) or at the earlier periods of the month (early) gives you a significant advantage. Honestly just turn a deaf ear to such statements and proceed on to prepare for the exam.</p>
<p>Considering the scenario here, we would personally advice you to go for the test during your summer vacation especially the one after the 2nd year. In our batch most of us took the test just before the 7th sem or during the sem. It is worthwhile to remember the saying "The early bird gets the worm". If you finish off the GRE &amp; TOEFL well before , You can send your application packets as soon as possible and not rush it near the deadlines. Some univs made their decisions in late december itself for those who applied early. So its best to take both test before the 7th sem commences and apply as soon as possible.</p>
<p>WRITING THE EXAM:</p>
<p>Many approach the exam highly skeptical of what lies ahead. Not for a second are we saying that this is unnatural but really you have to work under the presumption that if you have worked lady luck will shine on you. The key to writing this exam is being composed throughout the period of 3 hours. The general occurrence is that the first section often turns out to be difficult and students have that backlog when they proceed onto the next. In such cases it is advisable that you use the break between the sections prudently.</p>
<p>You have to stay calm and be confident. A lot of students who do well in the practice tests go horribly wrong in the main test, as they get excited. “Power prep” gives the most accurate indication of your score and you can expect getting the same score at the main test (+ or – 50, as far as we have seen). Take at least one of these “power prep” tests a day or two before GRE. You get to send free score reports to 4 universities of your choice. At the time of writing the examination you will tend to underestimate the value of this free report. They are extremely valuable ($120 GRE + TOEFL),so choose the universities carefully. GRE tests your time management skill. So more the number of practice tests you take you will be in a better position to meet the demand.Try not making errors in the first fifteen questions in quantitative and you will surely be able to get a high score. MOST IMPORTANT- attempt all questions in every section. If I'm correct omitting a question is twice as costly as getting it wrong.</p>

<p>I apppreciate your interest but i guess you will have to wait for the details regarding the CGPA. I think it would suffice now to say that CG of 7.5 translates to the minimum required GPA (most top ranked univs would be expecting atleast 3.0 out of 4) For more details keep watching this space.</p>

BASIS OF SELECTION BY UNIVERSITIES:</p>
<p>The following are important parameters which are taken into account by any university for giving u the admit card.</p>
<p>1 Academic scores 2. GRE scores 3. Papers, publications and Research projects 4. SOP 5. Recommendation letters</p>
<p>Top ranked universities weigh all the above equally and can sometimes give more importance to your research projects and papers than your scores. SOP and Recommendation letters play a crucial role in getting teaching and research assistantships. Fellowships are normally granted on academic excellence.</p>
<p>Papers, publications and Research projects: Let's start with the weightage given to the research. By and large this is the most important factor that will guarantee your admission as well as the assistantship. You may do any one of the following: a. Publish some original research papers in national/international journals/conferences eusa_doh.gif b. Try to do some good projects from IITs or IISc as well as the recos from the prof. eusa_wall.gif c. U may involve urself with any ongoing research in our college(if any eusa_naughty.gif ) d. Something is better than nothing. Try to present some papers in technical symposiums.</p>
<p>Some top universities understand only this language of research. U can offset your low GPA by doing some research work. So try to get into a culture of research.</p>
<p>More 'bout SOP,Recos etc later.</p>

PostPosted: Thu Apr 07, 2005 11:06 am Post subject: re:ROAD TO MS - VI&#160;: Admission Criteria Reply with quote well i got some questions regarding the GRE.</p>
<p>While selecting the universities is it a good idea to mail to a few indian students in the particular universities and ask them what my chances of admission are?</p>
<p>There is also a common belief that one manages to get aid after the 1st semester in most cases??? Is this true...??</p>
<p>It is also said that getting aid for an MS leading to a PhD is easier...Is this true???</p>
<p>Are fee waviers and aid one and the same thing or its different???</p>
<p>Does anyone have cds of Kaplan/princeton/ets....if so could i please borrow them and return them in a while....?????</p>

<p>PostPosted: Thu Apr 07, 2005 11:29 am Post subject: Reply with quote hi,</p>
<p>Of course it a good idea to mail some indian students asking them about the funding and research scenario in a particular university... but questions like "chances of admission" are quite blunt. No one can really say about anyone's chances of admission (other than the admission committee eusa_wall.gif ).</p>
<p>If you apply directly to Ph.D ur chances of getting aid is quite high. But dont use this as a tool for getting aid unless you are totally committed to doing Ph.D.</p>
<p>We will have a separate post regarding FAQs on aid .. until then please wait.</p>

<p>The Statement of Purpose&#160;:</p>
<p>In some weird way this really can swing your application. SOP’s are vital in getting aid and are often the determining factor. It is essential that SOP’s are commensurate with your academic ability. When we mean commensurate, it means that if you were to write a technical SOP, your application packet must contain proof of your technical knowledge. Similarly if the English is of “Oxfordian” proportions then the verbal score must back it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Try to be little bit honest when you write an SOP. &gt;&gt; Be CLEAR, CRISP in framing your sentences. Avoid childhood stories. Remember that any reader will just spend 1 or 2 minutes with your SOP. &gt;&gt; Number of sides is not very important. One and a half page SOPs are ideal and are more than enough to state your purpose clearly. &gt;&gt; Start writing your SOP early and revise your SOP continuously. &gt;&gt; A lot of professors have provided guidelines to write SOPs. Read a few and follow them strictly. U can find them @ University of Wisconsin@mad, UC Santa Barbara Websites. &gt;&gt; These are professional essays and you don’t need to be creative. It is not a test of your English ability but a statement on your abilities and intentions.</p>
<p>RECO: U r required to submit three letters of recommendation from those u have supervised u. These r most likely to be ur college faculty or ur project guide. Chances of getting an admit are increased appreciably if the reco is from IIT or IISc prof. The reco should effectively speak 'bout ur academic capabilities and abilities &amp; also about ur promise of success at the graduate level. Since now-a-days all the applicants get very good recos (Most of us r supossed to write our own recos eusa_boohoo.gif ) some univs give more importance to ur projects and research work.</p>
<p>As already seen, ur CG shud be as high as possible &amp; try to project urself as among the toppers in ur class. In case ur CG is low, try to project ur other high points. Rest in next.</p>
