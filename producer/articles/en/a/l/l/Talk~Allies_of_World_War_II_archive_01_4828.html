<dd>Finland is gonna be a very odd subject to deal with, that's primarily why I listed the entire Oslo group. Also, Denmark (and Norway) is something of an embarassment too, because of the large number of personnel that served in various Wehrmacht and SS formations, even if the Danish government cannot be considered an Axis ally. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">Nobs01</a> 01:13, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Finland is striking, as the only democracy to have joined the Axis, but the peculiar historical reasons for this are well-known. I don't think it's appropriate to discuss contributions to Axis forces in this article, especially as there were some from every Allied country (e.g. the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Free_Corps_1053.html" title="British Free Corps">British Free Corps</a>). <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 12:47, July 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Finland, like Italy, defected to the Allies during the war and started fighting the Germans on September 4, 1944. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Finland_55b6.html#Finland_in_World_War_II" title="History of Finland">History_of_Finland#Finland in World War II</a>. It should not be counted as one of the allies however, since no formal agreement was present. --<a href="../../../o/r/z/User%7EOrzetto_6421.html" title="User:Orzetto">Orzetto</a> 13:47, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Finland actually fought the Germans, while I can easily ID several so called "Allies" that made the official aggrement but did not lift even half of a finger to fight (Turkey, Nicaragua, and Saudi Arabia, I mean YOU). If anything, the Finns helped crush Hitler and the facists in Finland and Norway, and later unofficially fought in mainland Europe East and West Fronts. Even one freecking battle was more than the "Allies" I mentioned above ever did, so if these no-shows are allowed to be on the list I cannot possibly see any reason whatsoever why Finland cannot be on it. Also, as for the "did not sign" excuse, the North Vietnamese never got around to declaring war officially on the US but still they fought America fiercly. ELV</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Portugal</span></h2>
<p>I find it strange and inappropriate that Portugal is listed as an unofficial ally, as YES, the Macao and Timor campaigns did see SOME Portugese nationals (primarily CIVILIANS) fighting alsongside the allies against the Japanese, these instances were not backed by Salazar's Facist regime and were the EXCEPTION, not the RULE. The Portugese were known for sending large amounts of "voulanteers" to fight for Germany, many of whom were not only in the Eastern Front but also in North Africa, Italy, the Balkens, France and the Benelux (after which Salazar officially "cut ties" with said troops) and some even fought in the final, dying days of the Reich in Centeral Europe. Portugal also gave military "advisors" to the Germans (primarily in Yugoslavia) under the pretext of "combating the spread of Anarchy in Europe." As late as mid June 1944 the Portugese forces (as well as Spanish) participated in joint traning manuvers witht the Germans. Considering these facts, I feel that the inclusion of Portugal into this list is inappopriate and inaccurate. If you wish to talk about the LOCAL resistence to Japan in Timor and Macao, fine by me, but keep in mind that the rebels were not supported and were in fact condemned by the Portugese Government.

<p>Question:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Under neutrality rules, a neutral must intern hostile troops which cross border. During the Second World War the Swedish Government permitted Germany to transship its troops across Swedish territory to carry on the war against the Soviet Union. By the time the program ended in August, 1943, 2,140,000 German soldiers had transited Swedish rail lines. Was this a violation of Hague V? If so, why did Sweden permit Germany to ship those troops across its neutral territory?</i> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">Nobs01</a> 15:08, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think there was an official pretence that the passengers were not combat personnel. There was, of course, the thinly-veiled threat of Nazi invasion if Sweden had refused. Switzerland also allowed the transit of German personnel and equipment to and from Italy under similar circumstances.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 01:01, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be fair, the De havilland Mosquitoes in BOAC markings AND camoflage regularly flown into and out of Sweden as ball bearing mules were probably stretching the boundaries of neutrality.</p>

<p>Is it right that the USSR shown as "initially German ally"&#160;?</p>
<p>USSR never participated in anti-comintern pact and nither declared war on Poland in 1941 (but protected some areas of Ukraine and Belorussia, earlier annexed by Poland, from Nazis). USSR occupied this area only when Polish government ended resistance to Germans and left the country. Polish goverment ordered not to resist the USSR army.</p>
<p>Also USSR participated in Spanish civil war AGAINST Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>In fact, before 1941 USSR was neutral according to the international law.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 07:21, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, the Soviet Union started World War II, along with Nazi Germany, right after signing the secret Hitler-Stalin Pact, a military non-aggression pact, that secretly divided eastern Europe up into zones of influence for the Russians and Germans to conquer, without getting into each other's way. The Pact specified which territories were to go to which invader. "You can have this; and we'll take this", is a pretty fair summary, I think. Basically, the Hitler-Stalin Pact was the blueprint for WWII. Pretty neutral.-Ned.(Sept.)</p>
<p>Um, any way round, surely the USSR's entry to WWII should be dated to it's invasion of the Polish rump state, and not the German invasion of the USSR?</p>
<p>I am sorry, but in case you did not notice, the Finns were not facists. As a matter of fact, the Finns HATED the facists. As a matter of fact, I do believe that there are some records about German equipment transferred to the Russians in the Winter War. The main reason that the Finns sided with the Germans was due to Stalin's two invasions of Finland and after Hitler's costly but sucessful invasion of Denmark and Norway, Finland was cut off from the Western Allies, the one faction in the war the Finns felt any real comradeship with. For instince, Finland's alliance with Hitler was like the West's alliance with Stalin; a pact made between people who loath eachothers guts who make a shakey alliance based on a immenent mutual powerful enemy that will be broken at the earliest oppertunity possible. Take a look at what the Finns did to the Germans in Lapland and you do not see two facists fighting each other. You see a Democracy that grudgedly allied with a dictatorship fighting said dictatorship. After this the Finns joined the Western Allies and served with distinction in the West. The Russians were not "protecting" Finland or Poland! THey were launching an invasion riddled with atrocities and blood! The Soviets had already been preparing to move into Poland when the Germans invaded, and invade they did! The all across Eastern Poland Soviet and Polish forces fought each other to the death in a campaign coordinated with the German one, and in Centeral Poland the Germans and the Russians helped each other crush the surviving Polish resistence in the same battles! That is invasion, not protection, as one person claimed it was. Do Protectors commit horrific atrocities on those they are protecting, like the Soviets commited Katyn Forest agianst Polish officers? Are protectors usually resisted violently by those that they claim they are protecting? Do Protectors of Nation A aid Nation X that is invading Nation A and do they do so openly and puplically, like from Stalin's own mouth (note, this is the gist of it, I forgot the exact words): "One kick from Nazi Germany on one side, The Second one from the Soviet Union on the other, and there is nothing left of this atrocious child of Versailles."? The Soviets need to be at least mentioned as being Axis members in Poland before Barbarossa. ELV</p>

<p>This states: "Polish partisans" started diversion Soviet territory. It does not say where. If anything, it must have meant Eastern Poland, occupied by the Soviets in 1939. Even that is not credible to me, as from all sources I have read the Polish Underground in those areas never really had a chance to develop before 1941. Anyway, that statement is <b>NOT</b> evidence for Polish partisans on the Soviet-Finnish front.</p>
<p>There were plans to send the Polish <i>Podhalańska</i> Brigade to Finland as part of the British-French-Polish help to Finland, but they were never actually carried out.</p>
<p>This reference as a whole is pushing a strongly biased pro-Soviet point of view and is not credible. The following statement just about completely disqualifies it:</p>
<p>Есть еще одна весьма показательная по своей фабуле история битвы за душу народа", так называемое "катынское дело". Она требует особого рассмотрения в рамках "неисследованной мятеж-войны", но представляется достаточно хорошо изученной, в качестве примера международной провокации против России с участием историков и демократов типа Волкогонова и Яковлева в период с 1987 по 2000 гг.</p>
<p>In short, it states the the <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katyn_Massacre_a3ab.html" title="Katyn Massacre">Katyn Massacre</a> was an "anti-Russian provocation". This is revisionism of the worst kind.</p>

<dd>From some random <a href="http://gotowce.com.pl/prace/3543.htm" class="external text" title="http://gotowce.com.pl/prace/3543.htm" rel="nofollow">references</a> I found via Google on the web, Poland did consider itself to be in a state of war with USSR between September, 1939 and the summer of 1941. However, no formal declaration of war was ever proclaimed. Around September 17, 1939 the Polish goverment was in flight and too disorganised to declare war. When it reformed itself in France later in the fall, the pressure of France and Britain prevented Poland from formally declaring war. Please, if anyone has a good link in English that deals with this, please post it here. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 19:24, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One can imagine if one's country is invaded one whould consider themself at war. One can also imagine, if one's counrty is invaded, a formal declaration of war against the aggressor is not a requirement or necessary. 198.133.178.17 21:43, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The fact that Poland did not formally declare war left its position ambiguous. Some historians argue it was a significant mistake, as it seemed to have legitimised Soviet Union's claim that its invasion of Poland was not an act of war. At the same time, there would have been little point declaring war alone without France and Britain. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 22:19, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you mean that it may have made it easier for them to do it, yes. Still, such a declaration would have been symbolic anyway and in the end could not have mattered that much. The fact was that there was no way the West would start World War III to fight for the freedom of Eastern Europe and Stalin knew that very well and acted accordingly. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 23:45, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, at the end, they excluded USSR NOT for Polish events, but protecting Finland - a country with highly anti-Soviet, reactionist and pro-fascist regime, a (future) member of Hitler's anti-Comintern pact.</dd>
<dd>We should keep 'de jure' position - all other is a propaganda. - USSR was de jure neutral, in spite of the fact that it participated in wars in Spain, Finland and Japan AGAINST pro-fascist regimes.</dd>
<dd>Note, that Poland was a pro-fascist state before German invasion, there were enabled anti-semitic laws and anti-semitic propaganda in Poland.

<p>Except, of course, that the pact was publicly proclaimed as a non-aggression pact (a near-alliance), but it was the <b>secret protocol</b> that was the real agreement for a coordinated attack on, or tolerance of the other's attacks on, nonbelligerent countries. Which is a military alliance, now matter how you wish to obfuscate the matter. Neutral states do not dance arm-in-arm in the streets of Brest. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 21:11:20, 2005-08-31 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, knowing Soviet and Nazi political doctrine, no serious historian would take such words for their face value. Remember that Soviets used to "fight for peace" with their armies&#160;? The real intentions count and they are proven by the immediate result of signing the pact, which was the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland the following month.</dd>

<dd>Yes they have something in common: <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, but it does not matter here. As I explained above, it is the facts that counts. They did sign the alliance, used the "neturality agreement" <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a> for its title, and immediately did what they agreed to in the secret protocol: invaded their neighbour and started WW2. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 09:35, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not that they kept it secret, it's that they denied it existed. For political reasons, exactly. You are right. The political reason was that it proved their alliance with Nazis, while without the secret protocol the pact would seem like an ordinary peace treaty. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 09:35, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Finally, the secret protocol specifically discussed the fate of then independent countries, including Poland, the Baltics and Finland. It even made provisions for setting up a border between Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany along rivers within neighbouring Poland. A neutrality agreement&#160;?

<dd>It is proven that all wards about "totalitarism" is a pure propaganda, intended to state that USSR and Nazi Germany does not differ, which is a revisionism in its essence. There is no <i>totalitarian</i> ideology.
