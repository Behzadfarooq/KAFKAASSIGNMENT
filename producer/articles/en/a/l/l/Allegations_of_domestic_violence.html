<p><b>Allegations of domestic violence</b> are frequent in post-<a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a>/<a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation.html" title="Separation">separation</a> situations. The consequences of such allegations can be serious. The one making the allegation does so under oath, and failure to believe an accurate allegation could lead to more violence, or judicial sanction of the violence that has occurred. On the other hand, false allegations do occur, and the consequences of those for the person falsely accused can be very serious as well. For both the alleged abuser and the alleger, custody of the children, occupation of the home, and issuance of restraining orders are at stake. There are three main areas of debate in this controversial field, issues of the legal burden of proof, concerns about the definition of domestic violence, and disagreements about the frequency of false accusations.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_domestic_violence.html" title="Edit section: Legal burden of proof">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legal burden of proof</span></h2>
<p>Some contend that situations where assault has been alleged should be dealt with by the criminal courts, and not be accepted without evidence as an unproven slur on a assailant's character in family proceedings. It is contended that the legal principle of innocent until proven guilty should apply as much to allegations of domestic violence as to any other allegations of criminal behaviour. However, family court proceedings are civil proceedings where guilty verdicts are not being determined. Civil proceedings often handle what may also be criminal allegations—such as battery—using different standards of proof and different due process safeguards (such as right to an attorney, or presumption of innocence) than criminal courts. Tort actions for fraud or battery would be two examples.</p>
<p>Others point out that the victim may be too frightened, embarrassed, or otherwise reluctant to give evidence to the police. Consequently, they argue that the burden of proof should be less, i.e. on the balance of probabilities, or the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precautionary_principle.html" title="Precautionary principle">precautionary principle</a> should be used. On the other hand, in family court false allegations of all kinds are common,<sup id="_ref-RZB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RZB" title="">[1]</a></sup> and so lowering the burden of proof raises serious probability of erroneous judgments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_domestic_violence.html" title="Edit section: Definition of domestic violence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition of domestic violence</span></h2>
<p><i>Full article:</i> <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_Violence_a143.html" title="Domestic Violence">Domestic Violence</a></p>
<p>The legal definition of domestic violence in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> countries (including the USA and UK) also includes <i>non-physical</i> assault e.g. stalking, silent phone calls, threatening language etc and "low-threshold" actions such as touching<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Some have accused "Fathers' rights campaigners" of believing that a low threshold for what types of conduct can be construed as violent will be used in child proceedings to make allegations of violence against them on tenuous grounds. However, there is little evidence for this, and given the minimal evidence required, exaggerated or fabricated complaints are hardly limited to "low threshold" conduct.</p>
<p>There are three extensions to such a definition which have generated particular alarm due to the ease of their fabrication (often as a basis for persuading a court to deny joint custody or child visitation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of violence</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is the view that <i>even if there had been no violence</i>, then the fear of violence would be sufficient to deny contact with the child(ren). Such fear is usually discussed as from the father on the mother, though violence in both directions is of about equal frequency (see references at <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_violence.html" title="Domestic violence">Domestic violence</a> and the extensive annotated bibliography by CSU Psychology Professor Martin Fiebert<sup id="_ref-Fiebert_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fiebert" title="">[2]</a></sup> This matter is usually addressed in practice by arranging that no direct contact takes place between the parents at the point of changeover or by using <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contact_centres.html" title="Contact centres">contact centres</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Stress arising from other parent's contact/(custody) application</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is the view that it is a risk to allow a parent-child relationship to continue where an application for contact results in stress to the child or child's carer. Thus, going to court to obtain parenting time with one's children can be used as a reason to deny it. [1] This claim, despite being occasionally successful in court, appears to have no scientific support whatsoever, whereas there is extensive and growing knowledge of the importance of both parents being involved in their children's upbringing (except in relatively rare cases where there is some compelling specific danger involved).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Denial as domestic violence</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is also concern that a man who denies that he has committed domestic violence may be regarded as committing domestic violence <i>by his very denial</i>. That is of course an absurd argument, logical identical to those of the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salem_witch_trials.html" title="Salem witch trials">Salem witch trials</a>. However, some assert that there is sufficient bias in some jurisdictions that even such an absurd tactic has been used successfully.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Extending the definition (in law or in practice) to notions such as these, where false allegation is easy and disproof is virtually impossible, is thought by many to seriously compromise the integrity of the legal system, and courts are increasingly reluctant to consider such claims without more serious proof.</p>
<p><a name="False_allegations_of_domestic_violence" id="False_allegations_of_domestic_violence"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_domestic_violence.html" title="Edit section: False allegations of domestic violence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">False allegations of domestic violence</span></h2>
<p>The prevalence of allegations of domestic violence when couples break up is not surprising. However, many of these allegations are false (see,<sup id="_ref-RZB_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RZB" title="">[1]</a></sup> presumably motivated by the gains in property and child custody which may accrue to the alleged victim. High profile cases of false allegations of rape include that made against <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Hamilton_%28politician%29_fa17.html" title="Neil Hamilton (politician)">Neil Hamilton</a>, the former British government minister. It is also pointed out that the Home Office Research Report 191 concluded that men and women were equally likely to initiate domestic violence; scores of studies in the USA have come to the same conclusion.<sup id="_ref-Fiebert_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fiebert" title="">[2]</a></sup> Many are concerned that the prosecuting authorities simply do not take seriously the violence perpetrated by women on men.</p>
<p>The countervailing view is that there is evidence to disprove arguments that falsification of domestic violence claims are rampant and not genuine. The Domestic Violence Legislation Working Group of Australia has stated that there is no "<i>firm evidence that misuse of the legislation is rampant</i>", in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> Bureau of Crime Statistics evaluation report of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apprehended_Violence_Order_6bea.html" title="Apprehended Violence Order">apprehended violence order</a> (AVO) system have concluded that a majority of women taking out AVOs in situations of domestic violence have done so genuinely.</p>
<p>A further argument against widespread falsification relies upon the fact that lying about domestic violence is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a> which is severely punishable. Whilst this is an attractive argument it is weakened by the observation that perjury is very seldom, if ever, followed up in the family law system. However, there may be civil causes of action available for a party wronged by false allegations of domestic violence such as sanctions, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution.</p>
<p>Lastly, not taking seriously allegations can lead to further violence, as well as be judicial misconduct. In Maryland, a judge was under investigation for his conduct in domestic violence case. He retired and thus avoided punishment. Following his dismissal of a protective order, a woman's husband arrived at her place of work, doused her with gasoline, and set her on fire, causing serious burns. <a href="http://wjz.com/topstories/local_story_226150611.html" class="external text" title="http://wjz.com/topstories/local_story_226150611.html" rel="nofollow">Yvette Cade Seeks Justice Against Judge Palumbo</a></p>
<p>The sharp rise of allegation of domestic violence is evinced from child custody disputes in family court <a href="http://www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/FamilyViolence.pdf?docID=601" class="external text" title="http://www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/FamilyViolence.pdf?docID=601" rel="nofollow">(Baskerville 2006)</a>. Others have noted that during a divorce proceeding, when children are involved, domestic violence allegations and orders of protection "usually have the effect of separating them from one of their parents."</p>
<p>Of course, no one thinks that large financial incentives inevitably force cases to involve such allegations, or that every allegation in a high-dollar case is therefore false. For example, Sean "Diddy" Combs was ordered by a <a href="http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=100&amp;aid=59286" class="external text" title="http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=100&amp;aid=59286" rel="nofollow">New York county family court to pay over $19,000</a> monthly for one child about 11 years old to the mother for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_support.html" title="Child support">child support</a>. This award is valued at more than $1.6 million over seven years. This amount excludes alimony payments for school, camp, insurance, and medical. That case saw no false allegations. However, it is clear that there are motives for false alllegation, and a judicial history that at least in some jurisdictions has made them a profitable and common tactic.</p>
<p>Some who fear the prospect of a future false allegation have resorted to utilizing surveillance to capture the audio or video of an event, in an effort to exonerate themselves from false charges.
