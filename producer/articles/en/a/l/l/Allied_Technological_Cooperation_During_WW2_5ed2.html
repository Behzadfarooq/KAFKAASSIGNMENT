<p><a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_Arms_8337.html" title="Small Arms">Small Arms</a> really began to be shared after the fall of France, most of the ‘sharing’ being one sided as America was not yet directly involved in the conflict and thus all the movement of weapons was from the United States to the United Kingdom. Vast numbers of U.S small arms and ammunition were bought or supplied under <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lend_lease.html" title="Lend lease">lend lease</a> and arrived in Britain to re-equip the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> which had left large proportion of small arms as well as heavy equipment in France after <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Dynamo_2ab1.html" title="Operation Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a>. The creation of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Guard_04b7.html" title="Home Guard">Home Guard</a> (Local Defence Volunteers at this time) also put a great demand on small arms supplies forcing units to train with broom handles and makeshift Pikes using lengths of piping and old bayonets. The weapons supplied for the British army were the famous <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thompson_submachine_gun.html" title="Thompson submachine gun">Thompson submachine gun</a>, <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1911_Colt_pistol_11ef.html" title="M1911 Colt pistol">Colt .45 M1911 pistol</a> and the <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1917_revolver.html" title="M1917 revolver">Colt .45 M1917 revolver</a>. The Home Guard received <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1919_Browning_machine_gun_c994.html" title="M1919 Browning machine gun">M1919 .30 Machineguns</a> in small numbers, <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle_e806.html" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">M1918 .30 Browning Automatic Rifles</a> again in limited numbers and <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1917_Enfield_rifle_3ca3.html" title="M1917 Enfield rifle">P17 .30 Enfield Rifles</a> (the British <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pattern_1914_Enfield_5198.html" title="Pattern 1914 Enfield">.303 P14</a> version also being issued).</p>
<p>Slightly later in the war the <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1919_Browning_machine_gun_c994.html" title="M1919 Browning machine gun">M1919 .30 Machinegun</a> (commonly known as the 30-cal) and the <a href="../../../m/2/_/M2_Browning_machine_gun_1bc2.html" title="M2 Browning machine gun">M2HB .50 Machinegun</a> entered service with British Infantry and as anti-aircraft machine guns on British tanks and notably with the SAS on their heavily armed Jeeps.</p>
<p>Britain did supply small arms to Russia, the ubiquitous <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sten.html" title="Sten">9mm Sten Submachine gun</a> was supplied to Russian partisan troops.</p>

<p>The British made use of many American towed artillery pieces during the war, the <a href="../../../m/1/0/M101_howitzer.html" title="M101 howitzer">M2 105 mm howitzers</a>, <a href="../../../7/5/_/75_mm_Gun_%28US%29_b70b.html#M1" title="75 mm Gun (US)">M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzers</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Tom_c378.html" title="Long Tom">155 mm guns (Long Toms)</a> are but a few. These weapons were again supplied under lend-lease or bought outright. <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">Tank</a>/<a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank_Destroyer_bdda.html" title="Tank Destroyer">Tank Destroyer</a> American mounted artillery used by the British included the <a href="../../../3/7/m/37mm_Gun_M3_e27f.html" title="37mm Gun M3">37 mm M5/M6 Gun</a> <i>(<a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_tank.html" title="Stuart tank">General Stuart</a> and <a href="../../../m/3/_/M3_Lee_777b.html" title="M3 Lee">General Grant/Lee</a>)</i>, <a href="../../../7/5/_/75_mm_Gun_%28US%29_b70b.html#M2_2" title="75 mm Gun (US)">75mm M2 Gun</a> <i>(<a href="../../../m/3/_/M3_Lee_777b.html" title="M3 Lee">General Grant/Lee</a>)</i>, <a href="../../../7/5/_/75_mm_Gun_%28US%29_b70b.html#M3_2" title="75 mm Gun (US)">75 mm M3 Gun</a> <i>(General Grant/Lee and <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_Sherman_ab5d.html" title="M4 Sherman">General Sherman</a>)</i>, <a href="../../../7/6/_/76_mm_gun_M1_f124.html" title="76 mm gun M1">76 mm Gun M1</a> <i>(General Sherman)</i> and <a href="../../../3/i/n/3in_Gun_M5_145c.html#Self-propelled_mounts" title="3in Gun M5">3" Gun M7</a> <i>(<a href="../../../m/1/0/M10_Wolverine_29c0.html" title="M10 Wolverine">3in SP, Wolverine</a>)</i>.</p>
<p>The Americans in this instance did use a British artillery piece, the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordnance_QF_6_pounder_cd6b.html" title="Ordnance QF 6 pounder">Ordnance QF 6-pounder 7cwt</a> anti-tank gun. The U.S realized at the start of the war that their own <a href="../../../3/7/m/37mm_Gun_M3_e27f.html" title="37mm Gun M3">37 mm Gun M3</a> would soon be obsolete and thus they produced a license built version of the QF 6-pounder under the designation 57 mm Gun M1.</p>
<p>Both 76 mm and 75 mm guns were provided through tanks to the Russians by the U.S and the British tanks sent were armed with both the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordnance_QF_2_pounder_2a04.html" title="Ordnance QF 2 pounder">Ordnance QF 2-pounder</a> and the Ordnance QF 6-pounder.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_Technological_Cooperation_During_WW2_5ed2.html" title="Edit section: Tanks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tanks</span></h2>
<p>Probably the most well-known tank of the second world war is the <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_Sherman_ab5d.html" title="M4 Sherman">Medium Tank M4</a>, used in all theaters it was a versatile reliable design and easy to produce. Thus huge numbers were made and huge numbers were provided to Both Britain and Russia under lend-lease, despite official opinions the Medium Tank M4 was well liked by the Russian tankers. When Britain received the tank, it was given the designation <b>Sherman</b> and this is where the name of the <i>Sherman tank</i> came from - the U.K. naming its U.S.-built tanks after <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> generals. Both the British and the Russians re-armed their M4s with their own tank guns. The Russians re-armed a very small number with the standard <a href="../../../f/-/3/F-34_tank_gun.html" title="F-34 tank gun">76 mm F-34 tank gun</a> but so much 75 mm ammunition was supplied that the conversions were not widespread. The British conversion is much more well known as the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Firefly_505c.html" title="Sherman Firefly">Sherman Firefly</a>, mounting the potent <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordnance_QF_17_pounder_48f5.html" title="Ordnance QF 17 pounder">Ordnance QF 17-pounder</a> anti-tank gun in the standard turret with a new mantlet and the radio moved to an armoured box welded to the turret bustle. These conversions both show how a blend of both countries weaponry was desirable though unfortunately despite the Americans building a few 17-pounder Fireflies from new they never went into quantitative production and did not see action. The firefly thus remains a purely British variant of the Sherman.</p>
<p>The British also designed two other Sherman variants know as the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Crab_f509.html" title="Sherman Crab">Crab</a>, a mine flailing tank, the mine flail being powered by the tanks own engine and the <a href="../../../d/d/_/DD_Sherman_3ce4.html" title="DD Sherman">DD Sherman</a>, the <b>DD</b> standing for <i>Duplex Drive</i>. The DD was a swimming tank, a flotation screen gave buoyancy and two propellers powered by the tanks engine gave propulsion in the water. On reaching land the screens could be dropped and the tank could fight in the regular manner. The DD was used by both British and American forces during <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>. The DD had impressed <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Eisenhower_47fa.html" title="General Eisenhower">General Eisenhower</a> during demonstrations and was readily accepted. It was another key example of combining technologies. Unfortunately for the Americans they did not accept the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Crab_f509.html" title="Sherman Crab">Crab</a> which could have saved many <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_engineering.html" title="Combat engineering">Engineers</a> lives by clearing mines under fire but also under armour. <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armoured_recovery_vehicle.html" title="Armoured recovery vehicle">ARVs</a> (Armoured Recovery Vehicles) were also converted from Shermans by the British as well as the specialist <a href="../../../b/a/r/BARV_380d.html" title="BARV">BARV</a> (Beach Armoured Recovery Vehicle) designed to push-off landing craft and salvage vehicles which would otherwise have been lost.</p>
<p>The British also supplied tanks to Russia in the form of the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentine_tank.html" title="Valentine tank">Valentine</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill_tank.html" title="Churchill tank">Churchill</a> infantry tanks. As with the Sherman, these tanks were liked for their reliability and cross country performance respectivelely, but the small low-powered guns, 2 and 6-pounders, were received less enthusiastically.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_Technological_Cooperation_During_WW2_5ed2.html" title="Edit section: Aircraft">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aircraft</span></h2>
<p>In addition to being originally designed to a British specification for use by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a>, the famous <a href="../../../p/-/5/P-51_Mustang_6b8f.html" title="P-51 Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> would not have been the excellent fighter that it was without British technology in the form of the equaly famous <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Merlin_1e2b.html" title="Rolls-Royce Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> aero-engine. It is another excellent example of technological cooperation, in this case American airframe, British engine. The P-51 was also used in small numbers by the British. In addition to the British making use of American planes the U.S also made use of some <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfires_a7c7.html" title="Supermarine Spitfires">Supermarine Spitfires</a> based in the U.K and Mediterranean, as well as using <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Beaufighter_df50.html" title="Bristol Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighters</a> in the Mediterranean, and <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Mosquito_3a93.html" title="De Havilland Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquitoes</a> based in the U.K.</p>
<p>Britain supplied <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hawker Hurricanes</a> to Russia early in the war to try and help the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Airforce_4a3e.html" title="Red Airforce">Red Airforce</a> defend itself against the then technologicaly superior <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>.</p>
