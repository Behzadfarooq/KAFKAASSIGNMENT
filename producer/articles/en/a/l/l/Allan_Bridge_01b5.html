<p><b>Allan Bridge</b> was an American conceptual artist best known for his creation in 1980 of the confessional phone system known as the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apology_Project_e7a3.html" title="Apology Project">Apology Project</a>. He also went by the pseudonym <b>Mr. Apology</b> (a label which has since been adopted by an advice columnist).</p>
<p>Bridge sold rights for a film and novel. <i>Mr. Apology</i> by Campbell Black was published by Ballantine Books in 1984, and this was adapted by screenwriter Mark Medoff for the HBO thriller, <i>Apology</i> (1986), starring <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesley_Ann_Warren_5b28.html" title="Lesley Ann Warren">Lesley Ann Warren</a>.</p>
<p>Some confessions taped from the Apology phone calls were published in <i>Apology</i>, a magazine edited and published by Bridge. After investigating the notion of bringing Apology to the online service <a href="../../../g/e/n/GEnie_e7c7.html" title="GEnie">GEnie</a>, he was making plans in 1995 to expand the Apology confessions to the Internet. Bridge was active in boating and scuba diving. While diving August 1995, he was killed by a hit-and-run jet skier. Lydia Nibley wrote about this in her essay "All Apologies" (December 16, 2004):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The man's heavily accented voice hesitated only briefly before he confessed to multiple murders: "I want to apologize. I don't know if even what I did was wrong or right, but when I was in Israel for six months, I killed six Arabs at night with a gang of other Jewish settlers. At the time we thought -- I believed -- we were fighting for our homeland to keep it from the Arabs. But perhaps now that I'm here in America, I realize that maybe killing is not the right way, and I want to apologize."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This message was left anonymously on a phone-message service called the Apology Line, where people recorded their confessions and also listened to others admit to acts of intentional cruelty, silly screw-ups, unfortunate and unintentional mistakes and, on occasion, even murder. From 1980 to 1995, Allan Bridge ran the line as something of a secular priest, offering the potential for forgiveness through the catharsis of taped confession -- until the day he was killed by a Jet-Skier who fled the scene and was never identified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Allan's wife, Marissa, was convinced that had her husband lived, he would have forgiven the person who hit him. But does that Jet-Skier -- who was seen circling back to confirm that it wasn't driftwood, but a man in scuba gear he had hit -- live the rest of his life plagued by remorse and guilt? And would confessing to someone, anyone, even anonymously, make a difference?...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When asked if she is sure Allan would have been able to forgive the Jet-Skier who hit him -- even without an apology -- Marissa Bridge imagines several scenarios. "The person knew it was an accident and that it wasn't his fault," she says. "He couldn't have predicted a scuba diver would surface at that moment right in front of him. Maybe the person was really young and gave into the impulse to run away rather than to stay and face things. I'm sure whoever they are, they are sorry."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>She explains that listening to Allan's collection of tapes from the Apology Line helps her understand that the average person is in some level of pain about past actions, and that people who have bigger regrets have a larger burden to carry. "Allan was a petty criminal in his early life, and he worried that people could fall too easily into being either the predator or the prey. He lived his life to say, 'Let's see if we can be better people.'"</dd>
