<p>"Nevertheless, the prevalent international legal opinion is that these bombings were not a war crime." I deleted this part because it is a very PoV and subjective section. If 16,000 innocent victims during the Invasion of Poland was a <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_war_crimes.html#World_War_II" title="German war crimes">war crime</a>, then this certainly is. The winner of a war writes history as we all know, and Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>. Both sources are American foundations which are obviously biased. If these are not classified as one of the heaviest war crimes ever committed, we could scrap 90% of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_war_crimes.html" title="German war crimes">German war crimes</a> article. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalaskan_ac0c.html" title="User:Salaskan">Salaskan</a> 15:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you are talking about the 2,000,000 figure then there are other sources besides Beevor available to you, such as Norman M. Naimark whose research reaches the same conclusion as the aforementioned German scholars. "Of particular importance to these relations was the behavior of Red Army soldiers during the initial period of occupation. Naimark's research supports the estimate made by German historians Barbara Johr and Helke Sander that Soviet soldiers raped as many as two million German women between the time their counteroffensive reached German territory and well past the formal end of hostilities."

<dd>From the link it is unclear on what basis he supports this particular figure. He just supports them without explanation - why exactly 2,000,000. Of course it is the fact that excesses and violation against civilians did occur as it goes in any acting army. It is well documented in the Soviet archives - all sort of reports, court martial papers etc. Thousands of Soviet soldiers and officeres were prosecuted and a lot of them executed. --<a href="../../../n/e/k/User%7ENekto_6fd5.html" title="User:Nekto">Nekto</a> 18:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been looking into the accusation of hypocrisy but it does not hold water because the British did not change their policy, from that at the start of the war that broadly complied with the 1922 Hague Rules of Air Warfare, to that of strategic bombing until the day after <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam_Blitz_b7b2.html" title="Rotterdam Blitz">Rotterdam was Blitzed</a>. The decision was taken at Cabinet level that the policy would have to be changed because the Germans were clearly not keeping to similar rules of engagement and that the Allies would have to match and surpass them in this area if they were to win the war. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:40, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some would say that this is hypocritical, in fact. But when a sentence starts with "some would say" then it's time to remove that topic from a wikipedia page. I agree with you on that removal. --<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Crazy_bf62.html" title="User:Lou Crazy">Lou Crazy</a> 22:59, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why wasn't Goering tried? Because it wasn't a war crime? To say so (or to deny it) on one's own behalf is OR and therefore can't serve as a basis to make any point here. Citation of existing definitions of war crimes is necessary and many of those contradict each other. Let's include the major definitions into the article as well as every incident that qualifies as a war crime according to at least one of those definitions (maybe in decending order by number of applicable definitions) and let the reader decide. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 12:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haber, please don't be oversensitive, I didn't say anything about your sacred POV tag. Have it, if you really believe it's the right thing. But I think the {{OR|article}} tag may be more appropriate (read on for a reason), as <i>no proper definition of what constitutes to a war crime is being provided</i> in the first place, which would be necessary as a <i>valid reference point</i> for deciding as to whether the article is or is not in fact POV. Everything else is just personal opinions and not a basis for POV-tagging the article. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 19:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mitsos, I was puzzled and disturbed by your previous reference to Haber's opinion being determined by him, in your words, being " probably jewish or something." I think I now understand the motivation behind your relentless campaign here, and the moral obfuscation you have been attempting to introduce. Would you like to tell the other editors-those who do not already know-what your politics are? I think it may very well have some bearing on the point under discussion. And I should say that I, for one, already know the answer to this question by your written admission on on another page. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 23:42, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Agree on article quality, maybe I can find the time to come up with some appropriate sources. About Mitsos' politics: Just go to his user page, there is no need for a which hunt, he has a political attitude (which is more than many people can claim), but at the same time I believe he is good-faithed as an editor and that is what counts. Although I agree with Haber that moving/renaming might be needed, and some work on the article, esp inclusion of proper definitions of "war crimes" has to be done. If anyone wants to keep the title, that is. Still, I stick by my proposal of changing POV to OR tag, for the very definition of war crime within this article is not POV, but OR (which is a lot worse by wikistandards). <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 07:07, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have a <i>serious problem</i> here which goes to the heart of every concept of fairness, accuracy and political neutrality. Let me make it clear that there are <i>no private exchanges</i> in Wikipedia, and talk pages can be read by all. I have absolutely no interest in political withchhunts; but I do have an interest in the truth and the way in which a particular view of the world-POV, if you prefer-can be used for the manipulation of facts and interpretations. Haber is being far too restrained: Mitsos is more than a 'White Supremacist': he's an anti-Semite and a Nazi. I quote, "We hane (sic) got "Neonazis" in Greece too (like me)..." Further still, "A small description of National Socialism could be <i>the enforcement of the laws of nature in the human society</i>." And this, "I hate political correctness. As we say it is something <i>Invented by Jews, believed by Whites, ignored by muds."</i></dd>

This whole page must now be treated as <i>highly suspect</i> in every sense imaginable.

<dd>White Guard: Sorry for removing the POV tag. There were so many deletions to rollback that it escaped me. Thank you for restoring it.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, the problem is not that Mitsos holds some loathsome ideas. The problem is how to have a good wikipedia entry. Removing mention of incidents is not a good way. Pointing out that they might not be war crimes is. Putting things in perspective (an entry on Axis war crimes would be ten times longer and would still miss some) might be. Clarifying someone's ideas such as <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_J._Rummel_4961.html" title="Rudolph J. Rummel">Rudolph J. Rummel</a>'s, which were badly misrepresented, is certainly a good way.</dd>
<dd>I'm thankful the allies freed my country. Their record in WWII was very good, with a very small number of black spots. However, I think we can all learn something from those black spots. History is also useful for learning from past mistakes.</dd>

<dd>Lou, I accept your sincerity, but I think you have probably set yourself an impossible task. When I first came across this page I was, I freely confess, angered by the contention that the strategic bombing offensive, which, I believe, made a vital contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany, was a war crime, especially as the contention was based on such politically suspect sources. However, I made no changes to the page itself, merely confining my disquiet to a POV tag. When I was first approached by Mitsos on this issue-via a message on my talk page-I responded in measured terms, explaining with due care why I considered the tag necessary. His reaction was to initiate an edit war in the face of all my objections. I have now become aware of the full sickening truth-yes, I have to use that term- behind his campaign. I now see this whole page not as a legitimate encyclopedia entry but as <i>Neo-Nazi propaganda</i>. Where does this end? Just imagine if Mitsos and his loathsome chums decide to write a page on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion-which they may very well do-highlighting the true nature of the 'Jewish conspiracy'? And there are a whole series of possibilities along these lines. One can tackle nonsense like Holocaust denial when this pops up; but what about more subtle perversions in the guise of encyclopedic truth? We face terrible dangers. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 08:10, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haber, I'm not meeting extremists halfway. I'm trying to have the best Wikipedia page possible, without hiding information and without diffusing false propaganda. When Italian troops on a peacekeeping mission committed acts of violence on civilians, the responsible people were tried, and training was improved to avoid other such acts. This policy was successful, and my respect for our forces is increased for this. If we make a good page, it will help improve Wikipedia's image, too.</dd>
<dd>White Guard: I can sympathize with you, I was harassed by a neo-fascist some time ago (he was banned). If Mitsos wants to contribute useful information, so let it be. If he wants to disseminate propaganda, I'll help reverting it. A page on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>? Thank God there already is one, on Wikipedia, which says right from the start that they are fake. Of course, we have to be vigilant on these pages.

<p>I find it extremly disappointing that both sides of this argument have resorted to name-calling.Users should state their opinions and provide facts to support those opinions,not make personal attacks on those they disagree with.</p>
<p>I'm also disturbed that anyone who argues that the bombing of German civilians is a war-crime is immediatly denounced as a nazi. As all rational people know, the National Socialist program of genocide was a terrible atrocity. But this in no way makes Allied war-crimes- the killing of German civilians and POWs any less severe.[Esp.since the vast majority German servicemen were not war criminals].</p>
<p>I reiterate, I am in no way a nazi, and I deplore the crimes Hitler committed, both against Germany, and the world. But we must not focus on the crimes of our enemies so we can downplay our own: I often find that when the Luftwaffe bombed Allied civilians, it was called 'terror bombing' but when the RAF bombed German civilians, it is called 'strategic bombing', which makes it sound nicer, but the civilians are still just as dead.....</p>
<p>So I sincerly hope that everyone understands that concern over Allied war crimes is in no way an endorsement of nazism, and I hope that in the future everyone expresses their opnion, whatever it may be,in a civil and respectful manner.<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilippo_Argenti_9573.html" title="User:Filippo Argenti">Filippo Argenti</a> 00:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Neither was unrestricted submarine warfare; British merchantmen were effectively naval auxiliaries, since they were <i>armed</i> &amp; reported the positions of attacking subs, both of which "defenseless" merchantmen were prohibited from doing.

<dd>The Bismark sea may or may not be a war crime. It is not at all clear to me that it was. Interdiction of troops is not a war crime. For example the German machine-gunning of Allied soldiers swimming ashore from sunken landing craft on D-Day was not a war crime. One would have to show that the Japanese troops were <i><a href="../../../h/o/r/Hors_de_combat.html" title="Hors de combat">Hors de combat</a></i> and this is defiantly a legal question involving a detailed knowledge of international Naval law and it not one that armatures can answer.

That killing explicitly permitted is not democide. Thus, the death of civilians during the bombing of munitions plants in World War II is not democide. Nor is the death of civilians when through navigation or bombing errors, or the malfunction of equipment, bombs land on a school or hospital, unless it is clear that the bombing was carried out recklessly in spite of a high risk to such civilian buildings. Nor is the death of civilians in a bombed village beneath which has been built enemy bunkers. Nor is the death of civilians caught in a cross fire between enemy soldiers, or those civilians killed while willingly helping troops haul supplies or weapons. Seldom is it easy to make these distinctions, but the aim here must be clear. I discriminate between democide in time of war and war-deaths. The latter are those of the military and civilians from battle or battle related disease and famine. The former are those victims (which may include the military, as when POWs are massacred) of internationally prohibited war-time killing, what may be called war-crimes or crimes against humanity.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can say that he does <i>explicitly exclude war deaths which occure within the laws of war.</i> and as there were no "international agreements and treaties directly or by implication prohibit[ing]" area bombings, and atomic bombings, the paragraph was incorrect. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Germans did not like it when the French used colonial troops from Africa against them, and used it to score propaganda points. This dates back to WWI. Use a little common sense. Do you really think that the soldiers from Northern Africa behaved so badly, or do you think that racism is behind these stories? Is there so little doubt in your mind that you think Wikipedia should risk its reputation based on sources that you can't read?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the date of publication, this is a common problem with many of these "sources". Accusing individuals of war crimes sixty years after the war is hardly fair, in that they have no opportunity to defend themselves. Most of these soldiers have passed away. It is unfair to accuse them of crimes, and unreasonable to pretend that this is a real debate when the important information is not available, and the accusations were not aired in a proper forum. These articles need to be more rigorously sourced, or simply removed. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHaber_f4d1.html" title="User:Haber">Haber</a> 20:43, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haber, I have a few problems with your position. First of all, one could argue that "common sense" is not wikipedia policy&#160;;-) anyway, I can read most of the sources cited in the Marocchinate article, since they are in Italian (I am Italian, I think I mentioned it, anyway it is in my user page). While it is true that some of the allegations might be exagerated, it is undoubtable, from those sources, that mass rape happened. Anyway, when Wikipedia policy allows the use of sources in other languages it means that it decidet it is worth risking its reputation.</dd>
<dd>Accusing individuals of war crimes sixty years later is not only fair, it is a duty! Just a few years ago, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Nazi war criminal <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Priebke_742a.html" title="Erich Priebke">Erich Priebke</a> was tried and sentenced as he deserved. But we're not talking about individuals, it is not a matter of court but of history. The article on Marocchinate is rigorously sourced, according to Wikipedia standards.</dd>
<dd>To PBS: the Marocchinate article uses lots of italian sources, including interviews with victims, and parliamentary discussions (an italian communist deputy mentioned 60.000 victims... you can hardly claim she was a neo-nazi!). These sources range from 1952 up to contemporary papers.</dd>
<dd>BTW, how can you describe Dresden as a "tactical strike"?</dd>
<dd>Re: sources on US area bombing, that's a reference to the UK entry to avoid duplication. US bombers took part in most bombings in Europe, including Dresden.</dd>

<p>Dresden was a city on a rail hub close to the front lines, ("<i>...figures for October 1944 ... A total of 28 military trains, altogether carrying almost twenty thousand officers and men, were in transit through Dresden-Neustadt each day. There is no reason to believe that three months later ... movements from eastern and western fronts would have decreased substantially"</i> Taylor <i>Dresden Tuesday 13th February 1945</i> page 186,187) that was the primary reason it was a target, the secondary reason was it was the largest unbombed German city and it contained war industries. Before the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam_Blitz_b7b2.html" title="Rotterdam Blitz">Rotterdam Blitz</a> and the decision on May 15 1940 to change RAF directives, the British had bombed German towns west of the Rhine if they were rail hubs (Taylor page 111) because they considerd them to be legitimate even under the restricted rules of engagement they were using at that time. Also before the 1944 June Landings in Normandy the RAF and the USAAF had bombed the French rail network at least as far removed from Normandy as Dresden was from the Eastern Front in a purly tacitcal support role.</p>
<p>Much better examples of German towns of the type that Friedrich is talking about are those which Detlef Siebert wrote about in an article on <i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/area_bombing_04.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/area_bombing_04.shtml" rel="nofollow">British Bombing Strategy in World War Two</a></i> for the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>: "Some ... like <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_W%C3%BCrzburg_in_World_War_II_7873.html" title="Bombing of Würzburg in World War II">Würzburg</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Pforzheim_in_World_War_II_65ec.html" title="Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II">Pforzheim</a>, were selected primarily because they were easy for the bombers to find and destroy.

<dd>While Dresden was also a rail hub, "British Air Commodore Grierson told journalists that the aim of Operation Thunderclap had been to bomb large population centres and prevent relief supplies from getting through" (from <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II_6c21.html" title="Bombing of Dresden in World War II">Bombing of Dresden in World War II</a>). I'd say an Air Commodore is a good enough source. So it was a strategic decision. While other bombings might better describe the phenomenon of area bombing, Dresden is more widely known, so it is better as an example to explain what we're talking about.</dd>

</div>
</div>
<p>The problem with that source was that Operation Thunderclap was never launched, (it was a contingency plan never activated), What Grierson said was: "<i>First of all they [Dresden and similar towns] are the centres to which evacuees are being moved. They are centres of communications through which traffic is moving across to the Russian Front, and from the Western Front to the East, and they are sufficiently close to the Russian Front for the Russians to continue the successful prosecution of their battle. I think these three reasons probably cover the bombing.</i>" Taylor writes on page 413 of <i>Dresden Tuesday 13 Feb 45</i> that "another journalist asked Grierson whether 'the principal aim of such bombing of Dresden would be to cause confusion among the refugees or to blast communications carrying military supplies'. 'primary communications' Grierson affirmed. 'To prevent them moving military supplies. To stop movement in all directions if possible - movement is everything.' He then added a fairly offhand remark about also trying to destroy 'what is left of German morale'"</p>
<p>The point is that Dresden was a major rail hub near to the front lines and was targeted primerily for that reason. (It would have fallen into the communications zone in the theater of operations). This is made clear in the section <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II_6c21.html#Reasons_for_the_attack" title="Bombing of Dresden in World War II">Bombing of Dresden in World War II#Reasons for the attack</a>. For example see the memo from Secretary of State for Air, to Churchill "<i>The Air Staff have now arranged that, subject to the overriding claims of attacks on enemy oil production and other approved target systems within the current directive, available effort should be directed against Berlin, Dresden, Chemnitz and Leipzig or against other cities where severe bombing would not only destroy communications vital to the evacuation from the east, but would also hamper the movement of troops from the west.</i>" coupled with the JIC recommendation "<i>We consider, therefore, that the assistance which might be given to the Russians during the next few weeks by the British and American strategic bomber forces justifies an urgent review of their employment to this end." --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:47, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>I think you've just disproved your point. You're mentioning theatre of operations, actions involving both the eastern and the western front at the same time... that's totally outside the realm of tactics, and into strategy.

<dd><b>Dresden-Goebbels Last Victory</b> The debate about the legtimacy of the strategic bombing offensive has now focused on a single point-the destruction of Dresden. Was the raid justified in tactical terms? Yes, it was. Was it specifically aimed at the killing of civilians? No, it was not. Not only was Dresden an important transport hub, used to transfer men and materials to the eastern front, it was also by 1945 a major centre of war manufactury. It was the last remaining significant target in eastern Germany. Most important of all the prefered target, Berlin, was too well-defended to serve the task Bomber Command had set itself-delivering a final knock-out blow against the enemy. By early 1945 the RAF was running short of the kind of high explosive bombs used to 'soften up' industrial targets in the past, and Dresden-aside from its strategic importance-was vulnerable to incendiary devices, of which there was a plentiful supply. The other side to this whole equation is the <i>criminal</i> incomptetence of the Nazi authorities in failing to ensure that the city was properly defended, lacking in both anti-aircraft cover and shelter provision. Martin Mutschmann, Gauleiter of Saxony, was later to admit as much, though he himself had ensured that at least his own family would be provided with shelter.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But in the end the real victor of the whole Dresden debate is Josef Goebbels. It was to be he who at an early stage defined the terms in which the raid would be perceived by history, from the bogus casualty figures to the wanton destruction of 'cultural innocence'. It suited the Soviets, left with a heap of ruins, to perpetuate the whole myth, with references in the Communist press to 'Anglo-American air gangsters', just as it suited David Irving and other pro-Nazi historians to attempt to blur the moral boundries between acts of war and atrocities. Goebbels would be proud-the bigger the lie the more likely it is to be believed. Apologise for Dresden?

<dd>Sorry for the delay, Lou. I was away. Anyway you're right we shouldn't assume anything is "common sense", but let's just figure this: 7000 Goumiers survive the battle. They are given 50 hours to rape and pillage. In that time they rape 60,000 women, children, elderly, and animals. This gives the average Goumier a rape rate of 4 rapes/day! If one assumes that a few of these men didn't participate because they feared retribution, were decent people or disciplined soldiers, had trouble finding victims, or were too physically exhausted after mountain warfare to rape four times a day, then the statistics become even more unbelievable. Personally I think that a group of men that is capable of taking mountains filled with well-entrenched German defenders can't be all bad soldiers, or human garbage. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources</a> is being stretched rather far given the "outlandishness" of the claims and the fact that English sources are preferred, but not mandatory.</dd>

<dd>As for timeliness. You're right- we should go after living criminals if we can catch them and give them fair trials. As for dead individuals or groups, I guess it would be much easier for me to consider an accusation if it came soon after the war rather than fifty years later, and didn't rely so much on statments that are alleged to have been said by the accused. But you have a point. If more evidence is presented, I will look at it.

<dd>Hey, we all have a real life (or so I hope), so delays are to be expected. They happen to me, too. I agree with you that 60.000 rapes is probably too much. Maybe some of them were raped, some only suffered some other forms of violence. But consider these facts:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Many goumiers were executed right after the action by their officers</li>
<li>The french government paid compensations to some thousands of victims</li>
<li>The italian government paid compensations (albeit late) to other victims, because of a law where it assumed the burden of compensating for allied-caused damage</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To me, this means that the event is real, and although the number of victims can be exagerated (as always) it is certainly a war atrocity.</dd>
<dd>And it isn't something which surfaced too late. The executions happened within days (in some cases, hours). The french goverment had paid its compensations before 1952.</dd>

<p>See above. Also, I did some editing of some lets just say "less than accurate" English and my explanations are all in my edit summaries. In your "crusade for NPOV" it seems you've given this article some special attention...labels, advisories...that no other war crimes article has. It is illogical to tag something if there is, conceivably, nothing that can be done to "fix" the article - its sole purpose is to concentrate on a select group's war crimes. Also...and I have had this discussion with PBS...ask yourself what it is exactly that makes Friedrich "controversial"? Is he fudging numbers? Is he manipulating sources?

<li>How would an article about Allied war crimes not be slanted against the Allies.

I think the criticism here is being directed towards the article itself. Is it fair to make an article that takes such a narrow focus, i.e. the dangers of international trade? I think so. However, there had better be a link out of the page that allows one to analyze the entire situation, not just a collapsed, sub-sub-sub category. One should note that other war crimes pages - including those that choose an even narrow context (ie <i>wehrmacht war crimes</i>) - have no such content advisory warnings. Perhaps it would be better to simply introduce the listing as <i>some argue that...</i> or something to that extent.--72.92.15.61 02:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe I didn't explain sufficiently, but in addition to my own comments on this discussion page, I agree with many of the comments of White Guard and PBS. There are some very specific discussions already here, which sufficiently explain what is going on.

<dl>
<dd><i>The phrase Allied war crimes refers to atrocities or other acts committed between 1939 and 1945 by the powers... '</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a nonsense: War crimes are war crimes and may or may not be atrocities (for example firing a gun while flying a false flag is a war crime, but it may not be an atrocity). Equally an atrocities may or may not be be war crime, for example the maltreatment ethnic minorities perceived by the Soviet Government to be sympathetic to the Germans is seen by many to have lead to atrocities.</p>
<p>The previous wording "Allied war crimes were those crimes of war committed by the Allies of World War II against civilian populations or the soldiers of the Axis Armed Forces, including those of the allies of the Axis." is much more accurate so I am reverting to the previous version --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>War crimes are "crimes of war". Please. It's a circular definition and sounds ridiculous. How about 'illegal acts'? Also, why mention both soldiers and civilians? Who else is there? That can probably be deleted altogether. The entire intro still reads conversational in tone.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh"><font color="olive"><i><b>Michael Dorosh</b></i></font></a><sup><small><small><i><b><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichael_Dorosh_51c9.html" title="User talk:Michael Dorosh"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></b></i></small></small></sup> 18:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fair point so I looked at what it says at the start of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crime</a> page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the context of war, a war crime is a punishable offense under International Law, for violations of the laws of war by any person or persons, military or civilian. Every violation of the law of war in an inter-state conflict is a war crime, while violations in internal conflicts are typically limited to the local jurisdiction. In essence, the term "war crime" represents the concept of an international jurisdiction as applicable to the most severe crimes, in areas where government is dysfunctional and society is in a state of turmoil.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and altered the start of this article to "<i>Allied war crimes were violations of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Laws_of_war.html" title="Laws of war">laws of war</a> committed by the Allies of World War II against civilian populations or the soldiers of the Axis Armed Forces...</i>" I left "<i>including those of the allies of the Axis.</i>" but I an not sure what it means and unless someone can explain why it is there I think it should be deleted. There is a difference between Axis Armed Forces and Axis civilians, becausse some of those who fought for the Axis were not citizens of an Axis state (eg some white Russians like <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Shkuro_0710.html" title="Andrei Shkuro">Andrei Shkuro</a>, or Indians of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_National_Army_a752.html" title="Indian National Army">Indian National Army</a>). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 23:47, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it works, Philip. As for the NPOV tag or any of the same variety, I'm still waiting for the explanation. Leaving individual comments from various sources concerning certain events (i.e. strategic bombing) is precisely why I think the article was slanted and the POV tag was merited. I believe it was mitsos who objected to the mass deletion of these "side comments", but it was clear where this was leading to, as the "explanation" opened the door for infinite point, counterpoint analysis, till we have essentially what is on the artice that the link takes us to. This page is more of a list than anything. If we choose to approach it differently, I fear there is too much material we are trying to work with. Small - <i>very small</i>- explanations seem suffice, but we should be mindful of POV.--72.92.12.154 09:15, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, concerning the rest of the introduction, the overemphasis on humanitarian law at the time in the intro - without including sources that quote otherwise - is pov so I have cut it down to a brief "you should consider this" type of rationale. --72.92.15.61 03:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The views that conventional area bombing and the atomic bombings were war crimes is not one which is widely held in the English speaking nations. For this reason any article which states that either of these two actions were war crimes should contain the name of the person or organisation who are making the accusations. Friedrich does not claim that all area bombardment was a war crime, and in the references I have seen the only explicit accusation he has made is for the period when the Allies renewed the strategic campaign against German cities from September 1944, (after the lull because of the tactical support supplied by the heavy bombers for the Normandy landings). I am in agreement with you about not including lots of counter claims (or alleged justifications for the allied actions) in this article, but the name and quality of the initial source of the claim should be in this article as it is a "Surprising or apparently important claims that are not widely known.

<dd>This article should, of course, present both sides of the argument about whether it was a war crime or not. We shouldn't be offended that an article such as this exists in Wikipedia, because the Allied powers and the members of their armed forces and political leadership sometimes made wrong decisions in how they conducted themselved during the conflict. We should, though, make sure that this article presents all sides of the issue. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 12:26, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a very good reference, I thing you should includ a mention in in the article. Does he only state crime or does he state war crime? Does he explian why he thinks area bombing was a war crime, (which laws of war were broken) and does he include American targeted bombing in Europe as a war crime? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:13, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He's very clear that the U.S. bombing campaign in Europe was <i>not</i> a crime, because it was directed at military targets. He says that the British nighttime bombing campaign, especially the firebombing, and the U.S. firebombing campaign in Japan were crimes, basically because they targeted civilians and the cultural institutions of their societies (homes, schools, etc.). I'll outline his argument for why he thinks they were against the laws of war here later once I have his book back in front of me. I think his argument should actually be stated in the "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II_e01d.html" title="Strategic bombing during World War II">Strategic bombing during World War II</a>" article with a brief synopsis of it here along with a

Of course if one thinks that the American bombing was different from the RAF in Europe one has to explain why the bomb mix used in the Dresden raid by the USAAF was similar to the RAF city busting mix and not the more usual US precision mix. One also has to explain the <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Berlin_in_World_War_II_6adb.html#March_1944_to_April_1945" title="Bombing of Berlin in World War II">raid on Berlin</a> on February 3 1945, along with many other raids of a similar type.

<dd>My copy of A. C. Grayling "Among the Dead Cities" has arrived. So I looked up page 276 he does not say it was a war crime. He starts his book on a chapter called "Introduction:Was it a crime" in which on page 4 he writes "Is this assertion - 'delierately mounting military attacks on civilian populations a moral crime? - an unqualified truth?". In the chapter "The case against the bombing" on page 226 he says of the 1907 Hague conventions "however legalistically one might claim that its provisions were not violated in the letter, seems quite clearly and emphatically violated in spirit by area bombing". On page 244 he examins Harris's claim that there was "no international law at all" and mentions that Geoffrey Best wrote that the assertion was not correct but "if he had restricted himself to saying that there was not much of it, and that what there was lay mostly in the relm of principles". In the chapter Judgement towards the end of the book which includes page 276 he says is that "The history behind the provisions of the 1977 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocol_I_d887.html" title="Protocol I">first protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949</a> is left in silence by [area bombing]. But its meaning is crystal clear; as a retrospective judgement on area bombing, it nominates it as a crime." (this is a sumation of his argument on page 237). He goes on to say on the next page "In short and in sum: was area bombing wrong? Yes. Very wrong? Yes" but he does not say it was a war crime. Indeed several times in the same chapter (Judgement) he uses the term "immoral act" (page 272) and "moral crime(s)" (pages 272, 274,275) to describe area bombing, he does not use the term "war crime".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I do not think that Grayling is addressing the question was area bombardment in World War II a war crime in the legal meaning, instead he is addressing the issue as a moral crime. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:22, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quote of his that I cited doesn't say "war crime," it says just, "crime." Starting on page 121, he goes into the history of war crime law, and, although he never explicitely states that area bombing violated these "laws," he implicitly states this. However, I believe that he stops short of asserting that the bombings were definite "war" crimes because there is some ambiguity in the "law." Therefore, he takes the approach of determining if they were moral crimes or not. Nevertheless, the one sentence where he leaves out the word "moral" and says just "crime" is perhaps an intentional effort to say that the bombings were crimes in other ways besides moral. I know this article is titled "Allied war crimes" and, if we need a source that explicitely states that area bombings were "war crimes" and not just "moral crimes," perhaps, on second thought, Grayling doesn't provide the source needed. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 00:00, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another possiblilty is in the book "Firestorm the bombing of Dresden", edited by Paul Addison and Jeremy Crang. It is a compliation of essays one per chapter. One chapter is entitled "Dresden as a War Crime by Donald Bloxham". But on reading it he is putting forward a similar type of moral position to Grayling (he also quotes Geoffrey Best), but with some specifics for the Dresden raid. The problem is that with <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare.html" title="Unrestricted submarine warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> there was positive international humanitarian law (<a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_London_Naval_Treaty_6be6.html" title="Second London Naval Treaty">Second London Naval Treaty</a> etc) which was broken, but with aerial bombardent there was no positive international humanitarian law, so one is left to look at such things as <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_necessity.html" title="Military necessity">Military necessity</a> which depends very strongly on a POV. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:15, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>this thread is moving quickly, so I thought it necessary to begin this here. Haber, take note that the article mentions that the appellation <i>war crime</i> covers more than those which were charged. It also reads underneath the info box that not all agree that these are war crimes. There is no need to repeat essentially the same information a <i>third time</i>, especially in the form of bright, flashing boxes that scream "hello, here is my point of view"--72.94.202.237 00:08, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've introduced a couple of items to the article recently. In both items that I placed in the article, arguments can be made either way, and probably should be in the article, as to whether they are really war crimes or not. I'm sure this has been discussed already with reference to this article, but the article title itself is problematic, since it appears to assume that all of the instances mentioned in the article are presumed to be war crimes, when that's not necessarily the case. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 12:20, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The specific targeting of Dresdens civilian population by the war criminal bomber harris isn't mentioned in this article. I see from the chatter on this page that a bunch of english revisionists have decided to pervert history (once again). Don't you people give a shit about reality? Squealing about POV and ignorantly chopping away at articles until they contain nothing at all. Bomber Harris was a war criminal who specifically targeted civilian areas to terrorise the German populace. The people who removed this fact are racists/imperialists who wrap themselves in the blood soaked union jack, the butchers apron. Your english history books don't contain the information because you learn propaganda not history, don't confuse your ignorance with reality. Ignorance is not a point of view children.

<dd>I thought it was a given that it was a war crime, but I guess I'll have to try to find the time to look into that. For now, the Hague convention from 1907 <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> article 43 might cover it, depending on interpretation "The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.". Then the Nuremburg trials used the conscept of "ill treatment of civilian population" for some acts comited by Nazi Germany during the war. Article 6 of the Nuremburg Charter provides: <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/judlawre.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/judlawre.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages. or devastation not justified by military necessity;</dd>

<dd>First, the Danes. Please try to find the direct reference (the paper this newspaper article is talking about), and include a reference from the Danish viewpoint. I'm wary of the extraordinary claims that 80% of children under 5 died and "What kind of monsters masquerading as human beings were those Danish doctors of 1945?" A lot of psychological speculation seems to be going on without facts to back it up.</dd>

Rereading it I realised that the question of legality of the actions in question are extensively reviewed in the book, so it's indeed a warcrime under Hague IV as the US then interpreted it.

<dd>Having looked at it, I am amazed at how bad it is. The statements are usually unverifiable, stating things like "During Senate hearings in Washington in 1946, another witness testified that" or "He explained to one U.S. Senator", but does not mention what witness, what hearings, what senator, or what he is using as a source! The author does however admit that he represent a minority view on this subject: "The ensuing famine continued for nearly three years, but the few scholars who have examined the issue have concluded that the German famine was simply a tragic by-product of world-wide food shortages." <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 23:04, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you jump far to quickly to unwarranted conclusions, It is just a list of literature dealing with the subject, of which Bacques book is one of the more well known, regardless of its credibility. Not listing it would have been a flaw. The author also uses the words "novelist" and "alleged" when refering to him. He also lists the work which Bacques angriest critic Ambrose wrote in responce to Bacques earlier book. As to the minority view, I again think you reach too hasty conclusions. If you read the paragraph after the one you chose to quote what he seems to say is that he has investigated an important aspect of the occupation that most other authors have either been unaware of or have neglected to research.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 09:02, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even the paper states that the major causes of the famine was the utter desctruction of infrastructure and social organizations in Germany due to the war and the bad weather (and that the famine affected the US part of Germany the least). The author thinks that part of the famine was caused by malice by deliberately not distrubting available food, I see the quotes as supporting that there was a widespread famine in Europe and that the allies primarily argued that the Germany should not have more food than other parts of Europe.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 09:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess we come to very different conclusions when reading the paper then. As I see it the situation was bad all over europe, but the allies made it deliberately worse in Germany. As Clay stated: "The U.S. Deputy Military Governor, Lucius Clay, confided that "I feel that the Germans should suffer from hunger and from cold as I believe such suffering is necessary to make them realize the consequences of a war which they caused,”". When the situation was gettin OK in the rest of europe in early 1947 there was still famine in Germany as President <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>'s report shows <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=11&amp;documentid=24&amp;documentdate=1947-02-28&amp;studycollectionid=mp&amp;nav=OK" class="external text" title="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=11&amp;documentid=24&amp;documentdate=1947-02-28&amp;studycollectionid=mp&amp;nav=OK" rel="nofollow">read it here</a>. The section in the document we're discussing called "The Isolationist as Interventionist: Senator William Langer on the Subject of Ethnic Cleansing, March 29, 1946 Charles M. Barber" also partly discusses the area and time-period and might be intresting to read for context. I might not be able to respond further for a few days due to work so bear with me if I'm silent for a while.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 11:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, he quotes selectively (and you from him), but even so I think that the primary argument was the Germany should not be better off than the other European nations, and secondarily that this should also be a lesson. Note also that the destruction in Germany was far worse than in the rest of Western Europe, with a very large part of the most produtive male population dead or dying in the Russian POW camps. All major ciites were reduced to rubble (and in the Soviet zone whatever remained of industry was dismantled and removed to the Soviet Union). A large part of the population were refugees and could not return what was now Poland and the Soviet Union. So obviously a famine would be worse and last longer in Germany than in the rest of Western Europe. Finally, the famine in Germany was insignificant compared to what took place at the same time in the Soviet Union, where at the same time over million people died from famine.<a href="http://www.mellenpress.com/mellenpress.cfm?bookid=646&amp;pc=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mellenpress.com/mellenpress.cfm?bookid=646&amp;pc=9" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>

<dd>The Danish event seems much more clear (according to the discussion here) than the U.S.-witholding-food-from-the-Germans.

<dd>I resent this. If such a section is to be added then it should also mention that thousands of German children were offered the chance to come to Denmark after the war. That Denmark, being left virtually unharmed due to the non-violent surrender of the German troops here and the fact that the British never made it to Danish soil before the Germans surrendered, offered these completely innoncent children hospitality and a chance to get away from the completely bombed out Germany where they would have been left to take care of themselves. You cite 2 German newspaper articles. How is that in any way NPOV?

<dd>I'm sure that it's true that Denmark assisted many German children after the war. But, it also appears to be true that in at least one instance, that didn't happen. This article exists to document crimes or events that may have been crimes. I'm sure another article can exist, if it doesn't already, that shows the successful humanitarian efforts of the Allied countries after the war, including Denmark. That, however, is a separate article from this one. I don't feel threatened or resent the fact that some Allied personnel didn't act as honorably as they should have in World War II. It's obvious by how short this article is that these incidents were isolated and uncommon. But it doesn't change the fact that some crimes occurred and should be documented. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 21:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From the Spiegel article:</dd>
<dd><i>In the final weeks of the war, between February 11 and May 5, about 250,000 German refugees fled across the Baltic Sea to escape the sinking German Reich. Most were from East Prussia, Pomerania and the Baltic provinces and were fleeing the Soviet Army. And most were women, children or elderly. A third of the refugees were younger than 15 years old.</i></dd>
<dd><i>When they landed, they found themselves stranded in putative freedom and at the start of a new martyrdom. The refugees were interned in hundreds of camps from Copenhagen to Jutland, placed behind barbed wire and guarded by heavily armed overseers. The largest camp was located in Oksboll, on the west coast of Jutland, and had 37,000 detainees.</i></dd>

<dd>Denmark was occupied by the Germans! Nothing took place with out the approval of the Germans. The only armed guards in Denmark at the time were the German army and the Gestapo. Denmark was not a free self-ruling country until May 5. From August 1943 the Danes were without a legitimate government. You cannot possibly in any way refer to these socalled documented events as crimes committed by Danes against Germans as "revenge". Denmark was not a free country, how hard is that to understand? As for the murder allegations against Danish doctors in the article I would like to remind you that such charges must be proved. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 21:19, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply to <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">User:Ultramarine</a> I do not believe that I quote selectively. The quote I used was to show just what the reasoning behind U.S. activities, or lack thereof, was. Clay had to say things like that to be taken seriously, regardless of his true feelings. If you disbelieve that U.S. policymakers back in Washington were hungry for blood in the year immediately following the surrender then I can recommend reading: Casey, Steven (2005) <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/archive/00000736/" class="external text" title="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/archive/00000736/" rel="nofollow">The campaign to sell a harsh peace for Germany to the American public, 1944–1948</a>.

<p>And I think mr Lightner sums it up beautifully <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/lightner.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/lightner.htm" rel="nofollow">Interview with E. Allan Lightner, Jr.</a> <b>LIGHTNER:</b> Well, to us those months between V-E Day and mid-'46 seemed a long time. That's when much of the dismantling was taking place. It was a crucial period when much time was being lost in restoring the economy and our group in CE found that we were being opposed at every turn by those who wanted to carry out literally the provisions of JCS-l067. You know, Jimmy Riddleberger was the one who sweated out this whole business of dealing with the Civil Affairs Division of the War Department during the days of planning for the occupation of Germany, and also later on in dealing with the Kindleberger group. <b>MCKINZIE:</b> You look at the period between the Morgenthau plan and the Marshall plan, one of which represents a "salted earth" policy, and the other an industrial development policy. The question of historians who are always concerned with pinning things down to precise things inevitably comes down to: what was the turning point? Was there any particular event or any absolutely crucial time period in which the change from the Morgenthau plan to the direction of the Marshall plan was made? <b>LIGHTNER:</b> I think it was fairly gradual. I think the military had their directives based, as I said before, very much on the philosophy of the Morgenthau plan, the basic JCS-l067.</p>
<p>I’m curious as regards to the allegation in your first sentence anyway <i>Again, he quotes selectively (and you from him)</i> Can you please provide any examples of where Richard Dominic Wiggers is supposed to quote selectively? And why the use of the word <i>"again"</i>?, I can’t se you making this claim before anywhere in the talk page text.</p>
<p>As to the refugee situation caused by the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II_31b3.html" title="Expulsion of Germans after World War II">Expulsion of Germans after World War II</a> these were a consequence of the territorial changes the <i>Allies</i> had ageed upon.

<p>As to the situation in Germany; yes it was bad, with many millions of Germans used as forced labor, both by the Russians, the Americans, the French, and the British.

<p>And yes, the industry was being dismantled in the Soviet zone, but this was done not only by the Russians, but by all the Allies, both by the Americans, British, French and the Russians.

<p>What I’m trying to say with all this wearisome text, is that: Yes the situation was bad in Germany, but the official Allied policy made it stay that way, or even made it worse, which also is the conclusion of Richard Dominic Wiggers, in<i>The United States and the Refusal to Feed German Civilians after World War II</i>. As to the situation in Russia, that can hardly have any relevance for Allied culpability for the situation in Germany, unless it can be shown that what was done to the Germans is justified by the starving Russians. In any case, what the Germans were put through in the first year of Allied occupation, and which had repercussions for them for several years thereafter, was a violation of International law.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 21:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Most of the sources I’ve cited are admissible, with the exception of the national archives notes, the interviews, and possibly the Hoover reports, but in any case rules for talk pages are much less strict than for article pages. The author does not admit being a minority in my view, please provide a source that deals with Allied food policy that contradicts him. I expect you will find none, since no-one else has dealt with the subject, defacto making him a majority of one.

<dd>Your own synthesis and conclusions constitute original research. I suggest you try to publish in a scholarly journal. Regarding minority view, as he himself states, "The ensuing famine continued for nearly three years, but the few scholars who have examined the issue have concluded that the German famine was simply a tragic by-product of world-wide food shortages." and gives the sources you listed yourself above.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 22:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was simply responding to your statements (or OR if you prefer) ,<i>"Note also that the destruction in Germany was far worse than in the rest of Western Europe, with a very large part of the most produtive male population dead or dying in the Russian POW camps. All major ciites were reduced to rubble (and in the Soviet zone whatever remained of industry was dismantled and removed to the Soviet Union). A large part of the population were refugees and could not return what was now Poland and the Soviet Union. So obviously a famine would be worse and last longer in Germany than in the rest of Western Europe."</i> I responded point by point trying to show that you were not providing the full picture, and using sources easily accessible on the internet to do so.</dd>
<dd>I have no need to publish anything, as what I have written is not anything new. The synthesis you claim I made has already been done by the book authors I’ve provided. Petrov, Dietrich, and Wiggers. As well as by the authors of the magazine articles such as <a href="http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ray Salvatore Jennings <i>The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq</i></a> May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49, and probably also by many others. Regarding minority views, the same conclusions are independently reached by Dietrich in his 2002 book, making Wiggers less of a supposed minority. As to the quote, with a bit more of its text:</dd>
<dd><i>"The first Allied assessments of the food situation indicated that there were acute shortages, and that starvation was almost certain to occur within occupied Germany later in the year. The ensuing famine continued for nearly three years, but the few scholars who have examined the issue have concluded that the German famine was simply a tragic by-product of world-wide food shortages.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The situation in defeated Germany was unique, however, because the feeding of a civilian population ruled under conditions of belligerent occupation was considered by most contemporary experts to be an obligation under international law.</i>"</dd>
<dd>It shows that the other few who have bothered with the subject have not considered the legal aspects, I.e. the Allied responsibility for feeding the Germans that they had forced into unconditional surrender and thus taken full control over.</dd>
<dd>I don't se how the book abstract you provided shall mean anything. Has it anything specific about Germany to say?--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 22:59, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The abstract give quite different explanations than malice. Again, Wiggers give a long list of prior works after mentioning that prior scholars have different views than him.

<p>Please, enough with the dramatic allegations. <i>a nefarious Soviet Plot, implemented by spies like the plan's creator and Soviet spy Harry Dexter</i>.Indeed. Yes, Dietrich thinks that White was a Soviet agent, and since he was a driving force behind the Morgenthau plan Dietrich speculates that it might have been part of a communist plot to weaken Germany, possibly also western Europe, and pave the way for communist takeovers. But that is just a very minor part of the book, mostly Dietrich just describes the main events of the plans inception and the resulting effects of its implemented offshoots. Regardless of Whites political affiliations, he could not have achieved the plan on his own, the plan just reflected the general U.S. government attitude of the times. And as regards White as an agent, as Beschloss writes in my copy of "The Conquerors" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7432-4454-0</a>): pg. 153 <i>"Since White was the chief spur to one of Franklin Roosevelt's chief advisers on post-war Germany, whether or not White was secretly acting on behalf of the Soviet Union is no small matter."</i> When shown, by D.M. Ladd a top Hoover assistant, the FBI evidence against White in January 1952 Morgenthau was horrified. To Morgenthau "there seemed <i>"no question but that White was working for the Russians."</i>". Also on page 153 Beschloss goes on to describe the testimony of Henry Morgenthau III that Morgenthau spent the rest of his life wondering if White had manipulated him, he was never able to resolve the issue in his mind. There can be little doubt that White pushed very hard for the Morgenthau plan, but, as Beschloss says on page 156 (slightly paraphrased), we may never know what motivated Whites actions. His own philosophy; Soviet bribes or other pressure; an allegiance to the Soviet Union; or an arrogance that he knew best how to deal with the Soviets. That aside, I don’t think the Morgenthau plan merits mention in this article, that would entail speculating on the motives behind the U.S. nutritional policy vis-à-vis the conquered civilian population. Lets just state the facts. The U.S. was under international law responsible for feeding the Germans properly. The U.S. did not do so, resulting in needless suffering and death. Wiggins and Dietrich provide evidence and conclude that the withholding of food was deliberate. Theirs might be a minority view (depending on what actually is written in the list of books Wiggins provides, if they just deal with the general world food situation without looking on how available food was meted out (or not meted out) to Germans by the U.S. occupation authorities then they don’t count.) As long as no-one here has actually read any of the books and can provide info on what their content is I don’t think we can blindly claim that Wiggins is in the minority. My suggestion, state the facts provided by Wiggins, and that he might be in a minority, although there are no books previous to his that directly contradict him. (I expect that for fair plays sake he would have mentioned if there were any such) (A quick google search on his name shows no-one that mentions him to dispute him either, for whatever that's worth).--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 00:36, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no requirement that anyone should read all the supporting sources for a scholarly article. For example, I am not demanding that you should present evidence that you have read all of Wiggins sources. Wiggins states that he represents a minority just like he states that there was a war crime; you cannot demand that some of his statements should be selectively accpeted and other other not; that is a double standard.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 11:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A majority of those have concluded that the famine in Germany that persisted for three years was a result of world-wide food shortage. However, they have not taken into consideration the fact that the feeding of the German population was an Allied obligation under international law.

<dd>So far as I can tell I’m only rephrasing the authors initial paragraph. There were several years of famine in Germany. Few scholars have reviewed their subject. Their conclusion was that it was due to global food shortages. They have not considered, <b>however</b>, that the feeding of Germans was an Allied legal responsibility. That last part is by the way the reason we’re discussing it here. The author, in a reputable book (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0880339950</a>), writes that Allied actions were in violation of article 43 of The Hague Rules of Land Warfare. That clearly merit’s the subjects inclusion in this article.</dd>
<dd>Please show exactly what words in my proposal are supposed to be original research. Also, I don’t se you making any counter proposal, just some weird "minority space" statement.</dd>
<dd>In addition, please stop telling me to publish a book, I’m quite frankly getting annoyed. So far all I seem to get from you in this discussion are baseless allegations, such as your initial hasty claim that the book in question did not cite its sources, or that the author "quotes selectively". You still haven’t responded to my request that you show where he is supposed to do so by the way. And I hope that your previous mention of Soviet industrial dismantling in Germany without also mentioning French, U.S. and UK industrial dismantling was a case of ignorance and not a deliberate attempt to mislead.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 22:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Statements like "However, they have not taken into consideration" are pov, is the view of one scholar, not the truth. Soviet dismantling was far worse and the Soviet Union did not give any Marshall help. An npov statement would be "A minority of scholars see the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgenthau_plan.html" title="Morgenthau plan">Morgenthau plan</a> and a failure to provide adequate nutrition to the civilians in post war occupied Germany as a war crime. Most scholars see the famine as part of a general European famine at this time and caused by such factors as the general destruction caused by the war and bad weather."

<dd>If Stor stark7 was going out and interviewing the actual participants in this event, or reviewing unit reports and records, then that would constitute original research. As far as I can tell, his sources are secondary accounts, and thus, not original research. It looks to me like he has enough to support a paragraph about it in the article.

<dd>In his proposal above everything is sourced to Wiggers article. Again, this is the view of one scholars, not something accepted as established fact in the academic community. Stating things like "However, they have not taken into consideration" is POV, at the very least "Wiggers claims". I also note that is a conference paper, not a paper published in an journal, and that no person cited has this paper despite that is was published in 2003. No other scholar considers it important.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 03:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>1. Fine, I'll draft another proposal, this time also sourcing to Dietrichs book. Then we wont have only the one source. I’ll take your proposal into account when making it.</li>
<li>2.This is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> Conference paper, that made it into a book published by the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_Press_1861.html" title="Columbia University Press">Columbia University Press</a>. I think that gives far more credibility than you seem to want to imply.</li>
<li>3 Please qualify your OR statements that <i>"no person cited has this paper despite that is was published in 2003"</i> and "<i>No other scholar considers it important"</i>. Which books on the subject have been published since the books publication, and how many of them have you read to be able to make that categorical OR statement?</li>
<li>4. Your statement that <i>"Soviet dismantling was far worse and the Soviet Union did not give any Marshall help"</i> sounds to me like you’re trying to say the equivalent of "look, the Russians were even worse than us, so what we did doesn’t really count". That foray into second guessing your intentions aside, the Marshall plan has exactly what relevance to this? The Marshall plan was not extended to also cover Germany until sometime 1948-49, way past the time period we‘re discussing (1945-47).</li>
<li>5 Your proposal included the sentence <i>"Most scholars see the famine as part of a general European famine at this time and caused by such factors as the general destruction caused by the war and bad weather."</i> Isn’t this clearly a case of OR? Or am I missing something? <i>"Most scholars"</i> needs qualifying that very few scholars have examined the subject, I.e. <i>"most scholars"</i> have not publicly committed themselves to any opinion on the subject. And as to the statement <i>"and caused by such factors as the general destruction caused by the war and bad weather."</i>, source?; who has stated this conclusion, and where?--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 18:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Once again I must remind the less informed that Denmark was occupied by the Germans, was without a legitimate government and that these refugee camps were set up by the German army themselves. Nothing took place without the approval of the German army and/or the Gestapo. Also you might want to take a closer look at how the Germans themselves regarded these refugees. I do not for one second dispute the crimes committed by the Red Army as it moved its way through Eastern Europe. What I object to is the idea that some how Denmark was in control of its own country at a time when there was no legitimate government and the comepletely legal resistance against the German agressors was at its highest. Also, allegations of crimes must be proved. You are playing judge, jury and executioner without the slightest regard to people's legal rights. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 07:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you! As we already established over at <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis Powers</a> Denmark was not part of the Allies in the sense that it was not deploying military against the Germans (or anyone else for that matter). Denmark was, especially after August 1943 when the government resigned and the Germans were de facto in full control, considered a country friendly to the allies but Denmark was not part of the group of countries actively fighting the German army. The resistance carried out operations inside Denmark at the request of the British but there was no real army fighting the Germans. The army was defeated after only a few hours on the morning of April 9 1940. After that and until August 1943 the army was inactive and of no real use to anybody. Denmark never took part in any kind of actual warfare, we were freed by the British after the Germans surrendered to the British when they were at the border between Denmark and Germany. Our odd relationship with the Germans has been described on the above mentioned article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 20:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe MartinDK is correct. Denmark was a member of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Comintern_Pact_c477.html" title="Anti-Comintern Pact">Anti-Comintern Pact</a>, arguably making it a member, or at minimum a collaborator, of the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers_of_World_War_II_4f4a.html" title="Axis powers of World War II">Axis</a>. Therefore, the crime detailed above should probably be in the appropriate Axis war crime article although this crime was, technically, committed against a fellow Axis country. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 01:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. That I can fully accept because in that way it would be clear to the reader that Denmark was not engaging in warfare against Germany. Putting this in the Axis war crime article would also not confuse the reader who might otherwise come to the very wrong conclusion that Denmark was in control of our own country because we weren't. We were occupied by an army that we were not able to, and at the beginning of the war not willing to, properly resist.

<dd><i>After the fall of the government, Denmark was exposed to the full extent of Nazi power.

<dd>German officials cooperated with the smuggling since they disagreed with the order to persecute the Danish Jews, so this argument is not that strong. Prezen 18:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Denmark didn't have a "government in exile" like France, Norway, or Poland. Although many of the people of Denmark resisted, such as in the Jewish boatlift or the resistance, the Danish government appears to have collaborated, albeit under some duress. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 02:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The only legitimate government in Denmark during the war had resigned in 1943. There was no legal government, the country was in the hands of the Germans. The reason the Jews could be transported out of Denmark was because the body of water that needed to be crossed to the so-called neutral Sweden is very narrow. As a Swede I would imagine that you understand this. Second, do you really believe that right under the nose of the Germans, without any intervention by the German army, the non-existant Danish army would have been able to establish virtual death-camps for German refugees?</dd>
<dd>You need to make up your minds. Do you consider Denmark a collaborator of the Germans or an allied power who comitted crimes against innoncent Germans. Can't be both unless you want us to believe that the Danes were actually Germans who enjoyed killing their own refugees. Are you seriously suggesting that parts of Denmark was not under German control?! That would indeed be not only original research but downright revolutionary ground-breaking historical research. Also could you please post more sources than the one thesis mentioned because all the others are just reviews of that thesis.

<p>Please, enough with placing words in my mouth and then trying the demonstrate that they are wrong. That’s weasel tactics. I’ll concede that Denmark’s legal status as part of the Allies is dubious. Maybe they were part of the Nazi camp. Probably they were not. They were not occupied as a defeated nation, you’ll agree to that I hope. Anyway, since British troops landed in Norway to disarm the Germans there I suppose Denmark was also “occupied” by Allied troops. This question obviously needs looking into, and maybe it means that the fate of the refugees does not belong in this specific article. That remains as yet unclear however.</p>
<p>As to the Jewish flight, my only conclusion is that the German occupation must have been relatively mild, with few soldiers, since it is not only a question of transporting people across a fairly narrow strait, it is also a question of transporting all of them under time duress and undetected from all across the country to that specific strait. <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;z=6&amp;ll=55.912273,6.745605&amp;spn=4.914616,20.43457&amp;om=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;z=6&amp;ll=55.912273,6.745605&amp;spn=4.914616,20.43457&amp;om=1" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> This is a moot point to the issue anyway.</p>
<p>Your main argument seems to be that Germans were in control of Germany, and thus would not have let the Danes place them in camps behind barbed wire. Perhaps not, for those few weeks. But could, and did, the German authorities force reluctant Danish doctors to treat German civilians? Against the fierce arguing on your part stands the fact that the refugees came in the last few weeks of the war, and were there at least until the end of 1945. Plenty of time for the Danes to have full control over their fate. Plenty of time for German toddlers to die. Anyway I presume you’re Danish, since you seem to have such strong POV on the subject. Thus I presume you can read a quote from a reputable Swedish (possibly the most neutral country in the world….) daily newspaper. “Men ingen har på allvar kunnat bestrida att Lylloff avslöjat en skamfläck i nyare dansk historia” <a href="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_13200664.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_13200664.asp" rel="nofollow">SvD</a> (in swedish). Or why not read what a Danish newspaper, arguably not POV against Denmark, has to say. <a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/get/87301.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cphpost.dk/get/87301.html" rel="nofollow">the Copenhagen Post</a>(in english)</p>
<p>As to the fact that all is ultimately based on the research by Kirsten Lylloff, that is fairly natural, since the issue seems to have been buried until she discovered it by chance. The reason it took so long to surface I would personally speculate can partly be attributed to reactions such as I have witnessed here. Regardless, her research seems not to have been successfully challenged by anyone, and in addition to her work and publication in various journals, the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (<a href="http://www.dr.dk/OmDR/About+DR/20060703144527.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dr.dk/OmDR/About+DR/20060703144527.htm" rel="nofollow">Danish State public service TV</a>) has done a documentary on the subject, which as regards NPOV support of her thesis can be regarded as a fairly good indication…. <a href="http://www.dr.dk/dokument/aarhus/Kun%20en%20tysker/kun_en_tysker.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dr.dk/dokument/aarhus/Kun%20en%20tysker/kun_en_tysker.html" rel="nofollow">Danish TV documentary</a>--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 19:57, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK we are getting somewhere now. First of all it appears that we now agree that Denmark was not an allied power. In fact Denmark was was not a power at all and hadn't been for over 100 years. Remember how Norway became part of Sweden&#160;?&#160;;) Denmark was considered friendly to the allies, partly because the resistance became stronger with the support of the British and partly because as the war progressed it became obvious that Denmark was the small piece of land that laid in the way of the Soviets having free naval accaess to the Atlantic. So we benefited from that.</dd>
<dd>With regard to what happened <i>after</i> the war then yes it is definately documented that refugees who were shipped here by the Germans during the last months of the war were treated in accordance with the popular opinion at the time which was, when reviewed many years later, not good. However, I must insist that at the same time any section on this point to the obvious irony that German children were offered to come here after the war and recieved very generous hospitality especially when you consider the fate that they would have encountered in their own bombed out country. This self-contradicting duality must be stressed because like many thing about the occupation of Denmark it illustrates the very odd relationship we had with the Germans. On the one hand they were hated and treated accordingly, on the other hand there were plenty of examples of the exact opposite. With regard to neutrality I was refering to the fact that Sweden whilst officially neutral was extremely helpful to the Danish during the war and afterwards when the bombed out parts of Bornholm needed to be rebuilt. And I know for a fact that the Danes are grateful for this help. Finally it should be pointed out tha the Germans were not taking care of their own refugees and the Soviets sure weren't treating German refugees correctly.

<dd>The hatred she talks about in the article you linked to was not at all apparent until the Germans decided to take full control in August 1943. Up to that point pretty much the only people actively trying to resist was the resistance (of which my grandfather was a member so I know about this). The government even encouraged Danes to turn over those who resisted to the Germans and the public was not being very helpful to the resistance to say the least. This changed after August 1943 <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 07:55, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>With regard to the disarming of the Germans you should be aware that the Germans in Denmark did not resist the surrender. They co-operated and the whole process was (relatively) peaceful. British troops did arrive in Denmark since for a very short while Denmark was technically under British control. The whole process was a lot more complicated in Norway. The Norwegians suffered much more and there was actual fighting going on there. You cannot compare the two, if nothing else then due to respect for the Norwegians themselves.</dd>

<p><b>Proposed section on Denmark</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>During the last months of the war German refugees arrived in Denmark from areas now under Soviet control. These refugees had been shipped to Denmark following the fierce fighting on the Eastern front. After the war endend on May 5 1945 and the responsibility of these camps was transferred to the Danes themselves it has been documented that these refugees continued to be placed in camps inside Denmark under heavy security and recieved poor medical treatment. In addition to this surviving refugees have explained that they were not being provided with sufficient food. A large number of these German refugees died. Danish officials from the Red Cross have later explained that this was due to the popular opinion at the time. After the war a large number of German children were offered to stay in Denmark, the so-called <i>feriebørn</i> and those were not placed in camps but with Danish families who chose offer their hospitality.</dd>

<p>Where does this come from: "However, the prevalent international legal opinion is that these bombings were not a war crime."?

<dd>Since nobody seems to object, I'll remove this line and the accompying refs for the time being. The refs are these: "John Bolton <i>"<a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/lcp/articles/lcp64dWinter2001p167.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/lcp/articles/lcp64dWinter2001p167.htm" rel="nofollow">The Risks and Weaknesses of the International Criminal Court from America's Perspective</a></i>", US ambassador to the United Nations, Winter 2001; "ICRC"<a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1" class="external text" title="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1" rel="nofollow">International Review of the Red Cross no 323, p.347-363 The Law of Air Warfare (1998)</a>"</dd>
<dd>Both refs in fact <i>do not specificaly justify</i> atomic warfare, or show any proof that the prevalent international legal opinion does so. John Bolton's speech mentions atomic warfare in the following passage:</dd>
<dd><i>A fair reading of the treaty, for example, leaves the objective observer unable to answer with confidence whether the United States was guilty of war crimes for its aerial bombing campaigns over Germany and Japan in World War II. Indeed, if anything, a straightforward reading of the language probably indicates that the court would find the United States guilty. A fortiori, these provisions seem to imply that the United States would have been guilty of a war crime for dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is intolerable and unacceptable.</i></dd>
<dd>This simply means that Bolton allows for the possibility that atomic bombing may, internationaly, be considered as a war crime.</dd>
<dd>The second ref ("The Law of Air Warfare") includes this passage:</dd>
<dd><i>What may be used in air warfare?</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>The weapons that may be used are governed by the principle of limitation and military necessity laid down in international humanitarian law, which imposes certain constraints on the choice of means of warfare and stipulates that their use must be necessary.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg provides an example of this; it states that hostile operations must be aimed exclusively at securing a military advantage and prohibits the use of projectiles weighing less than 400 grammes which are either explosive or charged with fulminating or inflammable substances. There are other prohibitions and regulations relating to the means that may be employed for air warfare, among which the following are the most important.</i></dd>
<dd><i>— Causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. (...)</i></dd>
<dd><i>— Causing widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. (...)</i> etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This can simply not be read to mean that "the prevalent international legal opinion is that these bombings were not a war crime". It can be argued that the bombings were a military necesity, but a counterargument that superfluos injury, unnecessary suffering and widespread, long-term and severe damage to the enviroment was caused can quite as easily be raised. No <i>prevalent legal opinion</i> can be deduced, however. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 19:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bolton's point is precisly made for the reason the US will not sign the Rome Treaty over this issue. That to do so would possibly prohibit the US using such weapons in a future war. That implies that in the opinion of the US Government lawers the use of such weapons are not prohibited by previous international humanterian law. The second reference <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> makes the point in the secction on World War II entitled "Anti-city strategy/blitz" that "In examining these events [Anti-city strategy/blitz] in the light of international humanitarian law, it should be borne in mind that during the Second World War there was no agreement, treaty, convention or any other instrument governing the protection of the civilian population or civilian property, as the Conventions then in force dealt only with the protection of the wounded and the sick on the battlefield and in naval warfare, hospital ships, the laws and customs of war and the protection of prisoners of war."</p>
<p>See also the UK's position on Ratification and Accession to "Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949" (expressed in a Declaration on 2 July 2002) that states that "It continues to be the understanding of the United Kingdom that the rules introduced by the Protocol apply exclusively to conventional weapons without prejudice to any other rules of international law applicable to other types of weapons. In particular, the rules so introduced do not have any effect on and do not regulate or prohibit the use of nuclear weapons."<a href="http://www.icrc.ch/IHL.nsf/NORM/0A9E03F0F2EE757CC1256402003FB6D2?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icrc.ch/IHL.nsf/NORM/0A9E03F0F2EE757CC1256402003FB6D2?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Which suggests that the HMG holds a simalr POV to that of the US Government. And remember these are current POVs not those of 1945, which of course predates many of the more recent treaties which may (or may not) bind states which use or threaten to use neuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So as the Governments of the two largest English speaking nations do not consider that the use of the atomic bombs was at the time or since to be against the laws of war it is reasonable to include the sentence to balance the POV, particularly as <i><a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryuichi_Shimoda_et_al._v._The_State_5db3.html" title="Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State">Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State</a></i> also makes the point:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"[I]nternational law of war is not formulated simply on the basis of humanitarian feelings. It has as its basis both considerations of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_necessity.html" title="Military necessity">military necessity</a> and effectiveness and humanitarian considerations, and is formulated on a balance of these two factors. To illustrate this, an example often cited in the textbooks may be given, of the provisions of the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 prohibiting the use of projectiles under 400 grammes which are either explosive or charged with combustible or inflammable substances. The reason for the prohibition is explained as follows: such projectiles are small and just powerful enough to kill or wound only one man, and as an ordinary bullet will do for this purpose, there is no overriding need for using these inhuman weapons. On the other hand, the use of a certain weapon, great as its inhuman result may be, need not be prohibited by international law it it has a great military effect." (Section:Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: point (11):second paragraph)</dd>
</dl>
<p>With reference to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks <i><a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryuichi_Shimoda_et_al._v._The_State_5db3.html" title="Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State">Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State</a></i> made a case for the attacks being outside the laws of war BUT basing their arguments on the <i><a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/0/b9ca3866276e91cfc12563cd002d691c?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/0/b9ca3866276e91cfc12563cd002d691c?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">1923 Draft Hague Rules of Air Warfare</a></i> while ignoring the later <i><a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/0/910f79361f226492c125641e004057ed?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/0/910f79361f226492c125641e004057ed?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">Draft Convention for the Protection of Civilian Populations Against New Engines of War, Amsterdam, 1938</a></i> (where a defended city was defined) draws into question the usefulness of the judgement, which is not widly quoted as a precedent under interntional law (for example AFAICT the 1996 <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Court_of_Justice_d564.html" title="International Court of Justice">ICJ</a> advisory opinion on the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legality_of_the_Threat_or_Use_of_Nuclear_Weapons_31de.html" title="Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons">Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</a> did not quote its findings as a precedent).</p>
<p>So all in all I think that the extra sentence and the references should be included to balance the POV of the Shimoda case. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:48, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the discussion under "Aerial Bombardment" above, I thought I had a case that the Allied area bombings and atomic bombings were war crimes. After discussion, however, it appears that under the war laws in effect at that time, it would be very difficult to argue that those were war crimes. Some notable authors, commentators, etc have argued that the bombings were <i>moral</i> crimes, but, that is different from a war crime which is what this article is about. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 23:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bolton still strikes me as a bad choice of reference. He comes across as a kid who came home from school without his lunch money and won't tell dad who took it, because he's afraid of being beaten up the next day if he does. What he's saying is basically: we will not sign the treaty, because if we do, chances are, no matter how slim, that we'd be tried as war criminals for the atomic bombings. I'm sure you realise how guilty that makes him look.</dd>
<dd>It was my point that at this time there really is no consensus regarding the military and humanitarian views of the atomic bombings. Fact remains that superfluos injury, unnecessary suffering and widespread, long-term and severe damage to the enviroment were all caused. On the other hand, the atomic bombings were then viewed and are still viewed by many today as a military neccesment. Both of these two angles were defined and regulated under international law at the time. However, these two views will probably never come to a common ground, especially since anything as destructive as atomic weaponry was never envisioned in the pre-atomic international law, and as such the first instance of its use somehow slides through a loophole of the unforeseen - the humanitarian argument and the military neccesity argument are both just attempts to cover that loophole with the limited tools at hand.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, I understand your point and agree with it. But the sentence in question could do with a slightly different phrasing, IMO. For instance: you used the phrase: "the Governments of the two largest English speaking nations". The legal opinion of <i>the Governments</i> of <i>two</i> nations. Don't you agree that this can hardly be understood as "the prevalent international legal opinion"? Couldn't some less grandiose phrasing be used? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 01:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bolton is not saying that anyone will be tried for what happed in 1945 because he knows that the treaty is not retrospective (and the decision makers are dead). What he is saying is the US Government will not sign the treaty because it would bind the US in a future conflict in ways that the US Government finds unacceptable. As the US, (like all responsible governments) takes its treaty obligations very seriously, he is explaining that given a similar situation in 1945 the US would still consider the nuclear option and will not sign a treaty which limits its use of such an option. As the US currently is the only superpower and its government assumes it will win any conventional war, it is not surprising it takes such a position. Give it 50 years and if there are other Powers to equal or surpass the US the the US Government's position may well change.</p>
<p>I only used the two English speaking language governments because it is easier to find sources to back that statement up. However all 5 permanent members of the UN security council hold the same opinion (See Paragraph 59 of the ICJ <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i> for an example of this). As I would Imagen do the other nuclear armed nations. Added together they represent most of the population of the planet. When it comes to international law it depends on how States interpret the treaties they have signed, not the opinions of NGOs who have their own axes to grind. The point is made in the ICJ advisory opinion on the <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i>, in paragraph 55, where they analyze whether the use of nuclear weapons are covered by the Second Hague Declaration, Hague Convention IV, and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925 by the phrase "The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate." Under international law how States comply with their perceived treaty obligations which forms the basis for how those obligations are understood.</p>
<p>The ICJ's analysis and judgement is about the use of Nuclear Weapons in the 1990s not 1945 and even in the 1990s with all the new international treaties which have been introduced since 1945 it is not clear that the first use of nuclear weapons in a conflict today illegal. Strip away the post World War II treaties and the argument that in 1945 the use of nuclear weapons was illegal is based on very thin judicial arguments, which I think are summed up adequately by Shimoda, but to balance the paragraph I think the majority view should be included which is that their use was not illegal under international law as understood at that time. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:23, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's leave Bolton aside here, at least in the implications of his speech you highlighted. We are not talking about possible future use of atomic weaponry, we are discussing a past event. I still maintain that he's not doing the sentence his speech is referenced with any justice. His speech expresses anxiety about a possible trial, an anxiety that a casual reader can easily take to mean a feeling of uncertainty regarding the outcome of the said assumed trial - and also an anxiety that would probably be unnecesary if the judicial arguments were really as thin as you suggest. You are right (as I also said before) in that the international law of the time simply didn't cover the possibility of nuclear bombing <i>per se</i>, and strictly judicialy speaking, the bombings can not be covered by any aspect of the then existing international law. Provisional aspects would have to be adopted and in this assumed trial both sides would have strong and undeniable (albeit provisional) arguments.</dd>
<dd>But let's leave speculation aside. It has no place here. I accept your argument about non-English nations and nuclear powers. But I also highlighted "Governments" for a reason. These are the views of the Governments, and therefore also inherently political. Isn't it possible that the legal opinions of experts under no political obligations are much less unilateral? Remember, we are talking about the "prevalent international legal opinion" here. I would say there is no such thing as a "prevalent international legal opinion" if we are to include every single legal expert notable in applicable fields. Which is what "international" in this sentence seems to imply. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 13:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I re-read Bolton's speech, and you are right. He is talking about a possible future use of atomic weaponry. I take back my concerns about his speech.

<p>International legal opinion is expressed by Governments (States) and the interntaional institutions they have set up and have agreed to abide by the rulings of those international institutions. The Shimoda ruling (to use a source already in play) goes into this in some detail to explain why they can not rule on compensation for those affected by the atomic bombings (see <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ryuichi_Shimoda_et_al._v._The_State#III._Claims_of_individuals_for_damages" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Ryuichi_Shimoda_et_al._v._The_State">Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State#III. Claims of individuals for damages</a>). Bolton's comments are relevent because it shows that the US Government thinks that the Rome Treaty could put restrictions on their future use of nuclear weapons, Q.E.D. the US Government does not think that such restrictions applied under international law to the use, by the US, of atomic bombs in 1945. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 19:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says that Canadian troops burnt houses in Germany. Has this been over looked or is it meant to be some sort of joke? The second world war and burning houses is a war crime. How come the houses that were burnt in Japanese cities aren't mentioned anywhere? A great debate about area bombings in Germany not being a war crime and some houses that were burnt by Canadian troops are. No deaths mind you, just burnt houses.</p>
<p>As for killing of prisoners, everyone did it, many people were made indifferent to death. For some reason only Canada has been singled out. They did have a bit of a reputation for it in both wars. The Germans started calling Canadians some thing like the "Allied SS" in Italy when they started killing POWs after it was learned how the Germans were treating the Italian peasents. Sometimes if there was a battle going on and no one could be spared to take the POWs to the rear they shot them or sometimes just because they were done talking to them. I don't know if I can post any short stories from first hand accounts with details of some of those killings or not. Good idea or bad? Anyone? Brocky44 09:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what this article is about: singling out a few freak incidents within the Allied armies and turning them into an imposing list of "war crimes". However of the two you mentioned, the house burning is documented by the official historian of the Canadian army, which seems like a pretty strong reference to me. I think it should stay unless you have another reference to contest it, and I really don't think Canadians come off that poorly if that's all the mayhem they caused. The POW incident please feel free to delete because I think it is very weakly referenced. Given the contentious nature of the material we need better sources than a secondhand account of what a German was supposed to have thought inside of an Italian book. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHaber_f4d1.html" title="User:Haber">Haber</a> 13:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, most of these are small incidents. A couple planes strafing a few survivors in separate incidences? That counts as a war crime meriting mention? It looks like the authors of this article just quote mined through some books and when they encountered an incident like that they immediately added it here as examples. I suggest only things that were carried out on order or had some significant scale to be included here. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueShirts_64e9.html" title="User:BlueShirts">BlueShirts</a> 07:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is obviously just a dumping ground for allegations from everyone who has an axe to grind (particularly against the U.S. it would seem). For instance, why are the atomic bombings listed here as a "war crime" and the bombing of Dresdan isn't? Also, why the heck is a guy who was obviously brazy going bezerk and shooting up a bunch of prisoners at a camp in Utah considered a "war crime" worthy of mention here? Seems to me to be yet another example of the typical anti-US bias found on this site. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandpafootsoldier_a9c6.html" title="User:Grandpafootsoldier">Grandpafootsoldier</a> 20:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Americans bombed Dresden only a few hours after the RAF, and they used a similar city busting mix to the RAF (rather than the more usual USAAF mix), so if it was a war crime, the USAAF was a guilty as the RAF. However there was no German judicial enquiry into Dresden (or February 3, 1945 raid on Berlin by the USAAF) that found that the Allies had "violate the most basic legal principles governing the conduct of war", but there was one in Japan on Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is part of the Wikipedia policy to give a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a> and whether you agree or disagree with the verdict of the Japanese court, if you did not already know about it, perhaps you leave this page having learnt something new.

<dd>Agree that the page badly needs some balancing. Unfortunately Philip Baird Shearer constantly removes all attempts of comparison, like in this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=114487046&amp;oldid=114430751" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=114487046&amp;oldid=114430751" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Here is quote clearly showint that this is relevant for war crimes from the given source: "Death rates of POWs held is one measure of adherence to the standards of the treaties because substandard treatment leads to death of prisoners.

<dd>I can't actually understand why Philip Baird Shearer doesn't want to have these figures on this page. Even if I can agree that "POW deaths are not necessarily unlawful killings and therefor not War Crimes", a 60% death rate of Soviet POWs held by Germany raises questions. Certainly when you see that in comparison, the death rate of German POWs held by the Russians is of 33% at most, while it is commonly acknowledged that the treatment of the German POWs by the USSR was not in accordance of the Geneva convention (that, BTW, had not been signed by the USSR) and that it might well be regarded as crimes of war. Moreover, if I am ready to agree that all these death are not necessarily due to war crimes (some of these men might have been killed during allied bombing as well), the comparison between 60% for the Russian POWs on one side and 4% for the US and Commonwealth POWs on the other side is disturbing at least. And even more whent you know that one of the basic principles of the nazi regime was that the Russian were "Untermenschen" who didn't deserve any care. --<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob-BE_9c69.html" title="User:Lebob-BE">Lebob-BE</a> 20:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is about war crimes. The raw death rates among POWs is not a war crime statistic.

<dd>Arigato1, there has been a serious discussion on the topic over the past few days. However, there has yet to be any documentation brought out from reputable sources that the bombings were a war crime. You claim that the rest of the world considers this a war crime, so there must be some proof to back up this statement.

<p>Actually three issues: 1. Is this article about actual prosecuted war crimes or can anyone's assumed war crime be added? 2. Does the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute a war crime? 3. Can references given by Americans automatically get removed as "biased" when discussing American actions as a war crime or not a war crime?</p>

<dd>Commenting via RfC: This article should reflect only academic and mainstream views on Allied War Crimes. So, no not just anyone's speculation should be included. If there are scholars that think the bombing of Japan was a war crime it should be discussed.

<dd>My two cents - I would think the article should include both prosecuted and alleged war crimes, but they should be separated into different sections, and properly sourced if they are alleged. The question of whether the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes or not is not ours to decide. Provide legitimate, reliable sources stating that it was a war crime and it can be listed in the article. If not, then it cannot be allowed to remain. As for the references by Americans, you can't be serious. That is unbelievably anti-American POV-pushing. This article isn't about American war crimes only; they weren't the only member of the Allies. I guess we can only allow editors from Germany, Italy, and Japan to edit this article. There is no ownership of articles; neither is there a rule allowing a certain segment of editors to be blocked from editing articles based solely on their nationality. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 20:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just for clarification, I was not advocating the positions, just asking for comment. I tried to keep the questions neutral. For the record, I figure that 1. A war crime is a crime if it is put up to a trial. 2. Since it met the restrictions of the rules listed in the Dresden bombings, the bombs dropped on Japan were not war crimes. 3. Since the US is known for it's free press, deleting a reference because it is pro-US is just wrong. References are references regardless of their point of origin, as long as they are from a recognized source. But that is just my opinion, and I was looking for some others before putting mine.

<p>IvoShandor and Parsecboy have you read the entry for the A-bombings? If so why talk in vague terms and not comment on the quality of the references supplied for the A-bombings? IvoShandor why only scholars are not court cases better?</p>
<p>CodeCarpenter not all war crimes come to trial for example see <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Paradis_massacre_d1ac.html" title="Le Paradis massacre">Le Paradis massacre</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhoudt_massacre.html" title="Wormhoudt massacre">Wormhoudt massacre</a>, which is why we have the sentence in the introduction which reads "<i>Other incidents are alleged by certain historians to have been crimes under the law of war in operation at the time, but that for a variety of reasons were not investigated by the Allied powers during the war, or they were investigated and a decision was taken not to prosecute.</i>" --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 21:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not feel strongly against the alleged items, but in the title of the document, it says Allied war crimes, with no clarifier saying alleged. However, alleged carnivorous plants (protocarnivorous) are in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnivorous_plant.html" title="Carnivorous plant">carnivorous plants</a>, so it is not a strong objection, just a language objection. I just know that if I added OJ or Robert Blake to the list of murderers, it would get removed, due to a higher legal standard being in place. In some of the cases in the quote above, the equivalent of a Grand Jury looked over the evidence and decided that there was not enough evidence that a crime was committed. It was just my opinion as an outsider. I can see keeping the unprosecuted cases in a separate section here though as suggested by Parsecboy, since a separate page for alleged war crimes would get messy and lengthy. PS: <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Knochlein_b768.html" title="Fritz Knochlein">Fritz Knochlein</a> from the <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Paradis_massacre_d1ac.html" title="Le Paradis massacre">Le Paradis massacre</a> DID go to trial, was found guilty , and was hanged.

<dd>Re - Philip; Both of the sources supplied to support the assertion that the A-bombings were not war crimes aren't very relevant.

<p>The difference is not always that clear because politics gets involved. For example at <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> it stated that unrestricted submarine warfare was a breach of treaty obligations. And it noted that the Allies had done that, but no one from the a Allied side was tried for the crime. So did the Allies commit a war crime or not in adopting unrestricted submarine warfare?</p>
<p>It is beyond doubt that the Soviets committed mass rape in eastern Germany. But few if any were prosecuted for those crimes. Should the historical record as mentioned by many sources one of the most prominent English language sources being the Military historian <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Beevor_8d25.html" title="Anthony Beevor">Anthony Beevor</a> or should we not include it in this article as there were no trails?</p>
<p>The two sources given for the A-bomb was not a war crime are sufficient to show that there is a contrary view and to give a NPOV. It goes without saying that the war time government of the USA did not think that they were committing a crime and the sources given, show that the current US government still thinks that no crime was committed under the international law framed by the treaties that the USA has ratified, and the second source explains how little international law there was in this area in 1945. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>CodeCarpenter I think you are confused about something. There is a difference between alleging that OJ committed a murder, and stating that Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered (by person or persons unknown). Jack the Ripper was never bought to trial but his victims were murdered. It is a difference between a list of perpetrators and a list of victims. The latter tends to be a more complete list&#160;:-( It is beyond doubt that the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhoudt_massacre.html" title="Wormhoudt massacre">Wormhoudt massacre</a> took place and that it was a war crime, but unlike the <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Paradis_massacre_d1ac.html" title="Le Paradis massacre">Le Paradis massacre</a> the perpetrator(s) were never brought to justice. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In this case though, it is not just the victim, but the statement that is was a crime that is at issue. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> would not be on a list of murder victims (except in some conspiracy theory books), even though Nicole Brown Simpson would be. However, listing JFK as the killer of Marilyn Monroe would be a stretch, similar to calling the atomic bombings a war crime, IMO. Since this page lists not only the war crime but the Allied perpetrator, I feel it does fall under the OJ example. Jack the Ripper admitted his crime judged to be a crime in every society and only did not get tried because he did not get caught (see Osama Bin Laden), while America is being accused of having commited a crime by a couple of people here that is not only not considered a crime by many others, but America is not in hiding or on the run for their actions. If this was a mythical murder trial, America would rightly claim self-defense, and the trial would be thrown out of court, and no crime would be listed for their act of self defense. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 23:40, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>CodeCarpenter, this cannot be compared to a murder trial, and those Japanese infants killed in the bombings weren't throwing grenades at Americans, so self-defence wouldn't work either. This is more comparable to the fire-bombing of Dresden during WWII. This was a deliberate targeting of civilians, Hiroshima was a city with practically nil military value. Using your reasoning CodeCarpenter, Hitler was not responsible for the murder of 6 million jews because he was never tried. This whole dispute can be solved by stating in the article something along the lines of <i>"The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are heavily disputed, with many people on both sides of the issue."</i></p>

<dd>Perhaps the infants weren't throwing grenades, but I'm sure that if the eventual invasion of the Japanese mainland did take place, the majority of the civilians would've resisted. One thing you must remember is that war is not pleasant. It is not gentlemanly. People die in war; sometimes the wrong people, but it's not necessarily intentional.

<p>There is a problem on the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki page though, which is kernel of the problem for all articles like this were there are advocates on both sides of an issue like "was it a war crime or not". It is "does one put such articles in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Category%7EWar_crimes_57a2.html" title="Category:War crimes">Category:War crimes</a>?". This is AFAICT this is a binary decision: either Yes or No where there is no possibility of a "However sentence". --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Short answers 1) No one ever agrees on what this article should be about. Personally I think that the title does not match the contents, but I have no desire to fight that battle right now. 2) No, the atomic bombings were not war crimes. 3) American sources should not be excluded. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHaber_f4d1.html" title="User:Haber">Haber</a> 12:14, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Parsecboy said: <i>It is not gentlemanly. People die in war; sometimes the wrong people, but it's not necessarily intentional.</i> well, in this case it was intentional, the Americans knew that civilians and infants lived in the city, and intentionally targeted it knowing these civilians would die. It was not an army depot, it was a city that was based around the treatment of wounded soldiers, if in defining a military target you use the number of invalides, then yes, Hiroshima was a military target. But other then that, it was not a military target.</p>
<p>The fact that we are having this discussion points out in the first place that it is viewed as a war crime, maybe not by everyone, but by a sizeable number of people.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how you can say Hiroshima had no military value, outside of a "number of invalides". Hata's 2nd General Army, which controlled the defense of all of southern Japan was headquartered there. It was a supply and logisitics center, as well as a communication center. As for the civilians argument, it's no different from any other conventional bombing raid conducted during the war. Are all of those war crimes? What about any time an army shelled a city with artillery? Civilians surely died. War crimes all? What about those city battles where thousands of civilians died in the crossfire? Are all those soldiers war criminals? I don't see how the A-bombings are up on this pedestal. These two events where civilians died are somehow on a totally different plane than every other event. Surely you cannot argue the deaths of civilians in conventional bombings or during firefights are more "justified" than those who died in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 15:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was a deliberate targetting of civilians, surely you can't support that? This is entirely different than conventional bombings, because conventional bombings are meant to destroy a target/factory and its immediate surroundings. This is more comparable to the bombing of Rotterdam or Dresden than it is to a conventional bombing, because conventional bombings atleast pretended they were trying to hit a specific target rather than civilians. As for your explanation of its military importance, that is using a bazooka on an anthill, it was unwarranted.</p>

<dd>Yes, it was a deliberate targeting of a city. One thing you must remember is that WWII was a total war. In total wars, everything becomes a target; cities are attacked because they are industrial bases, transportation and logisitics nodes, etc. The goal is to force an opposing country into submission in the "cheapest" (for lack of a better term) way possible. You also have to take into account the purpose of the bombings. It wasn't to deliberately kill civilians, it was to cow the Japanese into surrendering, to avoid an incredibly costly (in terms of military and civilian lives lost) invasion. The argument that Japan was ready to surrender, and had the Allies indicated that they would've allowed Hirohito to retain his position, they would have surrendered without the A-bombs/August Storm is irrelvant. Hindsight is 20/20. Based on previous examples of the Japanese adherence to Bushido (i.e., the cliff suicides in the Marianas rather than surrender), it was very logical to believe the Japanese would not surrender until they were completely destroyed. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 20:42, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your whole argument is Original Research, and cannot be verified at all. In most other cases cities were not targeted, the railway stations, factories, etc. were targeted, they were in the cities, but it did not mean the whole city was the target. You can not excuse something that happened and say "that was (total) war", we must acknowledge that it happened and that it was a horrible thing and move on. The atomic bombings were different in that they were meant to destroy the whole city, and to force the Japanese government to surrender by telling them "If you don't surrender, we will do this to more of your civilians"</p>

<dd>In Europe the USAAF did target railway stations, factories, etc, as they did initially in Japan. They then turned to the RAF European strategy of targeting an areas in Japan not specific targets. The proponents of a total war consider the means of production are legitimate targets. As, (over the last 200 years), the amount of hardware that each combatant needs to fight has increased, so the logistics chain back to the factory and the support infrastructure that those factory workers need are seen as legitimate targets in a full scale/total war. That some innocents (like children and others not directly involved in the war) are then killed, is considered by those who support such a strategy as collateral damage justified by <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_necessity.html" title="Military necessity">military necessity</a>. Before and during World War II there was not positive international law which prohibited the bombing of civilian infrastructure from the air. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 08:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Two quick responses. 1. America can claim self-defense. I was using the single person as an illustrative point to help simplify my point. The suggestion that Hitler was not a criminal becuase he did not go to trial is a straw man. He would have gone to trial had he not suicided (is that a word?). For clarification, though, I will say not only crimes that go to trail, but crimes that would have gone to trial had the people responsible survived for trial. Had <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammed_Atta_79d0.html" title="Muhammed Atta">Muhammed Atta</a> somehow survived 9-11, he would have gone to trial, a Grand Jury would have found sufficient evidence to bring him to trial. No Grand Jury on the past 60 years has found sufficient evidence to bring America to trial for the bombings. 2. The reason we are having this discussion is not due to a sizeable number of people that follow the war crimes viewpoint, but due to my request for outside viewpoints after a couple of very aggressive and insulting reverters continued to remove American viewpoints as biased, revert War Crimes into this and other related pages, and to call anyone that dared to contradict them vandals. The fact that they have insulted people who have attempted polite discussion with them, and that they have yet to show up in this more reasoned discussion shows that their goal (not yours Jagder, but theirs) was merely confrontation, not a desire to reach the truth. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 12:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jadger, explain where my original research is. You apparently agree the purpose of the bombings were to cow the Japanese into surrendering. I'm sure we could find many sources that label WWII as a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>. The Japanese <i>did</i> commit mass suicide instead of surrendering in the Marianas. I'm also sure we could find sources stating that many in the military believed Japan would not surrender without being completely destroyed. You say <i>You can not excuse something that happened and say "that was (total) war"...</i> . Well, you also cannot look at an event that happened 60 years ago from today's standpoint. You must look at it in the context of the time in which it occurred, using only the information that those who made the decisions had, to properly understand why they did what they did. Like I said earlier, hindsight is 20/20. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 12:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The argument that Japan was ready to surrender, and had the Allies indicated that they would've allowed Hirohito to retain his position, they would have surrendered without the A-bombs/August Storm is irrelvant.</i> that is OR, so is <i>It wasn't to deliberately kill civilians, it was to cow the Japanese into surrendering, to avoid an incredibly costly (in terms of military and civilian lives lost) invasion.</i> because an invasion wasn't going to be necessary anyways, the Japanese had already started arranging for peace talks before the first A bomb was dropped. And the intentional targetting of a place where you know thousands of civilians is entirely a war crime. unless you think the <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Frampol_7d91.html" title="Bombing of Frampol">bombing of Frampol</a> was not a war crime. It was totally reckless and ignored the obvious loss of innocent life. Would you poison your dog's food (killing your dog) just to kill the racoon that comes around each night and eats its food? of course not, it was overkill and reckless.</p>
<p>yes, it was a total war, I think you are confused, total war does not mean basic humanity can be thrown out the window and international laws can be broken. And for the record, I don't necessarily think it was a warcrime in the strictest sense of the word, but should be included on this page because many would see it as an atrocity and this article is about atrocious things done by the Allies.</p>

<dd>Jadger, why aren't you listening to me? <b>You cannot look at the events at the end of the Pacific War from the perspective of today</b>. From the US leadership's perspective, Japan had thus far refused to surrender unconditionally. Therefore, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html" title="Operation Downfall">an invasion</a> <i>was</i>, to them, necessary. It doesn't matter what we now know. To properly understand the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, you must only use the information available to those who made the decisions. A: Japan refuses to surrender unconditionally. B: the Japanese have a history of incredibly tenacious and suicidal defense. Therefore, the option becomes either an incredibly costly invasion or attempt to force their surrender by attacking them with atomic weapons. You would be far more accurate to call your apparent assertion that the A-bombings were deliberate murders of Japanese civilians OR. As for your comment on total war, there were no international laws at the time saying you cannot use Atomic weapons or even that you cannot bomb cities. Total war simply means every aspect of a nation's military/industrial complex becomes a target, from the individual soldier with a rifle all the way back to the civilian factories that produce the bullets. Civilians are part of the war machine, and are therefore a target. Soldiers are no less human than civilians. Why is it perfectly ok to kill soldiers by the millions, but civilians must be spared? Because the civilians were the lucky ones to not be drafted? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 12:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is about "Allied war crimes", the word atrocity is too subjective. However, some think that the A-bombings were a war crime. At least one court has pronounced it as such, (which is the source given) and it ought to be included for that reason. However I also think it needs another sentence to balance the POV -- as there is at the moment but which has been deleted several times recently eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=115996640&amp;oldid=115992977" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=115996640&amp;oldid=115992977" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></dd>

<dd>First off, the comments that the "Japanese had already started arranging for peace talks before the first A bomb was dropped." is not supported by the facts. They rejected the last offer of surrender by the Allies, even after Tokyo was conventionally bombed. Second, the idea that they only surrendered because the USSR declared war on them seems odd, since the Soviets only declared war (in a war that had been going on for over five years) after the US dropped the A-Bomb. It is convenient for someone to claim the USSR was the deciding factor, but the coincidence that they waited until after the A-Bomb is tough to ignore. Finally, in response to the idea that only civilians were targeted, it must be noted that the Japanese hid their Military Industrial complex within their civilians in order to prevent the kind of strategic bombing that took place in Germany. Please see <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Tokyo_in_World_War_II_7d2b.html" title="Bombing of Tokyo in World War II">Bombing of Tokyo in World War II</a>, especially this quote: "Also, the strategic-bombing program that had devastated Germany's industrial complexes was ineffective in Japan where two-thirds of industry was dispersed in homes and small factories employing less than thirty workers.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup>" Attempts to pinpoint targets were failing, and more Japanese and American lives were being lost to the conventional bombing attempts that were being used from 1942 onward. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 23:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
