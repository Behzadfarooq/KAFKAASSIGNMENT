<p>Hi there! Template:inactive sounds good (I've changed the layout to a colorful box though, as per most such templates). I think two months for the talk page sounds fair. Thanks for your help! What about doing something similar for any page in the Wikipedia namespace? Or is that unfeasible?

<ul>
<li>Hm, good point, marking all of Wikipedia namespace is rather controversial. The point is that the Wikipedia namespace is a mess, and it's sometimes difficult to distinguish relevant content from old debates. I'll see if I can think of a better way of doing that, or failing that it would be good to get consensus first. But am I correct to understand that it is technically possible? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:06, May 10, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There has been some discussion in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategories_for_deletion_0417.html#Visibility_of_CfD_votes_on_categorized_pages" title="Wikipedia talk:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Categories for deletion#Visibility of CfD votes on categorized pages</a> about the desire for CfD candidates to somehow show up on the watchlists of <i>categorizers</i>, whether or not they have the <i>categories</i> themselves watched. It seems like the only reasonable way to do that, barring source code changes, is to have a bot populate talk pages with some new template resembling <a href="../../../t/f/d/Template%7ETfd_1243.html" title="Template:Tfd">Template:tfd</a>. I'm willing to rough-in a bot that would do that, but I do not want to step on your toes.

<p>Some people have taken to silly link spamming of sandboxes. Would it be worth to remove external links when checking the sandboxes? Giving spammers any slack just doesn't feel right&#160;:) <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 08:29, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was thinking that we could remove them periodically, like every hour or fifteen minutes. That would still allow people to test how it works, but make it less worthwhile to spam. Do many people use the public sandboxes for large-scale tests? I suspect most do it on their own subpages. Other options are to check manually (yuck) or suffer the spam (yuck yuck), or hope that it's just a fad (which would be nice). <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 20:54, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone recently fixed all the heading levels on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> so that headings start at ==2nd level== instead of =1st level=, per the MoS.

<p>You asked on sourceforge for protection and unprotection for pywikipediabot. See <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_protect.py_0d04.html" title="User:Gdr/protect.py">User:Gdr/protect.py</a>. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 22:38, 2005 May 12 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Automatic protection for <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>? What do you propose? <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 08:13, 2005 May 13 (UTC) P.S. Why is your talk page protected?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that the only way this is going to work is by integrated the protection and unprotection for images into the processes that update the templates that appear on the main page.</p>
<p>(It would be straightforward to write a bot that would (1) protect all images on the main page; and (2) unprotect all images with <a href="../../../m/p/r/Template%7EMprotected_7b11.html" title="Template:Mprotected">Template:Mprotected</a> that do not appear on the main page. However, this wouldn't really be a solution: unless you ran the bot <i>very</i> frequently, there would a window of opportunity for someone to vandalise an image after it appeared on the main page and before it had been protected. The times when new images appear on the main page are quite predictable (e.g. midnight UTC for the selected anniversary) and the images are chosen some time in advance. So I don't like that idea.)</p>
<p>In the process for updating <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_2dd7.html" title="Template:Did you know">Template:Did you know</a>, which is documented rather sketchily at <a href="../../../d/i/d/Wikipedia%7EDid_you_know_Guide_6fd7.html" title="Wikipedia:Did you know/Guide">Wikipedia:Did you know/Guide</a> you protect the image before updating the template. There are similar steps in the processes for updating the other templates. So I think the right thing to do is to assist in automation of the existing processes, which is what I'm doing with <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_DYKbot_4a33.html" title="User:Gdr/DYKbot">DYKbot</a>. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 20:41, 2005 May 14 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently, the private notice in the sandbox looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We politely ask you to leave the line above alone. As this page is for editing experiments, this page will automatically be cleaned every 12 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend this instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please leave the line above alone, but feel free to edit the sandbox below the header. As this page is for editing experiments, this page will automatically be cleaned every 12 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I recommend this is that some newbies are afraid to edit the sandbox and don't know what it's exactly for. Even with the header template message, "Feel free to try your formatting skills here" and "We politely ask you to leave the line above alone" could cause them some confusion.</p>
<p>Please change the sandbot script and use my version or a similar one.</p>

<p>Hi AllyUnion - the vote over at tfd was for Template:Substub to be deleted, and it's in the queue awaiting deletion. General feeling at WikiProject Stub sorting is that turning it into a redirect for its last few days would make sense, to sort of ease the transition. I could go ahead and unprotect it myself and do the job, but would feel happier getting your okay for the unprotection first (since it was your (good) idea to put it on there). PS - nice photos! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 11:28, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>

<p>I added a list of the major reference works that are often cited when writing about Star Trek to the main article. It has been mentioned that this is not quite what is meant by references, but IMO the only way to do a fully cited article is to abandon what has been written and write something from scratch, which isn't feasible (not to mention unfair to past contributors). I imagine some folks treat Wikipedia like they would a thesis or essay, but I don't really work that way - not with a simple website. Anyway, I started the list so hopefully something can be done with it. If push comes to shove, I'd recommend citing only those books dated in the 1970s since those are key works and the sum of their knowledge forms the basis for what longtime Trekkers like me know about the show.

<dd>I'm willing to bet the explanation of who Berman is probably got lost in a previous edit. Good catch, there. "Star Trek Creator" could be considered a reference along the lines of Shatner's books (I could also have listed autobiographies/biographies of Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan, Deforest Kelly, Leonard Nimoy and Walter Koenig as well -- yup, they all wrote books (except for Kelly who was biographed posthumously). I recall there being two biographies of Roddenberry published, one of which was considered quite controversial but I can't recall if it was Star Trek Creator or the other one the title of which I forget. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:30, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to bounce an idea off you. What do you think about an article based upon Star Trek bloopers? The original tapes have some notability because of their proliferation in the 1970s (in fact it could be said that the controversy over their unauthorized distribution anticipated current film piracy concerns). But beyond that, I could see us having some fun describing the different TOS, TNG, VOY, and ENT bloopers that have been released. I wouldn't suggest summarizing every Trek blooper - that could get boring - but some of the more popular ones might be worth noting, stuff like Shatner saying "Have no fear, Sargon is here" or Tuvok running away from a dark cave, or the newly classic "Martinis at T'Pol's" blooper from the season 1 gag reel.

<p>Your question is pretty broad. There are two major works on the subject. During TOS's second season, Gene Roddenberry and Stephen Whitfield co-wrote "The Making of Star Trek" which described in intense detail how the show came to be. It's from that source that names such as Captain Winter, the USS Yorktown (original name for the Enterprise) and other tidbits of the characters originate. About 10 years ago, Robert Justman and Herbert Solow, who produced TOS, wrote Inside Star Trek: The Real Story which covered the entire run of TOS and included a number of controversial claims (such as the affair between Roddenberry and Nichelle Nichols, the fact Gene composed an "impossible to sing" set of lyrics for the theme song so he'd get a cut of the royalities, etc.). And of course all the main cast either wrote autobiographies covering the early years, or biographies were written about them. For post-TOS history, as in the rise of fandom, I'd recommend "On the Good Ship Enterprise" by Bjo Trimble who organized the 1960s equivalent of Trek United, and Making of the Trek Conventions by Joan Winston which chronicles the beginnings of that element of Trek fandom. Of all the books I mentioned, these last two are the hardest to find, as you can imagine. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:59, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is definitely something that's worth doing the research for, but what one needs is time and resources. I have the resources - most of the books I mentioned including Trimble's book and the Trek Conventions book which is selling on the collectors market for a lot of money. Problem is, I just don't have the time to work on such a project at the moment. I could give a general outline from memory (Roddenberry pitching the show to CBS who turned it down in favor of Lost in Space; NBC and Desilu rejecting the show until Lucille Ball championed it; the controversy over Spock and the initial plan to have a female first office; the decision to air a monster-of-the-week episode first which some feel doomed TOS from the start; the write-in campaign that saved the second season; Harlan Ellison vs. Roddenberry, etc.). Problem is if you want sources cited I couldn't do that given my time restrictions. But maybe if we just created an outline and worried about sourcing later, it would give us a start? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:02, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

Should I only change pages that have a format of "Wikipedia:WikiProject *"? (Where * means any word, phrase, name, etc). What about <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Sandbox_bf93.html" title="User:Zocky/Sandbox">User:Zocky/Sandbox</a>? What about <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Template_5b2b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject/Template">Wikipedia:WikiProject/Template</a>? Can you give me your list of exceptions please? -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:56, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's been established that WikiProjects may reside in userspace for whatever reason. If the user tags something as cat:wikiproject, and it becomes inactive, then cat:inactive wikiproject is appropriate. That includes Peregrine 981 and Gracefool. Also, some WikiProjects don't have 'WikiProject' in their title, such as the LGBT notice board and Statistics Department. I'd say the sole exceptions are <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia:WikiProject</a> (the main page) and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProject_0951.html" title="Template:WikiProject">Template:WikiProject</a>.

<li>Oh yes, and please make an exception for subcategories (which shouldn't be moved period, otherwise cat:inactive may end up in cat:inactive&#160;:) ). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:13, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think this is how World War I started. Actually, it was while I was trying to plot revenge that you became an inspiration. So consider yourself a muse.

<p>I am not sure what is unclear: the reason or the implementation. I guess the former one.</p>
<p>It is my lucky day when I do not revert a dozen of anon vandals in my watchlist. Therefore each time I refresh my watch I browse thru anon contributors. In my watchlist at least 30% are vandals. If a bot runs, I don't see these anons, so to spot them I have to look into histories of articles last edited by bots. If the last edit was by a logged user I trust he spotted the vandal (with the exception of redlinked user name: chances are it is a newbie or even vandal too). Looking into histories is a burden both for me (I have &gt;3,000 pages on watch) and for wikiengine. That's why I'd like for a bot to report who edited before him.</p>
<p>Of course, simple-minded vandals will be spotted anyway. But in rarely edited pages and with deliberately clandestine vandals one better be on an early warning alert level. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:13, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>&lt;&gt; I see. I didn't think about this. But again, how does the "recent changes" work? I don't think it accesses full histories in the whole my watchlist. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:01, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bot hiding: This will not help me to see anons that edited immediately before bots. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 03:50, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
