<dd>Hey, AllyUnion, you only need to ask me once&#160;:) I haven't touched this page in about a week. It was in pretty bad shape then and had not been archived in a long time, no images. How long has your bot been broken?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, this page is linked from the main page, so I have a request; can we please be extra carefull to format it nicely, include the images and keep its archiving up to date? If the bot's not working I'm more than happy to do it manually. But, again, it is a highly visible page, linked from the manipage, and we should keep it looking nice. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 03:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm confused about "Kakashi Bot". Is he a working bot to fix double redirects automatically without human intervention? Does such a thing exist? If so, can you point me to its source code so that I may download and run it on my own Wiki installation, where double redirects are starting to become a problem?

<p>I noticed that you have an AFD bot that automatically puts the entire contents of articles listed for AFD in to a subsection of your user page. This is very useful I am sure. But who uses it?

That's something I never thought could happen, and I'll have to post a message somewhere warning people not to put any dates above the nomination date. Perhaps it would be best if the nomination pages had a line directly below the title saying "Nominated 5th December 2005" or something like that, above the description. Would the bot pick this up correctly?

<dd>Read the bot's userpage, <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurando-san_e26d.html" title="User:Kurando-san">here</a>. If you notice on the notes section of the page below, it has indicated that it will indeed work. The logical reasoning behind this is that I can not base the nomination on the history, as I do not reliably know which edit in the history indicates the date in which it was first nominated. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:33, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, no matter what the date is, it will always read the first "readable" date. Unfortunately, it was the May 15 date. You could, just add:
<pre>
&lt;!-- ~~~~~ --&gt;

to the template code, and it will fix all the problems... except Brian0918... who finds that he needs to be special and write his date in a format different from everyone else. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:46, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi - I noticed that NekoDaemon is meant to move contents from categories in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_category_redirects_0c06.html" title="Category:Wikipedia category redirects">Category:Wikipedia category redirects</a>. I've been doing some <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> cleanup and thought I'd let ND do some moving rather than doing it manually (or asking Beland or Who to do it with their bots). The claim at the category redirect page is that ND patrols "hourly". Does this mean ND examines each redirected category once an hour, or that it wakes up and does some amount of work every hour? I added the redirect template to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/Category%7EU.S._history_images_1ac0.html" title="Category:U.S. history images">Category:U.S._history_images</a> about 24 hours ago and the articles aren't moved yet.

<dd>And, while we're at it, what would you think about adding category deletion as well? WhoBot and Pearle are typically used for both moves and deletes, but if there were an equivalent to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECategoryredirect_5bad.html" title="Template:Categoryredirect">template:categoryredirect</a> for categories to be deleted, deleting a category (after discussion at CFD of course) could be semi-automated by adding the category to a "to be deleted" category patrolled by ND in much the same way as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_category_redirects_0c06.html" title="Category:Wikipedia category redirects">Category:Wikipedia category redirects</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 19:45, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi I am going through and fixing bad Wikisource links left from the language split. I have been doing this by hand off a search for Wikisource. So far I have looked at 700 of the over 4,000 results from that search and I now have a good idea where I will find errors. Is there any you can pull out a list of all the instance where WP links to WS without a template? The most common ways these links are setup is [[Wikisoure:This is an example]], [[s:This is an example]], [http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_is_an_example This is an example], and [http://wikisource.org/wiki/This_is_an_example This is an example] If I could have listing all these links and so I could just test them out and only look up the article when I find a bad link, it would be great as these bad links are really causing extra work at WS. Or if you have any suggestions as how I could do this without looking through 4,000 articles individually I would appreciate it. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> suggested I ask you as you have a toolserver account.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB">BirgitteSB</a> 15:46, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) I can run a query for you off the toolserver, but it would help me greatly if you had the query in mind; 2) Which database are you talking about? (English Wikipedia?) 3) Can you be more specific? I don't fully understand the context in which you are asking me to look up and for what reason. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:34, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry here is the long explanation. All the links that went to WS before the language split worked fine. After language split the links now go to the wrong place. One example is if you look at the History of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_David_Thoreau_badf.html" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>. Several of his works were linked to on WS and when the language split happened the works moved but the links stayed pointing to old wikisource. Another common problem using the interwikimedia link which once linked to works at the old wikisource, now links by default to English WS. You would be surprised how many instances there were of someone links to a non-English work on the old WS from the English WP. So the real problem is that now when editors from WP follow the lost links they see that the page does not exist and there is the standard prompt to "Create this page." Well they are repeatedly. I have seen 16 deleted edits and rarely have I followed these lost links to see less than 3 deleted edits. Almost every day at English WS it seems we have a work added that we can't read by an anomynous user we can't contact. I imagine it is just as tedious at the old WS, which still host some languages like gaellic, to have english works repeatedly added to their site. For my use I was hoping you could query the English WP, altough I imagine the problem exists elsewhere. If you look at my Contribs you see how am fixing these links, but you can't see all the pages containing the WS templates and other uses of the word "wikisource" I had look through hunting for these errors. If I can't find the right place to correctly link to I am deleting the link, but with cut and paste I feel I have done pretty well finding even Chinese! pages. Thanks for reading all this if you have more qusetions I can probably put together some links of what is happening--BirgitteSB 18:46, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you to take the time to look at my contributions the past two days? I have going through the {{wikisource}} links because it also has alot of errors. So you might to look a bit further back for the examples I was writing about above.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB">BirgitteSB</a> 18:55, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, if I understand correctly, there are new namespaces at the Wikisource. And Wikisource is now segmented into different languages. You want a query of any text that has the word "wikisource" in it. Gotcha. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 19:59, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Not exactly I have been working off a search of simply wikisource, but I was hoping you could help with a more subtle query. Most of the errors occur in following 4 ways of linking to wikisource: [[Wikisource:This is an example]], [[s:This is an example]], [http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_is_an_example This is an example], and [http://wikisource.org/wiki/This_is_an_example This is an example]. I was hoping to get a query on these particular uses of wikisource if it is possible. A query on just wikisource would also includes all the templates and 3 out of the 4 templates rarely have errors. See Wikisource segmented into different languages back in August, so there are a good deal of correct links as well. As far I know no one has attempted to make these fixes systimatically until now. When did I search on just wikisource I got over 4,000 results and I have gone through about 700 of them. I really don't know what toolserver accounts can or what the results would look like. I just was hoping there is a better/quicker way to go about this. Thanks for any advise you can give me.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB">BirgitteSB</a> 20:50, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm... I'll have to think about it. It's essentially four different queries unioned together. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 01:17, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll do one query as you requested, and another query to search for anything currently using the {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikisource_2cd0.html" title="Template:Wikisource">wikisource</a>}} template. They will be placed at <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_Query1_d85f.html" title="User:BirgitteSB/Query1">User:BirgitteSB/Query1</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_Query2_9cdf.html" title="User:BirgitteSB/Query2">User:BirgitteSB/Query2</a> --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 03:26, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Um, unfortunately, those queries are really out of date. And not necessarily correct. The toolserver, at the moment, doesn't have the space to run full text queries. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 10:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, this is with reference to <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jylee/dyk/talkpage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jylee/dyk/talkpage.html" rel="nofollow">Talk Page Converter</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jylee/dyk/talkpage2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jylee/dyk/talkpage2.html" rel="nofollow">Talk Page Converter (backup)</a>. I have just tried the first one and it seems to be good in terms of obliterating need for some grunt work. However, a couple of fixes need to be made. Firstly, the image name is getting into a separate line just below the line it is supposed to come in (I want it to come immediately one space after the "?"). Secondly, I want the image name to be displayed e.g. if the input is [[Image:Dunmore pineapple north elevation.jpg|100px|Dunmore Pineapple]], the output is "Dunmore Pineapple." Based on the prevalent practice on DYK archival, the output should be ([[:Image:Dunmore pineapple north elevation.jpg]]). With these two minor fixes, I'd reckon that it wd reduce half the workload in archiving. Could you let me know if it is possible? --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 16:40, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is, but I'm a bit busy with other things at the moment.
