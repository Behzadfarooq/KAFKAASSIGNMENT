<p>On the 1st day, Ponegativus created the world and all that is on the world. He created the world, the light and the dark, the water and the air, the people and the animals... and the breakfast cereals. And the cereals were quite good, because 2%, 1% and skim milk had yet to have been invented. And the only cereals were Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Lucky Charms (but only the marshmallows). The parents were angry. They cried unto Ponegativus, "why have you created these unhealthy cereals!?" And in his infinite wisdom, Ponegative created the different types of milk, put cereal with the marshmallows, and cursed Cinnamon Toast Crunch with a bad marketing team... And all was well.</p>
<p>On the 2nd day, Ponegativus said, "Let their be more light!". And Chuck Norris replied, "Say please".</p>

The song American Idiot also provokes an anti-American message.</p>
<p>The Song "When I Come Around" was meant to be interpreted as Hitler taunting fearful Jews to not cry, becuase he will soon arrive to kill them. In the song "Reject"(Nimrod) the lyrics contain the words,"To Hell and back to Hell again, you're not my type, your not my type(refering to Jews), I do what I want and you do what your told". "Nice Guys Finish Last" contains the lyrics "Nice guys finish last, your running out of gas", which refers to a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> victim holding on to their last breath of air, while being gassed.</p>
<p>"Having a blast" is a narrative in which the author states "I won't listen to anyone's last words", reffering to Hitler's final moments.another part of the song says"There's nothind left for you to say. Soon you'll be dead anyway," which Tre says is really <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> speaking to his next victims. With these hidden song meanings Green Day has been able to manipulate its listeners into hearing their Neo Nazi message.</p>

<p>Train-a-Tron is a 120,000 ton anthropomorphic train-turned-superhero and is the defender of Bayside Highschool. Resembling a standard line of four diesel locomotives, Train-a-Tron can quickly morph into Train-a-Tron Alpha Defender Mode, which to the untrained eye resembles U.S. Senator <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Bayh_1bf4.html" title="Evan Bayh">Evan Bayh</a>, however, experts believe this to be a crude optical illusion, or perhaps magic.</p>
<p>Train-a-Tron is committed to peace and justice, and also enjoys large meals of Indian food accompanied by a slurry of liquid <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluorene.html" title="Fluorene">fluorene</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobalt.html" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> which Train-a-Tron refers to as "karate krunch!!!!", both of which are prepared in massive quantities by his wife, Charlene Train-a-Tron, who is better known for her voicework in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a> film <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules.html" title="Hercules">Hercules</a>. Train-A-Tron often displays human-like emotions, such as love, sadness, and a virulent hatred of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calabi-Yau_manifold_66d1.html" title="Calabi-Yau manifold">Calabi-Yau manifold</a>, whom he holds responsible for the decline in property values in his neighborhood. Train-a-Tron is a registered <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a> and holds a Masters degree in Culinary Arts, which he earned through the University of California at Santa Barbara, shortly after his discharge from the Coast Guard for medical reasons.</p>
<p>Train-a-Tron currently is the only piece of industrial-transport equipment ever to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian decoration awarded by the United States Congress. It is worth noting that Train-a-Tron may only be summoned when five transport-concious teens come together and combine their signet rigns (called "signet rings" in teen speak), and shout the phrase "community values means expanded savings, every day!". The five rings symbolize integrity, science, hardwood flooring, humility, and prudent investing habits. Although 60ft. tall and capable of discharging quantum energy blasts from his eyes, Train-a-Tron's preferred method of defeating his enemies is with his <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heckler_and_Koch_aea4.html" title="Heckler and Koch">Heckler and Koch</a> 9mm pistol, which he carries at all times.</p>

<p><b>The Brick Monster</b> is a mystery. Bricks in pavement are often uneven, a condition that acts as evidence supporting the existance of the Brick Monster. The Brick Monster attacks may appear random, but the Monster often targets drunken college students. Though attacks on drunken students are common, equally common are attacks on uncoordinated people and people who are rushing to get somewhere.</p>
<p>Although it is uncertain as to how many of these monsters are in existence, you are bound to run into one on any brick-paved sidewalk. The Brick Monster is the worst enemy of the pedestrian, and leading scientists classify it as cousin to the dreaded pothole.</p>
<p>Here are some of the leading theories about the origins and nature of the infamous Brick Monster:</p>
<p><b>1. The Single Brick Monster Theory:</b> The Brick Monster is a single being who pops up randomly at various points throughout the world, creates an uneven brick, and returns to the netherworld from which he came.</p>
<p><b>2. The Collective Brick Monster Theory:</b> The Brick Monster is more a matter of the brick's state of mind than an actual monster. When a brick decides to become evil, he gives into the powers of a dark force, which make him part of the collective Brick Monster. In this theory, bricks who are incorporated into buildings may make the decision to be good or evil, but they cannot fully act on their decision because they are incapable of actually tripping pedestrians.</p>
<p><b>3. The Viscous Foundation Theory:</b> Scientists have observed that the Brick Monster rarely appears in bricks are set in a concrete foundation. Rather, the Brick Monster appears in bricks set in gravel, sand and other viscous or non-firm foundations. Thus, these researchers do not believe that the brick monster is real. These people refer to themselves as <i>apavementists</i>, a from the Latin route <i>pavementum</i>, meaning "a pavement of tiles or bricks."</p>
<p>The Brick Monster's intent is unclear; is it simply trying to cause mischeif, or could it be trying to stop potential violators of the law from evading the local authorities? Researchers continue to conduct experiments to discover answers to this lingering question.</p>

<p>A ramingo is an extremely rare species of animal, of which there is only one known in existence. It is the outcome of mixing a male rat with a female flamingo. This was done as a top secret science experiment by scientists in Vostok, who were completely surprised by the magnificent results. Funded by Dr. Moreau, the ramingo is planned to be used as a secret government weapon to deliver the bacterium Yersinia pestis, more commonly known as the black plague. The ramingo looks like a giant pink rat, with a flamingos long legs, beak and wings. The main goal was to make a flying rat, that could be host to the flear carrying the plague. May people have referred to the pigeon as the flying rat, but they are just moronic and have no idea of what they are talking about. The ramingo is the true flying rat, and a graceful one at that. Making the animal so beautiful is part of the plan as onlookers will try to get as close as they can to admire the animal while the fleas are doing their magic and spreading the pestilence.Scientists are actively working to breed a female ramingo for Walter, the male ramingo, as to start the breeding process for an army of ramingos. The ramingos are the next step in global warfare.</p>

<p>Munster Settlesack was born October 6th, 1500, and raised in small Amish community somewhere in the great Hawaiian wilderness. His father was a shoemaker and his mother was barn wench. Childhood years were hard on the young Munster. He was often ridiculed by others, and lived a lonesome life at the edge of chaos. His father died when Munster was only a mere 13 years old, and when his mother caught sight of the bloody spectacle that was his father, after the fateful washboard incident, her head exploded, releasing hundreds of kittens and Jell-O pudding snacks into the atmosphere. More frustration, turmoil, and anguish set in, in the following years. At the age of 15, the distraught Settlesack devoured his entire village and had sex with a goat named Lucile producing what we now call 'Canadians'. He roamed the Earth for nearly 400 years spreading his seed and conquering nations.</p>

<p>In the early 20th century, Settlesack found joy writing children’s books, based loosely on his addled childhood in the underbrush of the Hawaiian Amish community. Some of his most renowned books include “<i>Where The Wild Things Are</i>”, “<i>Go Dog Go</i>”, and “<i>The Hotdog Bandit</i>”. As he progressed in his career, his books became too complex for the inferior minds of the target children’s audience. Settlesack retired from his long running career of story telling.</p>
<p>In 1923, after a deep depression, Munster Settlesack found new life in the world of politics. After catching a ferry across the Atlantic, Settlesack moved inland towards Germany. He met an intriguing fellow by the name of Adolf Hitler, who, at the time, was contemplating the theft of all the chocolate in all of Europe. He and Munster made fast friends, sharing life stories of past hardships and losses. Settlesack’s experience in conquering others ultimately led him to a spot as one of Hitler’s top Commanders, and to be a co-writer of “<i>Mein Kampf</i>”. He was later discredited from writing in 1933, after the German Council of Literary Works saw this as a threat to German Literature, seeing the aged American, Settlesack, credited fro writing a book of such caliber. Settlesack raised complaints, saying, "The book was mine! Discredited from a book I poured my heart and soul into!? Blasphemy!" Settlesack was told, as printed in many historical documents, "What kind of a name is Munster, anyway"? His close friend, Adolf, retaliated by killing the Jews.</p>

<p>In April, 1943, after watching “<i>Casablanca</i>” for the fifth time in two days, argument sparked between the two. Hate raged between them for four months before Settlesack resigned from his duty, and fled the continent, swimming the entire length of the ocean, and arriving at a New York seaport two days later. After Munster’s departure, Hitler developed cases of irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, syphilis, and Parkinson's disease. He committed suicide in a bunker two years later.</p>

<p>After finally emerging from his Bungalow in northern Tennesee in the early 70s Settlesack went on to produce hundreds of classic adults films and collect over 450 different strands of the herpes virus and other various STDs which he later used as payment for Satan to gain immortality and the ability to shape-shift. In the early 80s Settlesack took on the guise of David Hasselhoff and appeared on the widely popular "<i>Knight Rider series</i>". He also appeared on such shows as, "<i>The Fresh Prince of Bellaire</i>" as Carlton, and "<i>Saved By The Bell</i>" as Screech. Through the 70s and 80s , he also produced a plethora of Academy Award winning films, such as “<i>The Godfather</i>”, “<i>Scarface</i>”, and “<i>Driving Miss Daisy</i>”, winning the hearts of millions with both his shear ruggedness and soft, sensitivity.</p>

<p>In the late 90s Munster became tired of his nomadic lifestyle and settled down in Manhatten, where he met his transvestite lover, Pauline. Pauline and Settlesack married, and soon after they had 3 children and 4 ferrets. Settlesack now, even through the hardship of exile, lives a modest life of relaxation and reconciliation. He currently lives with his wife-thingy, 3 children and 4 ferrets.</p>

<p>Illinois was the site of the great battle of 1972, where Superman fought against the evil forces of Poland. Poland had many a potato, but Superman was able to overcome these potatoes (or potatos, depending on which Vice President you talk to) with help from a magical camel. This camel was known as Joe, and he obtained his own cigarette company shortly after the battle, which Willy Wonka gave to him. Mr. Wonka kept saying that "candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker!" This resulted in Chuck Norris handing out roundhouse kicks to all. And to all, a good night.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Illinois&amp;diff=37867564&amp;oldid=37764166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Illinois&amp;diff=37867564&amp;oldid=37764166" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>This Thursday marks the second annual “Groundhog Day”. Groundhog Day began when Albert Einstein discovered that groundhogs can predict with perfect accuracy whether the weather will continue its wintry ways (alliteration, Bitches!). The story goes that Alby was out in a sunny, Western Pennsylvanian, snow-covered meadow on February 2nd pleasuring himself when he spied a fuzzy little varmint poking her head out of a hole. Because the groundhog was female and curvaceous, Alby decided the best course of action was to attempt to make love to the sexy hog. As he approached the animal without his trousers around his ankles and fully erect, Alby noticed that the provocative pest was looking at her shadow. Although Alby was ultimately unsuccessful in courting the cute furball, he did get lucky when he noticed that winter dragged on for another 6 whole weeks. If you will recall, Alby was a world-class mathematician, and thus he was able to put two and two together to determine that groundhogs are weather prognosticators. Thus the tradition was born</p>

<p>well mermaids will enjoy thinkerkelp kelp that like duckweed is high ptotein floating food. Thinkerkelp like many known plants will have specific benevolent qualities that go with form</p>
<p>Mermaids with all their beauty do much swimming Tuna have muscles that are capable of 7 to 12 times the energy activity of human muscle Tuna are able to move or virbrate their muscles twice as quickly as those of humans If you were 12 times as strong as a human swimmer any body form will do light like Ariel Darryl plus the many form mermaids findable with Yahoo image mermaid Wonderful advantages to tuna muscles are the ability to live at an enjoyable temperature from the far north to the waters of human swimmers</p>
<p>There you is breathing theres a better way mermaids use the chloride ion of oceanwater or body deposits of chloride where there is freshwater to run their ATP Krebs metabolism O youve heard of it, the gas humans breathe is the electron donor of land peoples metabolism just 3 pt of each lungful of air matters to make water from carbohydrates or lipids uses two hydrogen to each O a Kg of tasty kelp oil typically will have just a quarter mass hydrogen, two hydrogens per O or 4 Kg O per Kg kelp Mermaids that filter chloride Ion from the water are able to swim anywhere ignoring the surface Mermaids make O from carbohydrates The fish like that from a fish perspective the mermaid plantlike benevolent metabolism is like the water surface .</p>
<p>Better things that go with mermaids are their gaze Naming things is funny. A mermaids gaze is like her hair tiny lines like stringy goo come from her think touching fish the tiny lines are appealing to fish when a mermaid prefers to move rapidly or be a little like what humans name an artcar the fish school along her gaze lines then swim with fish mitts water effects make this like adding swim mitts with living viscosity hydroguides Mom n baby dolphins were research to do this with a 30 pt better swim to the young dolphin when the mom swam maternal guide type</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> is it really posted directly at the wall, rather than on a board of some kind? In either case, Wikipedia lacks either The wall of the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland, where the notice on chaining bycycles was posted or The board on the wall of the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland, where the notice on chaining bycycles was posted. A merge of these important, encyclopedic topics with the article on the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland would obviously be the correct thing to do in this case. We also lack a List of notices posted in the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland, in chronological order.

<p>It follows logic thusly:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to many books, there exists a monstrous entity named Cthulhu. Cthulhu lives 'dead but dreaming' in the sunken city of R'lyeh, a place inaccessible to human beings. He will soon rise and eat us all.</li>
<li>Now, Cthulhu, if he exists, exists somewhere inaccessible to human beings, so we cannot be certain of his existence or nonexistence.</li>
<li>If Cthulhu exists, he will give a quick and less painful death to those who have worshipped him and expressed their belief through self-flagellation and ritual sacrifice.</li>
<li>If Cthulhu exists, he will condemn those who have not worshipped him to eternal torture and unimaginable pain.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You may worship Cthulhu, and Cthulhu exists, in which case you suffer only finite pain and a quick death.</li>
<li>You may worship Cthulhu, and Cthulhu doesn't exist, in which case you gain nothing.</li>
<li>You may not worship Cthulhu, and Cthulhu doesn't exist, in which you gain nothing.</li>
<li>You may not worship Cthulhu, and Cthulhu exists, in which case you suffer infinite pain and eternal torture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows the values assigned to each possible outcome:</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<th>Cthulhu exists <span class="texhtml">(<i>p</i>)</span></th>
<th>Cthulhu does not exist <span class="texhtml">(1 − <i>p</i>)</span></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Worship of Cthulhu <span class="texhtml">(<i>E</i><i>P</i>1)</span></th>
<td>+ ∞ (finite pain)</td>
<td>
<center>0</center>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Non-Worship of Cthulhu <span class="texhtml">(<i>E</i><i>P</i>2)</span></th>
<td>− ∞ (infinite pain)</td>
<td>
<center>0</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Now you must wager: do you choose to worship him or not?</p>
<p>So we can describe our calculus of pain, holding <span class="texhtml">(<i>p</i>)</span> as the probability that Cthulhu exists, and <span class="texhtml">(1 − <i>p</i>)</span> that he does not exist.</p>
<p>If you worship him, we assign <span class="texhtml"><i>X</i>1</span> as the pain if he does exist, and <span class="texhtml"><i>X</i>2</span> as the pain if he does not exist. <span class="texhtml"><i>X</i>2</span> is less than <span class="texhtml"><i>X</i>1</span> because in both instances you go through the pain associated with worshipping Cthulhu, but in <span class="texhtml"><i>X</i>1,</span>, you also get eaten, which is more painful.</p>
<p>If you worship him your expected pain <span class="texhtml">(<i>E</i><i>P</i>1)</span> is some finite constant:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><i>P</i>1 = <i>p</i>(<i>X</i>1) + (1 − <i>p</i>)(<i>X</i>2)</span></p>
<p>For the case where you do not worship him, we assign <span class="texhtml"><i>Y</i>1</span> as the pain if he does exist, and <span class="texhtml"><i>Y</i>2</span> as the pain if he does not exist. <span class="texhtml"><i>Y</i>2</span> will be zero or negative, because you actually get pleasure if you don't worship him and he does not exist.</p>
<p>If you do not worship him, your expected pain is:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><i>P</i>2 = <i>p</i>(<i>Y</i>1) + (1 − <i>p</i>)(<i>Y</i>2)</span></p>
<p>However, Y1, the pain if he does exist and you don't worship him, is infinite. Therefore, expected pain is infinite if you do not worship him, no matter what the associated probability <span class="texhtml">(<i>p</i>)</span>.</p>
<p>As infinite pain is always greater than any finite pain, <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><i>P</i>2</span> is always greater than <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><i>P</i>1</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to minimize your pain, the only rational thing for you to do is to pick <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><i>P</i>1</span>, and worship Cthulhu through self-flagellation and ritual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Whilst there is much ambiguity about the nature of true love, it is unanimously agreed upon that to believe in true love one has to believe in both love and truth. For this reason, true love is considered the anti thesis of the postmodernist. Many postmodernists have argued vehemently that true love is an illusion, and that people have no emotional meaning besides what we endow them with from within our own personal ego matrix with socio contextual pertinences. In reply to this a few romantic philosophers kissed their brides dramatically. They were not available for questioning. Other anti-postmodern wizards sent out petitions. 500 signatures were obtained and a movement was passed in the sennate that true love be considered real. The movement is still yet to be decided.</p>

<p>Latus Rectum and the Asymptotes is a High School Band from CT.</p>
<p>Latus Rectum and the Asymptotes started like most bands do, with a dream and some untalented people who wished they were talented. Ross was Latus Rectum (mostly because nobody else really wanted the name), and Sean, Sameer, BE, and Brad were his asymptotes. With days upon days of hard practicing, Latus finally got its big break. It was the 2005 Battle of the Bands put on by Avon High School, though one of the actual bands that played there went to the local Middle School but were allowed to play anyway due to a lack of competing bands.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Needless to say, even more rear was kicked at this show, and Latus was probably #2 in the whole show, although there was never an official ranking (and the fact that I am in the band has absolutely no effect on how I rank them).</p>
<p>Latus performed such hit covers as "Evil" by Interpol and "Fire" by Hendrix. The band also showed off some of its own material, "What can you do?" and the brand new "Greatest song in the world". The latter song was a few chords composed backstage while waiting to play, and the lyrics were made up on the spot by BE (voted coolest member of Latus on the LR forum). The 30 or audience members that had stayed until the end when Latus played were shocked, rocked, and ready to leave unimpressed.</p>
<p>The band needed a change. That change happened quickly. Brad, the drummer, had graduated high school, and this meant leaving the band for the real world. When asked why they never expected Brad to leave at the end of the school year, one Latus member replied, "I always just assumed he wouldn't graduate." Summer vacation had even more surprises in store for the band, including one of the most spectacular websites known to man. BE and Ross left for most of the summer, leaving the band drummerless, bassistless, and keyboardistless. Basically there were only two guitars left, and that's not even really a band.</p>
<p>When all of the members reunited at the end of summer, they briefly considered hitting the road with a reunion tour, but soon realized that they only had two original songs, and nobody outside their high school had heard their name. In fact, most people in the school had never heard of them either.</p>
<p>It was time for a new sound and a new drummer, Collin Kritz. The band had considered Jeff Stote as a possible drummer, but soon realized that his talent was no match for Collin's lack of talent. That and he was already in another band ...</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt.html" title="Salt">Salt</a> with meat is a traditional Chinese dish commonly served at informal gatherings.</p>
<p>The dish is generally unhealthy. A high sodium content may overload the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reflex_arc.html" title="Reflex arc">reflex arc</a> pathways. Lysing of cells may follow. In coastal areas of Southeast China, where salt is abundant, inhabitants may eat salt with meat up to three times a day.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:SandM.JPG">Image:SandM.JPG</a></p>
<p>Immigrants have brought the dish to other countries, namely the United States and Canada, where rice is not native, while salt is in abundance. Residing in Salt Lake City, Utah, honorary chef Lai Xue prepares the specialty dish for local residents. Experience is the foremost prerequisite for preparation of this dish. Variations of the dish include salt with vegetables, salt with rice, and salt with fish.</p>

<p>The first mention of this traditional <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> dish was found in the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Tzu_68bf.html" title="Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_War_4a07.html" title="The Art of War">The Art of War</a>. During the period of the Three Kingdoms, in the kingdom of Wu, the sovereign Jing Di (景帝 jǐng dì) created this dish as ration food for foot soldier attacking the kingdom of <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shu_Han_fa47.html" title="Shu Han">Shu</a>. Sun Tzu cited this meal as an example of achievement in the field of military logistics by the Chinese.</p>
<p>The meal was a success in the field of military logistics because of resistance to spoilage. This meal became essential to the survival of the soldiers at the time. Salt supplied sodium and chlorine ions required for the enzymatic processes of the human body, while meat supplied need proteins to drive the cellular processes of human cells. An inherent advantage of this dish is that meat, when combined with salt, becomes resistant to spoilage by bacteria, therefore, this dish became highly popular for the soldier who can enjoy fresh meat everyday. The meal can be quickly prepared by mixing salt with meat on the battlefield without extensive preparation, thus it saves valuable time for soldiers in combat. The components of the meal: salt and meat, is easily transportable. Therefore, Sun Tzu appraised its invention as a success in the military logistics.</p>
<p>The meal is eaten extensively in the province where honorary chief Lai Xue used to reside: <a href="../../../w/u/_/Wu_Han_9c35.html" title="Wu Han">Wu Han</a> （<a href="../../../%E6%AD%A6/%E6%B1%89/_/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89.html" title="武汉">武汉</a>). The meal is also pravalent in the central provinces of China. During the Cultural Revolution of the Maoist Era, the popularity of the meal rose in norhern province because of the ability of this meal to suply vital nutrient for the body and the ease of preparation. Southern province are too snobish and Westernized, however, to embrace this meal. Therefore, salt with meat is recognized in China as the food of the proletariate.</p>

<p>It is probably a good time to mention that the story of Adriano Macchietto is completely false. A couple of us guys at the UCR CS department decided to see if we could make articles about ourselves and have them stay up. The James Bathgate article was a live for a while, but I think it was discovered to be false after someone checked up on the supposed awards that the WW2 received. As for Adriano, he graduated Spring 2005, so I guess he wins. I'd make a serious effort to get the article deleted, but I haven't the heart. You would think that somebody would have checked the the Italian Wikipedia to at least try to corroborate the story (Instead, somebody seems to have added it to fairytale categories. haha). Anyways, if Wikipedia gets distributed on DVDs in the future, I am hoping that this message will reach anybody who cares enough to hit the discussion tab. Otherwise, I am content with it staying the way it is. Riva Del Flume == Riverside translated through Babelfish.</p>

<p>KEY OPPOSITION</p>
<p>The Quakertown Community Senior High School Panther Marching Band Lackawanna Ring Bologna Club underwent many hard times in its short history, most stemming from opposition within the band led by none other than one RACHAEL SMOLINSKY. Her opposition led to many key military assaults:</p>
<p>BATTLE OF THE PRACTICE ROOM</p>
<p>On September 16, Maj. Gen. Kevin Bancroft confronted Smolinsky's Army of Northern Bandroom at The Practice Room. At dawn September 17, Davis's corps mounted a powerful assault on Smolinksy's left flank that began the single bloodiest day in Band military history. Attacks and counterattacks swept across Parker's cornfield and fighting swirled around the Uniform Room. Rebel assaults against the Drum Section eventually pierced the Drum Major center, but the Chorus advantage was not followed up. Late in the day, Bronsveld’s corps finally got into action, crossing the stage over Parker's Office and rolling up Smolinksy's right. At a crucial moment, Jarrell's division arrived from Upper E Hall and counterattacked, driving back Gumble and saving the day. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Smolinksy committed its entire force, while Solomon sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Smolinsky to fight the QCSHSPMBLRBC to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Smolinsky continued to skirmish with Jarrell throughout the 18th, while removing its wounded south of the Stairs. Bancroft did not renew the assaults. After dark, Smolinsky ordered the battered Army of Northern Bandroom to withdraw across the A Hall to the Upper B Hall.</p>
<p>Gen. Smolinsky and Gen. Rent-A-Cop concentrated its full strength against Maj. Gen. Kevin Bancroft's Army of the Bandroom at the crossroads county seat of The Cafeteria. On July 1, Rebel forces converged on the Caf from west and north, driving Rent-A-Cop defenders back through the streets to Cemetery Hill. During the night, reinforcements arrived for both sides. On July 2, Smolinsky attempted to envelop the Rebels, first striking their left flank at the Stairs, Bandroom, Parker's Office, and the Chorus Room with RentaCop's and Smolinsky's divisions, and then attacking the Rebel right at Jarrell's and Boquist's Room with Bolton's divisions. By evening, the Federals retained The Stairs and had repulsed most of Bolton's men. During the morning of July 3, the RentaCop infantry was driven from their last toe-hold on the Gym and the desk he sits at all day. In the afternoon, after a preliminary artillery bombardment, Smolinsky attacked the Union center near the Toms. The Silk-Boquist assault (more popularly, Boquist's Charge) momentarily pierced the Bando line but was driven back with severe casualties. Tyson's cavalry attempted to gain the Bando rear but was repulsed. On July 4, Smolinsky began withdrawing her army toward The Theatre on the A hall.</p>
<p>Her train of wounded stretched more than fourteen miles.</p>

<p>...Sadly one night, while flying his plane harmlessly over an area of the jungle he was quite familiar with, a large figure smashed down onto the top of the aircraft. Later, it was figured out that it was Dk. Funky suffered a fatal injury from the fall and is hospitalized for life. When asked the reason for doing this, Dk replied "ARRUGH! Charles MANSON!!!!" and took out 4 of the interviewers. Dk is still being chased by police. LOCK YOUR DOORS!</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the Toastmaster General is a now defunct ministerial position. The king's letters to his subjects are known to have been carried by relays of couriers as long ago as the 15th century. In 1510, Sir Brian Tuke was appointed as "Master of the King's Toast". In 1609 it was decreed that letters could only be carried and delivered by persons authorised by the Toastmaster General. 1660 saw the establishment of the General Letter Office, this would later become the General Toast Office (GTO). The Buttergraph Act of 1868 established the office of the Toastmaster General's right to exclusively maintain electric buttergraphs. This would subsequently extend to buttercommunications and breadcasting. The title of "Toastmaster General" was abolished under the Toast Office Act of 1969. A new public authority governed by a chairman was established under the name of the "Toast Office." The position of "Toastmaster General" was replaced with "Minister of Toasts and Buttercommunications".</p>

<p><i>Blogger:</i> Term used to describe anyone with enough time or narcissism to document every tedious bit of minutia filling their uneventful lives. Possibly the most annoying thing about bloggers is the sense of self-importance they get after even the most modest of publicity. Sometimes it takes as little as a referral on a more popular blogger's website to set the lesser blogger's ego into orbit.</p>

<p>Shoes Make Fire is a phrase originated by the American mad bibliophile Tyler Key. He formulated this phrase after having his own shoes rub enormous blisters on the heels of his feet. After hours of pain and anguish on a hiking trail, he finally deposed his shoes and archaicly exclaimed "AHHH SHOES MAKE FIRE!!!!" and with this remark, the world has been enlightened.</p>

<dd>The television in my bedroom makes a loud noise in the middle of every night (and so does the radiator). Most likely the external casing is involved, as this is large and lightweight and therefore quite resonant.

<p>(Article contains injokes, read Mr. Urbaniak's <a href="http://urbaniak.livejournal.com" class="external text" title="http://urbaniak.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">Blog</a> to get the 411) Born in the fragile year of 1964, James Urbaniak went on to become the king of the Independent Acting world. Beloved by society for his potrayal of the not so titular character Simon Grim in Hal Hartley's Henry Fool, he went on bless the acting world with his brilliant potrayal of R. Crumb in the Harvey Pekar biopic American Splendor. A controversial performance for bringing to life Crumb's awesomeness, his performance was chastised by Aline Kominsky for being too twitchy/awesome. Crumb however has not given his opinion on the performance, an act which Mr.Urbaniak 'takes as a compliment', he reportedly said with a shy smirk. On his long and amazing journey to become the world's modern Jimmy Durante, James Urbaniak currently stars as Dr. Thaddeus Venture and co-stars as The Phantom Limb on Christoppher McCulloch's shockingly subversive The Venture Bros. He also dabbles in the cartoon form's oppurtunity to improvise, with such gems such as 'Hey now Mister--' 'Oof! Auugh!' amongst other brilliant, equally shining diamonds in the rough. His theatre work includes the one man show Thom Pain (based on nothing), for which he has gained victory to himself via Drama Desk Award. Right now between his amazing career as the vocals of his shockingly conformistly anarchistic glam band Brazen and his career as the Nite Owl, he is currently completing the pilot Kidnapped for NBC where reality imitates art in the past, and he plays an assassin. Guest roles include Sex in the City, Law and Order, Law and Order: SVU. Currently he is lurking in Berlin, working on a sequel to the beloved Henry Fool, Fay Grim. He does it all because he is awesome. His hobbies include a flagrant disrespect of the law, and he is known in certain circles as Europe's 'Che Guevera of Turnstile Hopping'.</p>

It is rather absurd humor in the least, but highly comical. Amoungst many American middle-schoolers, Monty Python is very popular. So popular in fact, that some have dedicated their lives to commiting to memory large portions of "Monty Script" to memory and quoting it ad lib, very arbitrarily. In the film, King Arthur is looking for knights to join him at his Round Table at Camelot. He is accompanied by his trusty horse Patsy, who is a human with a coconut to emit the sound of a horse's hoofs. As he travels, he comes upon a castle. Arthur calls up to the two guards on watch, asking them to tell their master that "King Arthur of the Britians" requests to speak with him about joining him at his Round Table at Camelot. They are rather dissinterested about asking their master about the Round Table, so they strike up a discussion about where Patsy got the coconuts. They deduct that if a swallow were to carry the coconut from some tropical region, it could not possibly accomplish the task. "A two-ounce European swallow cannot carry a one-pound coconut," exclaims one of the guards. "Maybe a African swallow; they're bigger," says the other. "What about two swallows carrying a coconut between them?" By this time, King Arthur is impatient to the point of exasperation and decides to go look for knights elsewhere.</p>
<p>He then comes upon a small town in which witch trails are taking place. There is a knight to whom a mob has brought a "witch" who appears to be wearing a carrot-lik nose and a pointy black hat. "She's a WITCH! Burn her! Burn her!" The mob cries. The knight then asks what makes them think she is a witch. "Because she looks like one!" shouts on from the crowd. There are exclamations of agreement. One man with a big forehead says, "She turned me into a newt." Silence. "I got better." "Do you know that there are ways of telling if one is a witch?" asks the knight. "No, No" the crowd murmurs. "What do you do with witches?" "Burn them! Burn them!" "What else do you burn?" Silence. "Wood?" The same man with a big forehead trys. "Gooood," says the knight. "Does wood float or sink in water?" "It floats, it floats." "Alright, what else floats in water?" "Cherries;" "Very, very small rocks;" "People;" "Chruches;" Then Arthur shouts, "A DUCK!" "Very good," says the knight. "So...." "So, since wood and ducks float in water,....then...if a witch weighs the same as a duck,....SHE'S A WITCH!" There are cries of assent and shouts of "Burn her!" "BURN HER!" The innocent woman, of course using rigged scales, is 'convicted'. King Arthur approachs the knight. Upon asking him if he would join the Round Table, the knight immediately takes a knee and says "It would be an honor." King Arthure gathers more knights, when suddendly God tells him to go and find the Holy Grail. Arthur and his knights split up and go searching. Sir Robin the Brave chikens out against a three-headed giant, Sir Lancelot goes on a slaughtering rampage, and Sir Robert the Chaste almost fallls for a nun. Then they all rejoin (there was much rejoicing) and then ate Sir Robin's ministrels (there was even more rejoicing). They are then mocked by some French soliders because they cannot and will not and do not obtain the Grail.</p>
<p>And so the film goes, with no structure at all, until the movie ends with King Arthur and his knights being arrested by the Scothish Guard for murder. The Holy Grail remains hidden, as it will be for many centuries to come. Feel free to browse the rest of the article for more info on how the Holy Grail remains hidden.</p>

<p>My name is Bernardo Fernandez Jr. I have truly had more than my fair share of "15 Minutes of Fame".</p>
<p>1) My first 15 Minutes of Fame occurred when I was in 6th grade. It was my first job as a newspaper boy for the Hagerstown News. They had a contest that whomever signed up the most new subscribers would win a trip to Baltimore to the see the Orioles vs A's. I won the contest and was in the paper and got to see Reggie Jackson when he played for the Orioles.</p>
<p>2) When I was a Freshman in high school I was in the local newspaper for playing an Elf in a highschool production of Heidi. I was the Elf that told the story.</p>
<p>3) In 1983 I was interviewed in El Paso, Texas on a local radio station promoting a nightclub call Foxy's for a Halloween party.</p>
<p>4) In 1984 I was cast as an extra in the CBS mini-series Space in England, which turned into a speaking part with an opportunity to go to L.A. for a screen test. I was in every local newspaper, base magazine, and local tv story. Along with local newspaper back in my hometown of Shelby, Ohio.</p>
<p>5) In 1984 I won silver medal in USAFE Boxing Tournament and was in all the base newspapers and magazines in USAFE.</p>
<p>6) In 1985 I was on the cover of the Alconbury Base Magazine demonstrating the new DUI Breathalizer.</p>
<p>7) In 1992 I was in the newspaper for being the top salesperson in the state of Ohio for Cellular One.</p>
<p>8) In 1994 I was recognized in the newspaper for being the first salesperson to sell 100 cellphones in one month.</p>
<p>9) In 1994 I was a guest speacker at the World Wireless Conference "How to make money selling".</p>
<p>10) In 1995 I was the feature story in a national quarterly cellular magazine "The ABC's of Selling".</p>
<p>11) In 1997 I was interviewed on local tv station in columbus ohio for promoting Drink and Drive Safe over the holidays.</p>
<p>12) In 1997 I was featured in a local business publication Business First for my audit business.</p>
<p>12) In 1998 I was interviewed by a Columbus News station about the activities at the Muirfield Golf Tournament.</p>
<p>13) In 2001 I attended the Billboard Music Awards and was smack center of the tv when Bernie Mac stood beside me signing off and thanking the viewers for watching. I was fortunate to be sitting right behind Tim McGraw and Janet Jackson in an isle seat 4 rows from the stage. So everytime someone got an award they had to walk right by me. My phone rang for 3 days with people asking if that was me they saw on tv.</p>
<p>13) In 2002 I was interviewed again by a Columbus TV station being interviewed about the OSU Buckeyes Championship game.</p>
<p>14) In 2003 I was on the front page of the Technology section in the USA Today.</p>
<p>15) In 2005 I was interviewed by several publications in reference to David Cahall who scammed me and several other for over 2 million dollars!</p>

<p>Random Standard Time, or RST, is the time-zone used specifically at <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_Hall_661b.html" title="Random Hall">Random Hall</a>, a dorm at the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.</p>
<p>While the zone itself is not a shift, it attempts to redefine what constitutes a day in the hope that less people will be confused come midnight. Thus, the day changes occur between 29:59:59 and 6:00. RST is actually based on EST, and can be calculated in the following manner:</p>
<pre>
RST:hours = (EST:hours &lt; 6) ? (EST:hours+24) : (EST:hours)
RST:minutes = EST:minutes
</pre>
<p>The most significant difference is that the day-shift does not occur when everyone in Random Hall is most active (i.e. 2400), thus enabling the words 'tomorrow', 'today', and 'yesterday' to have more useful meanings. An example of a typical conversation before RST:</p>
<pre>
3:15 AM
Person A: "I'm so hosed, I have a PSet due tomorrow that I haven't started yet."
Person B: "No, you have it due _today_ (chuckle ensues)"
</pre>
<p>RST can be seen as a safeguard against person B from being harmed by person A.</p>

<p>However, forensic evidence claims these briefs are Adolf's, and the investigation is still ongoing now. There were other examples of briefs and vests found at concentration camps which are claimed to be Adolf Hitler's.</p>
<p>It is disputed as to whether the briefs found at various concentration camp were Adolf Hitler's or not.</p>
<p>Primary sources claim Adolf Hitler's briefs can be found at many concentration camps within the premises.</p>

<p>A whore is a person with loose values, morals, and pussy. Sometimes refered to as "slut" "woman of the night" or "ho" (not to be confused with the garden tool) A whore may be used to describe one who a) Sleeps around or "gets around the block" for money, or, b) One who has sex with many anonymous partners for pleasure. Whores have evolved throughout the ages. The most notible change occouring in 1997 when a whore was "skeeted" on in the face. This brought upon the facial revolution of 1997. In late 2003 the first skull penitration took place. The sound was described to be similar to shoving your fist in a jar of jam or strawberry-vanilla pudding. Whoredom developed in many third world countries, as late as 634BCE and has since expanded into the west, such as North America and South America. Every year rallies are held to protest, and to promote whoredom to those who are unaware, or just curious. Recently a new leader of the WAA (Whores activist association) has been elected, and weekly provides public services and also is a motiviational speaker for young aspiring whores.</p>

<p>A cybernetic hybrid of cheesy poofs and quack emotional therapy, Oprahsaurus was created in 1066 shortly following the Battle of the Hastings. It was used as the secret weapon during the <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxer_Rebellion_5c32.html" title="Boxer Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> which ended the 500 year Boxer-Brief dynasty. Following <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah.html" title="Oprah">Oprah</a>'s purchase of all the Boxers in the country, including <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Ali_e9d6.html" title="Mohammed Ali">Mohammed Ali</a>, the economic system collapsed resulting in the Brief Depression.

<p>Maine Lobsters are actually native to the waters of New York. The term "lobster" first referred to a fuzzy otter-like creature commonly found along the New England coast. Teddy Roosevelt, during his time in New York City, led a campaign to have Maine Lobsters, then known as "Awful Clawfuls" removed from the city sewers and water ways (where they were causing much damage to the infrastructure) and relocated to the cold waters of Maine. The creatures quickly overcame the "fuzzy old lobsters" and became quite prevelant, eventually driving the otter-like mammals to extinction. Locals began refering to the "Awful Clawfuls" as "the Awful Lobster-killers" and eventually just "Lobsters."</p>

<p>In the modern world "Cheese" is used as a metaphor for a wide and varied selection of things. From the historical position of being a main food stuff of Henry VIII, it has grown and developed through the years into one of the greatest leaders of modern time. After a bried stint as Chancellor of Germany 1933-45, cheese moved on to become one of Great Britains leading actors, starting off with Graeme Garden, and Tim-Brooke Taylor as the third "Goodie" cheese was eventually awarded an OBE for it's outstanding work on Badger Watch. Before long, Cheese became bored, and after being the one and only James Bond, decided to increase it's legend status but staring in "The Pacifier", "XXX", and "The Fast And The Furious" as that yellow car.</p>
<p>More recently however, cheese has once again become nothing more than a humble food stuff and tastes fantastic on toast.</p>

<p>Bobby 'Cosmo' Martin is an American Chocolate Labrador who resides in Fair Oaks, Texas. He was born in the summer of 1999, and has made countless contributions to society.</p>
<p>He is an undisputed master of the English language, understanding several complex command sequences such as "sit", "lay down", "roll over", "do you want a cookie", and "walk." Not only can he perform these difficult tasks, but he can also understand and answer different burning questions such as, "what time is it?" This marvel of nature can actually tell time on the 24 hr. system and inform the person inquiring that it is indeed time for him to consume his midday meal. Bobby Martin has his afternoon feast at precisely 3:00 pm every day and is vigliant in making sure that his family keeps it that way. Bobby's extreme dedication to sticking with tradition and consistency is just one of a slew of admirable traits posessed by the beast.</p>
<p>Bobby Martin is also an extremely proficient swimmer, putting many Olympic athletes to shame. According to lore, Martin once spent over 5 hours training in the pool without any rest, therefore permanantly etching his aquatic abilities into the stories of legend. Not just a local legend, Bobby has reportedly been admired and talked about by many accomplished celeberties. Olympic Swimmer Greg Louganis is rumored to have said, "that dog sure can can swim," and Baywatch heartthrob David Hasselhoff reportedly said "I wish that dog had been on my squad. A lot of unnecessary drownings certainally could've been averted." Many have tried to match Martin in stamina and distance, but so far, none have had the heart. For now, it seems that his crown is secure, and that undoubtablly pleases him greatly.</p>
<p>Bobby Martin has invented an new method of water elimination after prolonged water exercises. The technique know only to Bobby Martin is known as the "tripod stance" meaning, that Bobby Martin has the ability to stand motionless for a recorded 75 seconds with the only movement being the red, torpedo shaped penis through which Bobby Martin eliminates excess water from his system, no doubt taken on during grueling high stepping cardiovasular drills when his olympic traning coach yells "Go Bobby Go". To observe the water elimiation event is truly an opportunity to observe the upmost in control, poise, dignity and shameless pleasure and relief.</p>
<p>Bobby Martin has the ability to differentiate not only types of cars according to sound but the color of cars according to sound. It has been recorded, again and again, that Bobby Martin can discern a silver BMW and maroon Expedition from literally hundreds of cars traveling across the same street in front of his home. Truly a remarkable feat as, the BMW has a 5 sped transmission and Bobby Martin ONLY greets this car. Although it has not been scientifically proven that Bobby Martin can differentiate the car according to transmissin type, the studies are under way to prove or disprove this astounding fact.</p>
<p>It has been said that 'It's lonely at the top,' but not for Martin. Bobby has maintained a suprisingly low profile over the years, which has shielded him from the endless sexual advances from women and flashing lights of the paparazzi. Bobby once mentioned that he was no 'German Sheppard," undoubtably in reference to Benji("Benji", 1986) and Eddie(TV Sitcom 'Frasier") the cocaine-addicted mutts of Hollywood.</p>
<p>Loved by most, hated by some, but RESPECTED by all, Bobby is without question the most revered living being to ever exist on the earth. He knows what he wants in life, and he isn't afraid to go get it. We could all benefit from his experience and hopefully someday, mankind will rise to his level, ensuring a beautiful and prosperous future for all.</p>

<p>The Shampoo Effect refers to the effect of doing a little bit of something (usually drinking alcohol) after doing a lot of something and getting the same effect. If you read the directions on the back of a bottle of shampoo, it nearly always says "Lather, Rinse, Repeat", and the repeat is the important step here. If you wash your hair normally with shampoo and then after you are all rinsed, put a tiny drop of shampoo in your hair and you will have a full lather even though the amount of shampoo was minimal. Take the same idea and put it to drinking: if you drink a ton of booze one night and get drunk, the next morning you can just have a shot or a beer and you will feel the effects much stronger than you would if you didn't have anything the night before. Hence, the Shampoo Effect.</p>

<p><i>In other words, it sounds cool and would make a neat movie although it couldn't actually happen.</i></p>

<p>Universal Testicularism is a cult of approximately 250 members in and around the Barrington area. It started in February, 2004 by Chris Bove and Bobby Schramm. Unfortuantely, because many non-members do not take the cult seriously, it has not yet recieved recognition.</p>
<p><b>Basic Beliefs-</b> Our universe is inside the scrotum of the god named KWJYKUUP( the first five letters are silent). Our god lives in his own universe with other gods containing other universes. All the planets and stars are his many testicles and humans are his sperm. When a human dies, his soul gets ejaculated into either a good female god (heaven), a bad god (hell) or when our god is masturbating (purgatory). Catastrophes usually occur when god is having sex, and most deaths not during catastrophes occur during god’s weak perpetual masturbation. Earthquakes occur when god gets kicked in the balls.</p>
