<p>*<b>Support</b> I strongly agree with User:Fagstein, a similar title change was a great comprimise which worked in another passionate contoversy. Please see:<a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html#Article_structures_which_can_imply_a_view" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Article_structures_which_can_imply_a_view</a> where <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_terrorism.html" title="Zionist terrorism">Zionist terrorism</a> was changed to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_political_violence.html" title="Zionist political violence">Zionist political violence</a>. Plus, If this compromise title reaches a consensus, we can add this article to the policy page as another good example of compromise&#160;:).<br />
In addition, "Allegations" violates <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 23:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br /></p>

<li>No strong opinion on current title, but oppose Fagstein's proposal. Political violence is much too broad, including war by any reasonable interpretation. 14:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>-Oppose. And i oppose even more Fagstein's proposal. So long as "terrorism" is a word being used in daily conversation, possessing a conventionally understood meaning, then i utterly oppose any and all attempts to water down the term by substituting more acceptable rhetoric so as to appease the fragile egos and tender sentiments that right-wing zealots indulge in when using their country's name. The simple fact is that the early Zionist movement utilized what we today unqualifiedly understand as **terrorism**, and by changing the title that fact has been distorted and hidden. Similarly, what is being attempted here is directly analagous; one need only change the word "Israel" with "United States" and the motives for the lie read precisely the same.<br />
Furthermore, by limiting the page to "Allegations of State Sponsored Terrorism", the title limits us to *only* a discussion of currently evolving events. Unfortunately, whether the more sensitive among us here would like to admit it or not, there is a VERY LONG HISTORY of U.S. sponsored terrorism: the Indian Wars, raids against Indian villages shortly after the establishment of the Texas Republic, Civil War irregulars, the invasion of the Phillippines saw a good lot as well as Cuba, during the Spanish American war - the list goes on, i'm sure.<br />
These are not *allegations*. These are flat-out fully documented *facts*, and whether or not people here *like* them is beside the point. There is simply *no* *possible* *means* to justify the change of the title to the sham that currently sits there.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:29, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If the name is <i>US state-sponsored political violence</i>, it is an invitation to original research, trying to collect factoids to prove a case. If it is <i>American terrorism (term)</i>, or <i>Allegations of state terrorism by (the) United States of America</i>, then it is clear that we are writing an article about the allegetions. To me this seems central to having encyclopedic coverage of this topic. As long as the title makes it clear that we are writing about allegations, I have no great preference. I again point out that <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism_%28term%29.html" title="American terrorism (term)">American terrorism (term)</a> (now merged in here) was stable for several months under a similar model. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hogwash. There is plenty of evidence out there to demonstrate U.S. sponsorship of terrorist groups in Cuba, Indonesia, Haiti, El Salvador, Columbia, and Nicaragua, and those are just the ones that i can recall unquestionable facts for immediately, off the top of my head. I suspect that there is similar evidence to support a case for U.S. involvement in terrorism in Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma, Laos, Iran (i know i've read at least three or four newspaper articles in the last year that detail U.S. sponsored groups carrying out bombing raids in Irani territory), Angola, and other African nations as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem here is that a group of Wiksters has decided that they don't like the *sound* of "Terrorism Sponsored by the United States", and so they are insisting on the name being changed. The evidence to support the title is validated many, many times over, and the use of the word "terrorism" in this context is by no means stretched or forced. The problem here is simply politics; many citizens in today's United States like to pretend as if they have a moral high-ground over "terrorists" and refuse to accept that terrorist acts are far more often perpetrated by military organizations than they are by so-called "terrorist" groups. While it may not be the case that militaries must strap hidden bombs onto their fighters' backs and send them on missions-of-no-return, there is yet no *moral* or *tactical* difference between bombing civilian infrastructure from the safety of unassailable jets, sending a suicide bomber onto a crowded bus, or targeting major business centers, marketplaces, ports or tourist attractions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the United States is going to funnel money into groups like the Contras, the Maton Coute Coute, the Cuban Refugee groups down in South Florida, Indonesian militias, or -- as now -- Kurdish and Iraqi death squads (and there is more than enough evidence out there to justify this list alone), then there is no possible justification for allowing it to condemn the terrorist violence used by non-state groups as somehow extraordinary or beyond the bounds of human decency.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The title "Allegations of State Terrorism" is nothing more than a cynical and hypocritical attempt to divert attention away from the root causes of today's world conflicts, and i -- as an American, a citizen of the United Staes, and a diligent and laborious expatriate -- am deeply offended by it. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:19, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>--Church committee reports, yes. But needs an expanded account of verifiable, notable claims of CIA involvement in terrorist attacks against Cuba. There isn't any point arguing this - these act have been clearly described as terrorism by the perpetrators - the claims exist - they've been made in notable forums (UN) by notable people (leading politicians and ministers) - and are supplemented by a significant amount of evidence revealed in declassified documents.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 02:07, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

You also acknowledge here that the US trains people in the SOA, "How many of the 60,000 graduates are we talking about here? 10% or so?" but yet you write above: "can I see proof that his actions in his country were funded by the US?" Is training someone to be a terrorist considered evidence enough for you User:Zer0faults? We have already discussed the sections of this manual at length, and to my knowledge, you have never addressed the sections which encourage terrorism.

<li>-Include. U.S. development of "terrorist infrastructure," then of course not called that because their targets were the "bad guys" (the Soviet Army). When their targets switched, e.g. the US military headquarters, the Pentagon, was attacked on 9/11, it was routinely called terrorism. Shows US attempts to manipulate the term. Same for Reagan's statement that the terrorist Contras (acknowledged to commit terrorist acts by US State Dep't) are "the moral equivalent of the founding fathers." Some of this could be mentioned in the intro. section about uses and manipulations of the term for political motives. Just to be clear, I am not suggesting that the mujahadin's US-funded guerilla warfare against the Soviet occupying troops constituted terrorism. I am saying: (1) the US training and financing was critical for the founding and development of al qaida and OBL--should be discussed in the body of the article; (2) the inconsistent application of the term by US politicians and the media--should be discussed in intro section. --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 16:29, 7 September 2006 (UTC) Just to follow up, since al qaida is thought to be perhaps THE preeminent international terrorist organization, the fact that the US trained the people who went on to found it in the ways of guerilla warfare/terror (small cell structure operating on need to know basis), brought many of them together, and provided military training, weapons, funding, crucial coordiantion etc. is quite important to understanding terrorism today. So the US support of the mujahadin, while not state terrorism in itself (unless someone finds sources stating that at the time the mujahadin attacked a civilian target, for example an Afghan gov't target--I have not looked), without this support, Sept. 11, Madrid, etc. would not have been possible as we know them. Thus, at a minimum it's being an indispensable state enabler of al qaida terrorism. --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 22:28, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>--Military forces can committ terrorism. The Allied air campaigns against German cities in WW@ is an example. Killing civialins for political purposes. The air campaigns in South Vietnam, Operation Mongoose was a terrorist campaign(Mai Lai massacre a small part of it). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen01_857e.html" title="User:Green01">User:Green01</a> 3:44, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep but DISTINGUISH. Go into reasons for and agains excluding in the definitions section. See my comment about about Vietnam. The reader should draw his/her own conclusions based on the info and the defitions presented. We report, they decide. --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 00:01, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. Terrorism is a tactic. If an army goes into a region and kills every male child over the age of ten -- as the U.S. did in its invasion of the Phillippines -- then that is flat-out, unqualified terrorism. Moreover, the U.S. army has only recently become a "professional" army; prior to about fifty years ago, it was a draftee- or volunteer-army.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:47, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>--Assasinations of high-profile political activists is terrorism. The assasination of Archbishop Romero(1980), or Fred Hampton(1969). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen01_857e.html" title="User:Green01">User:Green01</a> 3:46, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. The CIA has an explicit policy against political assassinations, so that if groups supported and trained by the U.S. engage in them it is obviously a transgression of the public standard of conduct espoused by the United States Government itself. Assassinations in which U.S. sponsored groups are involved thus become important measures of how well the United States abides by its own public legal and political assertions.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 12:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep if important enough. See Northwood comment. Official plans, proposals and policies can be quite instructive as to institutional direction and motivation for terrorist actions, political appointee oversight (Northwoods proposal killed by pol. appointee), legislative v. executive branch checks and balances (Church Committee review of CIA assassination policy) etc. The article should make quite clear whether or not it was known to be implemented. --<a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYCJosh_d39d.html" title="User:NYCJosh">NYCJosh</a> 00:07, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
