<dd>- Another theory is the exponential use and abuse of chemicals in affluent nations since the second world war. Vast numbers of chemicals are introduced into our indoor and outdoor environments with little or no testing regarding their toxicity to living beings. Many believe that air quality is getting worse rather than better, particularly if one considers indoor air quality as well as outdoor. (Indoor air quality has become significantly worse since building codes changed in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> to make buildings more air-tight and therefore to conserve energy. This affects buildings built since this time.) Adverse reactions to toxins vary considerably from one person to another, and can involve extremes in symptoms including the <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervous_system.html" title="Nervous system">neurological</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endocrine_system.html" title="Endocrine system">endocrine systems</a> as well as the more commonly recognized allergy symptoms listed above. +</dd>
<dd>- Allergies are also viewed by some medical practitioners as a negative consequence of the use and abuse of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antibiotics.html" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination.html" title="Vaccination">vaccinations</a>. This mainstream Western approach to treatment and prevention of infectious disease has been used in the more affluent "<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_world.html" title="First world">First world</a>" for a longer period ot time than in the rest of the world, hence the much greater commonality of allergies in the First world. Little effort has been made to research the long-term negative effects of antibiotic use or of the use of vaccinations. There can be no doubt that these medicines affect the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a>, and that allergies are typically viewed as a dysfunctional immune response. Without the necessary research to prove or disprove this theory, much is left to speculation. +</dd>

<p>Alex, Heidimo:<br />
I have updated, expanded and categorised the article. Please offer your comments. I have put the "hygiene hypothesis" under a seperate header, as it is still a hypothesis (although evidence abounds), and reintroduced the alternative explanations for the rise in allergies. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a><br />

<dd>Good compromise. I deleted the paragraphs because of very obvious claims that weren't really substantiated. In particular, the phrase <i>"There can be no doubt that these medicines affect the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a>, and that allergies are typically viewed as a dysfunctional immune response. Without the necessary research to prove or disprove this theory, much is left to speculation."</i> strongly suggests allergies are '<b>caused'</b> by antibiotics or vaccinations, a point which does not have much (if any) published evidence behind it. I hope my revised version can stay. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 12:11, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must I haven't read through the section. I just put it back. You're correct that the language is rather firm and might be hard to corrobate with research data. For the sake of NPOV, I think some corrections ought to be made, but the section itself <i>does</i> belong in the article. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a><br />

Is the hygeine hypothesis different from Ecological Illness/Environmnetal Health.

Both seem a load of crap, at least scientifically. They might be correct, but they just leap to conclusions (WDIFSA tries to convince the reader the immune system consists of only 3 cell types, and all true-allergies are IgE related). Personally I was environmnetally sensitive to dairy when I was 15, but thank Word that's over. I think <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toll-like_receptor.html" title="Toll-like receptor">TLRs</a> may play a part in all this non-IgE reactions.

<p>The Hygiene Hypothesis is a total joke. It doesn't explain the physiology of the disorder in stark contrast to more scientific ideas about IgE and viruses. My reference "Is there a link between hygiene and allergic disorders" was written by Salvi and Holgate who are big names in Allergy research.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand how this putative fact supports the "Hygiene Hypothesis": "One supporting fact is that many Chinese will develop hay fever after moving into USA for three or more years." The hypothesis, at least as currently described on the page, claims that the predisposition to allergic reactions develops due to excessive cleanliness during childhood development.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, with respect to the discussion above, note that some allergic responses are thought to develop only after repeated or sustained exposure. So this assertion is at least not categorically true: "If it is the change of irritants, it should happen immediately." -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanM_3b61.html" title="User:DanM">User:DanM</a> 3 March 2007</dd>

<p>It might be good to contrast allergies with <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_intolerance.html" title="Food intolerance">food intolerance</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I agree that food intolerance should be contrasted briefly with food allergies on this page, and I definately think that food intolerance should not redirect to food allergy.

Also, animal work needs corroboration in humans. S Holland, MD <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 22:51, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of the people who have looked at the research, maybe you can tell me if they have controlled for this hypothesis: (1) Parent is allergic to X, (2) Parent avoids X, (3) Child is always/mostly with parent at young age, (4) being exposed to X at young age increases probability of hypersensitivity (allergy) to X, (5) from 2 and 3, child is not exposed to X, (6) therefore from 4 and 5, child is also hypersensitive to X. I guess all it would take is a decent adoption study. -- <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealGrouchy_6e83.html" title="User:RealGrouchy">RealGrouchy</a> 02:14, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I heard somewhere that some had therorized that those who had household pets in their household at a very young age are less likely to develop allergies than those that don't. (Under the theory that pets help keep the place from being TOO clean). I'm not sure how reliable it is though. Jon 19:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First: <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032100.asp#T032107" class="external free" title="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032100.asp#T032107" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032100.asp#T032107</a> "Cow feed undoubtedly contains pesticides, and cows are given antibiotics to keep them from getting sick and hormones to increase their milk production."</p>
<p>It then goes on to say: "Whether or not these substances show up in standard milk (which is supposed to be tested for detectable residues) is uncertain." And ofcourse, they have to say this, because there is a huge amount of investments in the Milk-industry.</p>
<p>Second: <a href="http://www.newstarget.com/010443.html" class="external free" title="http://www.newstarget.com/010443.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newstarget.com/010443.html</a></p>
<p>"Milk allergies may sometimes be penicillin allergies</p>
<p>Antibiotics, most commonly penicillin, are given to cows for the treatment of mastitis, an inflammation of the udders. Cows are not supposed to be milked for forty-eight hours after receiving penicillin. Often this precaution is not followed and then penicillin appears in the milk in small quantities. People allergic to penicillin-an estimated 1 percent of the United States population-may develop symptoms of penicillin allergy after drinking milk contaminated with this antibiotic. The allergic reaction may take the form of hives, sneezing, asthma, or an unexplained rash. Don't Drink Your Milk by Frank A Oski MD, page 55"</p>
<p>This all points towards the theory that all the penecilin and antibiotics, which are abused alot, damages the immune-system. So the common thing for allergies is that they are not genetical, but damaged immune-system. This is why there has been an explotion in the amount of people getting allergies now a days, compared to before. It's not a sudden mutation in our genes that has become widespread.</p>
<p>In the same way that you are told to avoid antibiotics when ill, because it causes resistance and damaged immune-system. The same way, you get all these antibiotics indirectly from your parent intake of antibiotic-filled milk and maybe also meat.</p>

Typically reactions to the casein in dairy products will involve a full-fledged immune response, manifesting as specific as a skin rash, or as general as fatigue. What happens during an allergic reaction is that your immune system cells treat the certain "offending" molecules, casein for example, as if it were foreign and dangerous. Some immune system cells will bind to the offending molecule in the food, triggering a cascade of physiological events that will activate other components of the immune system. This would then harness chemical messengers such as histamine to 'alert' the body that there is 'danger'. Inflammation and the creation of immune complexes that disrupt normal physiological functioning may ensue as a result."</p>

<p>The "nuts" subtree portion of common alergies with "nuts" itself as a child node of the "nuts" category is a bit odd. At the very least the child section of "nuts" below peanuts should be rephrased as "other nuts", but it would be far better to instead be replaced by a list of the other nuts that are common alergies. 168.166.196.40 21:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just looking at this article I feel that a few improvements are required, particuarly regarding medical implications.</p>
<p>differences between Hypersensitivity vs allergie vs adverse drug effects in medical situations</p>
<p>An adverse drug reaction (eg nausea and vomiting) IS NOT the same as an allergic reaction. Nausea and vomiting following penicillin consumption can be common but is not an allergic reaction and therefore could mean that penicillins cold still be used where appropriate. Similarly, a latex allergy involves typical allergic symptoms, and if you use condoms for example you're unlikely to allergic to latex. In surgery this is an important difference due to the need in surgery to use non-latex gloves and a latex free zone. Therefore determining the difference is important for both therapeutic and surgical reasons.--Mofs 12:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>this article is not for disambiguation. This article clearly states at the start it is about ONLY IgE-mediated hypersensities. Whether the article is actually following this is another question though.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 01:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand the difference between hypersensitivity and allergies, but the point i was making that in a clinical setting this clarfification needs to be made. the Hypersenitivity article is little more than a list of the different types of reactions whereas the allergy article (which most people without a clinical or biological background would head for initially) focuses on wider topics. In this sense, I felt that this was a relevant title to insert because of the need in a clincal setting to differentiate the two--Mofs 17:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This article does not focus on wider topics. It focuses on IgE mediated hypersensitivity. Anything you feel is appropriate for this page should most likely be moved to the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypersensitivity.html" title="Hypersensitivity">Hypersensitivity</a> main article.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 00:52, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>These sections seem very POV and under sourced.</p>
<p>Additionally I am worrying about their relevance to this article. This article is about IgE mediated allergies ONLY. It is not a general hypersensity article. The hygeine hypothesis in particular seems directed at all forms of hypersensity. I'd be inclined to say the same about increasing chemicals (the journal cited seems to be dealing with IgE mediated among other forms). Increasing prevalence should be mentioned (if sourced). But discussion about general "theories" as to why - if broad spectrum about all hypersensitities are not suited to here.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 01:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
