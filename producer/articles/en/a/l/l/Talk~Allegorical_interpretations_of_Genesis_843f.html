	    <p>I would just like to point out that Genesis does not make it clear how long the first, second or third day were exactly because God does not create the sun or the moon until day four. One might suggest that 24 hours was not instituted as a period of time until after the fourth day.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It also bears mentioning that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">Time</a> can be distorted according to modern physics according to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">Relativity</a>, especially towards the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>, so it's a possibility that days are not the common 24 hour days. However, one can also argue that the Bible, if true, is suppose to be for the general public, who may or may not have knowledge of advanced physics. Perhaps our technology advancement is disappointing God's original forecast? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanLee_a2c7.html" title="User:AllanLee">Allan Lee</a> 00:17, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article mentions that "Some conservative Christians think that seeing Genesis as a myth or as an allegory is some kind of "cop-out," and that it was always interpreted literally until biological evolution came and disproved it." I think disprove should not be used here, since there are always arguements revolving around the topic. Given Wiki's NPOV, perhaps it should be changed to "challenged"? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanLee_a2c7.html" title="User:AllanLee">Allan Lee</a> 00:17, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know this article originated out of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7ETheistic_evolution_7d20.html#Shortening_this_article" title="Talk:Theistic evolution">theistic evolution</a> article, but I think it could be broadened to include allegorical interpretations of the parts of Genesis that don't concern the creation accounts.</p>
<p>For example, the apostle Paul, in his letter to the Galatians, gives an allegorical interpretation of the Genesis story of Abraham's sons Isaac and Ishmael.</p>
<p>It would be nice, too, to see more on the Alexandrian school and its influence in allegorical interpretation. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 15:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The broadening of this article seems logical given the name. On the other hand, there is much to say just about the creation history... maybe someday we will need two separate articles: one for “Allegory in Genesis” and another for “Allegorical creation in genesis”... Anyway, the article is not meant to be static, feel free to expand the text in ways that seems sensible to you.</dd>

<dd>Okay, I've made some major revisions based on this discussion. I've tried to rearrange the sections into more logical divisions to facilitate additions of ancient or contemporary allegorical interpretations. I've also started expanding the article to include interpretations of passages outside the creation stories, although there is enough information about the creation stories to justify a separate section, I think. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 06:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is evolution singled out as disagreeing with Genesis? It's merely a single strand of scientific evidence that precludes a literal interpretation of Genesis. Evidence from astrophysics and geology is far more seriously at odds with literalism. I'll alter unless someone can point out something I've missed.

<dd>This article was originally taken from a section in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theistic_evolution.html" title="Theistic evolution">theistic evolution</a> article. I agree that there's no reason to single out evolution; I expect this article will grow away from its roots and encompass the whole range of allegorical interpretations of Genesis. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 14:54, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Daniel Quinn, in his book Ishmael, discusses Genesis as an allegory for the rise of agriculturalism; Abel represents the hunter-gatherers and Cain represents the new agriculturalists. Would there be a place in this article for this discussion?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think there is a place for it. Since the article is titled <i>Allegorical interpretations</i> -- plural -- it ought to cover the many different ways people have allegorized Genesis. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 19:17, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed some opinionated edits about the contradictions. The points are self explanatory and don't need a follow-up.</p>
<p>In response to the point of Adam dying on the same day that he ate the fruit, someone added a NT reference saying that dying is allegorical. Well that's the whole point of mentioning such a contraction. In response to the two stories of creation, someone added that verse 5 clearly states that plants were made before man. My version says: "and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth* and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground" That's pretty self explanatory, and yet still doesn't address the animals being created <i>after</i> man in the second account. Also, the verse concerning Noah changes in different translations Gen 5:32 (NASB) "Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth." 170.160.9.3 00:04, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first reference, <a href="http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html" class="external free" title="http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html</a> , is used to demonstrate that Augustine interpreted the creation in Genesis allegorically; however the first point on that reference page states that "Augustine stresses that his interpretation of Genesis 1-3 is literal and not metaphorical or allegorical". This seems to be a misleading use of this reference, since the reference text itself contradicts the idea that Augustine viewed Genesis metaphorically. 199.254.216.2 13:54, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I must wonder if you truly read past that line. He took it literally in a hugely different sense than modern literalists do. You may as well say that Andrew Johnson and Lyndon B. Johnson were the same because both called themselves Democrats... 66.68.176.213 21:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, what Augustine called a "literal view" would be considered metaphorical by today's literalists. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 18:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Nahmanides' disciple, rabbi Isaac of Akko, a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held, that the Universe is about 15 billion year old - strikingly close to the modern scientific calculations."</p>
<p>This is an incorrect statement. R' Akko believed that "God's day" was like a thousand human years and therefore each human year of 365.25 days is like 365,250 years from God's perspective. He also believed the world went through certain Kaballistic cycles of creation and that each of these cycles lasted 7000 years. He also believed that we are currently in the _second_ cycle. If you do the math that adds up to 2.5 billion years per cycle. And if we are currently in the year 5767 (Jewish calendar) of the second cycle that leads to a grand total of ~4.6 billion years.</p>
<p>It was Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's commentary from the book Sefer Yetzirah where he made the assumption that we are currently in the _seventh_ cycle of creation (something R' Akko did not believe) which he then equated to ~15 billion years which is comparable to modern science's estimates.</p>
<p>If anything, R' Aryeh Kaplan can said to believe the universe is ~15 billion years old, but one cannot say the same of R' Akko. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Orthoprax (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orthoprax_18f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orthoprax">contribs</a>) 07:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
