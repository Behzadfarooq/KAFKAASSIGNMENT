<p>Rugby was introduced to New Zealand by Charles Monro in the late 1860s, Monro having discovered the game while completing his studies at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ%27s_College_Finchley_8a48.html" title="Christ's College Finchley">Christ's College Finchley</a> in England. The first game took place in May 1870 and the first union, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury_Rugby_Football_Union_6511.html" title="Canterbury Rugby Football Union">Canterbury</a>, was formed in 1879.<sup id="_ref-CRFUFormed_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CRFUFormed" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 1882 New Zealand's first international games were played when the Southern Rugby Union (later the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Rugby_Union_e603.html" title="New South Wales Rugby Union">New South Wales Rugby Union</a>) toured the country. The tourists played Auckland provincial clubs twice, Wellington twice and had one game against Canterbury, Otago and West Coast, North Island. The visitors won four games and lost three. Two years later the first New Zealand team to go overseas toured New South Wales, played eight games and won them all.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first tour by a British team took place in 1888 when a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_Lions_91ee.html" title="British and Irish Lions">British Isles</a> team toured the Australian colonies and New Zealandâ€”although no test matches were played. The players were drawn mainly from England and the Scottish borders, though there were representatives from all four home unions. This tour was not sanctioned by the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Football_Union_d013.html" title="Rugby Football Union">Rugby Football Union</a> as it was organised by entrepreneurs and thus contravened the strict regulations the union had pertaining to professionalism.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAll_Blacks_sandbox_5fa0.html" title="Edit section: International competition begins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">International competition begins</span></h3>
<p>The NZRFU was formed in 1892. Seven unions were represented, with the significant absence of Canterbury, Otago and Southland.<sup id="_ref-NZRUNoCanty_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NZRUNoCanty" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> The first sanctioned New Zealand side went to New South Wales in 1893. New Zealand played its first home "international" game in 1894, losing 8-6 to New South Wales.<sup id="_ref-firsthome_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-firsthome" title="">[5]</a></sup> Its first true international match was against Australia on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a>, 1903 at the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Cricket_Ground_b665.html" title="Sydney Cricket Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>, resulting in a 22-3 win.<sup id="_ref-firsttest_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-firsttest" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>A representative New Zealand team first toured Britain in 1905 (since referred to as the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Original_All_Blacks_%281905%29_7174.html" title="The Original All Blacks (1905)">Originals</a>). For the first time, the All Blacks was used.<sup id="_ref-ABname_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABname" title="">[7]</a></sup> The tour was a success for the Originals, their only loss was 3-0 to Wales at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>.<sup id="_ref-OriginalsTourStats_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OriginalsTourStats" title="">[8]</a></sup> The match has become folklore in both countries due debate whether All Black Bob Deans scored a try which would have earned the All Blacks a 3-3 draw. Although the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_Lions_91ee.html" title="British and Irish Lions">British Isles</a> first visited New Zealand in 1888, they didn't play a test until their return in 1908. The 1908 British Isles team were known as the Anglo-Welsh as they consisted only of English and Welsh players; the All Blacks won the test series 2-0.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAll_Blacks_sandbox_5fa0.html" title="Edit section: Development of a legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Development of a legacy</span></h3>
<p>New Zealand's rivalry with South Africa began in 1921 when the Springboks toured New Zealand for a tense and competitive test series finishing all square.<sup id="_ref-1921Springboks_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1921Springboks" title="">[9]</a></sup> The 1924 All Black tourists to the UK were dubbed <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Invincibles_%28rugby_union%29_9769.html" title="The Invincibles (rugby union)">the Invincibles</a></i> due to the fact that they won every game. The opportunity to attempt a grand slam was prevented when Scotland refused to play them in an argument over expenses. The All Blacks toured South Africa for the first time in 1928, the series also a draw.</p>
<p>The first truly representative <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_Lions_91ee.html" title="British and Irish Lions">British Lions</a> side toured New Zealand in 1930, the Lions won the first test after some tough provincial games in New Zealand, but the home side regrouped and won the series 3-1. New Zealand toured the UK again in 1935-36, losing only four games (however two of these were tests). One loss was their game against England when <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Obolensky_8fb4.html" title="Alexander Obolensky">Prince Obolensky</a> scored two tries to help England to a 13-10 win, their first over the All Blacks.</p>
<p>In 1937, South Africa won a series against the All Blacks when they toured New Zealand. In 1956 under the captaincy of Bob Duff and through the surprise selection of Waikato player <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Clarke_bc46.html" title="Don Clarke">Don Clarke</a> (nicknamed 'the Boot') who kicked the decisive penalties in the final games, New Zealand won its first ever series over the Springboks.</p>
<p>The All Blacks 1959 3-1 series win over the Lions saw the start of a dominant period in All Blacks rugby. New Zealand touring sides to the UK from the 1960s on were powerful forces, dominated by the legendary names of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Meads_1138.html" title="Colin Meads">Meads</a>], Clarke and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilson_Whineray_8747.html" title="Wilson Whineray">Whineray</a>. The 1963-64 team, led by Wilson Whineray, failed to achieve a Grand Slam only because of a scoreless draw with Scotland. The 1967 side won three tests, but was unable to play Ireland because of a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_and_mouth_disease.html" title="Foot and mouth disease">foot-and-mouth</a> scare. Although the 1966 Lions were defeated 0-4 in their New Zealand tour, there was a reversal of fortune in 1971. Under the captaincy of Welshman <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dawes_7d80.html" title="John Dawes">John Dawes</a>, the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_British_Lions_tour_to_New_Zealand_7229.html" title="1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand">1971 Lions</a> beat the All Blacks in a test series. That remains the Lions' only series victory in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The 1972-3 tourists again narrowly missed a Grand Slam with a draw against Ireland. The tour achieved notoriety after the sending home of prop Keith Murdoch. He was alleged to have been involved in a brawl in a Cardiff hotel while celebrating the defeat of the Welsh. Graham Mourie's 1978 All Blacks finally achieved a Grand Slam, at the sixth attempt, but there was further bitter controversy after the Welsh test in Cardiff when an enduring myth was born. Some sections of the media alleged the All Blacks cheated, saying lock Haden dived out of a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line-out.html" title="Line-out">line-out</a> claiming he had been pushed. In fact, referee Roger Quittenton actually penalised Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver, and New Zealand won by kicking the resulting penalty. Quittenton has often unsuccessfully tried to give the lie to the Haden diving myth. It was on this tour that the All Blacks were famously defeated by 12-0 in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomond_Park_2fc3.html" title="Thomond Park">Thomond Park</a> by Irish province <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster_Rugby_8ea9.html" title="Munster Rugby">Munster</a>. The match has been made famous by the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Breen_b044.html" title="John Breen">John Breen</a> play <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alone_it_Stands_ecca.html" title="Alone it Stands">Alone it Stands</a> and is the last time the All Blacks were kept scoreless in a match.</p>
<p>The 1980s left deep scars on New Zealand rugby union and society in general. In 1981 two South African <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_Springbok_Tour_f969.html" title="1981 Springbok Tour">tour</a> matches in New Zealand were cancelled on police advice amid anti-<a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> protests; the 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was cancelled after legal action, and in 1986 an unauthorised tour party of South Africa, the New Zealand Cavaliers, included All Blacks.</p>

<p>The inaugural World Cup in 1987 was co-hosted and won by New Zealand, beating France 29-9 in the final at <a href="../../../e/d/e/Eden_Park_fcac.html" title="Eden Park">Eden Park</a>, Auckland. New Zealand conceded only 52 points and scored 43 tries in six games en route to the title, having swept aside the challenges of Italy, Fiji, Argentina, Scotland, Wales and France.</p>
<p>By the 1991 World Cup the All Blacks were an aging side, co-coached by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Wyllie_f670.html" title="Alex Wyllie">Alex Wyllie</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hart_%28rugby%29_9c03.html" title="John Hart (rugby)">John Hart</a>. They had looked vulnerable during pool matches and were knocked out by eventual winners Australia 16-6 in the semi-final at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansdowne_Road_81b6.html" title="Lansdowne Road">Lansdowne Road</a>. In the wake of the tournament there were many retirements including coach Wyllie, who had enjoyed an 86% win rate during 29 tests in charge.</p>
<p>Laurie Mains was given the job for preparing the side for the 1995 event in South Africa. When the All Blacks arrived in the Republic for the tournament, they seemed to be a strong side capable of regaining the trophy. A young <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonah_Lomu_a42c.html" title="Jonah Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> made a huge impact upon the World Cup, especially in the 45-29 win over England where he scored four tries. The New Zealand team suffered an outbreak of food poisoning before the final but took hosts South Africa to extra time before losing to <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Stransky_f032.html" title="Joel Stransky">Joel Stransky</a>'s <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drop_goal.html" title="Drop goal">drop goal</a>.</p>

The All Blacks warm up before a Tri Nations test against South Africa</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1995 the professional era in rugby union began. Australia, South Africa and New Zealand combined to sell TV rights for all southern hemisphere test matches, a new inter-provincial competition, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_14.html" title="Super 14">Super 12</a>, and domestic provincial competitions in each of the three countries. The test match between New Zealand and Italy in late 1995 was the first of the professional era. In 1996, under <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Fitzpatrick_44c0.html" title="Sean Fitzpatrick">Sean Fitzpatrick</a>'s captaincy, New Zealand finally won its first series in South Africa.</p>
<p>At the 1999 World Cup the All Blacks again dominated their pool, including a 30-16 defeat of England at Twickenham, but they looked less dominant in getting past Scotland 30-18 in the quarter-finals. Having been comfortably on top against France in the semi-final at Twickenham, they went out as the French produced an amazing half hour of rugby to which the All Blacks had no answer. John Hart subsequently resigned as coach and was replaced by co-coaches <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Smith_9b9d.html" title="Wayne Smith">Wayne Smith</a> and Tony Gilbert.</p>
<p>New Zealand qualified automatically for Rugby World Cup 2003 by virtue of reaching the semi final stage four years previously. The All Blacks entered the 2003 event with high expectations after an unbeaten Tri Nations campaign that included the return of the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bledisloe_Cup_402b.html" title="Bledisloe Cup">Bledisloe Cup</a> to New Zealand for the first time since 1998. As expected they dominated their pool, running up big wins against Italy, Canada and Tonga before winning one of the games of the tournament against Wales. They then beat South Africa, a team they had never beaten at the World Cup, 29-9. They lost out again to Australia 22-10 in the semi final in Sydney. Mitchell was then fired by the NZRU and replaced by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Henry_b063.html" title="Graham Henry">Graham Henry</a>.</p>
<p>Henry's tenure started with an impressive double victory over an understrength and out of form England, but his insistence on playing a flat backline tested the patience of an expectant public and saw the All Blacks finish bottom in the 2004 Tri-Nations.</p>
<p>In 2005 the All Blacks whitewashed the touring <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_Lions_91ee.html" title="British and Irish Lions">British and Irish Lions</a> 3-0 in the test series, won the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tri_Nations_Series_6c44.html" title="Tri Nations Series">Tri-Nations</a> and won the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_%28Rugby_Union%29_495a.html#Grand_Slam_Tour" title="Grand Slam (Rugby Union)">Grand Slam</a> over the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Nations_39df.html" title="Home Nations">Home Nations</a>. They went on to sweep the major <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Rugby_Board_a7f8.html" title="International Rugby Board">International Rugby Board</a> year-end awards. The All Blacks were named Team of the Year, Henry was named Coach of the Year, and fly-half (first five) <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Carter_%28rugby_player%29_b50e.html" title="Daniel Carter (rugby player)">Daniel Carter</a> was Player of the Year.</p>
<p>In 2006, they again took the Tri Nations Series by winning their first five matches, (three against Australia and two against South Africa) however they lost their final match of the series, against South Africa.</p>
