</dl>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>There are no WP:RS regarding chemmani ..because incident simply did not happen&#160;!!</li>
<li>No one is censoring anything... Why on earth people should censor something which did not exist&#160;!!</li>
<li>GOSL did a full investigation and the so called mass graves did not come out!!</li>
<li>there was a full scale investigations for over 2 years&#160;!!! yes&#160;!! 2 years spending lots of our tax money to please some shouting tamil diaspora!! and it was a total waste&#160;!!</li>
<li>If I write a book saying, there are mass sinhalese graves in jaffna, can i create an article and have my book as a source&#160;?? Internet is a free world and people can create what ever they want.BUT wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and giving correct info to the readers should be the priority..Its hilarious to ask readers to figure it out while deceiving them to believe in what you write.</li>
<li>please provide reports of the forensic experts, please provide the report of the GOSL investigation..NOT fairy tales written by PRO-Tamil sites</li>
</ul>
<p>finally, desire to fool wikipedian community it quite obvious here..Giving sources far from being <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>..pathetic and disgusting.thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 04:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whether there were mass graves at Chemmani or not, it seems from a quick google search that the subject has received sustained attention not only from Tamil groups, but also from the Sri Lankan press <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/990620/news2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/990620/news2.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the Sri Lankan government <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca199912/20001221gravesinchemmani.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca199912/20001221gravesinchemmani.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Because of this, it appears to me to be a notable, if contentious subject, and therefore not a good candidate for the "hoax" tag, which is generally a prelude to deletion. Iwazaki, correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like your intent is not to nominate the article for deletion, but to suggest that the subject of mass graves at Chemmani is war time propaganda. I wholeheartedly agree that this article is one-sided and needs a balanced telling and better sourcing.

<dd>They incident did receive a lot of attention in the late 1990s when their existence was initially alleged, but it was soon proven to be false. For that reason the tile itself, "Chemmani mass graves", is inherently wrong because there were nothing as such.</dd>
<dd>For example, some people have alleged the Bush Administration was complicit in 9/11 and those claims have got attention in some media. But, just because of that we don't create a article titled Involvement of the Bush Administration in 9/11. Similarly just one convicted soldier alleged the existence of graves in Chemmani, and it was picked up by people who wanted to discredit the military. It would be wrong because that never happened, and creating articles like this would needlessly dilute the encyclopedic value of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><b>talk</b></font></a> / <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><b>@</b></font></a> )</sup> 03:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Snowolf, I rewrote the article based on what I think are pretty uncontroversial sources. Let me know what you think and I'm glad to continue working on this -- although my main interest is the correct use of the "hoax" tag, and not the Sri Lankan Civil War (though I'm getting an education in the latter thanks to the former). It seems to me that the official Sri Lankan position is that Rajapakse's allegations are misleading, at least as far as the scope of what happened. That said, the government arrested a number of people in connection with this case who as far as I can tell are still facing charges. And government press releases use the phrase "Chemmani mass graves" <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200004/20000404Australia_condems_LTTE.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200004/20000404Australia_condems_LTTE.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010418editorialreview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010418editorialreview.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010406editorialreview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200104/20010406editorialreview.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/SecurityReport/sr200001/20000105Ponnambalam_dead.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/SecurityReport/sr200001/20000105Ponnambalam_dead.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. So I think it would be inaccurate to write this off as a "hoax", or as "proven false" without being precise about just what is fraudulent or discredited. I would welcome renaming this article to "Chemmani mass graves investigation" or "Chemmani mass graves allegations" or something of the like if that is generally agreeable. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 04:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Shunpiker, since it was me who tagged this as a <b>HOAX</b>,its my duty to clarify my position here..first let me start with by these words.."<b>Chemmani mass grave is a hoax</b>". there is not a question about it..With 4 years of investigation, only a dozen of bodies came out from that grave..And we don't even know whether these people were killed by the Army or not.Please bear in mind, most parts of jaffna was under the LTTE rule till 1995 and the founded skeleton and human body parts could easily belong to that era too..</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As snowolf has correctly pointed out, why would we need an article for something which did not occur&#160;?? If chemmani mass grave a true thing, I would make no objections..But since it just an allegation by a convicted Army personal, probably made to take away the attention away from him, why do we have to use wikipedia for this&#160;??? you have sated several Local newspapers also used the word "Mass graves" ..Yes you are right..When the allegations came out, we were shocked&#160;!! News papers and TV media gave a huge publicity and continuously used the word "mass graves" ,I as a university student made protest to the GOSL regarding this..It took a while to realised that we were all fooled by some..LTTE supporters used this to tarnish the government(they still do despite no proofs)and thats why you can still see , tons of internet sites having articles related to this..BUT not a single mention of the actual event is stated at those sites..Now after the proper investigation we all know that, this event is a <b>certain Hoax</b>.. <b>There were absolutely no mass graves in chemmani!</b>.. its just like the The 'Surgeon's Photo'<a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/lochness.html" class="external text" title="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/lochness.html" rel="nofollow">nessie</a>.People believed it(made to) but finally turned out to be a <b>HOAX</b>!! Since article was made after the investigations, why do we have to go back to the hoax again&#160;?? thanks --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 10:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>first please read the definition of "mass graves" and take your time to compare what you write with what already exist in the link given here by Mr sebestian..Remember you just <b>cant</b> add things like "chemmani" as it is obviously not a mass grave, since ONLY 15 body part were founded and ONLY couple of them had any indication of torture&#160;!! There may be mass graves in SL..But frankly I dont know how it is going to help our country in this case..Instead ,it will going to further damage our countries image, which is already in a terrible situation..Why do we need to spend our valuable time to destroy our countries image&#160;?? Why cant we form project such as "History of SriLanka" ,"Greatest SriLankan" and so on ,to show the good part of our country..In 3 rd century we had the worlds 2 tallest building&#160;!! We have temples bigger and taller than Pyramids ,and foreigners dont even know that&#160;!! We have oldest "brahmi script" and one of the oldest existing inscriptions of the wrold,and no one knows them&#160;!! <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus_steel.html" title="Damascus steel">Damascus_steel</a> was a SL invention ,but somehow Indians taking credit for it ,because <b>we are stuck in disputed templates and articles</b> created by you and other tamils...There are so many things Sinhalese(And others) made to the world and sadly no one knows them ..Instead of appealing our heritage and achievements, you are defaming our country with totally irrelevant and unnecessary articles/templates/tables..You can go ahead and create the "mass grave project" ,even though it will serve no good for our country,hence I prefer to stay away from it..BUT I will definitely keep an aye on it ,and wont allow to add defamatory info to it. thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 03:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, Iwazaki you should understand that this is wikipedia and thus it should serve as a information page. Your argunment "I dont know how it is going to help our country in this case" is pointless to me because Wiki is not here to "help" any country... It is just like any book you come here to get information. Also I do not appericiate your attack on not only raveen but also on a race (tamils) as you imply that tamils use wiki to put down Sri Lanka... With that being said I love Raveens' idea and I can contribut if needed. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchdogb_a098.html" title="User:Watchdogb">Watchdogb</a> 03:13, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>U didnt read all of my post ,did you&#160;?? As a free encyclopedia,wikipedia has given us the opportunity promote our country..yes, I used the word promote ,because our articles in wikipedia is read and referred by thousands of people around the world..By doing that we are also promoting or expanding wikipedia too..So its a mutual relationship..I don't think I have to reply to your other nonsenses,do i Watchdog<b>B</b>?..I would like to finish this short reply by saying that ,I would keep an eye(or two) on that project and certainly won't allow to add non-existence mass graves such as chemmani into it.Also ,I will make sure that the definition of a mass grave is strictly applicable to every incident in the project.thanks --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 09:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to reiterate my point of view. Yes Sri Lanka that I was born was a great country, people that I knew and interacted were the best. My first language was Sinhalese not Tamil because everybody around us spoke Sinhalese. But that is besides the point today we have this pointless war that I think has been dragged on for more than 20 years for no reason other than involved people’s lack of vision, lack of cranial capacity, total lack empathy for common people’s requirements, manifest racism and war profiteering when most of the elite’s children are abroad living in safety.</dd>

<dd>But all of us are driven by certain things, what drives me is Human Rights violations weather it is Sri lanka, India or Lesotho. If not for Sri Lanka, I will be writing about Human rights in Sudan. Because that’s what I am. If Iwazaki is interested in Great things Sri Lanka then he should write about it. As far I am concerned Chemmani was a mass grave because it did contain 15 bodies and the government stopped the investigation citing neutral sources but that was secondary information. I want to see the primary source that says the neutral people said that there is no pint in looking. Where is it&#160;? Asking the Sri Lankan government to investigate itself is like asking a thief to give the judge incriminating evidence when there is neither a carrot or stick attached to his behavior. I think I am violating <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> by saying all this.

<dd>Regardless of what Terrorist and tamil diaspora say, Sri Lanka is still a GREAT NATION..I have no doubt that Sri Lanka will overcome its problems, mainly terrorism and terrorist and Sinhales with the help of muslims and tamils (who are not terrorists) would make this a nation to be proud of,just as it was in the history..With all the investigation with our tax money to satisfied some NGO 's and Human rights activist, we found only 2 bodies with any kind of assaults signs at chemmani..And you call this a "Mass Grave"&#160;?? Do you have any idea what this "MASS" means&#160;?? Then comes your ranting&#160;!! its not only a <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a>,its a mere <b>pretext</b> for your to create this project..You blame the Government of ex-President chandrika here,while praising her excessively in other places in wikipedia,and its becoming hialrious!! Why did you only blame Chandrika's government&#160;?? How about condemning the Jaffna residents who did not die so they couldn't end up at chemmani&#160;?? How about blaming LTTE for not killing enough people and burying them at chemmani&#160;?? Or how about blaming all the Srilankan who did not end up at the chemmani mass grave&#160;?? GO ahead with your project,As I said before "<b>I will make sure that the definition of a mass grave is strictly applicable to every incident in the project</b>" And I ask you,kindly, <b>not to make terrible blunders ,such as adding non existence mas graves in to the project</b>.Look forward to see all the mass graves articles. thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 13:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What ever said and done Chandrika was the only human being in this conflict of demons and devils. All what I can write is because she took responsibility for her governments actions. Fighting the LTTE is one thing, no one will ever question that. But fighting a civilian population is completely another sick dimension and all fair human beings will fight it. She was a rare Sri Lankan with a basic human trait of taking responsibility for barbaric actions that even most Sri Lankan Wikipedians don’t have decency to take responsibility for. This article was a pathetic propaganda piece when you started putting the hoax tag and fighting it. Now it is a descent article. That’s’ the strength of the Wikipedia process. This will go on even after you and I dead. No one can ever stop information from coming out. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> 14:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
