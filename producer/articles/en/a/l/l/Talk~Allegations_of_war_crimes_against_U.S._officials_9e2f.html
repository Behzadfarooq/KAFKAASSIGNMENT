<dd>This page is patent nonsense. All of the links come from sources such as Z-Mag and thirdworldtraveler that have a clear ideological agenda to push. That is not to say there is no substance to this page, but it is hopelessly slanted not just by the nature of the page but by the nature of the publications it links to. Wikipedia should use objective and factual sources, not partisan op-eds and material lifted from "Z-Pub" or whatnot. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<dd>I just edited the bombastic rhetoric without even looking through the links (except for deleting the blog one). This is more than patent nonsense; it's completely unacceptable material for an encyclopedia. Imagine if there were a bunch of articles based completely around Newsmax and FPM pieces. There'd be panic and mass terror. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 11:01, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HA!, that's the first thing I thought (though I don't necessarily think it's true, a claim could be made). However, if it were cleaned up, thos would make a decent article. Possibly, though, it could be merged into another article about international law, or else renamed to something showing how the US generally holds itself above international law (i.e. not supporting the International Criminal Court without major concessions/exemptions). That'd be another tricky one to make NPOV, though.<a href="../../../j/d/7/User%7EJD79_8d62.html" title="User:JD79">JD79</a> 03:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed "The Haditha massacre is, if proven true, a war crime." That's a conclusion. You need to find a cite to a (notable and) reliable source who accuses the Bush administration of a war crime based on it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 16:17, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We know that killing civilians is a war crime. So, by that token, if the soldiers involved are found to be guilty, this massacre would constitute a war crime.

<dd>We're not lawyers, and we don't know that "killing civilians is a war crime." We need an actual allegation by someone notable who says that this particular thing was a war crime. It should be easy enough to find; surely George Galloway has said something about it. I didn't understand your remark about an edit war. Certainly you did not mean to suggest that the alternative to an edit war is for the article to be written the way you want it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 16:33, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">Every violation of the law of war in an inter-state conflict is a war crime</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">It comprises such acts as mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. War crimes are sometimes part of instances of mass murder and genocide though these crimes are more broadly covered under international humanitarian law described as crimes against humanity</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore the massacre and abuse of prisoners constitute war crimes. All you have to do is read the relevant articles!</li>
<li>No, I am not saying that agreeing with me is the way to avoid an edit war. However, instead of deleting everything you disagree with, it is also possible to insert {{fact}}, especially since I gather from your response you know it is correct. To me that is more civil and less l;aborious. Now, I not only have to find your sources, I also have to find the original text to restore it. Not very efficient.</li>
<li>Please, restore the deleted info which is correct as you are aware, and I will insert the refs.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio"><font color="blue">Gnothi seauton</font></a></sup> 17:12, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Telegraph says, "If confirmed when the official findings are published next week the incident would be the worst war crime committed by US forces in Iraq." This would support saying that the Telegraph says it was, if confirmed, a war crime. It is not an allegation of a war crime against a US official, unless you want to say the battalion commander was a US official. That might be appropriate, but would greatly expand the scope of the article. For the other things, I don't think we can take a quote from someone saying, "That's tantamount to torture" and turn that into "Rumsfield is guilty of a war crime." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 17:30, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are too critical. We know that killing civilians is a war crime. How do we know? It says so in the treaties the US has signed. To suggest that we are incapable of understanding what the definition of a war crime is, is being overly cautious and ignores the fact that the law very explicitly describes what is considered a war crime. That this massacre, if the facts turn out to show it is a massacre, is a war crime is beyond doubt. The squad's leader is responsible. I am not saying the Bush administration itself is culpable, but surely some within the military are guilty.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio"><font color="blue">Gnothi seauton</font></a></sup> 08:24, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I first mentioned this almost a year ago. This material is crap. It is a repository of links from the same few avowedly political far left rags, including many contributions from the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blum_02dc.html" title="William Blum">same author</a>. The only material that differs in the slightest is that on George W. Bush, which can be moved to other articles, where the discussion probably already appears in some form to begin with. This is not a serious contribution, is non-notable, and is not in any form valuable otherwise. Nobody has done anything about this in a <i>goddamn year</i>.

The suggestion that I place a tag is completely ludicrous in light of the fact that I did so, <b>a year ago</b>, and <b>nothing has been done</b>. The problem with this article is not bad sourcing; the problem is the content itself. You can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alleged_U.S._war_criminals&amp;oldid=10489801" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alleged_U.S._war_criminals&amp;oldid=10489801" rel="nofollow">original version</a> if you like. Bad sources have merely been plugged in after the fact from a rant by <a href="../../../g/s/h/User%7EGSherman_891b.html" title="User:GSherman">this guy</a>. It is terrible. No one wishes to personally vouch for its merit but instead bitches when something is actually done about it. Why? What the hell is so important about this trash that we need formal process to determine what to do with crap that nobody wants to touch in the first place?</dd>

<dd>If it's not deleted as original research (and it might well be kept, like you say), every item has to be an allegation of war crimes against an official, and needs to be cited to a reliable source.

<p>Short of name calling or a personal attack, this is quite frankly the worst article I've yet seen on wiki. Surely this site is taken more seriously than allowing citations from known wacko publications? You've got to at least cite something mainstream.</p>
<p>Besides the citation problems, what is this article even about anyways? unsubstantiated allegations against US officials? What is the point to having an encyclopedia article on Allegations?

<p>The world and the U.S. need to take a look at these and other "alleged" crimes. Certainly this page could be saved from utter nonsense.</p>
<p>First, better sources could be found. Second, a true look at war crimes would have to include acts commited prior to the Johnson administration. Franklin D. Roosevelt would be a good place to start i.e. the manhattan project. Of course, you could go further back. Lastly, I think a title change would be more appropriate. Perhaps more specific would be Allegations of Crimes Against Humanity against the Office of the President. Since, Foreign Policy is largely dictated by the executive office it might be clearer to hold blame with the office not the official. Also, since there have been no inquiries or indictments made according to the geneva conventions many of the so called "war crimes" cannot be called so. However, I believe that there is no need for official accusation for the terms "crimes against humanity" or "crimes against peace" 25 September 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jeremywj (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jeremywj_9e7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jeremywj">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>many posters have objected on the grounds that only biased ("left wing") sources are cited. But one can easily imagine circumstances where only marginal sources provide the truth, eg samizdat in the USSR. It is not that hard to imagine that (a) US officials are guilty of war crimes; (b) a majority consensus refuses to recognize that fact; (c) therefore, only "marginal" sources are available. Rather then getting on a jingoistic high horse about this, it is better to realize that all govt's by their very nature, frequently are responsible for acts that could be called war crimes; what distinguishes good and bad govts is the effort they make to atone for thier sins.
