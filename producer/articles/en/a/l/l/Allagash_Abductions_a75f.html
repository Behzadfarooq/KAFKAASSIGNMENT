	    <p>The <b>Allagash Abduction</b> is a part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unidentified_flying_object.html" title="Unidentified flying object">UFO</a> / <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abduction_phenomenon.html" title="Abduction phenomenon">Alien Abduction theories</a>.</p>
<p>The incident occurred on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_20.html" title="August 20">August 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> when four men, Jim Weiner, his twin brother Jack, Chuck Rak and their guide, Charlie Foltz, all in their early-twenties, ventured on a camping trip into the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allagash.html" title="Allagash">Allagash</a> wilderness of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a>. The men's story is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first day went by without incident, however, on the their second night, they noticed a bright light not far from their campsite which they first passed off as being a helicopter or <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather_balloon.html" title="Weather balloon">weather balloon</a>, but later noticed it displayed a strange quality of light. Suddenly, the object imploded and disappeared. The following day, as the first, went by without incident. The men were unlucky in their fishing so they decided to try it at night. They set camp on the shore of <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Lake_82e3.html" title="Eagle Lake">Eagle Lake</a> on August 20. As darkness settled, the men built a blazing campfire which they expected to burn for several hours to be used as a beacon for their campsite while out on the lake. They then headed out in a canoe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After a short time, Rak noticed the bright light they had seen two nights before in the distance above the tree line. He called the others' attention to it. They watched the object intently and noticed it appeared to be much larger this time and made no sound. Foltz grabbed a flashlight and began flashing an <a href="../../../s/o/s/SOS_60d5.html" title="SOS">SOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suddenly, a bright beam of light shot out from the bottom of the craft and it quickly made its way towards the men. All men, minus Rak, began to paddle furiously back towards shore. Rak seemed entranced by the object as it closed in on them. Suddenly, the light enveloped the canoe and the four men.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next thing the men knew, they were back on shore at their campsite. They stood at the edge of the water and stared blankly at the craft, which was hovering no more than a few dozen feet from them. After watching for several minutes, the craft suddenly imploded as it had done two nights previous, and reappeared over the treetops on the other side of the lake. It then shot upwards into the sky.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The men suddenly all felt exhausted and decided to sleep for the night. The large fire they had made only minutes previous was now a pile of burnt embers. Without much conversation following the unusual incident which just took place, the men went to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next morning, the men spoke little of the incident and packed their belongings to move to a new campsite.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be 12 years before the incident would begin to play a pivotal role in the men's lives. The twins, Jim and Jack, suddenly began to have nightmares of being in a "medical examination room". They also dreamt of strange creatures with large heads and large black eyes. When telling Chuck Rak and Charlie Foltz of their dreams, to their shock, the twins learned that they too were having similar nightmares.</p>
<p>Under separately conducted <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypnosis.html" title="Hypnosis">hypnotic</a> regressions, the men recalled being abducted from the canoe and being inside the craft that they had seen at Eagle Lake. While inside, they were subjected to several tests, such as urine, blood, semen, and skin samples. During these tests, the beings telepathically informed the men that they would cooperate and that they would not be harmed. Each of the men described the beings as resembling large insects with "bug-like" eyes.</p>
<p>Through the years, the men have described their experience through their artwork and through television and radio appearances. The men have also had several more strange experiences which they believe are correlated to the incident at Allagash. Foltz describes that he sometimes hears whispers but is unable to make out any words. He also believes he may have been abducted a second time. In 1994, he described having a strange dream of walking through a long corridor. Strangely, an ivy covered wall outside his house suddenly had a bare circular patch.</p>
<p>Jack Weiner has stated that, over the years, he has seen strange lights in the skies near his house.</p>
<p>The Allagash abductions achieved notoriety as the first well-documented, multiple abduction case. A book, <i>The Allagash Abductions</i> by Raymond E. Fowler, documents the incident. The incident was also dramatized in an episode of <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsolved_Mysteries_fc56.html" title="Unsolved Mysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a>.</p>
<p>To this day, the men implore that their experience was, in fact, real and not a hoax.</p>
