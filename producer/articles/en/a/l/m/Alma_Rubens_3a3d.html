<p>Alma's first stage opportunity came in 1917 when a chorus girl in a comedy became ill and the young aspirant was called on to replace her, merely because she happened to be there. Soon the stock company came to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>. After a short time, Rubens left the troupe on the advice of Franklyn Farnum (1878-1961), a member of the stock company. Farnum was given a motion picture role and persuaded Rubens to follow him into movies.</p>
<p>Her breakthrough performance was in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> in the movie <i>Reggie Mixes In</i>. She made six more films in that same year. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> she starred <i>The Firefly of Tough Luck</i> which was a big success. She gained notoriety when she became <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Fairbanks_3c0c.html" title="Douglas Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>' lead actress in <i>The Half Breed</i> (1916). Soon she completed <i>The World and His Wife</i>, starring opposite Montague Love. She continued to work successfully until <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>. In that year she starred in <i>The Price She Paid</i>. She retired temporarily from the screen in 1926.</p>
<p>Her career practically ended overnight, as fast as it had begun. Rubens did play Julie in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> part-talkie film version of <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_Boat_%28film%29_20f7.html" title="Show Boat (film)">Show Boat</a></i> -- which was her next-to-last film and one of her few sound films -- however, the sound track for the portion in which she spoke has apparently been lost.</p>
<p>She began finding it hard to get roles because of her <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addiction.html" title="Drug addiction">addiction</a> to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a>. Because of this she started to go in and out of mental institutions. Rubens was treated and pronounced cured of her drug problem at the State Narcotic Hospital in Spadra, California (now part of <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomona%2C_California_6339.html" title="Pomona, California">Pomona, California</a>) and at Patton State Hospital in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Bernadino%2C_California_1f4f.html" title="San Bernadino, California">San Bernadino, California</a>. Rubens' addiction became known when she attacked a physician who was taking her to a sanitarium for treatment. During her first confinement at the Spadra facility, Rubens made a spectacular escape. She returned voluntarily before being transferred to the Patton facility.</p>
<p>Her final stage appearance was in January 1930. She had a role in a play at the Writer's Club in Hollywood. Following her parole from the Patton hospital, in December 1930, Rubens traveled to New York and announced a theatrical and screen comeback. She made an appearance on stage with her husband while there. However she returned to Los Angeles the same month. She had been there less than two weeks when she was arrested in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego%2C_California_4c0a.html" title="San Diego, California">San Diego, California</a> by Federal officers on a narcotics charge. Rubens claimed she was a victim of a frame-up, and physicians attested to her statements that she was not taking drugs. She was bound over to Federal district court and released on bail. She appeared for a preliminary hearing the second week in January 1931.</p>
<p>Rubens died of <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> the following week. She was unconscious for three days prior to her death at the home of her physician, Dr. Charles J. Pflueger, 112 North Manhattan Place, Los Angeles. She contracted a cold which quickly developed into pneumonia. She became comatose and never recovered. Her doctor described her fatal illness as one of the most serious types of pneumonia, typhoid asthenic. It is characterized by a low temperature and high pulse rate. Beside her when she succumbed were her mother, Mrs. Theresa Rubens, and a sister, Mrs. Hazel Larch, of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madera%2C_California_0be3.html" title="Madera, California">Madera, California</a>. Both mother and sister lived on a ranch in Madera. Rubens was 31 years of age.</p>

<p>Rubens married three times. Her first marriage, to actor Franklyn Farnum, who was nearly twenty years her senior, lasted only a month. The couple were married secretly. The actress sought a divorce in August 1918. In November 1923, Alma married Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman, an author and film producer. The marriage was brief and a suit for divorce was filed in January 1925. During the next two years, she made several films for the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Film_Corporation_b9bf.html" title="Fox Film Corporation">Fox Film Corporation</a>. When her contact expired she went to Europe with actor <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Cortez_278a.html" title="Ricardo Cortez">Ricardo Cortez</a>. The two were married in February 1926.</p>
<p>Rubens' personal decline began when she returned to California in 1928. Her narcotic habit completely consumed her. The actress once remarked she had become an addict through the mistake of a New York physician. He had administered a narcotic during an illness. A few months later, additional opiates were needed and the actress confessed she was taking them for every real or imaginary illness. At the time of her demise, Rubens was suing Cortez for divorce. Cortez claimed he had not been notified of his wife's death, and later remarked that he had not seen her for several months and was unaware that she was seriously ill. Alma Rubens was buried in a Fresno mausoleum. Services were performed by the Gates, Crane &amp; Earl Company of 1724 North Highland Avenue, Hollywood.</p>
