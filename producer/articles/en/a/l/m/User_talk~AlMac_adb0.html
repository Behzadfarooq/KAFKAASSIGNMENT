<dl>
<dd>Keep up the good work, get rid of all the lists and the article should be all right. I strongly suggest you read <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_layout_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to layout">Wikipedia:Guide to layout</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page</a>, if you haven't already—they're very insightful, as are the other articles in the style book.</dd>
<dd>Be aware that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an FAQ</a>. Don't refer to the reader or yourelf directly; sentences like <i>Company-A has personal information on you and me.</i> are considered bad style. The article shouldn't be a how-to: <i>Go to Steve Gibson Research site, scroll down to Shields Up, run tests</i> are improper. A better version would be something like <i>Software to detect vulnerabilities is available from organisations such as <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibson_Research_Corporation_064a.html" title="Gibson Research Corporation">Gibson Research Corporation</a></i>, and arguably anything more detailed in a how-to way might not be proper here on WP. Avoid (though not at all costs) external links inside the main article body, the proper place is in its own section the end of the article. Try to give more than one alternative if there is one.</dd>
<dd>Last but not least, of course the article does not have to be perfect. Others will improve on what you write, especially if you make a decent start. Once you get rid of
<ul>
<li>all
<ul>
<li>the freaking

<li>lists</li>

<p>I recognize that many concepts involve controversy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am from Scotland ...
<ul>
<li>you want to know something about the Loch Ness Monster?</li>
<li>It has been said that when a person travels from Scotland to another nation, that the average intelligence of the people of both nations increases.</li>
<li>How is that possible?</li>
<li>Joke: Travel broadens the mind.</li>
<li>Nowadays, most travel is on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do not believe in UFOs
<ul>
<li>However, I participated in game design in which we decided that UFOs would be the vehicles used by people traveling in time, not backwards and forwards in history, but across parallel time dimensions from other realities in our multiverse</li>
<li>As fantastic as that Science Fiction concept might seem to some people, I find the notion of UFOs, if they really do exist, as being time traveling vehicles as much more believeable than being space traveler vehicles. That would explain a lot of the mystery of them being able to elude our efforts to make contact with the occupants.</li>

<p>I do not expect to learn 100% of Wiki skills then apply them. I think of this like computer programming. I learn some of what can be done, I do it. I produce useful output based on my partial know how, then as I gain experience, I add to my total sum of know-how.</p>
<p>I read some documentation ... how do you do that ... I get reasonably good at doing some process, then I read some more documentaiton on how to make my input more sophisticated with more features, then with practice get good at that, then read some more on self-improvement, and hopefully what I produce along the way is in fact of value to the community. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 28 June 2005 20:04 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bcat, Thanks again from <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> who has added more stuff to the stuff to learn, since these tips. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> has only studied a fraction of the suggested material so far. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 4 July 2005 18:22 (UTC)</p>

<p>The way I operate, I am constantly starting some effort, getting part way done, then becoming somewhat distracted, with many loose ends to pursue. of places I plan to visit over time</p>
<p>As my involvement continues, there is great risk I am not going to remember all the places where I had started something, that perhaps needs continuation.</p>
<p>On normal days, I check my watch list, and pick a few recent areas to work some more on, as time permits. The very top of watch list has way to review the whole list, but sometimes in a Wiki update the whole watch list can be lost, but user contributions still intact.</p>
<p>From time to time as time permits, also check the overall areas I been active in to see what I had intended to work on, but fallen behind in commitments.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> professional work load resembles a roller coaster ride.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are days when it seems work work work, I can't get a fraction completed that I need to get done, there aren't enough hours in the day to do my job, and this goes on seemingly for an eternity.</li>
<li>There are days where nothing has gone wrong, I am caught up on urgent business, I am doing useful stuff. I love this job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> time availability for volunteer projects is also like a roller coaster ride.</p>

<p>I came to Wikopedia for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>I knew about it because there are entries on my parents, math professors, and I had stumbled across it several prior times with various research.
<ol>
<li>Here is the page on <b>my Mother</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Scott_Macintyre" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Scott_Macintyre" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>If I do a similar page on myself, I recognize that I should limit it to the stuff that I have done that is truely unique in the world, such as <b>Operation Contact</b> in the Simulation Gaming hobby</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>David Gibbs</b> started a Wiki for AS/400 iSeries interests <a href="http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and I started posting there what I knew but my interests include a great deal of computer security stuff that does not really apply to the IBM world, and I wanted to share my computer know-how, and while I have tried blogging, I am not really happy with the concept of many people talking, while security issues are not really being solved in the world as rapidly as I would like to see.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other topics that interest me, that I also intend to post information about in the future. See what I wrote in the New User Log</p>

<p>This is something <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<strong class="selflink"><sup>(talk)</sup></strong> been learning something about in recent days. The goal is to develop a high quality free on-line encyclopaedia (supported by donations), and to that end, it is important to maintain a harmonous community of volunteers, but the encyclopaedia is more important than the community.</p>
<ol>
<li>Experienced volunteers, who are seen to have been doing a good overall job with Wiki, can be elevated to an administration sys/op status, which gives them access to capabilities not available to ordinary editor volunteers.
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> enjoys several thousand volunteer editors.
<ol>
<li>Many of us are newbies, but also remember that <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> has only been around for about 5 years. Immense value has been generated by people who all started out here as newbies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>About 700 of them have been elevated to administrators.
<ol>
<li>These administrators are also human, subject to the same frailties, and difficulty dealing with frustrations as the rest of us.</li>
<li>They are able to abuse their privileges to engage in <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_war.html" title="Wheel war">Wheel wars</a> against each other in ways not available to ordinary editor volunteers, such as blocking each other from Wiki access for arious time periods, for perceived abuses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>First, editors try to resolve different views on how things should be done, using talk pages of articles, and messages to each other on these talk pages.
<ol>
<li>We have rules to follow, about content, style, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, civility, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If we are seen to have done 3 reverts to the same article within 24 hours, for whatever reason, even to combat vandalism, administrators can block us for up to 24 hours. This is intended to seek peace and quiet, like police break up a brawl to get law &amp; order, calming down the participants, before trying to settle the dispute.</li>
<li>If we human beings are unable to resolve differences in a civilized manner, or we think another party to a disagreement is being unreasonable, there can be <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERfM_d120.html" title="WP:RfM">WP:RfM</a>, and finally, if all else fails, to the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a>.</li>
<li>A first step in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a> is to verify that earlier dispute resolution process steps have been exhausted.</li>
<li>Ultimately there can be an appeal to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a>, founder and owner of <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a>.</li>

<p>Well, it's no big deal, but using the singular form of the word is standard when choosing a title and you should start the article with a clear definition of what a security breach is (even though it may be obvious to you).

It is a legitimate topic; the only thing I worry about i that it may be redundant with <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a>?<br />
The text needs to be in prose, not list form. It should have references, and footnotes, so people know where the information is from. The text should inform people about these audits, not try to convince them that they are necessary.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 7 July 2005 19:25 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks again. I saw the Votes for Deletion as I was getting ready to leave for the office, and I should be on the road right now. I also see that this kind of process takes 5 days, so I figure I have part of the weekend, depending on what happens at my office (see roller coaster ride explained above).</p>
<p>I studied the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> article before I started <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Security_Audits_f880.html" title="Computer Security Audits">Computer Security Audits</a>. My conclusion was that <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> is rather dated. It describes a reality of large comapnies, like those traded on the stock market, that can afford to have a team of humans from some audit firm, perform certain tasks. Most small businesses, which are most enterprises period, cannot afford this, and certainly not home users.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> is a valid topic, of great interest to many enterprises, but while the work they do is more intensive than what I am writing about, their market share is microscopic compared to my focus. I think perhaps I should try to explain that, like the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">Computer security</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_insecurity.html" title="Computer insecurity">Computer insecurity</a> articles point at each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">Computer security</a> article focuses on Design for Good Security in the first place, which most computer vendors should do, but far too many do not.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_insecurity.html" title="Computer insecurity">Computer insecurity</a> article focuses on victims in the "Oh Hell, what a mess we are in, how do we get out of this?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly (except I need to clean up the language)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> article focuses on what the giants of industry do to identify security issues in need of remediation.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Security_Audits_f880.html" title="Computer Security Audits">Computer Security Audits</a> (which may need a slightly different title) article focuses on what the little guy, and small business can do, to identify security issues that are easily repaired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now many enterprises do not think they need Security Audits, but one of the outputs of these automated tools is an education that can lead some companies to conclude that they do need professional help, because the remediation effort is more than can be handled by their staff. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 7 July 2005 19:36 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks</a> is a sister project to Wikipedia. Like all <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikimedia projects</a>, it is distinct in the type of information that it contains. Whereas Wikipedia seeks to compile encyclopedic content, Wikibooks can best be described as compiling didactic content, that is, content that is mean for learning. This has some small overlap with Wikipedia, but also includes "how to's", applied or otherwise esoteric information. For more information about whether Wikibooks is right for your project, try reading <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Why_use_open_textbooks%3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Why_use_open_textbooks%3F" rel="nofollow">these guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for noting your concern about citing issues. I would say that there are two reasons for citing.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are directly referencing or quoting some specific work or material. This type of reference/citation is necessary to avoid plagiarism and copyright isues. Since you are writing almost entirely out of your working knowledge of the subject, this should never be an issue for you.</li>
<li>Any subject you discuss should be verifiable. That is, people should not just have to go on your word alone, but be able to cross check it with other sources. However, you really should not let this get in the way of your posting that information in the first place. If what you say really is true (a reason why you most try to remain factual and neutral), other Wiki users will also be able to confirm what you've written with external references.</li>
</ol>
<p>Really, I don't think this is an issue for you. A user with alot of concrete knowledge in an area and no references is better than a user with no knowledge and alot of references. The latter is very common and will come along to help out soon enough. - <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabioB_77b6.html" title="User:FabioB">FabioB</a> 8 July 2005 19:00 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, you contacted me when someone suggested to you to publish your work as a book on wikibooks. I did not reply earlier because I was too busy. But it is important that you think about this wikibook-project again. Donating single articles on Wikipedia is one thing. But donating an entire book is a totally different scale of value. I would by all means consider mailing the script to at least twenty publishers before you donate your knowledge to wikibooks. If it gets declined, and lots of books are, you can always donate it.

<p>Sorry, I was slightly confused by your message, so I'm not entirely sure what you need help with. It looks like you got your signature working, so that's good. If you want to change the background color of the "Leave me a message" box, go into the code and find the part that says "background-color: lightblue". You can change "lightblue" to any of the colors on <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/colors/article.php/3478961" class="external text" title="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/colors/article.php/3478961" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. (I think the code numbers are supposed to work as well, but I couldn't get it to work in testing- however, you should be able to just use the words, for example by changing "lightblue" to "Darksalmon") I hope this helps, and let me know if you need anything else. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">EWS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 12:31, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi again. Thanks for the barnstar, it is much appreciated. The answers to your 3 questions are as follows:</p>

<li>)Yes there is a page that i can link you to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">Wikipedia:Userboxes</a>. This page can be hard to find and remember so i suggest you bookmark it. You will find many userboxes on this page, as well as a general guide to making your own userboxes.</li>
<li>) I have looked at your userpage and fixed up what i could, hope you dont mind. As for the wikiproject userbox, i am not sure if you made this up yourself?</li>

<p>If you did you may need to find a new picture because that picture was of the swan bells in perth! The reference desk userbox seems to have worked it was just down the bottomk of the page because you didnt allow an 'enter'.</p>
<ol>
<li>} Thanks for the optimism, but no unfortunately i did not create userboxes. (Although i would like to be able to say i did!) :) I picked up my love of userboxes from many people, but to say the least, i would have to say that it was on <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers">User:Redvers</a> that i found out about this concept.</li>

One problem was that you didn't supply two initial colours, another was there was a newline after the file name but before the |40px bit.

<dd>Hi! I think that the two-sided userbox is a great idea, not to mention that it also looks great. Your userpage has definetly come a long way over the last few days. The way you have set out your (many!) userboxes is quite original and effective. Keep up the great work answering questions at the reference desk and helping people such as Jayant. Have a very merry christmas, or whats left of it and a very happy new year, can't wait to help you at another time, --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_K_819a.html" title="User:Ali K">Ali K</a> 15:41, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

All of her images, and anything related to her stories, that is used without her explicit permission, will result in flogging with 2x4s of various lengths and woods.

<dd>Also, in general, if you edit an article, you don't have to contact every editor before and ask if it is OK. In my case, I just reverted some link spam on <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enterprise_resource_planning.html" title="Enterprise resource planning">ERP</a>. If an article is important to an editor, they have it on their watchlist and will contact you if necessary.

<p>I think I have made significant progress restructuring my user page for readability. The lessons so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's not have a huge mass of userboxes like a url farm. Cluster them according to general interest areas.</li>
<li>With each cluster of icons, have some text, whose vertical volume is such that the user boxes take up less vertical space than the relevant text, so we avoid overlapping with the next body of work.</li>
<li>Userboxes in front of associated text can be easier to manage, provided no overlap from prior section.</li>

<p>I started archiving my talk pages (pushing 50k) and I put "watch this page" on everything I working on, then I noticed my new archives were red link on my Watch list. I clicked on the link. My efforts there all right.

<p>Thanks for the message! I actually had looked at the ERP history a little, and kind of figured out some of what was going on with the ERP list - I liked what you did and thought I would "take up the baton" and run with it a little.</p>
<p>I am brand-spanking-new to this, and am unfortunately an addict. My wife is treating this as a sickness and is already quite prejudiced against it. I love Wikipedia! It is so awesome, I can see this naturally organizing all human knowledge in a short period of time. It is fantastic to watch this happening.</p>
<p>Since you've contacted me, and this is the closest thing that I have to a relationship with anyone on this site, can I ask you a few questions?</p>
<p>1) Where can I get template tags? Everyone is using them everywhere, but I can't seem to find a simple reference list of them that I can print out so that I can start using them.</p>
<p>2) How do I raise a flag when someone does something wrong? I've "been bold", and fixed a few things, and am afraid that someone might jump on me. In case that happens, how to I escalate the item for discussion? It seems that it might be done through template tags...</p>

<dd>Nice :) I thought I'd save a comment here yesterday, but perhaps not. I think it would be a good idea to add a section to the cyberlaw project about "incorporating the learnings from the class into relevant wikipedia articles". The initial thrust of the project, however, is for them to get involved with editing; and to organize somehow the edits they've made (and the community followup in response).</dd>
<dd>Other things that can be linked from the project page : individual accounts of contributors (a few are listed, but not most).</dd>
<dd>I like the idea of sprucing up the team section with links to talk pages and subpages right from the project page. And thank you for getting in touch with the project teams. You might ask the wikipedia team-groups directly about questions you have (re: the course, or law in general) -- I'm hoping that each team will come up with a one-liner defining what they stand for / work for, which might help you decide where to direct questions; but until then you can just ask whichever team seems most active...</dd>

<p>Right. Excellent book. Perhaps you should suggest it there, also, and anywhere else important. It's a good idea, oven overlooked, to remind folk that designing management takes thought and skill. People who know how hard it is to design a bridge sometimes think that designing and nurturing an organization is child's play.</p>

<p>Hey, I fixed a spelling <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a>, I hope thats ok. Also to clarify:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Note that the flag of Britain is a combination of the flags of Scotland and England. I am pretty sure Wales and Northern Ireland omitted.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>To clarify, there isn't really a flag of Britain. There is a flag of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Jack</a> which includes <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. You can find out more on the page for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Jack</a>. There is no Welsh influence on the flag as Wales is technically a principality of the Kingdom of England. Or something like that. Hope that clears it up :) - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 00:01, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I'm beginning to understand what's going on with the Cyberlaw project.

<p><i># There is a proposal to kill some article or group of articles, and I go to the talk pages of the articles and try to place a NPOV link to inform the people who are active there, about the proposal.</i></p>
<p>Absolutely not. In fact, that is a GREAT idea and IMO an important step of the process. I often post notes on people's talk pages to tell them a page they worked on is up at AfD, because often they won't be aware (especially if they're new). It is ridiculous to have a debate about a topic and not have it with the people who it will concern.</p>
<p><i># I tell a bunch of people about a project that I think might be of interest to them, based on the category they in or the types of articles they have contributed to.</i></p>
<p>No, that's a great idea. You can also post news about new projects of any kind of <a href="../../../v/p/n/WP%7EVPN_955a.html" title="WP:VPN">WP:VPN</a>. But I would mention how you happened to target them, eg "I see you've edited articles about X, maybe you'll be interested in a new project Y?" Otherwise they might think you're randomly spamming them.</p>
<p>You can also put a discreet link in your signature to draw people to it - quite a few people do that.</p>
<p><i># I do some heavy work on some article, then I visit talk pages of past editors to give them a heads up that I have changed what they had worked on.</i></p>
<p>That would be OK, but not necessary. It's not your responsibility to chase them up, and you don't need their permission. If they're still interested in editing the article, one would presume they would have it on their watchlist. Just make sure you use an informative edit summary like "big overhaul" or "added heaps of new info" or something, so they can see it for themselves if they are interested.</p>
<p><i># I write some piece, like in a talk page, then I point other people at that write-up, saying I think they might be interested.</i></p>
<p>Also fine. It is a much better idea to have a discussion on a topic in one place, rather than 6 separate active discussions.</p>
<p>Listen, don't worry too much about getting the fine detail of every little policy and guideline down pat. As long as you act in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> you should be fine. You may find that you inadvertently break some guideline. Well, that's fine - that's a good time to learn about it. Hopefully other editors will remember <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. But burdening yourself with understanding the whole kit &amp; kaboodle before you do <i>anything</i> is not necessary.

<p>In three years I have found the people who are easiest to work with, and most honest to deal with, are those who are totally open about their viewpoints. It didn't matter whether they were liberal or conservative, Catholic of Jew, pro-life or pro-choice, being open about who they are and their viewpoint enabled a reasoned, intelligent debate to ensue and meant people knew what viewpoints x or y would add into an article. I have found userboxes a godsend in that regard. Rather than having to write a long explanation of who they are, they can communicative their viewpoint quickly and effectively using a userbox. Others can use them to A line has to be drawn but most user boxes IMHO are perfectly valid.</p>
<p>The genie is out of the bottle on userboxes. They cannot now be deleted without provoking a Wikipedia civil war. All we can do is try to ensure <i>extremely offensive</i> users (eg, <i>This user hates queers</i>, <i>This user wants Israel wiped out</i>, <i>This user hates blacks</i>) aren't used. The last thing WP needs is about outbreak of political correctness on WP, whereby users are banned from saying what their political or religious identity is.</p>
<p>Allowing people to state their preferences also would enable WP to disprove claims of bias by showing that it has conservative users and liberal users, pro-israel and pro-palestinian users, pro-life and pro-choice, etc. Imposing censorship would frankly be a disaster that would drive many users away. Already the forced deletion by a cabal of a reference to a pro-life group on users has offended many and driven away some of our best contributors.</p>
<p>People should be entitled as of right under free speech to say who they are and what their views are. Either user pages are deleted <i>altogether</i> or people should be given the right to reveal as much as they wish about their views. <b>Free speech in a free encyclopaedia demands no less.</b></p>

<p>AlMac, I hope you were not offended by my comments on the WP Computer science talk page. I was not in any way trying to prescribe the scope of "computer science" (which is a pretty vague term anyway), I was just trying to point out that the articles you were proposing to make a "part" of WPCS were unlikely to garner much interest from the current project participants. You are certainly welcome to put the WPCS tags back on those articles, if you feel they should be there. However, I'm doubtful that, even with the tags in place, those articles would actually receive any attention from WPCS participants. Hopefully you will have more luck finding interested parties among the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computing_2546.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computing">WikiProject Computing</a> crowd. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 00:36, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for the welcome. I've been around wikipedia for a while now and have contributed bits and pieces. I saw the new users list only recently though. As for the NPOV bit, I try to keep that as much as possible and try to discuss matters before large edits. However, everyone has their biasses based on what they've been through and what their stands on life are. My introduction was meant to reflect that. :)--<a href="../../../n/k/v/User%7ENkv_e00c.html" title="User:Nkv">Nkv</a> 09:46, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could not find your talk page to reply there, but I will do so here.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Miscelaneous" is a legitimate word in American Emglish</li>
<li>"Witch" means a woman who does magic. I suspect you misspelled "which"</li>
<li>"versun" is not a word. I suspect you mean "version"</li>
<li>"uf" is not a word. I suspect you mean "of"</li>
<li>"Engliesch" is not a correct spelling version I recognize in any version of "English" that I am aware of.</li>
<li>"ist" is a word in German that means the same as "is" in English</li>
<li>"ta" is a colloqial expression in British English. Example usage "ta ta" meaning "goodbye"</li>
<li>"abuv" is a misspelling ... I suspect you mean "above"</li>
<li>"spelin" is a mis-spelling of "spelling"</li>
<li>"frum" is a mis-spelling of "from"</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your point in posting this statement that you have no idea how to spell in English? <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<strong class="selflink"><sup>(talk)</sup></strong> 23:25, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi...... I dont think anyone would have a problem with our band name" Cosa Nostra"...In our country most of the people dont even have the faintest idea that cosa nostra means the mafia....(and the japanese Yakusha haven't come to our shores yet....).....and if we really become a big success and start touring...(which is really really tough in a country like India)...i dont think anyone would mind us using a italian word as our name...in our country atleast.... and we become world famous or something then we would just explain on the TV that we dont have nay connections with the underworld....ha ha..... anyways... did you listen to the song?? if not, please try to... and sorry about the quality...we only had a single mic and we had to record all the music and the vocals through the same mic.....</p>
