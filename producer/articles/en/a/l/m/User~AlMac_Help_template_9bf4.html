<dd>Ayone who objects to the formatting of a question strongly enough to comment on it ought to just fix the thing to his liking, and be quiet about it. We don't need a template telling us you've done it: there's no reason to increase the length of the page to demonstrate your ire.

<dd>Why do you insist on helping people who disrespect the system? I find the Reference Desk an important tool in mainaining and updating Wikipedia, as it gives insight into missing data in articles. It should not just be a place where clueless newbies are 'helped' again and again when it clear that they will never check back for an answer, and never read the rules. Again, why help people who disrespect the system?</dd>
<dd>I also don't find the above templates particularly rude, and have a greater problem with people posting inane or single-word 'questions'. Should we just remove all questions that do not appear to be genuine questions? That would certainly help to decrease the length of the page.</dd>
<dd>In summary, the RD should not go out of its way to 'help' people who could have 'helped' themselves without much effort. Only stricter rules can curb the number of rediculous questions. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 20:56, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, helping the clueless newbies again and again and again and again and again is pretty much what Reference Desks do.

<dd>ps. I've now read on several occasion that editors who object to repeating themselves, and who would like to curb the number of rediculous questions are effectively not welcome at the RD. I object to that.

<dd>I am starting to see paralells between my posts and the posts of madmen. Nevertheless, the Reference Desk currently serves its purpose only up to a point. Only a small number of volunteers answer questions, and there is no clear way to archive past questions. The first problem could be fixed, in my opinion, by reducing the number of incredibly stupid questions, and by encouraging knowledgeable editors to patrol these pages looking for articles that require clarification or appending.</dd>
<dd>The second problem could be solved by a system of categories for archival. Many questions do not require archival, for example when the problem with a page is fixed, or when no actual question exists. Only questions that led to an interesting discussion (<a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_Humanities_c54c.html#What_is_your_favorite_poem.3F" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/Humanities">What is your favorite poem?</a> for example) need to be archived. While this question appeared on Humanities, it could very well be archived under a more specific header, such as a poetry category. Questions regarding computers could be archived together, specified by operating system or some such criterion.</dd>
<dd>My point is that the Reference Desk is little of what it could be. But when I previously suggested actually enforcing the <i>rules</i> at the top of each page, I was told I was uncivil and shouldn't contribute. At the very least then, the rules should be renamed to <i>suggestions</i> or <i>tips</i>, but it should be made clear that asking a question in even the vaguest terms (What are the evils of monopoly?) or completely redundant (what is virginity&#160;?) will be answered. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 21:13, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Our point is that many of these silly questioners are first-timers. Whatever you say isn't going to do a damn thing about the next one, it isn't like training one kid. So, the strategy that some of us encourage is to be polite and responsive and helpful. Doing otherwise isn't going to deter the next <i>intrusion</i> but it may well indeed influence this questioner to improve. Scolding is not helpful, and in fact may result in "justifiable" vandalism because we were such jerks. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 21:34, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hold hope that a <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_report_a490.html#editintro.3D_doesn.27t_display_when_editing_existing_pages" title="Wikipedia:Bug report">future software tweak</a> will enable us to force the readers to read the rules. Until then, you know as well as I do that the person who asked 'what is virginity&#160;?' will not be back to read the clever answers given to the question. Ve will not even follow the link to 'virginity' that was created to help vim. All effort to help this person is wasted.</dd>
<dd>There's a difference between being jerks and being professional. Making it clear that a procedure should be followed to ask a question is professional, not uncivil. Answering any question, no matter how innane, or responding with sarcasm to people whose mastery of the enlgih language may be poor is unprofessional, and even uncivil. I ask you, what is wrong with standardising a response such as the following:</dd>
<dd><i>What is viginity?</i>

<dd>If no other contributors pile on, or offer help/sarcastic remarks the problem is fixed, and the question can safely be ignored. When archiving time comes along, this question needn't be archived.

<dd>That's some some freaking smart bot. And oh, if someone is researching this whole "mess" in the future for whatever reason well then we'll just change history by not archiving the stuff we don't like because we know it all.

<dd>A bot could easily detect any question that has not been answered, or any question that has been responded to only with a stanrd response. Such questions could then be treated differently. Perhaps .. Perhaps unanswered questions could be left on the main page of the RD, while 'silly questions' (those questions with a standard reponse) could be removed after a while, without being archived. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 11:54, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologise for my above post. I shouldn't have minded <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo's</a> rather silly answer. For the record, I still don't see how ve could have misread my comment, unless he didn't read it carefully. I don't see what is ambiguous about "A standard response might even help a bot remove such questions before archival." And I don't see how anyone could find the concept laughable, even if they misunderstood its simplicity.</dd>
<dd>Still, I let emotion guide my post, which I shouldn't have. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 11:54, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's worth noting you all raise good points. True, my templates may seem a bit harsh, but I believe that to deal with puppies who piss on the carpet, you must give them a good thwack with a rolled-up newspaper. Standard responses seem a bit mechanical, true, but it seems to me that it's a lot easier to just toss in something standard than type out, "Hey, you know what, you're stupid, don't do that dumbass." It's a matter of philosophy; you can love them or leave them, but they're ultimately in my user space and I'll have them deleted if I am told to because I am violating some policy or some such. I never said you had to use them and I'm not forcing them down anyone's throats. It's just a suggestion. Feel free to be bold and edit the wording if you like; I don't really care, honestly. Just putting in my two cents, since I started the controversy. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECernen_7781.html" title="User:Cernen">Cernen</a> <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECernen_a016.html" title="User talk:Cernen">Xanthine</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cernen_40f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cernen">Katrena</a> 16:37, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
