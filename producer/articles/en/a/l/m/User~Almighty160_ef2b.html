	    <p>Loap Resident Evil Unoffical In 2005 Octobor 24th a boy had a dream that would change the loap resident evil forever.At first he knew that there already is which is loap res-evil.But he knew that he had to take chances.So what he did was he took a pen and paper,took some notes and gets ready for the first release of loap resident evil unoffical.At first 1.0 came out pretty badly because it was almost the same as 7.8 Offical.Then he did 1.1 and 1.2 which are more fixed and added few features.November 16th 1.3 comes out and the release was 5% of the custom game populartiy.</p>
<p>Almighty160:It felt good when people hosted it one was that they have a more fixed and fun version of loap resident evil.I didn't know that 8.5F came out but i didn't really worry because I knew that at first i would start small like a hamster but will be big as a shark.</p>
<p>November 5th 2005 a tester SkullOrc was trying to figure out how to get people in his hosted game.SkullOrc couldn't figure out how so after he left almighty160 had an idea that he could host.Thirty minutes later after SkullOrc left almighty160 can host again and he ready for 1.4.</p>
<p>November 12th 2005 1.4 is release and the hosting market raised to 7%.Fans were pretty happy because they seeing a light to a new future.But what they think at first is that almighty maybe just an amateur.</p>
<p><br />
almighty160: I knew those people wouldn't like it because one its unoffical and two 8.5 is still the better game.I played other loaps to get some neat ideas so what i did I downloaded the map pack and start taking notes.</p>
<p>November 18th 2005 almighty160 quickly releases 1.5 and it was a full failure.One reason was that the dogs and cats were rigged and almost unstoppable.Almighty160 dropped to 6% of the hosting but he knew that first mistakes maybe the last mistake.</p>
<p>November 23th 2005 almighty160 releases 1.6 and it turns out another failure.The reason was that almighty160 didn't actully know the dogs and cats were super powerful.Almighty160 has lost the fans trust and then all anyone hosted was ether 1.4 or 8.5.</p>
<p>Almighty160:I thought it was the bugs but it was really just those heros the dogs and cats.If i want to change everything I will have to think of better ideas.</p>
<p>December 2nd 2005 almighty160 releases 1.7 and he gained so much trust on the fans that atleast 4 people would host it a day.</p>
<p>Almighty160:I was so happy because the dogs and cats were gone and new ideas were there.I had to take out dogs and cats or it will make me look like a loser.1.7 felt more of an arcade because the feel of it was so good that its like playing back when arcade games were a hit.</p>
<p>December 5th 2005 After almighty160 met new testers he was ready to go to the next level.</p>
<p>almighty160:Sense 1.7 was a hit i have to make sure 1.8 would be the same thing.So I looked back at first person shooters because they were the reason that games like half life 2 and star wars battlefront was a hit.So what I did i saw people play some first person shooters and i saw a person played counter strike.When i heard all this cooperation with the radio it got me the idea.Adding radio could make other players cooperate to kill zombies or even kill enemies such as cops or yakuza.</p>
<p>December 12th 2005 1.8 comes out and it was also a huge hit.More bugs were fixed and the radio was such a good idea that the hosting was 12%.Almighty160 was so happy that he knew that if he wants a better version he would need lots of testing and bunch of ideas.</p>
<p>Almighty160:It didn't feel like you were playing an arcade game anymore.It felt more like playing the first game console that was a hit.The radio was very effective that people would just ask for backup or do some plan tactics for war advantage.When I got the percentage to 12% it felt better then ever.I maybe not get up to dota but I will be on the list of great creators.</p>
<p>January 7th 2006 1.9 comes out and all the counter strike radio was added.But it wasn't just for cops and swat.Druglord and yakuza also had it and more cooperation was made.1.9 didn't had any major bugs or anything but it felt like 1.8 mega pack.The percentage was 17% and almighty160 was ready for the last days of unoffical.</p>
<p>almighty160:Now that I am not a laughing stock anymore its time to go serious.</p>
<p>Feburary 6th 2006 2.0 Beta comes out and it goes up to 19% of hosting chances.Changes were coming and 8.5 was dropping by 12% of hosting.Lots of changes were made but it wasn't over yet.</p>
<p>Feburary 13th 2006 2.0 final comes out and 21% of hosting was made.The game looked so bright that 1/3 of 8.5F was lost.</p>
<p>almighty160:Time is comming for a change and the time to stop is comming.</p>
<p>Feburary th after 2.0 final was release 2.1 came out and it only made 21% of hosting.A few bugs but they were fixed easily.</p>
<p>Feburary 21 2006 2.1 Expansion comes out and it fixes every bug and better audience.</p>
<p>Feburary 38th 2006 2.2 Vbeta comes out and word spreads quickly.25% of hosting was made and almighty160 was ready for the end.</p>
<p>Almighty160:I got so far and thanks to this map I made friends but most importantly those friends are a family.Surely unoffical means underground or some cheap bastard who just wants a rigged charecter.But actully its just an edit version that wants a change what Resident Evil sopose to be about with loap.I am glad for the people who enjoyed them from all the months but this isn't over yet i am still making more and more.Maybe not loap resident evil but great games that have action and cooperation in them.</p>
<p><br />
March 12th 2006 2.2 Vfinal comes out and its better then ever.In past 3 or 4 versions cops,stars,and swat got to choose their own charecter.This time druglord,terrorist,and pimp can choose their own too.In the past 2 versions S.T.A.R.S got in and fans rushed for it.29-30% of hosting was made and it was such a huge improvement.People across the world that have been trying the unofficals will have their worth of playing it because they got their hands on a new generation of loap resident evil unoffical.But this isn't just a game that plays good it even looks good with custom skins that were made.With all the new classes and choosing you will try for 4-6 times.Or even more then what you thought you would end up with.</p>
<p>Almighty160:My testers took their paths making their own and I have accomplished my dream.This is the vision that creators should make and fans should make.Things that you yourself would have fun with and others would have fun too.True this is called final version but there are 2 more versions that are still in the shadows.</p>
<p>Rating from creator 9/10 Final</p>
<p>Rating for 1.8 9.5/10</p>
