<p>Most of what I've seen places almonds in the genus <i>Prunus</i>, rather than in a separate-yet-related genus. But I don't know enough botany to know which we should do.</p>

<p>I have read that almonds once contained enough cyanide to be poisonous to humans, but through selective breeding it was reduced to the point where they became edible. If this is true, it should be added, but I don't know whether it is.</p>

<dd>The Almond Board of California also claims almonds are California's #1 export, but only the sixth leading agricultural product overall. Perhaps that contributed to the original confusion.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Talk%7EAlmond_0a9c.html" title="Edit section: Pronunciation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>The article currently says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In parts of Northern California, where almonds are a main crop, the word is often pronounced with a unique regional accent. Rather than the usual American pronunciation of "Ahl-mond", with the soft A and L, it is pronounced with a hard A and nearly silent H, as in "Aah-men". This method of pronunciation is particularly prevalent near the city of Chico in Butte County, but it is also heard in nearby Glenn, Colusa, and Tehama Counties.</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, well the more linguistic training you have, the less meaningful descriptions like this become. What do "hard" and "soft" A refer to? Is there any actual /h/ in "Aah-men", or is that just a convention to indicate the quality of the a?</p>
<p>Is there any chance that someone in the know could get this transcribed into IPA? Thanks. --<a href="../../../i/u/s/User%7EIustinus_acb0.html" title="User:Iustinus">Iustinus</a> 17:39, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know IPA, but as resident of the area, I can try to answer the question. I don't think there is an actual "h" sound in the pronunciation. The "Aah" sound described above should be like the "a" in "cat". I would write it phonetically as "a'-men". (putting a strong emphasis on the "a"). This pronunciation is only common among almond-farming families and orchard workers who use word "almond" hundreds or thousand of times per year. It's an informal, abreviated form of the word, dropping the "L" and the "d" sounds, and changing the initial vowel sound from the "o" in "odd-ball", to "a" as in "apple". Curiously, this pronunciation only seems to apply to almonds until they are harvested and processed. In the context of food, an "almond joy" candy-bar for example, even an almond farmer would be more likely to use the common (non-regional) pronunciation. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelfavor_1c96.html" title="User:Michaelfavor">Michaelfavor</a> 00:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The use of an 'h' in a pronunciation guide means a voiced 'h', i.e., aspiration (here, as in e.g. the Arabic name <i>Ahmed</i>). Does this really apply to the Calif. pronunciation? - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 01:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've removed the above paragraph from the article as (a) the pronunciation statements aren't cited, and I think are unusual enough to need citation, (b) it isn't in IPA, and the manual of style deprecates non-IPA pronunciation guides, and (c) is it really encyclopaedic?</p>
<p>I'm not very good at writing IPA, but based on the above spellings it is something like /æhlmɑnd/ for the 'usual American pronunciation', and /ɑhmɛn/ for the California local - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 10:57, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know IPA, but the California pronounciation is like 'amp' or 'Amanda'. You should be able to copy the IPA notation for the 'Am' sound from those words. The local joke is that it's pronounced that way because you have to knock the (hel)<b>L</b> out of the tree to get the nuts to fall. <a href="../../../t/o/i/User%7EToiyabe_d751.html" title="User:Toiyabe">Toiyabe</a> 20:35, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well it would seem that Americans pronounce the word competely differently from us in the Commonwealth? I pronounce it <b>arr-mond</b>, which is the pronunciation given by the <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a>: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['ɑːmənd]</span> <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 09:59, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I (a native and lifelong resident of the Chicago area) pronounce "almond" something like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈɑʟ.mṇd]</span> or occasionally <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈɑl.mənd]</span> I have heard other Americans using <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈæ.mən]</span>, which may well be the Californian way. Toiyabe, I don't know how Californians pronounce "amp" or "Amanda" to make a comparison. I've also heard a (maybe Ohio/Michigan) variant that is closer to the OED version, something like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈɔː.mənd]</span>, which if I had to spell it, would be "awmin'd". FWIW, FiggyBee, I would pronounce <b>arr-mond</b> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɑɹ.ˈmʌnd]</span> and I would spell <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['ɑːmənd]</span> as "ommin'd".

<p>"California produces 80% of the world's almonds" - I'd like to see this figure verified from an independent source. The source cited seems pretty biased to me.

<p>I didn't see anything about this, they are the two main types of almonds grown in California.</p>
<p>Also the saying goes that when it's on the tree you call it an "ALMOND" but when it's on the ground it's called an "AMOND" since you have to knock the "L" out of it. This is an almond joke that growers tell referring to the knocking of the trees with mallets in order to shake the almonds from the tree. (today it's done with tree shakers)</p>

<p>Hey WLU I can appreciate the comments on the article being short and unreferenced. Next time I submit I anything I will make sure the article is comprehensive and referenced well. However, I didn't appreciate the spam comment and "promote spas". The site as a whole is about everything related to spas and massage, including skin care. There is no spa promotion on the article page. The site is completely non profit, not even a hint of adsense or anything else. It costs me money, and it is a project created out of learning how build my own database driven web sites (custom cms from the ground up). So please instead of labeling any outbound link as spam, make sure you understand what you mean. Again I appreciate the other comments, and if that's all that was said I wouldn't be writing this. Also, you may want to check other links on the page before yanking the new one. The cooking link is, short, unreferenced, promotes a book and has adsense on it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.162.191.128 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.162.191.128.html" title="User talk:70.162.191.128">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.162.191.128_cbe7.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.162.191.128">contribs</a>).</small></p>
