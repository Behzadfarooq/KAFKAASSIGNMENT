<p>Thanks Elizmr, I will make sure I am more careful with this. Sometimes after I upload some text, I forget to add a link or something.

<p>Thank you for your concern Elzimr. I am having difficutlies with adding relevant info to that page. Amoruso keeps reverting for no good reason. He disputes several things. For example, he does not want to believe that the Arabic term al-Masjid al-Aqsa from which the english al-Aqsa Mosque is derived, denotes the whole area of the noble sanctuary. I added citations that explain when these terms started to be used and what is denoted by each etc, but he insists that this is not neutral. Furthermore, he removes informaiton that al-Aqsa mosque compound's capacity is hundreds of thousands muslims. Instead he want only to use the number 5000 only to marginalize the place! Finally, he disproves the edits I made to the Dome of the Rock which is now blocked for this reason. There I have added the construction letter regarding the Dome in which it mentions that the muslim calpih commissioned the Dome as a mosque for muslims. Instead he insists this is not neutral and that the word mosque should be replaced with the word shrine arguing that the Dome was built by Jews and for Jews!</p>
<p>I cannot continue reverting his edits on these pages alone and this is why I need help from other people of knowledge. Certainly regarding this particular topic, he has agenda and is only interested in disputes and not authentic resources and is just not letting any information from Islamic accounts to stay there. This is why I asked the help and assistance from other users regarding this issue. I understand that many users may not be able to contribute conveniently to this article with legitimate resources, but I can do that and I have access to thousands of Academic Journals and Books and magazines. He argues that I may only have such edits on Arabic WikiPedia! I do not see why such information that is available in the Arabic language should not be available also in english, particularly given the fact that many of the old Arabic texts themselves have been recently translated to English and can also be conveniently cited and verified by english speakers. Have a good day. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 08:55, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sometimes if the language is made more precise to convey a pov more exactly then the objections will go away but it doesn't sound like this is that kind of a case. Would it make sense to give two numbers of the occupancy with cites for each and say the capacity is disputed with some claiming x and some claiming y? Or two sets of sources and say that one set is the codified muslim source and the other is whatever it is and let both stand? It will be clear to Muslims reading that they should trust the Muslim source more, and others can get the range of what's out there and make their own conclusions. Is the problem with who built the dome about the site of the Jewish temples or is it something else? Anyway, I think you could probably reach a version that would be ok with both of you. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 23:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur with Elizmer's proposal here for a plurality of (reliable) sources as a way of mitigating this issue. Hang in there Almaqdisi, don't lose your cool. --<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 00:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Amerique, and Dear Elzimr. Thank you both for your remarks. Indeed I am always sticking to reliable sources and authentic citations. The problem with <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">al-Aqsa Mosque</a> page and with the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dome_of_the_Rock_4284.html" title="Dome of the Rock">Dome of the Rock</a> page is that Amoruso and Chesdovi do not want to understand. This is really the whole issue. Even if you bring what ever sources like I am doing at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">al-Aqsa Mosque</a> page, they are just not interested to understand, and only love to revert edits that take really time to organise. It is not becoming fun and something should should be done about it. Elzimr, this is what Amoruso believes <a href="http://www.templemountfaithful.org/Newsletters/2001/5761-11.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.templemountfaithful.org/Newsletters/2001/5761-11.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

For this reason, Amoruso keeps removing any information that explains what is al-Aqsa mosque, and that the whole Noble Sanctuary is a prayer site, and that the Dome of the Rock is a muslims house of worhsip, etc... I do not think there is a possibility at all for neutrality here with just wrong information. You cannot be neutral with such simply false information.

<dd>I understand what it is like to have hard work undone and dismissed and can understand your frustration at that. The good thing about Wikipedia is that the work is still there in a previous version so don't despair. I also know that is is kind of bizarre to look at a page on a topic you know everything about and see that the people editing the page don't know much and there are inaccuracies there. I have looked at pages in my professional field and have had that experience. At the same time when I've looked at those pages I have been struck by how hard the editors are trying and how much they care about editing the article and the topic. This makes me feel more fondly towards what they have done even though they have gotten some of it wrong. Anyway, I don't know much about the history of the dome of the rock, but will look at the link you sent which shows Amoruso's POV. Maybe there is a way to present all of the material in a way that you and the others will be able to accept. Maybe not. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 03:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not going to pursue trying to fix the Al-Aqsa thing further. Sorry. One of your co-religionists has decided to call me an "infidel" for my troubles. From a muslim to a jew I find this rude; I thought we were all people of the book with mutual respect between us.

<dd>You seem determined to take offense for no reason - not only is infidel a perfectly proper word for non-Muslims, it's also used by the Catholic Church for some similar purpose (as I proved to somebody, I think it was you).</dd>
<dd>And you have no evidence whatsoever that I'm a Muslim, so your attempt to embarrass another Muslim by calling him "your co-relgionist" looks very much like an attempt to shut down a discussion where it's you that's been found intolerant and ill-informed.</dd>
<dd>All of which would be much more understandable, were it not that I earlier objected (strongly) to what appeared to be an attempt to inveigle me into a discussion with serious anti-semitic overtones.</dd>

<p>I am fairly sure that the Catholic church does not use this word currently, although they certainly did historically. Most educated people currently realize that we live in a multicultural society and don't go around saying deliberately insulting stuff to people who are different from them in an inciting way. And with all due respect, I am not taking offense "for no reason". I have honestly said that I consider calling someone an "infidel "(ie--someone of no faith) is rude and have asked for an apology. I don't think it would be productive to reply to any of your points because it is clear to me that there is no hope for a reasonable dialog, but your whole reply above is very attacking--you accuse me of trying to get you into racist arguments, trying to embarass a Muslim, calling me intolerant, calling me ill-informed. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 00:44, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Dear <strong class="selflink">User_talk:Almaqdisi</strong>. I cannot take a discussion about the use of the word "infidel" very seriously.</b> The fuss made looks exactly like an attempt to make the discussion personal in order not to discuss the point I'd raised (Israel's gradual destruction of the Al-Aqsa mosque). It's not just an attempt to slur me, it's an attempt to re-define Arabic as a language of insults. The next step is to say "We've made calling someone a Muslim an insult, therefore we're going to bar you from using that word too". When I see <i>Political Correctness</i> of this kind being injected, I assume that the points I'm making are excellent, and the accuser knows it.</dd>
<dd>Now, I may have been wrong to use the word "infidel", but there isn't another I could have used, and my quick search of google suggests the word is sometimes used as insult, but more often is not. I will, however bear your words in mind and not use this particular word again.</dd>
<dd>(You will have noted the same people are making generalisations about the "The Jews" and demanding that I join that discussion. They're attempting to trick me into making some kind of similar racist generalisation, in order they can smear me as anti-semitic. This silly spat over the meaning of "infidel" comes from the same tool-box, the one labelled "ways to silence critics of Israel". But it comes from a different drawer, the one labelled "easy ways to make Arabic speakers feel bad and tie them in knots").</dd>

<dd>My apologies - I'd not appreciated there was an English word I could have used, that of "non-believer" instead of the Arabic "infidel". I can see I've fallen foul of the English-speaking mafia, who have an absolute right to re-define any and all Arabic words as being insulting and declare them not fit to be used in polite society.</dd>
<dd>Wouldn't it make more sense just to announce that "iggerant furriners are not welcome in the Wikipedia", and then the lowly ranks of people like myself would know we were not entitled to engage even in discussions on Talk pages, let alone edit an article?</dd>

<p>[Sahih Bukhari: Volume 3, Book 29, Number 87]</p>
<p>Narrated Qaza'a, the slave of Ziyad: Abu Said (Radi Allah Anhu) who participated in twelve Ghazawat with the Prophet (sal-allahu- alleihi-wasallam ) said, I heard four things from Allah's Apostle (sal-allahu- alleihi-wasallam ) (or I narrate them from the Prophet ) which won my admiration and appreciation. They are:</p>
<p>1. No lady should travel without her husband or without a Dhu-Mahram for a two-days' journey.</p>
<p>2. No fasting is permissible on two days of 'Id-al-Fitr, and 'Id-al-Adha.</p>
<p>3. No prayer (may be offered) after two prayers: after the 'Asr prayer till the sun set and after the morning prayer till the sun rises.</p>
<p>4. Not to travel (for visiting) except for three mosques: Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca), my Mosque (in Medina), and Masjid-al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem). --- <a href="../../../i/b/r/User%7EIbrahimfaisal_46ee.html" title="User:Ibrahimfaisal">Ø§Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ù‡ÙŠÙ…</a> 17:04, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right that our scholars have been taking this position that it was a physical journey but there is little or no strong evidence to show that <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> believed it this way as well. The general argument is that why the prophet would be ridiculed when he told about this journey. The people who believe that it was a dream say that it was a very important revelation from the God which told Muslims that now Juresalem is now going to be given to Muslims, and as the prophet lead the prayer in front of all the previous prophets, that showed that Muslims will rule this world. And this claim was ridiculed by the opponents of the prophet. The classical example of this understanding comes from <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> (ra). He believed in this so strongly that he didn't even care to bring army with him, but rather went alone with his servant to take the control of the city of Juraselum. And as the Qur'an promissed, the city fell into his hand.</dd>

<p>I agree Hadith can be used. SHOULD be used youre right theyre very important source. But not with coming our own original interpretations. If Hadith say, 'Narrate Aisha: Prophet told me journey was physical journey not dream.' then we can say Hadith say that. Original research when were saying it 'suggest' something. That makes sense?

<p>Thanks Almaqdisi. Im mainly angry at the Truthspreader he was going around saying using Hadith is original research even if we only repeat exactly what it say. Saying we need secondary source in all cases THEN I look through his contributing and see that! Not your fault at all!</p>
<p>For when we dont know if hadith reliable or not. And lets be honest we usually dont. Even the best Islamic scholars disagree on very many of these. In this case where we dont know we should be careful and say 'According the the hadith of Sahih Muslim' and tell exactly what it say. Thats a fair and honest using of the primary source.

<p>Hello, Almaqdisi. I understand you may be frustrated with the way some articles are being edited. I just had one of the articles I wrote deleted, so I can understand frustration. However, it helps to keep <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia%7EDo_not_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_f384.html" title="Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a> in mind. The talk pages of the article is where the merits of the individual sources can be discussed, and I, among many other editors, will be happy to engage in constructive dialogue with you there.

<p>Hi Almaqdisi</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether the following is true or whether it can be verified. But I thought you should see it anyway:</p>
<p>The historical claim of the Zionists is almost unbelievably tenuous ..... a smallish portion of Israel was a Judean Kingdom, lasting 100 years between 145BC and 44BC (when the Romans occupied the Eastern Meditteranean).</p>
<p>The Italians ruled continuously until 626 AD (this comes to a total of 670 years).</p>
<p>The Persians took over. They were almost immediately converted to Islam, 637 AD, and the Muslims held the area until 1948 (this comes to a total of 1311 years. Though they lost a portion, briefly, to the Crusaders).</p>
<p>It would seem that, based on the length of occupation, Italians have a six times better claim to Israel than any American or Russian, and Muslims have 13 times as good a claim.</p>
<p>(You might wish to accept Biblical claims that there were two earlier periods of Palestinian independence, totalling 300 years. A kingdom of Israel between 1030-1020 BCE and 930 BCE-920 BCE, c.100 years. Then 200 years of two independent kingdoms, Israel and Judah. Destroyed by the Assyrians c. 720 BCE. But even if we accept the older, unproven claims, the Italians would still be 50% more entitled to the area and the Muslims three times as entitled to it).</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the claim is not based on length of occupation, then on what is it based? Not religious fundamentalism along with armed robbery, I trust?</p>

<p>Hi Almaqdisi,</p>
<p>You know, I gave some thought to the changes you made this morning when you deleted my remarks on the etymology of "Palestinian" from the introductory paragraphs of the article on Palestinian People and actually, I came to the conclusion that I agree that the etymology should be removed from the introduction and placed further down in the article.</p>
<p>After all, many Palestinians who would read this Wikipedia page would like it to be a source of pride and it is perhaps unavoidable that mention of Israelis and Palestinian Jews would disturb them when it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead I was thinking that the discussion on the adoption of the term "Palestinian" could be relocated to the section talking about the newspaper in 1911 called Filisteen (not sure I got the spelling right).</p>
<p>I had gone so far as to edit it that way and then I guess you restored the previous version (surprisingly to me). In addition, as you may see in my edit, I thought it important to mention that it was Yasir Arafat's adoption of the name Palestine Liberation Organization that essentially created the term "Palestinian" as a <i>fait accompli</i>, but that he was only able to do this because Jewish Palestinians had abandoned the term "Palestinian" in favor of "Israeli" after 1948. Regardless of the conflict, it seems to me these are valid facts that are enlightening to read in this context for one who may not have considered it before.</p>
<p>I am planning to quit editing this page because I don't want to cause any frustration to you or others but what I would suggest is a balanced emphasis on facts. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJabeles_26ea.html" title="User:Jabeles">Jabeles</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/b/User_talk%7EJabeles_1d76.html" title="User talk:Jabeles">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jabeles_8f0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jabeles">contribs</a>) 20:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
