<p>The International Conference on Primary Health Care, was held on 12th September, 1978. It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all the people of the world.</p>

<p>The Declaration has 10 points and is non-binding on member states.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Ata_Declaration_5865.html" title="Edit section: Definition of health">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">health</a></span></h2>
<p><b>I</b> The Conference strongly reaffirms that health, which is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, is a fundamental human right and that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most important world-wide social goal whose realization requires the action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health sector.</p>

<p><b>II</b> The existing gross inequality in the health status of the people particularly between developed and developing countries as well as within countries is politically, socially and economically unacceptable and is, therefore, of common concern to all countries.</p>

<p><b>III</b> Economic and social development, based on a New International Economic Order, is of basic importance to the fullest attainment of health for all and to the reduction of the gap between the health status of the developing and developed countries. The promotion and protection of the health of the people is essential to sustained economic and social development and contributes to a better quality of life and to world peace.</p>

<p><b>V</b> Governments have a responsibility for the health of their people which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures. A main social target of governments, international organizations and the whole world community in the coming decades should be the attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. Primary health care is the key to attaining this target as part of development in the spirit of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_justice.html" title="Social justice">social justice</a>.</p>

<p><b>VI</b> Primary health care is essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination. It forms an integral part both of the country's health system, of which it is the central function and main focus, and of the overall social and economic development of the community. It is the first level of contact of individuals, the family and community with the national health system bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and work, and constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process.</p>

<p><b>VII</b> Primary health care:reflects and evolves from the economic conditions and sociocultural and political characteristics of the country and its communities and is based on the application of the relevant results of social, biomedical and health services research and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_health.html" title="Public health">public health</a> experience; addresses the main health problems in the community, providing promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services accordingly;</p>

<p><b>involves</b>, in addition to the health sector, all related sectors and aspects of national and community development, in particular <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_husbandry.html" title="Animal husbandry">animal husbandry</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industry</a>, education, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing.html" title="Housing">housing</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_works.html" title="Public works">public works</a>, communications and other sectors; and demands the coordinated efforts of all those sectors;</p>
<p>'<i>requires</i> and promotes maximum community and individual self-reliance and participation in the planning, organization, operation and control of primary health care, making fullest use of local, national and other available resources; and to this end develops through appropriate education the ability of communities to participate;</p>
<p>It should be sustained by integrated, functional and mutually supportive referral systems, leading to the progressive improvement of comprehensive health care for all, and giving priority to those most in need;</p>
<p><b>Relies</b>, at local and referral levels, on health workers, including physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliaries and community workers as applicable, as well as traditional practitioners as needed, suitably trained socially and technically to work as a health team and to respond to the expressed health needs of the community.</p>
<p><b>VIII</b> All governments should formulate national policies, strategies and plans of action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensive national health system and in coordination with other sectors. To this end, it will be necessary to exercise political will, to mobilize the country's resources and to use available external resources rationally.</p>
<p><b>IX</b> All countries should cooperate in a spirit of partnership and service to ensure primary health care for all people since the attainment of health by people in any one country directly concerns and benefits every other country. In this context the joint WHO/UNICEF report on primary health care constitutes a solid basis for the further development and operation of primary health care throughout the world.</p>
<p><b>X</b> An acceptable level of health for all the people of the world by the year 2000 can be attained through a fuller and better use of the world's resources, a considerable part of which is now spent on armaments and military conflicts. A genuine policy of independence, peace, détente and disarmament could and should release additional resources that could well be devoted to peaceful aims and in particular to the acceleration of social and economic development of which primary health care, as an essential part, should be allotted its proper share.</p>
<p>The Conference called for urgent and effective national and international action to develop and implement primary health care throughout the world and particularly in developing countries in a spirit of technical cooperation and in keeping with a New International Economic Order. It urged governments, WHO and <a href="../../../u/n/i/UNICEF_d137.html" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>, and other international organizations, as well as multilateral and bilateral agencies, non-governmental organizations, funding agencies, all health workers and the whole world community to support national and international commitment to primary health care and to channel increased technical and financial support to it, particularly in developing countries. The Conference called on all the aforementioned to collaborate in introducing, developing and maintaining primary health care in accordance with the spirit and content of the Declaration.</p>
