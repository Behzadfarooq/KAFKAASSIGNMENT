<p>I've updated and cleaned up this article. Accrediation issues and tone of the article has been balanced like the person below did back in September. Online Schools like Almeda University, University of Phoenix and others have been getting a bad rap(my opinion) due to it's non-traditional conformity with other colleges and universities.--bobbyd January 2007.</p>
<p>I've done some cleanup on this article. While the accreditation issue must be handled, the tone of the article and the balance of discussion has to be evened out. I don't know much about the university, and don't know where to start, but while an honest article is in order, it can't be a smear job, either. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Veronica678 18:00, 30 September 2006 (UTC)The part about the dog should be removed. If a person filled out an application using a fake (dog's) name, the content of the application must have been also falsified with enough detail to pass the equivalency meter. The problem is that if someone did complete the application with enough fake personal details to be awarded the Almeda degree, with the sole intent of discrediting Almeda, then it violates several laws including fraud and entrapment. All Almeda applications require that the applicant sign electronically that they are at least 18 years of age and all information contained within their application is true and correct. Also, the dog story was not created by a news team investigation, but was an uncorroborated story told to the news – which they then chose to print without verifying the details. This is akin to sending a friend with your birth certificate in to take your drivers license test for you and then bashing the Department of Motor Vehicles for issuing you a driver’s license when you can't drive.</p>

<p>(I've moved this from the POV section as it seems to me fairly balanced and from various sources - some sugar to balance the sourness of this discussion) Janeybee 21:12, 15 March 2007 (UTC)<br />
I'm not sure you can blame a university for people lying on the application form, can you? I could have lied plenty on my Open University Masters degree but common decency dictates that one doesn't. I think it's high time there were more of these life experience universities, to break down the old snobbery about academic/book learning being so much better than any life experience. In terms of how Almeda University stands up against some of these criticisms, well all universities attempt to be profit-making. They aren't there for the good of their own health!There are plenty of positive comments if you look for them. I'm new to Wikipedia so I don't know if it's legitimate to quote other sources, but I have referenced them so people can check them out:</p>
<p>"We are confident that Almeda University is a Credible school. Almeda University has gone the extra lengths in student privacy and security." <a href="http://www.degreeadvice.com/almedauniversity/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.degreeadvice.com/almedauniversity/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.degreeadvice.com/almedauniversity/index.html</a></p>
<p>"Almeda University is a young exciting company formed in 1997. It offers a wide range of Associate, Bachelor’s, and Master’s degrees in a variety of fields including business and most technical fields as well as the arts and sciences. It is accredited by AOAEX (the Association for Online Academic Excellence) which is a private accrediting agency that ensures online distance learning programs are credible. Almeda’s virtual campus is a learning community that is alive with high technology, educational innovation, and personal enrichment." <a href="http://www.onlineeducationfacts.com/online-education-facts/almeda.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.onlineeducationfacts.com/online-education-facts/almeda.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineeducationfacts.com/online-education-facts/almeda.htm</a></p>
<p>"DegreeAdvice.com: Down the Beaten Path Currently, government officials have launched an unprovoked attack against online universities and colleges, calling them “degree-mills”, because of their mix of both knowledge and life experience. What’s wrong with this? Apparently these schools do not walk down the beaten path of traditional ones, placing an emphasis on education instead of mere profit making.</p>
<p>It would seem that online schools such as Almeda University’s mix of traditional learning and the personal experiences of their students has scared the institutions to the point where they have released their government attack dogs in an attempt to completely discredit these schools, with the goal of maintaining the status-quo of the current system. As they attack this new wave of education, tuition costs of traditional universities continue to rise, denying countless people the opportunity of furthering their education and career potential. Apparently, spending upwards of one hundred thousand dollars is the only way to prove that the education received is worthy of government approval. While these on-line educational programs offer a solid alternative to other post-secondary institutions, they are continuously bombarded and discredited by the education system. It would appear that post-secondary education is crafted for those whose bank accounts warrant it… at least in the eyes of traditional universities.</p>
<p>While these on-line schools are chastised, it is rarely mentioned that the US government does not accredit many other well-known institutions, even though they are well respected worldwide. Cambridge University in England is no more accredited than Almeda University, yet the latter is receiving all the blows. It would seem that the recent influx and popularity of on-line schools has threatened the potential business of traditional schools, so while they claim to be protecting education, they are merely protecting their own business." <a href="http://www.degreeadvice.com/blog.html" class="external free" title="http://www.degreeadvice.com/blog.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.degreeadvice.com/blog.html</a>Xanthebudd 21:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— Xanthebudd (<a href="../../../x/a/n/User_talk%7EXanthebudd_f773.html" title="User talk:Xanthebudd">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xanthebudd_2956.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xanthebudd">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<p>This is a matter of taking an article out of context. The context as written on Wikipedia alludes to the assumption that Almeda knowingly issued a diploma to a dog. The facts in the news article state that the dog's owner completed the application with made-up information and used his dog's name, Wally. The way I had it in my version were accurate according to the article. The "editors" of Wikipedia keep saying that I am not allowed to change it as it is a single use account. But does anyone really care about accuracy here?Veronica678 16:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it makes the point that Almeda make no attempt whatsoever to apply any standards of quality or verification to their degree applicants. If you can get a diploma for your dog, answering the questions truthfully as this guy did, then that shows something fundamentally awry in the institution's quality control. Or that it has none, and is a diploma mill, which seems to be what the majority of external commentators believe. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 16:29, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you kidding? The guy that got the diploma for his dog clearly perjured himself to discredit Almeda. And since he was willing to commit perjury on his Almeda application, what makes you think he was 100 percent honest in the news article? Veronica678 21:36, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know, he didn't commit <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a>; he just lied on the form to Almeda. That's a pretty common technique of investigative reporters. If you search a little, you'll see that he works (or at least worked) for the TV station, so my guess is that he did it at the request of the station reporters. That's why I think he didn't lie further. And both their story and our article are honest about the fact that he lied, so our readers can judge the situation as they see fit. Perhaps some will agree with you; others, like the station reporters, will feel that a little creativity in filling out a form is not quite enough to merit an Associate's degree. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 05:40, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, in every state of the USA, KNOWINGLY providing false information on a college application is perjury. Secondly, the Almeda online application will not allow you to submit it without at least a "significant" amount of data. Thus, there must have been a lot more falsified details than the news writer let on -- perhaps enough to qualify him for the associate degree. Lastly, the simple fact that he was doing an investigation does not make him above the law. Is it okay for a news writer to attempt to carry a gun onto an airplane for the sake of an investigation? Certainly not without the direction of the FBI.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Veronica678 (<a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeronica678_701a.html" title="User talk:Veronica678">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Veronica678_e097.html" title="Special:Contributions/Veronica678">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>People applying to Almeda do need to apply to the University. Not everyone is accepted based on life experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Almeda University has tried to clean up it's image by becoming a more respectable online College/University to gain acceptance like</li>
</ul>

 to the likes of the University of Phoenix and other traditional college and universities.

<li>Any questions, feel free to go to the web site and "talk" to an online representative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spurred by Jeff's challenge to offer balance, I took a look for more reliable source references to Almeda.</p>
<ul>
<li>A story in CityLink about Almeda as basically their textbook example of a degree mill - no campus, no courses, no tests, and you get a degree. The story also discusses Almeda's being driven out of Florida by the local regulators.<a href="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Jeff, I don't see how we're going to be able to introduce the POV you want. Everything I see from any reliable source indicates that Almeda (1) has no campus, (2) teaches no classes, (3) administers no tests, and (4) offers degrees for about $600 based entirely on "life experience." Are you going to insist on the POV tag until someone finds a newspaper article somewhere saying that Almeda is a great school whose degrees are widely accepted by people familiar with the school? If not, what POV are we missing? Thanks, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 18:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, please read the article, if you think it's written in NPOV, just switch the tag to {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnbalanced_cf71.html" title="Template:Unbalanced">unbalanced</a>}}. The page says nothing positive about the institute, even the view of the institute itself in reply to any of the criticisms isn't posted. While it might be easier to provide criticism for an institute such as this, for a better coverage a balanced article is a lot better. It would let an informed person who reads the article to make their judgements by themself instead of reading it and believing that only one side is allowed to voice their opinion (which would lead them to ignoring the article). - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 09:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Our article on Charles Manson doesn't say how kind he was to his mother, either. The reason the article says nothing positive about the place is that, in essence, there <i>is</i> nothing positive which does not emanate from the place itself. It's a diploma mill. There's not much more to be said. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 10:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, I disagree with the analogy about Charles Manson, since the article about him does provide some balance, talking about his personal philosophy and motives for his actions. In this case the article has nothing but criticisms, which is bad, because it gives the appearance of an unbalanced article. Having some kind of retort, even from the institute itself would be better, and would let everyone judge things for themselves. You don't need to lead people by hand to the conclusions by providing one-sided coverage, especially in cases when the conclusion is this obvious (I don't disagree with you about the place itself). - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 12:11, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <i>think</i> that what Jeff is getting at is that we might, as an exercise in "writing for the enemy," create a new first body paragraph that stated Almeda's side of the story, cited to their website -- that Almeda offers degrees based on "life experience" as well as on-line courses in a number of primarily technical areas, and, well, I'm not sure what else would meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidelines for self-published materials in articles about the publisher.

<dd>That doesn't sound unreasonable, but I confess that I'm skeptical that the Almeda College website expresses their view about Almeda College. It's the same question about the people running a <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigeon_drop.html" title="Pigeon drop">pigeon drop</a>: they express a point of view, but are we obliged to believe they hold that view?

<p>There are 6 regional agenicies and you are correct, though only partly correct. Schools can be nationally accredited as well, but Almeda has neither regional or national accreditation, they basically created the agency who accredits them and plenty of other mills.</p>

<p>I have looked at all the discussions for Almeda University and have found that even the recently cited material from the State of Conn. is faulty.</p>
<p>Just because a Board of Governors for a State says it doesn't recognize a school due to licensing issues for that State doesn't mean it's a scam, fake or illegal.</p>
<p>Almeda is a accredite University and they have been trying to shed it's bad image. Someone needs to give this University a break and open the doors to them.</p>
<p>Just because a University isn't of the traditional sense of an actual building and is a virtual school/university doesn't mean that it's not accredited.</p>

<p>I would like to alert editors' attention to the following exchange, which I believe highlights attempts by Almeda University to skew the content of this page by paying freelance writers to remove negative information on a daily basis. I post the exchange here to inform future discussions, but I have no interest in further involvement with this article.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I picked up an ad on a subscribers-only freelancer website entitled 'Wiki Requirements'. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my clients is suffering with a negative Wikipedia review. Attempts to change the Wikipedia write-up have been short lived. Wikipedia does not require facts to print slanderous comments. Their only "burden of proof" is that someone read it in a newspaper somewhere. Looking for an individual that can review and the Wikipedia comments on an ongoing basis. You will need to log in once daily to see if somebody reverted to slanderous comments. If they had, you will change them back to valid / positive comments. I will not ask you to print anything that's not truthful. The pay for this is $2600/year or $50.00 per week and it's ONGOING. This should only take you a few minutes a day. When you are away or unable to make it on any day, you should deduct $7.15 from the weekly total. Payment made through Guru Safe Pay ONLY. You may need the ability to log in with different IP addresses and/or different accounts. Contact me on the PRIVATE message board with any questions you may have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made enquiries about this work and was sent the following private message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am glad you are interested in the project. The company we are talking about is Almeda University. And even though Wikipedia has almost crushed Almeda, you should know that Almeda University is a very well-run and consumer-friendly organization. Almeda has excellent customer service, stands behind its product 100% and offers a no-questions asked refund policy. Almeda University is a university that offers life-experience degree. Unlike â€œdiploma millsâ€ Almeda has clear cut requirements for one to earn that degree. Additionally, people that do not meet the qualification are often asked to write a Thesis or Dissertation to prove their knowledge. Since the Almeda degree is not regionally accredited, Almeda makes it perfectly clear to its potential students that if they are looking for employment in the public sector (taxpayer funded jobs), the Almeda degree will probably not be accepted. Almeda, unlike its competitors, provides nothing but honest information and exemplary customer service. Almeda, unlike its competitors, only wants to issue degrees to those people that can honestly benefit from that degree AND are actually eligible for that degree. First, I am getting another editor to change the Almeda write up to a positive one. Once this is accomplished, what I need from you is to continually (daily) look at and update (if needed) the Wikipedia Almeda University review. Almeda does not deserve to be crushed like that by the educational traditionalists that think they are holier than God! For this, I will pay you $50/week ON-GOING. You should know that I am also going to bring in another reviewer (or two) to do the same -- that is, once a day review the site and make sure it stays positive! It's so easy to flip it back and forth that the more eyes I have on it the better the chance will be that it stays positive. You will find a lot of negative information about Almeda. Most of it is addressed on the attached. Please read when you can. But know that these negative statements are all beating down on the same issue. ALMEDA DEGREES ARE NOT FOR EVERYBODY AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR TAXPAYER FUNDED EMPLOYMENT IN CERTAIN STATES. Almeda FULLY discloses this to prospective applicants. One line is all that is needed on this subject! Please let me know if you are willing to take on this task. Thank you! - Richard</p>

<p>I replied to the message, saying that I was not willing to undertake the work on these terms as Almeda struck me as a dishonest organisation.

<dd>Several years ago I was bombarded with adds for a diploma mill out of Detroit; I forwarded the information to Gordon Gee, the president of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

The emails soon stopped.</dd>

That last statement that nothing can replace the kind of education found in a classroom is pure and utter nonsense! In fact, while one does learn alot of theoretical knowledge in the class room, the proof of knowledge acquisition is in the application. In other words, you can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk? So what you are saying is that some one who has studied auto mechanics for four years is more able and knowledgeable then someone who has been wrenching on cars all of his life? Bullshit!!

<dd>Actually, your absolutely right Anonymous person.

<p>Actually, your absolutely wrong Kinslayer. I'm not talking about someone saying "I've worked on them all my life" I'm saying someone who has the life experience and can actually do the job. If I worked for general motors or Nascar for ten years, I am going to be more knowledgeable than someone who just learned about automotive theory in a classroom. I am not taking away from classroom knowledge, but at the same time I think it is unfair, and criminal, to de-value peoples life experience. I never went to driving school, I just got in my fathers car and did it until I could do it. I then went and took the driving test and got my license, so at the end of the day, what's the difference?</p>

<p>In relation to the status of Almeda degrees in Florida and "Other states" the article now simply says that they are illegal. This is misleading.

<p>This is totally unfair to portray this school in such a poor light. Just because it is not accredited by the usual accrediting bodies does not mean the school is not accredited. It clearly states what bodies it is accredited by, whether they meet the authors approval or not, and this article should say as much. the accredidation issue was recently correected, and someone came back and re-wrote this smear campaign against the school, What does the author have against the school?

<p>I was asked to review this article by an editor expressing concern that it violated NPOV, in being too critical of the group. I conclude that, if anything, the article is not quite critical enough. Almeda is deserving of no respect. The article is well-cited, but I wonder if it meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 18:05, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>And your basis for saying the article is 'not critical enough' and that 'Almeda is deserving of no respect' is what exactly? That would not seem entirely fair, given the fact that several positive views of Almeda University have been cited in this discussion page - from well respected sources - but none have as yet found their way into the main article. I think until that happens it is difficult to say this is a fair representation of Almeda University. I wish I had the time to do it because I just hate this hatchet job. jay 18:41, 17 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— Jay impulse (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jay_impulse_b830.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jay impulse">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd>I think you'll find the main reason they haven't found their way into the article is because the article has been locked to all editors following the emergence of evidence that Almeda is attmepting to pay people to edit the article round to how they think it should read. And Micahel, I feel notability is possibly acieved through the fact that Almeda is one of only a couple of companies that are attempting to bypass <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> by <s>bribing</s> paying 'independent' editors to edit the article on their behalf. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 18:53, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Not quite: there have been numerous prior attempts to - ahem - <i>balance</i> it, but they have fallen a bit short of the usual standards. For example, this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Almeda_University&amp;diff=110737091&amp;oldid=103798484" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Almeda_University&amp;diff=110737091&amp;oldid=103798484" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, which removes a few inconvenient but provable facts (well, most of them actually), and replaces them with the claim that it <i>is</i> accredited - by a body with no recognition or status. Not that this is pointed out, you understand.

<p>I know the article itself is locked but I was referring to the fact that people could suggest article changes in the discussion section (I think). These could then be considerd for inclusion in the main article, such as information from the links put up by some contributors above. Of course, if none of this information finds its way into the main article then we will know that Wikipedia is indeed not an impartial encyclopaedia on this subject.jay 19:15, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article has been locked until such time as it is deemed safe for it to be unlcked to be edited again. Admins not making additions is probably the best thing to do.

<p>As stated in the protection rules: 'protection is not an endorsement of the current version'. That said, I think the current article is a reasonable compromise, if Almeda meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. If Almeda is paying people to make edits to the article to try and make itself look good, it is guilty of running a scam. This does not necessarily make it notable: we don't have articles on every spammer and con artist. I'll need to think about this further. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 20:20, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>NPOV in the case of this "university" is best served by preventing those who it is paying to come here and whitewash the article, from doing so. I have reduced to semiprotection for now, let's watch and see, but if anyone is thinking of substituting "non-traditional" for unaccredited as we've seen elsewhere, the time to forget it is <i>right now</i>. Please be in no doubt: we block people who whitwash problematic unaccredited schools. We have done this before. Almeda is not the first <s>diploma mill</s> unaccredited "university" to seek to polish up its image through Wikipedia. Yes, the fact that the world's highest-profile online reference points out that it has no accreditation and no discernible standards is going to make it hard to sell as a going concern. Might even undermine the value. Do we care? Not hardly. If you can find rock-solid independent secondary sources with praise for the place, feel free to add them, but the criticism is verifiable and self-evidently significant, and that's that. I got my degree the hard way - you can tell, can't you? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:22, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>So did I - plus my Masters degree - but I'm not precious about that and I still don't think that traditional universities hold all he answers for everyone. Many skills we'd be in a sorry state without go unaccredited by universities.
