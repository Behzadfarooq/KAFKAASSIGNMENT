<p>There are acronyms used at Wiki that I was unfamiliar with before I arrived here.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>COTW</b> = <i>Collaboration of the Week</i>
<ul>

<li>I saw some place that we are only supposed to vote on up to three of these ... I not know if at a time, or each week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>POV</b> = <i>Point of View</i> (unwelcome at Wiki)
<ul>
<li><b>NPOV</b> = <i>Neutral Point of View</i> (Wiki policy)</li>
<li><b>PC</b> = <i>Politically Correct</i> is related to being nice, provided we do not compromise the truth.</li>
<li>NPOV vs. PC understand different
<ul>
<li>If we cannot imagine anyone who might disagree with the truth of some statement, then it is NPOV.</li>
<li>If someone disagrees, then it is either POV or they are wrong about the facts.</li>
<li>If people agree with the facts, but are offended by the presentation, or disagree with adjectives used, like "severe", then that is more of a PC issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>RFC</b> = <i>Requests for Comment</i></li>

<p>Great advice copied from <b>Notes</b> section of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComputer_security_audit_7e10.html" title="Talk:Computer security audit">Talk:Computer security audit</a> so that links to places for <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> to study are better grouped together,</p>

<dd>Also <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles</a>, starting with Lead section, suggested by <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">User:Fenice</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Keep up the good work, get rid of all the lists and the article should be all right. I strongly suggest you read <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_layout_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to layout">Wikipedia:Guide to layout</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page</a>, if you haven't already—they're very insightful, as are the other articles in the style book.</dd>
<dd>Be aware that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an FAQ</a>. Don't refer to the reader or yourelf directly; sentences like <i>Company-A has personal information on you and me.</i> are considered bad style. The article shouldn't be a how-to: <i>Go to Steve Gibson Research site, scroll down to Shields Up, run tests</i> are improper. A better version would be something like <i>Software to detect vulnerabilities is available from organisations such as <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibson_Research_Corporation_064a.html" title="Gibson Research Corporation">Gibson Research Corporation</a></i>, and arguably anything more detailed in a how-to way might not be proper here on WP. Avoid (though not at all costs) external links inside the main article body, the proper place is in its own section the end of the article. Try to give more than one alternative if there is one.</dd>
<dd>Last but not least, of course the article does not have to be perfect. Others will improve on what you write, especially if you make a decent start. Once you get rid of
<ul>
<li>all
<ul>
<li>the freaking
<ul>
<li>lists</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'll try editing it, too.&#160;;) Note that I'm a newbie, too. Cheers. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoritz_f530.html" title="User:Moritz">Moritz</a> 7 July 2005 21:33 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recognize that many concepts involve controversy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am from Scotland ...
<ul>
<li>you want to know something about the Loch Ness Monster?</li>
<li>It has been said that when a person travels from Scotland to another nation, that the average intelligence of the people of both nations increases.</li>
<li>How is that possible?</li>
<li>Joke: Travel broadens the mind.</li>
<li>Nowadays, most travel is on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do not believe in UFOs

<li>However, I participated in game design in which we decided that UFOs would be the vehicles used by people traveling in time, not backwards and forwards in history, but across parallel time dimensions from other realities in our multiverse</li>
<li>As fantastic as that Science Fiction concept might seem to some people, I find the notion of UFOs, if they really do exist, as being time traveling vehicles as much more believeable than being space traveler vehicles. That would explain a lot of the mystery of them being able to elude our efforts to make contact with the occupants.</li>

<p>I do not expect to learn 100% of Wiki skills then apply them. I think of this like computer programming. I learn some of what can be done, I do it. I produce useful output based on my partial know how, then as I gain experience, I add to my total sum of know-how.</p>
<p>I read some documentation ... how do you do that ... I get reasonably good at doing some process, then I read some more documentaiton on how to make my input more sophisticated with more features, then with practice get good at that, then read some more on self-improvement, and hopefully what I produce along the way is in fact of value to the community. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 28 June 2005 20:04 (UTC)</p>

<p>Stuff I know I need to learn</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit History ... how do I access that?
<ul>
<li>one reason has to do with multiple people editing something concurrently and I want to make sure nothing accidentally deleted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default rules
<ul>
<li>e.g. on the Current changes page, I want it to hide minor edits by default</li>
<li>there may be other stuff like that which is desirable</li>
<li>Very top of page <b>preferences</b> now being explored by me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where I have a sub-topic that has exploded in size and my interest, how do I move it to some other page just for that interest area?
<ul>
<li>My user-id then / or \ (?) then title of that topic.
<ul>
<li>User talk:AlMac/New Topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Cut &amp; paste title of the article that needs to export whatever
<ol>
<li>edit where link needed
<ol>
<li>put slash at end then whatever the new topic is</li>
<li>put brackets on it</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>save my work</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Now I have link to new article space where something might be moved</li>
<li>After move there, delete where it came from, except for suitable linkage</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I think that creates the copy, then do I cut &amp; paste, or how use MOVE&#160;???
<ul>

<li>This is for the WHOLE PAGE in which the old one is redirected to the new one ... I might only want to move a section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other reasons to move a page:
<ul>
<li>Original article misspelled or inappropriate upper lower case.</li>
<li>Scope of content has evolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Achieving a level of Neutrality that is acceptable to this community
<ul>
<li>Security breaches may be a particularly challenging topic, but if I can learn good enough Neutrality of Points of View there, I should be able to handle most any topic.</li>

<li>The way I operate, I am constantly starting some effort, getting part way done, then becoming somewhat distracted, with many loose ends to pursue.</li>
<li>In the short term, I remember that I had started on Security breaches
<ul>
<li>had LOTS more I plan to add to that section and related topics</li>
<li>Then someone added a warning to me that my point of view was not sufficiently neutral
<ul>
<li>I went to links provided ... lots of stuff to study there, but I get some of the gist of it</li>
<li>I start to re-write some sections to try to fix the problem &amp; LOTS more to do there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I figure out how to locate the someone who added the warning (<b>MacGyverMagic</b>) &amp; get to his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MacGyverMagic" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MacGyverMagic" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and add a comment acknowleging his input
<ul>
<li>while I am there, I see
<ul>
<li>a bunch of other people with questions that do not appear to have been answered,
<ul>
<li>for which I insert my efforts to help those people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and statements that I want to expand on,
<ul>
<li>and in some cases do so</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>so now I have a growing # of people where I posted something, and would like to know when there is any response to what I inserted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After my first input, I saw that it gave my PC internet address &amp; I did not like that, so I became a regular user, and I added a wee bit to new user
<ul>
<li>When I was in new user, I saw stuff from other new users saying things that I was tempted to comment on, and I would hope to revisit later to see if more give and take there worth pursing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then Bob added the welcome with lots of places I plan to visit over time</li>
</ul>
<p>As my involvement continues, there is great risk I am not going to remember all the places where I had started something, that perhaps needs continuation.</p>

<li>I knew about it because there are entries on my parents, math professors, and I had stumbled across it several prior times with various research.

<li>If I do a similar page on myself, I recognize that I should limit it to the stuff that I have done that is truely unique in the world, such as <b>Operation Contact</b> in the Simulation Gaming hobby</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>David Gibbs</b> started a Wiki for AS/400 iSeries interests <a href="http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and I started posting there what I knew but my interests include a great deal of computer security stuff that does not really apply to the IBM world, and I wanted to share my computer know-how, and while I have tried blogging, I am not really happy with the concept of many people talking, while security issues are not really being solved in the world as rapidly as I would like to see.</li>

<p>I would be happy to.</p>
<p>Feel free to copy stuff that I posted earlier to your page and to MgM to the new place.</p>
<p>However notice that I am a relative newbie here ... my first attempt at my own article Security breaches immediately got into trouble because I have a Point of View that may be objectionable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screw-ups are embarrassing</li>
<li>Screw ups in public are a PR disaster</li>
<li>Screw ups in handling screw ups in public can lead to a company almost going out of business.</li>
<li>Entirely too many people seem to take the attitude that poor performance is acceptable.</li>
<li>It is Ok to have a bunch of people killed on the pbulic highways all the time.</li>
<li>Accidents happen, so don't sweat the occasional plane crash.</li>
<li>Accidents happen, so don't sweat occasional rashes of food poisoning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I acknowlege that mistakes can happen, and feel that we all should strive to help them become an exception to the rule. But my POV attitude can perhaps spill over to my efforts to write articles such that I appear to be unsympathetic to entities that have seriously screwed up.</p>

<p>I am still stumbling around Wiki, without big picture. I saw this project <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Punctuation" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Punctuation" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and thought that the people in the two projects might like to know about each other due to similarity of interests.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are ideas discussed in the Standards project that would be useful to these others.</p>
<ol>
<li>Addition to Toolbox
<ol>
<li>I just edited this page, please check it for common typing errors.</li>
<li>I am working on editing this page. I want to see what it looks like through the eyes of common Browsers out there, other than the one I am using.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps there are techniques used by the Punctuation project that could help with the Standards project. Consider the notion that the Punctuation project finds out about problems via:</p>
<ol>
<li>software crawling offline dumps
<ol>
<li>perhaps the kind of software used by Search engines to do updates might be better, because then you would have linkage
<ol>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
<li>Here is link to the problem.</li>
<li>Date and time stamp of discovery, because the page may have changed by the time someone tries to fix it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grammar checking software exists, presumably in many languages.
<ol>
<li>Suggested fix text could be given.</li>
<li>Some of this kind of software can be flawed or not up to human standards.</li>
<li>Human would have choice of cut &amp; paste, or work on what the software did not do good job with.</li>
<li>There might also be bug report if the software consistently falls short of the mark in some obvious way.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Other projects might use similar software to identify which pages have the problems that those projects seek to fix.
<ol>
<li>spelling and grammar</li>
<li>Wiki Syntax <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wiki_Syntax" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wiki_Syntax" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>

<p>Well, it's no big deal, but using the singular form of the word is standard when choosing a title and you should start the article with a clear definition of what a security breach is (even though it may be obvious to you).

<dd>I do have to move my browser window marginally sideways to see everything, which is not a problem, but if you ever intend to add more stuff sideways, you might be able to adjust the column headers to use two vertical lines of text so that the column width is not made excess by the titles.

<p>After you added the flags, and made other adjustments, related to my suggestions, the other text now flowed around the left side of the chart.

<p>Thanks, some of the stuff I added to several articles was because I was looking at that article and thinking some stuff was missing that perhaps belongs in a separate article, but I still feeling damaged by several failed attempts to fix my Security breaches startup, so for the moment I suggesting ideas and making small additions, then letting more experienced Wikipeans either do moves to new articles, or approve my suggestions.</p>

<p>Some of my posts were minor thoughts, to me anyway, or to point out correlations between things. Prolonged involvement in much of the above means I will need to pick and choose which to continue, and which to back away from.</p>

<p>First of all, don't panic. This has happened before, the article is scrutinized and can survive if you follow their suggestions for improvement. I moved it to suit the naming conventions and copyedited the lead section. It is a legitimate topic; the only thing I worry about i that it may be redundant with <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a>?<br />
The text needs to be in prose, not list form. It should have references, and footnotes, so people know where the information is from. The text should inform people about these audits, not try to convince them that they are necessary.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 7 July 2005 19:25 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks again. I saw the Votes for Deletion as I was getting ready to leave for the office, and I should be on the road right now. I also see that this kind of process takes 5 days, so I figure I have part of the weekend, depending on what happens at my office (see roller coaster ride explained above).</p>
<p>I studied the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> article before I started <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Security_Audits_f880.html" title="Computer Security Audits">Computer Security Audits</a>. My conclusion was that <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> is rather dated. It describes a reality of large comapnies, like those traded on the stock market, that can afford to have a team of humans from some audit firm, perform certain tasks. Most small businesses, which are most enterprises period, cannot afford this, and certainly not home users.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> is a valid topic, of great interest to many enterprises, but while the work they do is more intensive than what I am writing about, their market share is microscopic compared to my focus. I think perhaps I should try to explain that, like the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">Computer security</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_insecurity.html" title="Computer insecurity">Computer insecurity</a> articles point at each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">Computer security</a> article focuses on Design for Good Security in the first place, which most computer vendors should do, but far too many do not.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_insecurity.html" title="Computer insecurity">Computer insecurity</a> article focuses on victims in the "Oh Hell, what a mess we are in, how do we get out of this?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly (except I need to clean up the language)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditing_information_security.html" title="Auditing information security">Auditing information security</a> article focuses on what the giants of industry do to identify security issues in need of remediation.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Security_Audits_f880.html" title="Computer Security Audits">Computer Security Audits</a> (which may need a slightly different title) article focuses on what the little guy, and small business can do, to identify security issues that are easily repaired.</li>

<p><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks</a> is a sister project to Wikipedia. Like all <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikimedia projects</a>, it is distinct in the type of information that it contains. Whereas Wikipedia seeks to compile encyclopedic content, Wikibooks can best be described as compiling didactic content, that is, content that is mean for learning. This has some small overlap with Wikipedia, but also includes "how to's", applied or otherwise esoteric information. For more information about whether Wikibooks is right for your project, try reading <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Why_use_open_textbooks%3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Why_use_open_textbooks%3F" rel="nofollow">these guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for noting your concern about citing issues. I would say that there are two reasons for citing.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are directly referencing or quoting some specific work or material. This type of reference/citation is necessary to avoid plagiarism and copyright isues. Since you are writing almost entirely out of your working knowledge of the subject, this should never be an issue for you.</li>
<li>Any subject you discuss should be verifiable. That is, people should not just have to go on your word alone, but be able to cross check it with other sources. However, you really should not let this get in the way of your posting that information in the first place. If what you say really is true (a reason why you most try to remain factual and neutral), other Wiki users will also be able to confirm what you've written with external references.</li>
</ol>
<p>Really, I don't think this is an issue for you. A user with alot of concrete knowledge in an area and no references is better than a user with no knowledge and alot of references. The latter is very common and will come along to help out soon enough. - <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabioB_77b6.html" title="User:FabioB">FabioB</a> 8 July 2005 19:00 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, you contacted me when someone suggested to you to publish your work as a book on wikibooks. I did not reply earlier because I was too busy. But it is important that you think about this wikibook-project again. Donating single articles on Wikipedia is one thing. But donating an entire book is a totally different scale of value. I would by all means consider mailing the script to at least twenty publishers before you donate your knowledge to wikibooks. If it gets declined, and lots of books are, you can always donate it.

<p>Sorry, I was slightly confused by your message, so I'm not entirely sure what you need help with. It looks like you got your signature working, so that's good. If you want to change the background color of the "Leave me a message" box, go into the code and find the part that says "background-color: lightblue". You can change "lightblue" to any of the colors on <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/colors/article.php/3478961" class="external text" title="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/colors/article.php/3478961" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. (I think the code numbers are supposed to work as well, but I couldn't get it to work in testing- however, you should be able to just use the words, for example by changing "lightblue" to "Darksalmon") I hope this helps, and let me know if you need anything else. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">EWS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 12:31, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
