<p>The <b>Alma Mater Society of Queen's University</b>, otherwise known as the <b>AMS</b>, is the central undergraduate student government at <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_University%2C_Kingston_885e.html" title="Queen's University, Kingston">Queen’s University</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. It is the oldest organization of its kind in Canada. Its roots lie in the old Dialectic Society (now known as the Queen's Debating Union), which created the AMS in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>.</p>
<p>An umbrella organization, the AMS each year hires over 500 student employees and 1000 volunteers, as it works with member faculty societies to offer a wide array of resources, services, support and opportunities to Queen’s students.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Mater_Society_69d2.html" title="Edit section: Day to day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day to day</span></h2>
<p>The day-to-day operations of the AMS are overseen by the AMS Council which includes an annually elected three-person executive (the President, Vice-President (Operations) and Vice-President (University Affairs), selected as a slate), five commissioners who are each responsible for a specific aspect of student life, and three directors who are responsible for overseeing the AMS’ 14 corporate services.</p>
<p><a name="Commissions" id="Commissions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Mater_Society_69d2.html" title="Edit section: Commissions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commissions</span></h3>
<p>The five Commissions fuel student life on campus, they include: Academic Affairs, Social Issues, Internal Affairs, Campus Activities, and Municipal Affairs. Each commission runs many events, programs, and committees.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Academic Affairs Commission (AAC) runs many programs including the "Last Lecture on Earth" series, where popular professors are given free reign to lecture as if it were their last, to packed crowds of students at Alfie's, the campus pub. They also run an academic grievance centre, and are responsible for lobbying the administration and the government, for the betterment of undergraduate academics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Social Issues Commission (SIC) seeks to "represent the diversity of students at Queen's University," through advocacy, awareness raising educational campaigns, and events. As activists for positive social change, they seek to provide students with a greater understanding of social issues and foster an environment in which we may celebrate our differences while being equal as peers. Their approach achieves social justice and serves as an advocate and resource for students wishing to access educational information on social justice initiatives on campus. The Commission is divided into four areas: Human Rights, Education Awareness, Environment, and Publications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Commission of Internal Affairs (CIA) oversees matters concerning AMS Assembly (the highest legislative student body at Queen’s), the AMS Judicial Committee (the student administered non-academic discipline tribunal), elections and referenda, and the administration of nearly 200 AMS-affiliated clubs and extracurricular organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Campus Activities Commission (CAC) is primarily an events-based organization, responsible for organizing all of the special events that make university life so memorable. Being arguably one of the most active commissions, the CAC is responsible for organizing Orientation (Frosh) Week, Queen's Model Parliament, and many other activities on campus. With sixteen different committees, it is a great place to get involved with social activities, volunteer and leadership opportunities at Queen's.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Municipal Affair Commission (MAC) functions as a liaison between Queen's and the wider Kingston community, with the aim of fostering a relationship where both students and community members benefit. The Commission sends hundreds of students volunteers into the community through volunteer programs such as Kaleidoscope and the AMS Volunteer Crew. The MAC also plays a role in the Queen's community by increasing awareness of property standards and the importance of respecting the environment in which we live. In addition, the MAC also represents students needs in the community and works to ensure that students are treated fairly and equitably.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Offices" id="Offices"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Mater_Society_69d2.html" title="Edit section: Offices">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Offices</span></h3>
<p>Each of the five offices provide the operational support that enables the AMS to function.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AMS Development Officer (ADO) acts as a liaison between the Alma Mater Society and the Queen’s University Office of Advancement. In this role the ADO actively pursues opportunities to better engage students with Queen’s alumni. This engagement is typically (but not limited to) industry-specific career advice, and business networking events. In addition to their Advancement responsibilities, the ADO works at establishing new business development opportunities, affinity programs and partnerships for the AMS to pursue with external companies that will deliver better products and services to Queen’s students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Human Resources Officer (HRO) oversees the recruitment, hiring, training, evaluation and appreciation of all 1500 AMS staff and volunteers. With a 100% turnover policy, employee development becomes a key factor in the continued success of the AMS, as does a smooth transition process from year to year. The Human Resources Officer is a source of information on Employee and Volunteer Policy, and the go-to person for questions about interviews, applications, or hiring in the AMS. The HRO, along with the VPUA, the Social Issues Commissioner, and the Information Officer, receives Harassment Advisor training each year and can offer advice, referral or support on any harassment issue inside or outside the AMS.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The AMS Information and Communications Officer (ICO) is responsible for ensuring that the AMS communicates effectively with its constituents, the student body. The ICO oversees the AMS website, puts together the AMS Guide to Queen’s, and oversees all information campaigns that come out of the AMS. The ICO works closely with all of the AMS commissioners, officers and directors to ensure that students are aware of opportunities and initiatives taking place within the AMS, and how they can be a part of what goes on. The ICO also oversees the Campus Research Committee, which conducts public opinion research throughout the year to find out what students think of current issues within the university.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Information Technology Office is tasked with providing Information Technology support to the AMS and its operations. Consisting of the Information Technology Officer (ITO), Web Developer, Application Developer, System Administrator, and Technical Support staff, this office is responsible for the upkeep of MyAMS.org, the development of software for the Society as well as providing technical support to all AMS services, commissions, offices and committees. The IT Office is also responsible for the technical administration of the Queen’s University Optional Student Fees Opt-Out process, and works closely with Internal Affairs on Elections Software development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Student Centre Officer (SCO) is jointly managed by the Alma Mater Society, the Society for Graduate and Professional Students and the John Deutsch University Centre Council, and can assist with any concerns or questions relating to the operation and programming of the student centre. The SCO ensures that the JDUC Council is working with and for students to ensure a vibrant and dynamic student centre by proposing, fostering, developing and overseeing programs and services consistent with the mission and long-term plans of the JDUC. The SCO also oversees the operations and programming of MacGillivary-Brown Hall and club space. The Student Centre Officer can assist with any issue relating to the Queen’s Centre project and the Queen’s Centre Student Working Group.</li>

<p>The AMS’ ultimate authority lies with the AMS Assembly that is comprised of elected representatives from each of the 11 member faculty societies (<a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sciences_4322.html" title="Queen's Faculty of Arts and Sciences">Arts and Science</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Faculty_of_Applied_Science_b79e.html" title="Queen's Faculty of Applied Science">Applied Science</a>, Education, Concurrent Education, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_School_of_Business_818e.html" title="Queen's School of Business">M.B.A.</a>, Commerce, Rehabilitation Therapy, Nursing, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_School_of_Medicine_c0a5.html" title="Queen's School of Medicine">Medicine</a>, Physical and Health Education, and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_School_of_Computing_0b27.html" title="Queen's School of Computing">Computing</a>) and the Residences (Main Campus and West Campus).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Mater_Society_69d2.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The AMS was incorporated in 1969 as a non-profit organization without share capital and thus the Assembly representatives also serve as the voting members of the corporation and annually elect a Board of Directors that oversees the services and financial affairs of the Society. These affairs currently entail an annual operations budget of over $9.5 million.</p>
<p>At its inception, the AMS had represented all students attending Queen’s University. However, that changed in 1981 when the Graduate Students’ Society, an AMS member society formed in 1962, voted by referendum to secede from the AMS. This secession developed out of a conflict around graduate student representation, student services, policy positions and other issues. In the 1990s, the AMS has seen both the Theological Society and the Law Students’ Society depart for membership with the GSS, resulting in its name change to the Society for Graduate and Professional Students. The Law Student Society split with the AMS over a dispute regarding student constables.</p>
<p><a name="Representation" id="Representation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Mater_Society_69d2.html" title="Edit section: Representation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Representation</span></h2>
<p>Currently the AMS represents over 13,500 students, each of whom becomes a member of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">Society</a> upon paying the mandatory student activity fee along with their tuition.</p>
<p>Today, the AMS seeks to remain true to its roots, working diligently on enhancing both the academic and extra-curricular experience of its members while fostering important connections with the surrounding community. The AMS provides the overwhelming majority of the broader learning environment that has become such an essential part of a Queen’s education.</p>
<p>Federally, the AMS is unaffiliated. Provincially, they are a founding member of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Undergraduate_Student_Alliance_36d7.html" title="Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance">Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance</a> and recently rejoined the organization after leaving in the mid-1990s over a scandal involving OUSA's budget and accountability.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Mater_Society_69d2.html" title="Edit section: Employees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Employees</span></h2>
<p>Employing only eight permanent staff, the AMS places full managerial and oversight responsibility in the hands of students. And to ensure these extraordinary leadership opportunities are afforded to as many students as possible, there is a 100% annual turnover with new students appointed to every supervisory position each spring.</p>
