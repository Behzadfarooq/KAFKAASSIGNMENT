<p><b>Alfred Richard "Alf" Gover</b> <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">MBE</a> born (<a href="../../../e/p/s/Epsom.html" title="Epsom">Epsom</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_29.html" title="February 29">February 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> â€“ <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">October 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>) was the mainstay of the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club_c790.html" title="Surrey County Cricket Club">Surrey</a> <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowler_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bowler (cricket)">bowling attack</a> during the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>.</p>
<p>A fast right-hand bowler with a deadly outswinger and a cleverly disguised breakback, Gover began bowling at a young age and was first taken on trial by <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_County_Cricket_Club_5f65.html" title="Essex County Cricket Club">Essex</a> in July 1926. He bowled <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Douglas_d469.html" title="Johnny Douglas">Johnny Douglas</a> at the nets several times and travelled with Essex as twelfth man to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oval_7c8c.html" title="The Oval">The Oval</a> in 1927. A chance conversation with <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Strudwick_cf60.html" title="Herbert Strudwick">Herbert Strudwick</a>, the great Surrey wicket-keeper, led Gover to changing county because he thought his prospects would be brighter with Surrey.</p>
<p>Gover played his first county match against <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_County_Cricket_Club_322a.html" title="Sussex County Cricket Club">Sussex</a> in June 1928, but did not establish himself permanently until 1930. With <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Brown_%28cricketer%29_2920.html" title="Freddie Brown (cricketer)">Freddie Brown</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Fender_2a01.html" title="Percy Fender">Percy Fender</a> and Maurice Allom available up to 1932, Gover did not play a major role, but with Brown and Allom moving into business Gover was called upon to bear a much heavier burden in the dry summer of 1933 and responded with 98 County Championship wickets. His advance was the result of curbing a tendency to overstep the crease, but his cumbersome action was still criticised even as his strong build of 188 <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimetres.html" title="Centimetres">cm</a> (6 feet 2 inches) and 87 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kg</a> (13 stone 10 pounds), combined with vast capacity for work on the placid, billiard-table Oval wickets had him in contention for a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test</a> place against such candidates as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bowes_d692.html" title="Bill Bowes">Bowes</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Farnes_2ea3.html" title="Ken Farnes">Farnes</a>, "Nobby" Clark and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Copson_1535.html" title="Bill Copson">Copson</a>.</p>
<p>In 1935 Gover's progress was stalled by him shortening his run to conserve his energy, but when allowed his full run in 1936 Gover went from strength to strength. He took 54 wickets in May mostly on the placid Oval pitches, and carried on so well that he took 171 County Championship wickets for 15.42 each even when many pitches were too wet for him. He played for England against India at <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Trafford_%28cricket%29_1f77.html" title="Old Trafford (cricket)">Old Trafford</a> but the wicket was so good that even his energetic delivery could produce no venom. The following year Gover did equally well, again taking 201 wickets but seemingly proving himself not quite fast enough to be dangerous against the best batsmen.</p>
<p>Injury on a winter tour of India ended Gover's run of success: in 1938, apart from a week in late May and early June when he achieved his best figures of 14 for 85 against Worcestershire, Gover was clearly unfit (despite periods of rest) and had so little venom his haul of wickets fell from 201 to just 86. Though he recovered somewhat in 1939 with increased fitness, it was already evident Gover would struggle to regain the speed and venom of his two great years. However, when county cricket resumed after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1946 Gover, at 38, bowled so well under exceedingly unfavourable conditions that he played in the Third Test against India. With his strong physique it was surprising he was not chosen for either the 1936/1937 or 1946/1947 <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashes_series.html" title="Ashes series">Ashes tours</a>. Though he soon decided 1947 would be his last year in county cricket, Gover was still often regarded as the best fast bowler in England (though now not by <i>any</i> means genuinely fast) and many wished for him to be selected for the last Test when Harold Butler withdrew and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Bedser_f718.html" title="Alec Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> was out of form.</p>
<p>After Gover retired from <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-class_cricket.html" title="First-class cricket">first-class cricket</a> he played a couple of matches in 1948 for <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedfordshire_County_Cricket_Club_5d6c.html" title="Bedfordshire County Cricket Club">Bedfordshire</a> in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Counties_bf85.html" title="Minor Counties">Minor Counties</a> competition, taking 25 wickets at just over nine runs each. But after that he devoted his life to his cricket school in <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandsworth.html" title="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a>. He established this school in 1938 and had already trained a number of future Test players by the time of his last match for Surrey. However, in the following decades Gover gradually developed his school to such an extent that it became regarded as the most valuable school for the fine-tuning of cricketers' skills. His school, redeveloped from its humble origins as an industrial shed, was where many Test or potential Test players developed the necessary skill to rise to the highest levels in cricket. <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viv_Richards_6d95.html" title="Viv Richards">Viv Richards</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Roberts_cfa8.html" title="Andy Roberts">Andy Roberts</a> and <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Bishop_04d3.html" title="Ian Bishop">Ian Bishop</a> are some notable examples of players who benefitted from Gover's coaching. It was primarily for his work in cricket coaching, rather than his deeds for Surrey in the 1930s and 1940s, that Gover was awarded an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">MBE</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>
<p>Gover continued to be principal at his school until 1989, and he wrote widely on cricket right up to his death at the age of 93 in 2001. At the time of his death Gover was the oldest surviving Test cricketer, and his death left <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Appleyard_1da3.html" title="Bob Appleyard">Bob Appleyard</a> as the only living bowler who had ever taken 200 wickets in an English season.</p>
<p>He was President of Surrey for 1980.</p>
