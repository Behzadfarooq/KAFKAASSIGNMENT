<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Taylor_Howard_19d1.html" title="Edit section: Birth and Family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Birth and Family</span></h2>
<p>Alfred was born in the rural community of Pleasant Valley, <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prairie_Ronde_Township%2C_Michigan_b64f.html" title="Prairie Ronde Township, Michigan">Prairie Ronde Township</a>, near the town of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schoolcraft%2C_Michigan_8566.html" title="Schoolcraft, Michigan">Schoolcraft</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalamazoo_County%2C_Michigan_4e3d.html" title="Kalamazoo County, Michigan">Kalamazoo County, Michigan</a>. His is the story of a farm boy who responded to the call of the far horizon to become a world citizen and a Christian witness to the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
<p>The Pleasant Valley neighborhood, though a tiny dot on the map, was infact singularly cosmopolitan. Early settlers had come from many eastern States, and some directly from <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. This diversity may have placed in this boy's mind the idea of the bigness of the world.</p>
<p>Alfred was the son of Cornelius Howard, who was born in Michigan in 1841. His mother was Harriett Guilford. Alfred's paternal grandfather was of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> lineage, arriving in Michigan from <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Plains%2C_New_York_442f.html" title="White Plains, New York">White Plains, New York</a>. His paternal grandmother was Margaret Osterhut of <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a> descent.</p>
<p>Cornelius was deeply involved and powerfully loyal to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. He was a frequent lay member to the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Joseph_1c08.html" title="St. Joseph">St. Joseph</a> Annual Conference, twice to the General Conference, and served for ten years as a Trustee of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otterbein_College_d899.html" title="Otterbein College">Otterbein College</a>. Harriett Howard was likewise devoted, if unobtrusive in her religious expression. As a boy Alfred was uplifted by the sound of his mother's voice raised in prayer as she went about her housework.</p>

<p>Alfred's favorite reading in boyhood was the <i>Youth's Companion,</i> a weekly magazine for young people, filled with hair-raising tales of Indian fights on the frontier. As a man Alfred expressed regret that those exciting stories always assumed the Indians had no rights on the land where they were reared and on which their ancestors had lived for generations.</p>
<p>Alfred attended country school, then the Schoolcraft <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_School_87a1.html" title="High School">High School</a>, four miles from his home. His favorite high school subject was <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_geography.html" title="Physical geography">physical geography</a>. He also enjoyed <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiology.html" title="Physiology">physiology</a>, which prompted in him for many years the desire to study <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a>. At the age of eighteen he taught school one year in his neighborhood. The next year he taught near <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davenport%2C_Nebraska_933c.html" title="Davenport, Nebraska">Davenport, Nebraska</a>.</p>
<p>Young Alfred was often encouraged to attend college. One of his encouragers was his pastor, the Rev. J.L. Parks. Thus, it was decided that Alfred should attend Roanoke Classical Seminary in Indiana. The Principal was Professor D.N. Howe, a graduate of Otterbein and of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Biblical_Seminary_366e.html" title="Union Biblical Seminary">Union Biblical Seminary</a> in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton%2C_Ohio_88d9.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a> (now <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Theological_Seminary_5588.html" title="United Theological Seminary">United Theological Seminary</a>). Alfred enjoyed these college preparatory studies under Professor Howe. After this one year, however, because the Roanoke Seminary moved to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Manchester%2C_Indiana_ac4e.html" title="North Manchester, Indiana">North Manchester, Indiana</a>, Alfred decided to attend Otterbein in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westerville%2C_Ohio_f0e6.html" title="Westerville, Ohio">Westerville, Ohio</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Taylor_Howard_19d1.html" title="Edit section: College">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College</span></h2>
<p>The autumn of 1889 found Alfred Howard, at the age of twenty-one, enrolled in the academy of Otterbein College. One year later he matriculated to the college itself. His days at Otterbein were happy ones, and he never tired in later years of relating his college memories. Alfred was an earnest student, with a mind thirsty for truth, a characteristic he retained the rest of his life. Nevertheless, bad eyesight severely handicapped him, and he had great difficulty getting glasses which fit properly.</p>
<p>Heredity and an active farm upbringing gave Alred a powerful physique. In college he played <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity.html" title="Varsity">varsity</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a>, alternating between center and guard. Frequently he was pivot man in the famous "<a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_wedge.html" title="Flying wedge">flying wedge</a>."</p>

<p>Alfred sang first tenor in the Otterbein Quartet, the first of a series of such organizations in the history of the college. One one occasion the quartet sang at the church of W.W. Williamson, who had a son John. The latter was fascinated by the singing collegians and vowed to also some day go to Otterbein and sing in the quartet. In due time <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Finley_Williamson_c265.html" title="John Finley Williamson">John Finley Williamson</a> did both, and much more than that. He continued his musical interests after graduation, organizing a choir and a choir school: founding the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Choir_College_2fb0.html" title="Westminster Choir College">Westminster Choir College</a> in Dayton, Ohio, (presently in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton%2C_New_Jersey_b719.html" title="Princeton, New Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>), which became world famous.</p>
<p>One year Alfred directed the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian_Church_e7a2.html" title="Presbyterian Church">Presbyterian Church</a> choir in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion%2C_Ohio_607b.html" title="Marion, Ohio">Marion, Ohio</a>, traveling from Otterbein each weekend. The pastor was a Rev. Mr. Thomas, whose young son Norman became well acquainted with Alfred. Later <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Thomas_e28c.html" title="Norman Thomas">Norman Thomas</a> also became a Presbyterian minister, but is better known as the frequent candidate for <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> on the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">Socialist</a> ticket.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Men%27s_Christian_Association_82ab.html" title="Young Men's Christian Association">Young Men's Christian Association</a> on the Otterbein campus made a rich contribution to Alfred Howard's life. S.D. Gordon was state secretary of college Y.M.C.A. work in Ohio at that time, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_R._Mott_35ee.html" title="John R. Mott">John R. Mott</a> and Robert E. Speer, young men just out of Cornell and Princeton, respectively, were frequent speakers at Y.M.C.A. conferences.</p>
<p>In 1890 at one such conference John R. Mott made an address which engraved three unforgotten sentences on young Howard's mind:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hide the Word of God in your Heart (<a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> Study)</dd>
<dd>Tie yourself to one man (personal <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelism.html" title="Evangelism">evangelism</a>)</dd>
<dd>Keep your eyes fixed on the uttermost part of the earth (foreign <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missions.html" title="Missions">missions</a>).</dd>

<p>One summer Alfred even attended the famous college Y.M.C.A. conference at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northfield%2C_Massachusetts_1246.html" title="Northfield, Massachusetts">Northfield, Massachusetts</a>.</p>

<p>Howard met May Day Stevenson at Otterbein. They conducted their courtship on the campus, but he proposed to her one summer by letter.</p>
<p>Alfred and May were married on their graduation day: 15 June 1894, in the home of Professor Henry Garst, who performed the ceremony in the presence of many college friends. Soon thereafter the happy couple were on the high seas sailing for the mission field in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>.</p>

<p>Alfred Taylor Howard was deeply religious. He believed profoundly in the efficacy of prayer. As a boy he had formed the habit of prayer, and as a college student prayed regularly. In later life, while taking long walks, he would pray for long lists of persons and causes, setting aside certain days of the week for various portions of his long prayer lists.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his college days, Alfred wondered about what his life-work should be. So he made this a matter for prayer. During the summer before his senior year, while working on his father's farm, he chose a certain empty stall in the barn as his "quiet place" for daily intercession. Later he wrote, <i>"I do not know when in my life I ever prayed more earnestly for definite guidance."</i></p>
<p>In his handwritten memoirs, found after his death, he tells of the outcome of his prayer:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"One day early in August, Dr. William M. Bell, an old friend of father's, was to speak at a county <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_school.html" title="Sunday school">Sunday-school</a> convention in <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalamazoo.html" title="Kalamazoo">Kalamazoo</a>. Doctor Bell had been elected general secretary of the Home, Frontier and Foreign Missionary Society of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Brethren_Church_7e0e.html" title="United Brethren Church">United Brethren Church</a>. My brother Roy and I drove to Kalamazoo to hear him. We saw him for just a few minutes before his address to the convention. He said he wished to see me after the meeting. Accordingly at the close of the program he came through the crowd toward me, and to my surprise, stated,</i> "Howard, we want you to go to Africa."</dd>
