<p>Does this article seem unwieldy to anyone else? The section on "Other Transmissions" is long, not very informative, and hard to read. I think it should be reformatted at the least if not removed entirely. The other section which seems way long and uninformative is the trivia section. Not every fact that someone feels is interesting about the show should be listed. I think that perhaps we could condense the list to ten factoids so that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> doesn't become a series of laundry lists. (Moving Alf's cameo's in other shows to it's own section should help for a start.) Once the article is easier to read, then we can add more information that seems to be lacking. For example, I think there should be more information on Melmac, Alf's Girlfriend Rhonda, and a more complete summary of the final episode. --<a href="../../../i/n/_/User%7EIn_Defense_of_the_Artist_9bc2.html" title="User:In Defense of the Artist">In Defense of the Artist</a> 03:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dd>
<dd>Okay, last question...the above sentence seems unclear. Were Martin Sheen, Ed Begley Jr, and Ray Walston ever on the original series. It seems uninformative to say that the move "did star other actors" since if the original cast wasn't in the movie it would 'have' to star other actors. If the actors are not significant to the series, it doesn't seem that they need to be mentioned here. If the actors are significant, it should be mentioned 'why'. --<a href="../../../i/n/_/User%7EIn_Defense_of_the_Artist_9bc2.html" title="User:In Defense of the Artist">In Defense of the Artist</a> 03:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

</blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since I've seen this show, but I thought the hair dryer bit was just a sarcastic jab at the destruction of the planet. That is, when Alf was asked about how it happened, he bitterly replied that everyone plugged in their hair dryers, but he wasn't being serious. The real reason was, of course, the nuclear catastrophe, with the implication being that it could happen to us if we aren't careful. <a href="../../../c/m/y/User%7ECMYK_d8f2.html" title="User:CMYK">CMYK</a> 22:58, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why should it be considered sarcasm? Why do you say it was "of course" a nuclear catastrophe much like one that is impending on our planet. Melmac was a planet where cat was a delecacy and lint was worth more than gold. Besides...I seem to remember Alf frequently doing his hair with a hair dryer, isn't that right? --<a href="../../../i/n/_/User%7EIn_Defense_of_the_Artist_9bc2.html" title="User:In Defense of the Artist">In Defense of the Artist</a> 03:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember one episode, probably one of the early ones, where they were talking about a mysterious, trans-Neptunian planet. I don't think it was in reference to Melmac, but it might have been a place where one of ALF's alien friends ended up.</p>
<p>Anyway the father had an A-ha moment and mentioned two recently discovered objects that could possibly be planets. I could have sworn he said "Chronos" and something that sounded like "Sharon" and possibly the planetoid <a href="../../../2/0/6/2060_Chiron_d6a4.html" title="2060 Chiron">2060 Chiron</a> or Pluto's moon <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charon_%28moon%29.html" title="Charon (moon)">Charon (moon)</a>.</p>

<p>I think it should be done only if there is sufficiant information beyond the TV series information to warrant a seperate article.

<p>The note about crispy critters is uncited and all reputable articles I have checked show no mention of Crispy critter being an older ALF puppet. Reputable sources all say that the ALF puppet's creation predates the concept of the show. It was thanks to a very funny television series pitch using the ALF puppet that led to the concept of a series. If supporting evidence for the Crispy critter note cannot be found, it should be removed.--<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottmcmaster_3d00.html" title="User:Scottmcmaster">Scottmcmaster</a> 15:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The actress who played Dorothy, Kate's mom, isn't credited, and Rhonda, his girlfriend, isn't mentioned. He was a member of the Melmac Orbit Guard, thus explaining why he was off-planet during its destruction.</p>
<p>Notable episodes to note: Gilligan's Island parody / funeral for Lucky the cat (season finale?) Dorothy's discovery of Alf while on a drunken binge Cyrano De bergerac parody Finale (needs more detail)</p>
<p>"each episode's name is also the name of a song relevant to the episode's plot": For example??? This very fact probably led the writers to the idea of "<a href="../../../h/e/l/Help_Me%2C_Rhonda_7240.html" title="Help Me, Rhonda">Help Me, Rhonda</a>" accidentally played on a loop instead of his ship's distress call leading his girlfriend to Earth. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueNight_546f.html" title="User:BlueNight">BlueNight</a> 06:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't this be at <a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_%28television%29_a06b.html" title="ALF (television)">ALF (television)</a> or something instead of Alf&#160;?</p>

<li>Yes, it should. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 07:55, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is it just me or is the episode guide link a dead angelfire page? My internet has been a bit touchy today, so I don't want to delete a valid link. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobludwig_2554.html" title="User:Robludwig">Robludwig</a></p>

<p>There is some vandalism toward the end of the trivia section. It doesn't appear to be easily editable.</p>
