<p>Perhaps the most significant thing Whitehead did was to formulate a new cosmology fit for the modern world. Having realized that quantum mechanics had knocked the bottom out of the nineteenth century sciences and their philosophy of "matter is the basis of all things", Whitehead proposed a more comprehensive philosophy of process, or organismic philosophy. This he wrote about in his magnum opus <i>Process and Reality</i> which is sub-titled <i>An Essay in Cosmology</i>. However, Whiteheadians these days are mostly theologians and uninterested in cosmology, so his four-phase universal pattern of process - which would introduce a structured holism to "life, the universe and everything", and a cosmology fit for disciplines from astro-physics to zoology - is very largely ignored today. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.61.189.104 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.61.189.104_fa0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.61.189.104">contribs</a>) 18:53, July 2, 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>The preceding paragraph seems caught in a semantic snare. "Cosmology" means different things in physics and in metaphysics. Whitehead tried his hand at both meanings of the word. His theory rivaling general relativity is a failure, but his <i>Process and Reality</i> rightly lives on.132.181.160.42 07:58, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(moved from <a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcairns_501c.html" title="User talk:Icairns">User talk:Icairns</a>:</p>
<p>You changed Whitehead's category from "mathematicians" to "British mathematicians." This also brought to my attention that he's classified on Wikipedia as a "British philosopher." We should consider removing the word "British" from both. Or, we should consider using the word "English."</p>
<p>In other encyclopedias and dictionaries, he's referred to by sometimes using "British" and sometimes "English." Many times both words are absent and he's simply referred to as "a philosopher." In order to understand why, you must know the development of his thought and career, and know about British philosophy, analytical philosophy, continental philosophy, and American philosophy. (Maybe you already know this?) This is because, as you probably know, British philosophers usually engage in analytical philosophy. Analytical philosophy is opposed to the type of philosophy that Whitehead engaged in (he did Process philosophy, and in a sense Continental philosophy, and American philosophy prior to the American's being influenced by the analysis of Britain). So calling Whitehead a specifically "British philosopher" is somewhat of a misnomer, even if he was born in Kent.</p>
<p>In terms of his philosophy career, it started near his retirement age, in the United States, where Harvard offered him a position teaching philosophy when he was about 60 years old. Before this, he didn't engage much in "philosophy proper." Whitehead is certainly referred to as "British" in the sense of his mathematical/logical work with Russell in the early part of the 20th century in England, but referring to him in this way today is a bit off-key. He wrote his philosophical works later, when he was in the States, and about 65 to 75 years old, and he was a very long way conceptually from "British philosophy." The foremost Whiteheadian experts in the world, David Ray Griffin, John Cobb, etc., at the Center for Process Studies in Claremont, CA, usually refer to him as simply a philosopher, or sometimes (but rarely) as an English philosopher. See "Process Philosophy" <a href="http://www.ctr4process.org/process/CPSWhatIs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ctr4process.org/process/CPSWhatIs.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Whitehead drew very heavily from William James and others, and his philosophy has an American flavor.</p>
<p>But, yes, it's also true that because of his mathematical/logical background, he is (in a sense) identified with analytical philosophy; with Wittgenstein, Quine, etc. Books were written on this relationship by George Shields and others. But the bulk of the writing by far is about Whitehead and Continental philosophy, Hegel, Eastern philosophy, theology, etc. (even things written from a Deleuzean perspective, etc.). The point is that his thought was so wide that it's all over the map (very unlike British philosophy).</p>
<p>I did my graduate work at KU Leuven (besides Claremont, KUL is really the only place to study Whitehead). I took a seminar with Lewis Ford, and he never referred to Whitehead as British or English, neither did Jan Van der Veken or Andre Cloots. At any rate, I'm guilty of name dropping here, true, but I'm pointing out it's probably more accurate to refer to him as just a philosopher, or maybe "English." What do you think? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 08:11, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I simply changed the categ Mathematicians -&gt; British mathematicians. I did this because of Whitehead's involvement with Russell in the Principia. You may well have an argument that he was an American philosopher or at least an 'unstated' philosopher. Clearly, we could do with more biographical information on his emigration, naturalisation, etc. You will need to look back to 8 Mar 2002 when the Whitehead article was edited to add 'British'. However, I don't think there was much doubt that (together with Russell), he was one of the most influential British mathematicians of his age. <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcairns_bb52.html" title="User:Icairns">Ian Cairns</a> 13:39, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC) (a mathematician, not a philosopher)</dd>

<dd>As a side note, it's common for folks to say, "Whitehead's involvement with Russell in the Principia." But Russell was the student (albeit a brilliant student). Russell did alot of work (as students do) but Whitehead was actually the force behind it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 16:38, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whitehead was born English and never took American nationality. In his writings on the foundations of mathematics, Whitehead was a logician and analytic philosopher, just as much as Russell. But the Whitehead who created process metaphysics was not a British philosopher. No UK philosopher in the 20th century ever dared write anything with the sweep, ambition, and scope of <i>Process and Reality</i>. And process philosophy has had few admirers in the UK. I submit that the mature Whitehead was an American philosopher, influenced by Peirce was well as James. example, Peirce advocated an evolutionary cosmology. We know that Whitehead perused Peirce's mss in Harvard's possession, and was exasperated at the extent to which Peirce had anticipated ideas Whitehead thought he was the first to think. I do not want to detract from Whitehead's originality, because Peirce never wrote a philosophical book. To his everlasting credit, Whitehead left us with many wonderful books.132.181.160.42 07:54, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I regret to say that this entry and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process_and_Reality_3464.html" title="Process and Reality">Process and Reality</a>) simply do not do justice to the enormous intellectual achievement of A N Whitehead, the most original British thinker since Francis Bacon. Would an expert on process philosophy please step up to the plate?</p>
<p>It is absolutely astounding to read Lowe on Whitehead's education in the 1880s: grubby engineering math and fair physics. Whitehead taught himself algebra and logic to write his first book, <i>Universal Algebra</i>. He taught himself math logic, more or less a la Peano, and Cantorian set theory while writing <i>Principia</i>. Then he goes back to theoretical physics and relational theories of space and time. Now well past 60, the greatest British metaphysician of all time emerges. How did he manage to reinvent himself so many times?132.181.160.42 08:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The expansion by <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> is a welcome improvement to the article. I made two types of changes to the paragraph on Whitehead's theology which were summarily reverted. The first change deleted two phrases that were redundant in context, thus making the paragraph more consise. The second change was an attempt to harmonize the conflict existing between the two statements that <i>Whitehead leaned towards <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>.</i> and <i>Prior to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_War_38d8.html" title="Great War">Great War</a>, he considered himself an agnostic.</i> "He leaned Catholic" implies a theistic tendancy, while the statement about being agnostic reverses that tendancy without any reason given. Changing "Prior" to "After" was a guess, but it would supply a reason for the change in belief (he had lost his son), which otherwise leaves the reader wondering about the implied change in Whitehead's thought. Please explain your reversions. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 22:07, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blainster, I specifically object to your practice of inserting unsubstantiated guesses into the article. A quick search produced the following: <i>Bertrand Russell, who knew him [Whitehead] well from 1898 to 1910, reports that they saw eye to eye on matters religious. Whitehead may have been just as agnostic as Russell, but he was much more reticent about proclaiming it. The effect of the First World War led him to cultivate a deeper religious sensitivity, but it was not until 1925 that he found a concept of God he could endorse</i>.

You are welcome to rephrase my assertion any way you like, provided that factual accuracy is maintained. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 07:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
