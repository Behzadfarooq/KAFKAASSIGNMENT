	    <p><b>Alfred Arthur Greenwood Hales</b> (<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">21 July</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a> – <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">29 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>) was an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> novelist and war correspondent.</p>
<p>Hales was born at Kent Town, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, the son of Frederick Greenwood Hales, a wood-turner, and his wife Sarah Leigh, née Veal. He had the ordinary <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">primary education</a> of his time, and after being apprenticed to a carpenter began a wandering career by going to the country. For years he worked as a farm hand and rouseabout and became a magnificent rider. He occasionally contributed to country newspapers, never staying long in one place, until he came to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales_42a9.html" title="Broken Hill, New South Wales">Broken Hill, New South Wales</a>, where he was a mining reporter for some years. There he wrote his first book, <i>The Wanderings of a Simple Child</i>, which was published in 1890. This went into a third edition in the following year. Hales then visited America and <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and returning to Adelaide started the Adelaide Standard. He next went to the goldfields in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> and started the <i>Coolgardie Mining Review</i>. A fire destroyed his plant and he was penniless, but after working for some time as a dry-blower he went to Boulder City and with his brother Frank started the Boulder Star. He stood as a labour candidate for parliament but was defeated, and when the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Boer_War_db66.html" title="Second Boer War">South African war</a> broke out became a war correspondent for the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Chronicle_e0d9.html" title="Daily Chronicle">London Daily News</a>. For a time he wrote fearlessly and critically of the way in which the British were conducting their operations, but was wounded and made a prisoner by the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boer.html" title="Boer">Boers</a>, and was not released until the end of the war.</p>
<p>Hales wrote a book on his experiences, <i>Campaign Pictures of War in South Africa</i>, which was published in 1900, and in the following year appeared his first novel, <i>Driscoll, King of Scouts</i>. He made a success with McGlusky, published in 1902, afterwards followed by a long series of stories with this Australian of Scotch descent as the hero. Hales was not content to be merely a writer of fiction, he went to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28region%29.html" title="Macedonia (region)">Macedonia</a> and fought in a rebellion against the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turks</a> in 1903. This was followed by experience as a war correspondent in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Japanese_War_956c.html" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, and in the following years much lecturing in England, South Africa, Australia and South America. Wherever there was a mining field Hales visited it, and in South America he made a special study of the agricultural and pastoral possibilities of that continent. When <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> began he endeavoured to enlist but was too much over age. He worked as a war correspondent in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, and then went to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, where meeting <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Garibaldi_II_19b1.html" title="Giuseppe Garibaldi II">General Garibaldi</a>, he endeavoured to join the Italian army. Garibaldi, who was born in Australia, tried to help him without success, and Hales again worked as a correspondent. In 1918 he published <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i>, a series of able sketches on matters arising out of the war. After peace came Hales lived mostly in England and wrote a large number of novels, of which about 60 are listed in Miller's <i>Australian Literature</i>. Many of these had large circulations; of the McGlusky series of some 20 volumes about 2,000,000 copies were sold. Hales published a volume of verse, <i>Poems and Ballads</i>, in 1909, which is not important as poetry, and he also wrote some unpublished plays. He died in England on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">29 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. He was married twice (1) to Miss Pritchard of Adelaide who died in 1911, and (2) to Jean Reid. There were four sons and a daughter by the first marriage.</p>
<p>Hales was a big, kindly man known to everyone as "Smiler" Hales. He took part in and was much interested in every form of sport, and exemplified a philosophy of courage and cheerfulness. He was a good journalist and a good teller of tales, who believed in wholesome decent living and was not afraid to say so. His <i>My Life of Adventure</i>, 1918, and <i>Broken Trails</i>, 1931, give interesting and vivid pages from his life.</p>
