<p>The initial design work began in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> and was highly innovative, necessarily so to meet the demanding requirements - sufficient speed to successfully pursue any ship; the ability to avoid anti-submarine weapons and to ensure success in underwater combat; low detectability, in particular to airborne <a href="../../../m/a/d/MAD_9372.html" title="MAD">MAD</a> arrays, and also especially to active sonars; minimal displacement and minimal crew complement. A special <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanium.html" title="Titanium">titanium</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloy</a> hull would be used to create a small, low drag, 1,500 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton.html" title="Ton">ton</a>, three compartment vessel capable of very high speeds (in excess of 40 <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knots_%28speed%29.html" title="Knots (speed)">knots</a>) and deep diving. The submarine would operate as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interceptor.html" title="Interceptor">interceptor</a>, staying in harbour or on patrol route and then racing out to reach an approaching fleet. A high-power <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor.html" title="Liquid metal cooled reactor">liquid-metal-cooled</a> <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_plant.html" title="Nuclear plant">nuclear plant</a> was devised meaning extensive <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automation.html" title="Automation">automation</a> would also greatly reduce the needed crew numbers to just 16 highly trained men. The practical problems with the design quickly became apparent and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> the design team was replaced and a less radical design was proposed, increasing all main dimensions and the vessel weight by 800 tons and doubling the crew.</p>
<p>A prototype, <i>Project 661</i> or <i>K-162 (since 1978 K-222)</i> (referred to by NATO as the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papa_class_submarine.html" title="Papa class submarine">Papa class</a>), was built at the Sudomekh yards in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Leningrad</a> and completed in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. The long build-time was caused by numerous design flaws and difficulties in manufacture. Extensively tested and reconfigured, it was taken out of service following a reactor accident in 1980. It reportedly had a top speed of 44.7 knots and a claimed dive depth of 800 m. This combined with other reports created some alarm in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> and prompted the rapid development of the <a href="../../../a/d/c/ADCAP_f9e2.html" title="ADCAP">ADCAP</a> <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedo</a> program and the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Lance_87c8.html" title="Sea Lance">Sea Lance</a> and W-class submarine projects (the latter two were cancelled when more definitive information about the Soviet project was known). The creation of the high-speed <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spearfish_torpedo.html" title="Spearfish torpedo">Spearfish torpedo</a> by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> was also a response to the threat posed by the reported capabilities of the Alfa.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfa_class_submarine.html" title="Edit section: Production">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Production</span></h2>
<p>Production started in 1974 as <i>Project 705</i> with construction at both the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty_yard.html" title="Admiralty yard">Admiralty yard</a>, Leningrad and at Sevmashpredpriyatiye (Northern Machinery Factory), <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severodvinsk.html" title="Severodvinsk">Severodvinsk</a>. The first vessel was commissioned in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>.</p>
<p>Project 705 boats were intended to be an experimental platform themselves, to test all innovations and rectify their faults, that would afterwards found a new generation of submarines. This highly experimental nature mostly predetermined their future.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, with the completion of the seventh vessel, production ended. All vessels were assigned to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Fleet_9948.html" title="Northern Fleet">Northern Fleet</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Propulsion" id="Propulsion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfa_class_submarine.html" title="Edit section: Propulsion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Propulsion</span></h2>
<p>The power plant for the boat was a <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_cooled_fast_reactor.html" title="Lead cooled fast reactor">lead cooled fast reactor</a>. Such reactors have a number of advantages over older types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquid metal cooled reactors can almost instantly adjust their power output, while typical water-cooled reactors require 20 to 30 minutes to reach full output.</li>
<li>Due to higher coolant temperature, their <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_efficiency.html" title="Energy efficiency">energy efficiency</a> is up to 1.5 times higher.</li>
<li>Lifetime without refuelling can be increased more easily, in part due to higher efficiency.</li>
<li>Liquid metal can't cause an explosion and quickly solidifies in case of a leakage, greatly improving safety.</li>
<li>LCFRs are much lighter and smaller than water-cooled reactors, which was the primary factor when considering power plant choice for Lira.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though 1960s technology was barely sufficient to produce reliable LCFRs, which are even today considered challenging, their advantages were considered compelling. Two power plants were developed independently, BM-40A by <i>Hydropress</i> in Leningrad and OK-550 by the <i>OKBM</i> design bureau in Nizhny Novgorod, both using an <a href="../../../e/u/t/Eutectic.html" title="Eutectic">eutectic</a> <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a>-<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bismuth.html" title="Bismuth">bismuth</a> <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solution.html" title="Solution">solution</a> for the primary cooling stage, and both producing 155 megawatts of power.</p>
<p>Burst speed in tests was between 43 and 45 knots for all vessels, and speeds of 41-42 knots could be sustained. Acceleration to the top speed took one minute and reversing 180 degrees at full speed 40 seconds. This degree of maneuverability exceeds all other submarines and most torpedoes that were in service at the time. Indeed, during training the boats proved to successfully evade torpedoes launched by other submarines, which required introduction of faster torpedoes such as the American ADCAP or British <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Spearfish_torpedo.html" title="Spearfish torpedo">Spearfish</a></i>. However, the price for this was a very high noise level at burst speed, as for any body moving through water at high speed. The tactical speed, where the noise would be similar to other submarines, is about 20-25 knots.</p>
<p>Propulsion was provided by the main <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propellor.html" title="Propellor">screw</a> with 30 MW steam turbines, and two 100 kW electric-powered screws served as an additional propulsion for maneuvering and a backup. Backup power systems included a 500 kW <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">diesel</a> generator and a set of zinc-silver <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_%28electricity%29.html" title="Battery (electricity)">batteries</a>.</p>
<p>The OK-550 plant was used on Project 705, but later, on 705K, the BM-40A plant was installed due to the low reliability of the OK-550. While more reliable, BM-40A still turned out to be much more demanding in maintenance than older <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressurized_water_reactor.html" title="Pressurized water reactor">pressurized water reactors</a>. The issue is that lead/bismuth eutectic solution solidifies at 125 degrees C. If it ever hardens it would be impossible to restart the reactor since the fuel assemblies would be frozen in the solidified coolant, so whenever the reactor is shut down it must be heated externally with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam.html" title="Steam">superheated steam</a>. Near the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pier.html" title="Pier">piers</a> where the submarines were moored, a special facility was constructed to deliver superheated steam to the vessels' reactors when the reactors were shut down. A smaller ship was also stationed at the pier to deliver steam from its steam plant to the Alfa submarines.</p>
<p>Coastal facilities were treated with much less attention than the submarines and often turned out unable to heat the submarines reactors. Consequently the plants had to be kept running even while the subs were in harbour. The facilities completely broke down early in the 1980s and since then the reactors of all operational Alfa submarines were kept constantly running. While the BM-40A reactors are able to work for many years without stopping, they were not specifically designed for such treatment and any serious reactor maintenance became impossible. This led to a number of failures, including coolant leaks and one reactor broken down and frozen while at sea. However, constantly running the reactors proved better than relying on the coastal facilities. Four vessels were decommissioned due to freezing of the coolant.</p>
<p>Both the OK-550 and the BM-40A designs were single-use reactors and could not be refuelled as the coolant would inevitably freeze in the process. This was compensated for by a much longer lifetime on their only load (up to 15 years), after which the reactors would be completely replaced. While such a solution could potentially decrease service times and increase reliability, it is still more expensive, and the idea of single-use reactors was unpopular in 1970s. Furthermore, Project 705 does not have a modular design that would allow quick replacement of reactors, so such maintenance would take at least as long as refuelling a normal submarine.</p>
<p><a name="Hull" id="Hull"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfa_class_submarine.html" title="Edit section: Hull">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hull</span></h2>
<p>Like all Soviet nuclear submarines, Project 705 used a double hull, where the internal hull withstands the pressure and the outer one protects it and provides an optimal hydrodynamic shape. However, unlike almost all other submarines, the hulls of the Lira had variable diameters. The shape is optimized for minimal active sonar signature and minimal water resistance and, although it complicated the design, it was essential for providing required maneuverability.</p>
<p>Apart from the prototypes, Project 705 and 705K submarines were built with <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanium.html" title="Titanium">titanium</a> hulls, which was revolutionary in terms of submarine design at the time due to the cost of titanium and the technologies and equipment needed to work with it. The difficulties in the engineering became apparent in the first submarine that was quickly decommissioned after cracks developed in the hull. Later metallurgy and welding technology were improved and no hull problems were experienced on subsequent vessels.</p>
<p>The internal pressure hull was separated into six watertight compartments, of which only the third (center) compartment was manned and others were accessible only for maintenance. The third compartment had reinforced spherical <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulkhead_%28partition%29.html" title="Bulkhead (partition)">bulkheads</a> that could withstand the pressure at the test depth and offered additional protection to the crew in case of attack. To further enhance survivability, the ship was equipped with a protected rescue capsule for the crew that could be ejected.</p>
<p>The hull was designed for extreme depths, below the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_sound_channel.html" title="Deep sound channel">deep sound layer</a> (at 1 km), but complete redesign of the pipelines and other inter-hull systems was delayed. According to some information,<sup id="_ref-fasman-rsrd_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fasman-rsrd" title="">[1]</a></sup> one of the submarines was tested on depths up to 1300 meters but submerging to such depths and returning caused permanent damage to equipment, which in a few cycles would make the vessel very unreliable; possibly this test was conducted just before decommissioning.</p>
<p><a name="Control_System" id="Control_System"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfa_class_submarine.html" title="Edit section: Control System">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Control System</span></h2>
<p>A suite of new systems was developed for these submarines, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Accord</i> combat information and control system, which received and processed hydroacoustic, television, radar and navigation data from other systems, determining other ships, submarines and torpedoes location and speed and predicted trajectory. Information was displayed on control terminals, along with recommendations for operating a single submarine, both for attack and torpedo evasion, or commanding a group of submarines.</li>
<li><i>Sargan</i> weapon control system controlling attack, torpedo homing and use of countermeasures, both by human command and automatically if required</li>
<li><i>Ocean</i> automated hydroacoustic system that provided target data to other systems and eliminated the need for crew members working with detection equipment</li>
<li><i>Sogh</i> navigation system and <i>Boxite</i> course control system, which integrated course, depth, trim and speed control, for manual, automated and programmed maneuvering</li>
<li><i>Rhythm</i> system controlling operation of all machinery aboard, eliminating the need for any personnel servicing reactor and other machinery, which was the main factor in reducing crew complement</li>
<li><i>Alfa</i> radiation control system</li>
<li><i>TV-1</i> television system for outside observation</li>
</ul>
<p>All the systems of the submarine were fully automated and all operations requiring human decision were performed from the control room. While such automation is common on aircraft, other military ships and submarines have multiple, separate teams performing these tasks. Crew interference was required only for course changes or combat and no maintenance was performed at sea. Due to these systems, the combat shift of Lira submarines consisted only of 8 officers stationed in the control room. While nuclear submarines typically have 120 to 160 crew members, the initially proposed crew number was 14 - all officers except the cook. Later it was considered more practical to have additional crew aboard that could be trained to operate the new generation of submarines and the number was increased to 27 officers and 4 under-officers. Also, given that most of the electronics were newly developed and failures were expected, additional crew was stationed to monitor their performance. Some reliability problems have been connected with electronics, and it is possible that some accidents could have been foreseen with more mature and better developed monitoring systems. Overall performance was considered good for an experimental system.</p>
<p>The main reason behind the small crew complement and high automation was not just to allow a reduction in the size of the submarine, but rather to provide an advantage in reaction speed by replacing long chains of command with instant electronics, speeding up any action.</p>

Alfa class submarine at sea.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Alfa class submarines were designed for anti-surface warfare and their primary mode of operation was slowly waiting for enemy ships or information on enemy location and, once detected, rushing at full speed towards the target. While Lira's size, speed and electronics provided enough advantages in combat to defeat a group of enemy ships or a few submarines, their detection equipment suffered because of their small size and they mostly had to rely on directions from coastal facilities to find their targets. This made Lira submarines a strong defensive weapon, but not a capable hunter-killer, as they could be detected more easily than they could detect.</p>
<p>Despite the vessels' constant reliability problems, no crew members were lost on these submarines. This was due to extensive crew protection measures and automation that isolated the crew from most of the machinery.</p>

<p>Alfas, as with almost all other nuclear submarines, were never actually used in combat and didn't perform any important tasks except power demonstration. However, the Soviet government still made good use of them, by exaggerating the planned number of vessels, which were assumed to allow naval superiority to be gained by shadowing major ship groups and destroying them in case of war. The US replied by starting the <i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Seawolf_class_submarine.html" title="Seawolf class submarine">Seawolf</a></i> program to create similar submarines and <a href="../../../a/d/c/ADCAP_f9e2.html" title="ADCAP">ADCAP</a> program to create torpedoes maneuverable enough to prosecute successfully Alfa class submarines.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/a/Seawolf_class_submarine.html" title="Seawolf class submarine">SSN-21 <i>Seawolf</i></a>, created 12 years later, did not replicate Lira but rather was built around the concept of anti-submarine warfare to respond to the dual threats of the Soviet ballistic missile submarine fleet and the Alfas. It has a burst speed of 35 knots, three times higher displacement, much less maneuverability and does not have the Alfa's characteristic automation. The <i>Seawolf</i> class was not designed as a 'dogfighter' in the manner of the Alfa, but, with its focus on lower noise level and extensive surveillance equipment, to detect and prosecute at much longer distances. The Seawolf could detect attacking submarines at a long range, particularly due to the high noise levels produced by Alfas at full speed, both allowing the fleet to avoid an attack and for fleet anti-submarine forces to be concentrated against the attacking submarines. However, <i>Seawolf</i> class submarines cost over 2 billion <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">dollars</a> each and were a very costly response to an initiative that proceeded not much further than experiments. With the end of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> and the ending of the threat of the Soviet ballistic missile fleet and Alfa submarines their construction was halted, and later restarted. There are currently three Seawolf class boats in operation.</p>
<p>The Lira submarines were intended to be only the first experiments for a new generation of submarines and before their decommissioning there was already a family of derivative designs, including Project 705D, armed with long-range 650 mm torpedoes, and the Project 705A ballisitic missile variant that would be able to defend itself successfully against attack submarines, therefore not needing patrolled <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastion_%28naval%29.html" title="Bastion (naval)">bastions</a>. Due to the end of the Cold war none of them was actually implemented.</p>
<p>The technologies and solutions developed, tested and perfected on Lira formed the ground for future designs. The suite of submarine control systems was later used in <a href="../../../a/k/u/Akula_class_submarine.html" title="Akula class submarine">Schuka (NATO designation Akula)</a>, or Project 971 attack submarines that have a crew of 50, which is more than Lira but still less than half as many as other attack submarines. <i>Schuka</i> submarines in their design represent a hybrid of <i>Lira</i> and <i>Seawolf</i>, using a large passive sonar array, towed sonar array and further reduced noise level.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/r/a/Graney_class_submarine.html" title="Graney class submarine">Project 885 <i>Yasen</i></a>, or Severodvinsk class multipurpose submarines, planned to be launched in late 2006, finally implement ideas of 705A and 705D, combining ability to launch a variety of long-range nuclear missiles and engage hostile submarines or ships at long range. The missiles carried include <a href="../../../r/a/d/Raduga_Kh-55_4b5a.html" title="Raduga Kh-55">3K-10 <i>Granat</i></a> with 2500-3000 km range, and new Kh-101 and Kh-102 with range up to 5000 km.<sup id="_ref-Missile_specifications_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Missile_specifications" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> Their displacement is reduced compared to <i>Schuka</i>, dive depth and maneuverability are significally improved, due to more modern reactor and smaller displacement.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> Noise reduction technologies and solutions include ideas borrowed from <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seawolf_class_submarine.html" title="Seawolf class submarine">Seawolf</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_class_submarine.html" title="Virginia class submarine">Virginia</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, with additional use of acoustical decoupling and isolation of the internal and external hulls.

In the book the Palestinian intelligence agency has bought and modernized the sub with a new diesel electric power plant - speed and performance however, in the novel stayed the same as on the original nuclear powered version - and a groundbreaking system of detection. The submarine in the novel also carried a midget sub in the compartment originally housing the reactor.</p>
