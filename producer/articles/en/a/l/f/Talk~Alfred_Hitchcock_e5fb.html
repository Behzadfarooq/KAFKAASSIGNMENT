<dl>
<dd>Still nothing about Hitchcock's time in Germany? Before directing his first film, Hitch worked as, I believe, an art director on a few things (had to destroy some of Lang's huge sets!) and, in McGilligan's book, there's direct mention of Hitch observing Murnau in action on 'The Last Laugh'. Also, most academic works about Hitchcock tend to emphasize the tremendous importance that being immersed in this high-point of German Expressionism had on him: actual film style, and the amount of creative freedom given to filmmakers to control all aspects of their creations. As it stands, I don't believe the article does any sort of justice to these ideas. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacze_Moj_7b9b.html" title="User:Pacze Moj">Pacze Moj</a> 01:34, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Still,one of Hitchcock's directorial priorities was to work love stories into his films.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>This was in response to Hitch being cynical of romantic relationships in his films. This statement seem completely redundant to me. It is impossible to be cynical about something without presenting it or discussing it. The very fact that Hitch was cynical about romance in his films logically implies that he "worked love stories into his films". In fact, the statement is a bit misleading, since it seems to imply that perhaps Hitch *didn't* take such a cynical view, after all. The assumption seems to be that if you work love stories into your movies, you must have a flattering opinion of romance. But by that reasoning, there would be no anti-war movies, e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 01:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is still a mess. Except for the intro, links, quotes, and so on. What to do, what to do?? <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 01:37, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you're talking about the Hitchcock article as a whole, I agree -- the grammar and punctuation is a mess (I just quoted three sentences in a post on IMDB, and had to redo the whole thing for it to make sense). Plus, the article contradicts itself about the cause of Hitch's death. At the top it says heart attack; at the bottom it says renal failure. Need to definitely fix that. 08:43, 15 August 2006 (UTC) A. Victoria</p>

<p>I see that "Sir" has been added, bolded, as part of his name in the lead paragraph and in all of the Category links. Doesn't this go against Wikipedia policy on such titles? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:11, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More to the point, if (as the article states) he had taken out American citizenship well before he got his knighthood, then unless he retained dual British citizenship (about which the article is silent), the knighthood was honorary and he was never even <i>entitled</i> to use Sir. I've sometimes seen him referred to as "Sir Alfred Hitchcock", but I'm beginning to suspect he's in the same category as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Geldof_005d.html" title="Bob Geldof">Bob Geldof</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Cooke_ed2a.html" title="Alastair Cooke">Alastair Cooke</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Milligan_c14a.html" title="Spike Milligan">Spike Milligan</a>, <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Eisenhower_f660.html" title="Dwight Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and lots of others.

<dd>Acquisition of U.S. citizenship on or after 1 January 1949 does not cause loss of British nationality. Hitchcock naturalised in 1956, hence he remained British. A similar case is <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Hopkins_3f1b.html" title="Anthony Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>. Alistair Cooke lost his British nationality upon naturalisation in the U.S. as he became American in 1941 (ie before 1949). Bob Geldof is an Irish citizen who has not applied for British citizenship. Spike Milligan's case is a little more complex, he was British by birth in India before 1949, and Irish by descent from his father. Because he was an Irish citizen and neither he nor his father were born in the UK or its Colonies, he did not become a citizen of the UK &amp; Colonies on 1 January 1949. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_British_nationality_law_d9ce.html" title="History of British nationality law">History of British nationality law</a> has details.

<dd>Actually, I would disagree with that usage. The very common "Irish American" or "Irish-American" usually implies "Irish ancestry but born in America". We would usually say "Irish-born American" for a US citizen born in Ireland but raised in the U.S., and "Irishman/Irishwoman who became a naturalized American citizen" (or, in Wikipedia, "Irish, later American") for one who emigrated as an adult. I can't think why this case should be handled differently. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"British-American" suggests mixed parentage and/or upbringing, or someone raised in the US to British parents. The problem is that its not very clear what it means and it then has to be explained, "born and raised in Britain and later became an American citizen", so you might as well say that from the outset. I prefer the version we have now because its unambiguous. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 08:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure that it was just a honoury knighthood he received. Unless he renounced his British citizenship he could still receive a full knighthood.

<dd>I made the same point back in October (above). There must be evidence somewhere that would put to rest the question of whether he had dual British-American citizenship, or whether he renounced British upon becoming an American. For now, the assumption is that he dropped his British citizenship. This would be the usual way of doing things. Retaining one's original citizenship along with the new citizenship would be the exception rather than the rule. It could have happened, but where's the evidence? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 02:18, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have had a good look around Google. Plenty of references to him becoming a US citizen in 1955. No hits at all for anything to do with dual citizenship or retaining British citizenship. The eponymous hotel does not settle the matter. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I propose that the status quo remain, ie. he was born British, became an American, his knighthood was honorary, and he is not entitled to "Sir". <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 05:09, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, well, well. These might seem to provide support for both sides of the argument at first glance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hitchcock himself believed that he was not entitled to the title Sir. But maybe he was confusing 2 things. (a) Knighthoods are available only to British subjects, and (b) the USA does not normally permit its citizens to accept foreign awards and honours. If he believed he was American and only American, then both reasons (a) and (b) would have been relevant. But they would not have prevented him from being awarded an <i>honorary</i> British knighthood, and they would not have prevented him from using KBE after his name. [Note: It is customary for Americans not to use postnominals, so in the USA he would probably not have done so (just as Steven Spielberg, Norman Schwarzkopf, George Bush Sr and Colin Powell do not, even though they are all honorary KBEs)].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Royal Warrant of 1 Aug 1980 calls him Alfred Hitchcock, Esq, not Sir Alfred Hitchcock, which suggests he did not receive the KBE. If we look closer, though, the point of the warrant seems to be to convert his widow from Mrs Alma Hitchcock into Lady Hitchcock, because it talks about giving her the style she would have had if he had been knighted. The Gazette notice of December 1979 lists him as a recipient of a KBE, with no mention of anything honorary, and the award was announced on New Years Day 1980. Honorary knighthoods are normally separately announced, and not part of the other New Years or Queens Birthday honours lists. If the KBE were honorary, there’s no way his wife or widow could be called Lady Hitchcock.
<ul>
<li>An analogous case is <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Falcon_Scott_8294.html" title="Robert Falcon Scott">Robert Falcon Scott</a> (of the Antarctic). His widow was awarded the rank and precedence <b>but not the style</b> of the widow of a KCB. This means she was treated as if she were the widow of a KCB in all official matters, but was not entitled to be called Lady Scott. This was because Scott was not knighted, either while he was alive, or posthumously (because that is simply never done), and the best they could do for him was to treat his widow <i>as if</i> he had been knighted. But because he was not <i>actually</i> knighted, he wasn't Sir Robert, and she wasn't Lady Scott.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lady Hitchcock seems to be the opposite case. Which means that on balance, I think josh is right: Hitchcock was awarded a full KBE which was officially announced, but he died before he could be formally invested. Nevertheless, the fact of the announcement entitles him to be referred to as <b>Sir Alfred Hitchcock KBE</b>. If the Yanks don't like giving him his full due, nominally speaking, that's up to them.</li>
<li>It also seems Hitchcock was mistaken about his own entitlement to the title Sir Alfred. He certainly is not the first case of a person being unaware of or confused about his true citizenship status.</li>
<li>I need to say another thing about confusion. The commentary on Hitchcock’s letter says: <i>Hitchcock had become a U.S. citizen in 1956 and he was right when he said U.S. citizens cannot hold titles of nobility. But because Britain allows dual citizenship, he was still a British citizen and could use his title there.</i>
<ul>
<li>Just because Britain <i>allows</i> dual citizenship does not necessarily mean that it did so in Hitchcock’s case. I don’t think this part of the commentary adds any value.</li>
<li>Also, it suggests that a title can apply in one country and not another. This is not right. If he were entitled to be called Sir Alfred at all, then that means he was a British subject, and despite being also an American citizen, he was still a British subject when he was in America and he would have been perfectly entitled to call himself Sir Alfred there. American custom might dictate he downplay his titles, but would have no effect on his legal entitlement if he wanted to press the point. The American prohibition on its citizens accepting foreign awards applies only to the extent that they are citizens. Where a person is a dual national, when they wear the other country’s hat US laws do not impinge on them. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 10:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally. Just had a <a href="../../../o/r/d/Talk%7EOrder_of_the_British_Empire_c4fc.html#When_do_you_receive_the_title.3F" title="Talk:Order of the British Empire">word</a> with one of the people working on the honours articles. He said that Sir Fred would have got the full title (Sir and KBE) when it was announced. So it would seem that the second Gazette entry was just clarification/protocol. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshurtree_32f2.html" title="User:Joshurtree">josh</a> 13:20, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as I know, one does not have to renounce British citizenship to adopt foreign citizenship. As far as the United Kingdom was concerned, Hitchcock was still a British subject and therefore entitled to use his knighthood. I can also confirm that he appears in the honours list published in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, the UK newspaper of record, on 31 December 1979 in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List as a substantive KBE, not an honorary KBE (unfortunately, I can't provide a link to it as it's a password-only database). That seems pretty conclusive to me. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 14:28, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Josh has already provided the link above, so it is now beyond dispute that he was Sir Alfred. However it is not necessarily true that a British subect keeps his citizenship when adopting foreign. What about <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Cooke_ed2a.html" title="Alastair Cooke">Alastair Cooke</a>, KBE? He was born in Britain, later adopted US citizenship, then given an honorary knighthood, honorary because he was no longer a British subject. Maybe he chose to renounce his original citizenship, or maybe under US law at the time he was required to - who knows? International citizenship laws are a minefield of technicalities, and they keep changing. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 22:44, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>During my research last night I found out alot about citzenship in the UK. The only way you can lose your citizenship if you renounce it by informing the Home Office (and paying for the privilege). Even if the other nation requires you to have exclusive citizenship you still have to renounce yourself before taking on the new nationality. I don't think giving it up voluntary is common (if you do you can never retake your British citizenship). Alastair Cooke took American citizenship during the second world war before the first tax treaty between the UK and US in 1945<a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2004/04/10/stories/2004041000030900.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2004/04/10/stories/2004041000030900.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. So probably renounced his British citizenship to avoid <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_taxation.html" title="Double taxation">double taxation</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The difference between Alastair Cooke and Alfred Hitchcock is that Cooke became American in 1941, while Hitchcock did in 1956. 1 January 1949 was the cutoff, British people who became American before that date normally automatically lost British nationality, those who became American afterwards normally kept it (unless they specifically chose to renounce it under <b>British</b> law). <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 15:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, we could change it to "later took up dual citizenship". The first few lines are supposed to introduce the subject before going into more detail. The fact that later in his life he had dual British and American citizenship (and according to the article, he didn't have it until he was well into middle-age) is not really that important to the subject.

<dd>As a general statement, I would agree that dual nationality is not important to the introductory information about a subject. But where the subject's name has been changed through knighthood, and that was only possible because of dual nationality, then it becomes highly important.

<p>It is absolute rubbish that "he has never been credited with or used the title "Sir", which is therefore inappropriate for the lead-in here". I have seen him listed as "Sir Alfred Hitchcock" many times. Maybe he is not in America, but he certainly is in Britain. It was used in his obituary in <i>The Times</i>, for instance. And we have proof from the honours list that his knighthood was, in the eyes of HM Government, substantive, not honorary. It is therefore wholly appropriate to use it in the lead-in. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 01:55, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I omitted the following:</p>
<p><i>Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was French actress Claude Jade as the secret agent's worried daughter, Michele, in Topaz (1969).</i></p>
<p>This is incorrect. Claude Jade does not fit the description of a typical "Hitchcock Blonde". First of all, she has dark hair. Second, she has a rather small part in the ensemble film. She's really only in a few scenes, and is not really a pivitol character in the film. In place of this, I used the example from his last film, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Plot_43c7.html" title="Family Plot">Family Plot</a>, which featured not one but possibly two blonde heroines (if you count <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Black_fe38.html" title="Karen Black">Karen Black</a>'s character).</p>

<p>I was under the impression that he wanted to do a nude scene in <i>Topaz</i> but discovered that the actress in question (maybe Claude Jade?) had had some kind of surgery which eliminated that possibility (though why he couldn't have used a body double as he did in <i>Frenzy</i> escapes me). Also, in <i>Psycho</i> there are a few seconds when the viewer can see Janet Leigh's breasts (or at least what would be her breasts if a) it's Janet Leigh's body in the frame rather than a body double, and b) despite what JL claimed, she wasn't wearing moleskin). It happens at the point when she reaches out and tears down the shower curtain. I've seen the film probably 30-40 times, and I never noticed this until many many viewings...being so shocked and riveted by the scene as a whole and (at that point) by the absolutely mesmerizing image of her hand moving slowly toward the curtain.</p>
<p>So to say that <i>Frenzy</i> was the first time he allowed nudity or even considered it seems to me to be not completely accurate. Thoughts? <a href="../../../w/s/p/User%7EWspencer11_8aca.html" title="User:Wspencer11">Wspencer11</a> 14:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think <i>Kaleidoscope Frenzy</i>, or <i>Kaleidoscope</i>, which he began work on in the mid 60s would have been the first real appearance of nudity in a Hitchcock film. Universal and MCA weren't keen on the film and it was shelved at the pre-production stage. Hitchcock eventually reworked some of the ideas and themes into <i>Frenzy</i>. There are some stills and screen-grabs (which feature some mild nudity) from the shot footage at <a href="http://www.daveyp.com/hitchcock/wiki/Kaleidoscope_Frenzy" class="external free" title="http://www.daveyp.com/hitchcock/wiki/Kaleidoscope_Frenzy" rel="nofollow">http://www.daveyp.com/hitchcock/wiki/Kaleidoscope_Frenzy</a> 86.3.4.244 05:36, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most sources I've seen say renal failure. According to his Doctor (Dr. Flieg) Hitchcock was suffering from "mild hypertension, a heart condition, kidney problems, and a general physical deterioration" (McGilligan, pg 745) in the weeks before his death. According to Spoto ("Dark Side of Genius" pg 554), in early April 1980 "his liver failed, his kidney function slowed, and his ... heart no longer responded to the [pacemaker]". 86.3.4.244 05:47, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on <i>in popular culture</i> information.

Recently I also created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Alexander_the_Great_d3a1.html" title="Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great">Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great</a> out of material that had been deleted from the biography article. Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this as a model for the editors here.

<p>Am I the only one who thinks the current photo isn't <i>vintage</i> Hitchcock? The Master of Suspense is most often portrayed as a stern director. A laughing Hitchcock is somewhat, well, un-Hitchcockian. Of course, I realize the current photo is a blessing with regard to copyrights and whatnot. But I think it doesn't convey an adequate image of Hitchcock.</p>
<p>Edit: The new one is even worse. Hitchcock on TV? Scanlines included?</p>

<p>Much more could be said about the hardcover and paperbound books which Hitchcock supposedly edited. The article is rather too dismissive of them, and most of the titles cited are children's story collections. Actually the first few AH paperbacks (published by Dell) came out in the 1940s, long before his TV series began. These include "Bar the Doors" and "Fear and Trembling," which are superb collections of first-rate mystery and horror stories. It seems likely to me that AH was actually involved in the editing of these. Another group from the 1960s were co-edited (some would say "ghost edited") by Robert Arthur. These originally came out in hardcover and are also very fine anthologies. They include "Stories for Late at Night" and "Stories That Scared Even Me." Most of the post-1960 paperbacks were either abridged versions of the hardcovers, or collections of stories from the AH Mystery Magazine. These latter books can usually be distinguished by the increasingly silly titles ("Let It All Bleed Out" and "Happy Death Day" are examples). I strongly feel that this subject deserves more careful study; the books are still popular today (check out eBay) and I collect them.

<p>I'm pretty certain that at least two of the major Hitchcock biographies (including Patrick McGilligan's "Life in Darkness and Light") state that Hitchcock did drive, and another (possibly Charlotte Chandler's "It's Only a Movie") that he did eat eggs. There were several autobiographical stories that Hitchcock frequently told reporters (including the one where he was locked in a police cell as a boy) and it's difficult to know where the real truth lies in them. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavepattern_596b.html" title="User:Davepattern">Davepattern</a> 19:24, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several of the pages for Hitchcock early films have had a statement added that they were until recently in the "public domain" -- I believe this is incorrect, as UGC UK (now part of Studio Canal) and Carlton (now part of Granada Internation) reasserted their US rights during 1997. The films can be found listed in the documents at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/gatt.html" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.gov/gatt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/gatt.html</a> (specifically 22/Aug/1997).

<p>I have rewritten the sentence concerning this, but would like to get confirmation on one aspect from someone who knows more about it than I: as I recall, the dream sequence planned by Dali was essentially unshootable, so the notion of it being "cut" isn't exactly true since it wasn't shot.
