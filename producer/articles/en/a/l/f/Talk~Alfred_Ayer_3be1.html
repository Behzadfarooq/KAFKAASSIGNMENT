As for "At a party that same year held by fashion designer <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_Sanchez_8274.html" title="Fernando Sanchez">Fernando Sanchez</a>, Ayer, then 77, confronted <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Tyson_b51d.html" title="Mike Tyson">Mike Tyson</a> harassing <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naomi_Campbell_a428.html" title="Naomi Campbell">Naomi Campbell</a> ...," I'm familiar with the story, and I know that Ayer went to see what was happening, but the sentence as it stands is poor English. He confronted X, who was harassing ... or He confronted X while he was harassing ... Or he encountered/discovered X harassing. But not "he confronted X harassing." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:38, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope you don't think my interest in this is to force "childish" profanity into the intro of an article; I'm only interested in insuring that a quote is complete and accurate as per the original source. In fact, upon reflection, the story doesn't belong in the intro at all and I'm not sure how it ended up there. As far as the sentence construction, I disagree, but I'm open to another version that doesn't incorrectly imply that it was a chance encounter. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:46, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. I think it's a great story for the intro, and I'm going to restore it, though not today because there has been too much reverting already. It's common for publications to use an ellipsis instead of a curse word, and common in general for quotations to be edited for any number of reasons. Also, the current construction doesn't imply it was a chance encounter. As I remember the story, Ayer heard screams coming from a bedroom and went to look. There he encountered/discovered/saw/found/Tyson harassing Campbell. Also, Rogers is not the original source. This is a very well-known story about Ayer. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:03, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that story should stay put. Ayer was more than just an academic philosopher and that story, I think, gives the reader some insight into his personality and character. He was the sort of guy who could be found in fashionable nightspots, of the sort, where people like Mike Tyson and Namomi Campbell might turn up. He was the kind of guy who go up to a Mike Tyson and remonstrate with him and get away with it. That says something about the man's character. Jim F.</dd>

<p>I think this phrasing is a little biased:</p>
<p><i>Ayer's philosophical ideas were largely parasitic on those of the Vienna Circle. However, his clear, vibrant and (arguably) arrogant exposition of them makes Language, Truth and Logic essential reading on the tenets of logical positivism -- the book is a classic, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world.</i></p>
<p>I think 'parasitic' is a bad term, 'deeply influenced' lends itself better and is less likely to be seen as pejorative. Wherever I read about Ayer and the Vienna Circle the phrasing is something like that.</p>
<p>'(arguably) arrogant' anyone accused of this is better refered to as 'polemical' in most cases.</p>
<p>'the book is a classic' might be better as 'the book is widely regarded as a classic of 20th century philosophy'</p>

<p>I think that this page needs to be expanded by at least two-fold. There is much more to Ayer's philosophy than what is presented here. There is much more to say about the verification principle, the debunking of it, the controversies, Ayer's other ideas, and the criticisms of Ayer. There should also be more about his life and experiences. Most of what is currently here about his life seems to concern the minor event of Ayer confronting tyson at a party.</p>

<dd>I restored the "atheist philosopher" etc category. Notwithstanding the content of Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer was quite prepared to say "I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it." see Ayer's article <i>What I Believe</i> <b>in</b> <i>Humanist</i> 81 (8)August 1966, p226.

<p>Does Ayer belong in the Jewish Philosopher category? Although he may have had jewish ancestry, I seem to recall from Rogers that his mother wasn't jewish (may be mistaken).

<p>Wikipedia has a strong atheistic bias. Theists tend to have criticisms which "debunk" their claims whereas athiests do not.

<dd>This article is about Ayer - I don't see any need to criticize <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athiesm.html" title="Athiesm">athiesm</a> here, or his beliefs. For example, ask yourself if it would be appropriate to list all the arguments for athiesm on the pope's page?

<p>Can anybody help me out with the pronunciation of Ayer's name? Is it /ah-yer/ or /ay-yer/?</p>
<dl>
<dd>My prof pronounces it A-yer as in the letter A, but according to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ayer" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ayer" rel="nofollow">Dictionary.com</a> and <a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/ayer" class="external text" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/ayer" rel="nofollow">M-W.com</a>, it has the same pronunciation as 'air'. –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 08:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
