	    <p><b>Alfred George "Alfie" Hinds</b> (d. <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>) was a British criminal and escape artist who, while serving a 12 year prison sentence for robbery, successfully broke out of three high security prisons. Despite the dismissal of thirteen of his appeals to higher courts, he was eventually able to gain a pardon using his knowledge of the British legal system.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_George_Hinds_adbc.html" title="Edit section: Hinds' Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hinds' Career</span></h2>
<p>Hinds grew up in a children's home following the death of his father, a thief who died while receiving ten lashes as a form of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal_punishment.html" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a> for armed robbery, before running away at the age of seven. Eventually arrested for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petty_theft.html" title="Petty theft">petty theft</a>, he would later escape a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borstal.html" title="Borstal">Borstal</a> institution for teenage delinquents.</p>
<p>Although drafted into the British Army during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, Hinds deserted from the armed forces and continued his criminal career before his eventual arrest for a jewelry robbery in 1953 ($90,000 of which was never recovered by authorities). Although pleading not guilty, he was convicted and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.</p>
<p>However, Hinds later escaped from Nottingham Prison after sneaking through the locked doors and over a 20-foot prison wall for which he became known in the press as "Houdini" Hinds. After eight months as a fugitive, he worked as a builder-decorator in Ireland and throughout Europe until his arrest by detectives of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Yard_5bca.html" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a> in 1956.</p>
<p>After his arrest, Hinds brought a lawsuit against authorities charging the prison commissioners with illegal arrest and successfully used the incident as a means to plan his next escape by having a padlock smuggled in to him while at the Law Courts. Escorted by two guards, he went to the lavatory where they removed his handcuffs outside. Once inside the lavatory, Hinds bundled the handcuffs and snapped the padlock onto screw eyes inserted on the door by his unknown accomplices and escaped into the crowd on <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Street_fda1.html" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a> before his capture at an airport five hours later.</p>
<p>Hinds would make his third escape from Chelmsford Prison less than a year later and, returned to Ireland, he lived for two years as a used car dealer under the name William Herbert Bishop before his arrest after being stopped in an unregistered car.</p>
<p>While eluding Scotland Yard, Hinds continued to plead his innocence sending memorandums to British MP's and granting interviews and taped recordings to the press. He later sold his life story to the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i> for a reported $40,000.</p>
<p>He would continue to appeal his arrest and, following a technicality in which prison escapes are not listed as misdemeanors within British law, his final appeal before the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in 1960 was denied after a three hour argument by Hinds before his return to serve 6 years in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkhurst_Prison_fb41.html" title="Parkhurst Prison">Parkhurst Prison</a>.</p>
<p>In 1964, Hinds won a $45,000 settlement in a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> suit against the arresting officer Herbert Sparks, a former chief superintendent of Scotland Yard's "<a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_squad.html" title="Flying squad">flying squad</a>", after Sparks had written a series of articles in the London <i>Sunday Pictorial</i> criticizing Hinds's claims of innocence. After failing to prove to a London jury of the accuracy of his statements regarding Hinds original conviction, Sparks was ordered to pay Hinds in damages.</p>
<p>His notorious jail breaks from three high security prisons and his successful libel case earned Hinds celebrity status. He soon became a sought after speaker criticizing the English legal system. When invited to take part in a debate before The Polytechnic (now <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Westminster_d168.html" title="University of Westminster">University of Westminster</a>) Students' Union by President <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Spencer-Thomas_ac0a.html" title="Owen Spencer-Thomas">Owen Spencer-Thomas</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, he was confronted by another attempt to deprive him of his liberty. During a drink in a nearby pub after the debate, he was kidnapped by six students for a rag week stunt and frogmarched along a couple of streets to a basement room in the college. Hinds yet again foiled his captors after securing a bunch of keys and turning the lock on them. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
