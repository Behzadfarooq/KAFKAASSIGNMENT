<p>Experimentally speed of gravity do not have measured but must be not greater than 22.2222 billion times c and not less than 20 billion times c</p>
<p>By Alfonso Guillen</p>
<dl>
<dt>Summary</dt>
</dl>
<p>Still nowadays is not known: What is the gravity? Which is its speed?.</p>
<p>However, in the world, the great majority of the physicists follow the General Relativity, which explains the gravity like the effect of the curvature of the spacetime in the movement of free fall of the bodies, but, they simultaneously agree that as gravitational waves is a quantum phenomenon endowed with the transmitting particle real graviton, whose origin is the energy of the oscillation of the own spacetime. Thus the gravity appears like geometric and quantum phenomenon, that has not allowed General Relativity and Quantum Physics unify. This is the other great existing physical theory and from which a quantum theory has been derived about of the gravity, whose carrier is the virtual graviton.</p>
<p>This problem has two basic alternatives to solve it. One is the theory of "Everything" that is based on explaining the quantum character of the gravity from strings in spaces of 5 and more dimensions, where the particle is turned pure geometry, but in spite of the great delivered attacks it is not managed to surpass the low energies. The other alternative is to leave General Relativity in search of the unification of the gravity and other physical phenomenons in a quantum theory but of material particles. This scenery is again explored, as soon as it was left by the pioneers of the quantum gravity.</p>
<p>The dual geometric-quantum gravity of General Relativity also has darkened so much the concept of speed of the gravity like the development of an suitable technology to measure it, that according to the relativity must be equal to c. This was the goal for the end of 2005, of some of the actual Laser Interferometry projects of LIGO, GEO, VIRGO, TAMA etc.</p>
<p>The ingenious experiment made for to measure the speed of the gravity, in the 2002, by the scientist Sergei Kopeikin is not accepted due to its controversial effectiveness.</p>
<p>In 1998, from a theory of quantum material particle gravity, in a theoretical experiment, the prestigious scientist Tom Van Flandern calculates the speed of the gravity at least in 2 x 10<sup>10</sup> times c, that is consistent with the thesis of the author, formulated within an analogous scene, in 1969, about the superluminal speed of the gravity.</p>
<p>In this paper the author presents the controversy on the speed of the gravity between General Relativity and the quantum theory of the gravity and exposes the foundations of his thesis.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Introduction</dt>
</dl>
<p>The gravity in analogy with electromagnetism includes the static and dynamic gravitational fields. The first causes the free fall of the bodies in agreement with the conical circle, ellipse and parabole of Newton. The second causes the gravitational waves.</p>
<dl>
<dt>1 The static gravitational field cause of the Universal phenomenon of the gravity</dt>
</dl>
<p>In both theories, the static gravitational field cause gravity, although it is formulated in two configurations:</p>
<p>- True static gravity field of the General Relativity that remains equal, while transformation does not occur of cosmic magnitude, because it is the curvature of spacetime of a local region.</p>
<p>- Apparent static gravity field of the quantum gravity since it would be really made up of virtual gravitons with speed, but because these gravitons exist within the lapse of uncertainty never can be detected and the gravitational field always seems equal.</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.1 The static gravitational field according to General Relativity does not have speed.</dt>
</dl>
<p>In the General Relativity the gravity, that causes the fall of the bodies and explains the Celestial Mechanics, is the phenomenon of the curvature of spacetime of a local region. Spacetime is the geometric place of all the events of the Universe passed, present and future, that in a local region exists in the curved geometric variety of Lorentz of four dimensions (x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>), because its tangent spacetime is the plane of Minkowski, characterized so that speed c is an insurmountable limit and the speed of the light is invariant for all observer.</p>
<p>The curvature of spacetime of a local region the cause the existing mass-energy in that region, in agreement with the equation of Einstein G<sub>ab</sub> = 8Π G/c<sup>2</sup> T<sub>ab</sub> that gives the curvature in a point based on the mass-energy in the same one. This curvature is defined through derived partial from first and second order of the metric tensor ds<sup>2</sup> = g<sub>µν</sub> dx<sub>µ</sub>dx<sub>ν</sub>, which gives to the distance between two closely events x<sub>µ</sub> + dx<sub>µ</sub>.</p>
<p>The bodies in free fall, consequently, subjects to a field of gravitation, inertial move with accelerated movement, in curved trajectories that are geodesies under metric g<sub>µν</sub>. If this is zero then by inertia the bodies are in relative rest or relative rectilinear uniform movement, in flat spacetime. Since the gravity is not more than the distortion of the geometry of flat spacetime by the presence of the mass-energy then does not exist transmission of gravitational force between the bodies, since these travel indeed free of forces on geodesies, that are the shortest trajectories within curved spacetime, and the bodies among them not are pushing. It is the metric g<sub>µν</sub> underlying to geodesies that it distorts the straight geometry of geodesies of flat spacetime and it turns them curves. Thus, there is no class of radiation between the bodies connected within a gravity relation, equal than in the transmission of the electrical or magnetic force between electrical charges in rest or in uniforms rectilinear movement.</p>
<p>The components of the metric tensor g<sub>µν</sub> are equivalents to the gravitational potential of Newton, which multiplied by the gradient gives the acceleration that experiences a body in a point of the field of gravitation, g = ▼φ. Einstein replaces the gravitational force by a purely geometric amount Δg<sub>µν</sub>. For Newton, this acceleration, g, is the gravitational force by unit of mass applied in a determined point of the field of gravitation.</p>
<p>The components of the connection of Levi-Civita, that associates the metric with characteristics of the curvature, known like symbols of Christoffel Ґ<sup>ω</sup><sub>µν</sub>, in the application of the partial first derived from of the metric tensor, they determine by means of, a parallel transport in which is not torsion nor shortening, the form of the curve between all pair of closely events of the gravity field, in the limit that tends to 0, for example, of a stellar system like our Solar system. Really, these components are equivalents to the force of gravity field of Newton, but in Einstein is not more than the form of the curvature, and the components of the tensor of curvature of Ricci, calculated from the symbols of Christoffel, in the application of the partial second derived from the metric tensor, are equivalent to the gradient in a point of the gravity field, or change of the form of the curvature, that in General Relativity causes the free fall of the bodies, that is their movement accelerated within curved geodesies. The slope in all point and the infinitesimal change that is not of the potential of the gravity field of Newton but if of the curvature of the spacetime of the gravity field of Einstein always aim at the true position of the center of masses of the gravitational system, respect to which this center always is in rest. Thus, it is clear that the gravity does not have speed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The author, confronting this model of General Relativity with the model of the Quantum Gravity, finds that if the main source of gravity not agreeing with the center of masses of a stellar system, as it is the case of our Solar System, situation that aims to be general since a stellar system frequently will be made up of a set of stars, then it would exist a torsion force acting between the star and the planets. The speed of transmission of virtual gravitons closed c and the existing angle between the direction of the emission of virtual gravitons by the star and the center of masses of the system would cause this force. Like in our Solar system, torsion force not acting implies that the speed of virtual gravitons is sufficiently over c, so much like for to act instantaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1.2 Static gravitational field according to quantum gravity has speed</dt>
</dl>
<p>In quantum gravity although also static field of gravity is responsible by universal gravitation, nevertheless this phenomenon is the interchange of virtual gravitons between two or more bodies and since the aberration does not detect the speed of the virtual graviton must exceed c. This is physically possible because the virtual graviton does not have intrinsic mass, in agreement with the quadrivector moment p<sup>µ</sup>. Nevertheless, for the present quantum relativist physicists the speed of the graviton will be c, maximum limit of the speed, since the quantum gravity is derived from the Quantum Physics, that is the integration of Special Relativity and the Quantum Mechanics. Though c comes from Special Relativity where it only limits the speed of the bodies with intrinsic mass the relativist physicists do not make such distinction. The possibility that the graviton surpasses c was guaranteed by Doctor Carlos Lemoine Amaya, during one of my chat maintained with him, who said "if, is possible because the graviton does not have mass in rest", fact that I had not analyzed, although I was who introduced, in 1969, this thesis.</p>
<p>In 1998, the astronomer, mathematician and scientist Tom Van Flandern derived from the formulas of the Celestial Mechanics an equation that he apply to the Earth orbit and to the pulsar binary PSR1534+12 and he obtained that the speed of the gravity would be minimum 20 billion times c. Tom says: "If the gravity is taken again like a force of the nature that propagates in flat spacetime then the speed of the propagation indicated by the observation and the experiments: is no smaller than 2 x 10<sup>10</sup> c ".</p>
<dl>
<dd>In effect, to take again the flat spacetime account to its favor that the Universe topology seems that it is of curvature zero, then the space is plane. Thus, it indicates the experiment to measure the rate of change of the speed of expansion of the Universe made by Saul Perlmutter of "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", in California, USA, published in "Nature", in 1998, that was corroborated by Peter Garnavich and Robert Kirshner of "Harvard-Smithsonian Center", in Cambridge, England. Also, the measurement on the mass of the Universe made by Paulo de Bernardis, in the Boomerang project that is agrees with the result obtained by Paul Richards, of the "Maxima" project and with the result of the "Supernova Cosmology" project. Present cosmology, based in General Relativity, to establish the topology of the Universe uses the course of the expansion from Big-Bang; this depends of the density of the matter and the speed of the expansion. The possible topologies taking the superficial space are: flat (curvature 0), spherical (curvature +) and of chair to mount (curvature -). Then, curved spacetime is only a local phenomenon because as much in the infinitesimal lapses it is plane and the space in the Universe is plane.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Tom has said that if the speed of the gravity is c then the propagation of the static field would produce the phenomenon of aberration and the orbits of planets would be unstable. The contradictors of Tom say that this was solved by Faraday, Maxwell and others. It is certain that the physicists of century XIX when discovering the field, through which a distant body makes contact with another body, it eliminates the remote action of Newton. But, also it is certain, that the physicists of century XX discovered the quantum field, compound of virtual particles of the static field and of real particles of the dynamic field. And in the effect of Poynting-Robertson was established that the action through the field with finite speed causes orbital instability as Doctor Tom Van Flandern says. The Poynting-Robertson effect is the force of the pressure of the light that due to speed c, acts throughout the radius from the slowed down position of the Sun, and not from the true position of the Sun, which affects the artificial satellite orbits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The scientist Steve Carlip have said that the aberration cancels by the law of conservation of the energy and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation. Really, this argument not applies since the phenomenon of the radiation of the gravitational wave is despicable to celestial mechanic. In addition it requires of a system that generates cuadripole moment of masses and the wave would happen outside of the radioactive near field, consequently, of the orbits of the planets, which not would be affected by aberration but in long time would occur coalescence to the to lose their orbital binding energy by the radiation that gravitational waves transport.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Recently, the relativist physicists say that the force originated in the aberration, that would cause the speed c, is canceled by the gravitomagnetism, that would be a rotating flow of gravitational energy caused by the drag spacetime, in the turn movement on its axis of planets, which Einstein prognosis exists and the NASA, in the test of gravity B, it sets out to establish. Nowadays, this flow is known like inner gravitomagnetism since also the flow would exist, created by the rotation of planets around of the Sun that would be the outer gravitomagnetism. The forces originated in these flows are considered very weak forces and despicable although the scientists Martin Tajmar and Clovis de Matos, financed by the "European Space Agency", believe to have measured, in laboratory, in the 2006, the inner gravitomagnetism, very up to value of Relativity, which aims in favour of the quantum gravity. The author observes that to accept the thesis of which the aberration is cancelled by the gravitomagnetism the forces would have to act in opposite sense; no is thus, since all the planets are transferred around the Sun and turn on their axis in equal sense, then the sense of the forces of the gravitomagnetism would be agree with the sense of the forces that cause the aberration. The only exception is the turn on its axis of Venus. Thus, in general, the gravitomagnetism does not cancel the aberration but that would reinforce it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2. The speed of geometric configuration of the curvature of a spacetime local region</dt>
</dl>
<p>In General Relativity the bodies inertial follow geodesies of a certain local configuration of spacetime. The equation of Einstein: G<sub>ab</sub> = 8 Л G/c<sup>2</sup> T<sub>ab</sub> shows as the flow of energy and moment through a point of spacetime affects its curvature there, defined by means of the tensor of second order of Ricci that does not apply for the vacuum and it only gives information on the curvature for three dimensions, but also spacetime vacuum is curved within a local region according to the gravitation of a stellar system described by the tensor of Weyl that transports the information of the curvature independently of the gravitational source and completes the part of the curvature of the variety of four dimensions of spacetime of Lorentz, not specified by the tensor of Ricci.</p>
<p>The speed of this connection, well-known like the speed of the connection of the field of gravity with the bodies, would be in agreement with c and would indicate that it is the speed of the bending spacetime of a local region. This supposed speed c was excellent during the formation of the Solar System possibly due to the fragmentation and the gravitational collapse of a very gigantic interstellar dust and gas cloud, does near 4,650 million years and until about 100 million years later in which the Solar System acquired a similar actual aspect composed of the Sun, sub regions of planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, dust and interplanetary gas. In that lapse the configurations of spacetime of the local region and sub regions were formed very similar to the existing configurations nowadays. Geodesies also are updated with the relative changes of position between the bodies during their relative movements of transferring.</p>
<p>Also, it is the speed of updates of these curvatures with the very smooth changes that are happening in the flows of energy and moment within of local region due to the interaction of our Solar System with the rest of the Universe, in the processes of delivery and receipt of radiating energy.</p>
<p>In the terms of the celestial Mechanics the update of geodesies lacks importance. These changes in the configuration of spacetime require of a causal connection between the bodies, by means of the virtual graviton interchange that these, of their mass-energy, must radiate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tom Van Flandern has demonstrated that General Relativity cannot explain this connection since it lacks of virtual gravitons. Thus, Tom rejects the geometric model and assumes the model of the quantum physics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>3. The gravitational waves and their speed in agreement with the equations of field of the general relativity</dt>
</dl>
<p>Einstein considered the existence of gravitational waves in analogy with the electromagnetic waves that are produced by the acceleration of an electric charge, although, in the case of the gravity its waves would be generated by the not uniform accelerations mutually induced between the bodies source and objective, that intervenes in a gravity interaction. This would be the case of the elliptic translation of the planets around the Sun. But these gravitational waves are absolutely strange to the phenomenon of the Universal gravitation.</p>
<p>The speed of propagation of these gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein, would be c, which counts on the endorsement of the community of relativistic scientists, who even calculate can be a little smaller. The professor doctor Helmut Rechenberg, of the Institute Max Planck, in Munich, Germany, that has been director of the CERN, thus he said me in August of 2000.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What cause these not uniform accelerations? According to Einstein when at least a quadrupole mass system exists, by example, binary asymmetric Pulsars</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>General Relativity predicts the existence of radiation of gravitational waves that, in the lowest order, is proportional to the third derivative of the cuadrupole moment of the distribution of the mass-energy of a local region. This radiation is originated in the mechanical lost energy, that is to say, kinetic and/or potential, during the produced no uniform accelerations in the matter within the region. The lost energy reappears in the induced undulations of the curvature of the space-time. Due to the continuous character of space, the energy is transported from the sources to the asymptotical regions of space. During the gravitational radiation the mass of the particle does not change, of this assumption it eliminates the possibility that the particle same, with own energy, contributed for the gravitational radiation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The electromagnetic waves are generating by oscillations of two electrical or magnetic poles of equal magnitude, sign or opposite polarities together within a smallest space. In analogy the General Relativity predicts that two star oscillating ahead back must produce gravitational waves. In effect, this happens in binary pulsars. If the stars are closely together the stars of the binary system they push each one the other communicating an orbital oscillating movement. Nevertheless, this analogy between electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves are not so perfect. Whereas, electromagnetic waves propagate in the spacetime the gravitational waves are waves of the spacetime itself and whereas in electromagnetism the oscillation is symmetrical and the electromagnetic waves are spherical waves, in the gravity the waves are not as those of the sea and it require of asymmetric sources. This is the case for binary pulsar with forms ellipsoids and/or elliptical orbits. In these pulsars with the variation of the time take place within the dipole variations of the common center of masses; this produces cuadrupole that reunites the relation of the energy of four nonsymmetrical angular moments of two masses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These not uniform accelerations is believed disturb the continuous 4-Lorentzian structure of a local region but very weakly, so much that according to the calculations of the general relativity not even the gravitational waves produced by the asymmetric explosion of a supernova, are capable to accelerate in a level detectable to any another star.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The emission of these gravitational waves would cause certain loss of the orbital angular moment for the binary Pulsars. In effect, the orbit light decays for the PSR1913+16 of according to the prediction of Einstein about such gravity emission. This constitutes the indirect only test about its existence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a next future, the projects LIGO, of US, GEO, of Germany, VIRGO, of Italy-France or TAMA of the Japan must will discovery the gravitational waves and will establish the speed of gravitational waves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is radiation of the binary pulsars really gravitational radiation?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The doctor Tom Van Flandern formulated, that waves radiated by the binary Pulsars are not waves of gravity but if some form of electromagnetism. Tom Van Flandern ratified, this concept, to the author by means of E-MAIL of 1/11/2000.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In 2002, the scientific Lee Samuel Finn and Patrick J. Sutton of the Center for Gravitational Wave Physics, of the University of the State of the Pennsylvania, USA combined the rates of orbital decay of binary pulsars PSR B1913+16 and PSR B1534+12 and they obtained that mass of the real graviton is maximum less than 1.35342 × 10<sup>-52</sup> grams, with a 90% of confidence. This value is much closed to superior limit of the mass of the real photon which is less than 10<sup>-51</sup> grams, in agreement with calculation, made by the scientific Jun Luo and its colleagues in the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, in 2003. And very far from the value superior limit of mass of the real graviton less than 4.5 × 10<sup>-66</sup> grams, estimated by the scientific S S Gershtein, A A Logunov and M A Mestvirishvili, in 1997, with base in the observed parameters of the expansion of the Universe.</dd>
<dd>The rate of orbital decay of binary pulsar Hulse-Taylor, PSR B1913+16, is agrees with predicted by General Relativity with an error of approximately + 0.3%. However, this minimum error can lead to reject thesis of which this is gravitational radiation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which is the physics of the gravitational wave of the spacetime?</dd>
<dd>The author emphasizes the very serious problem of the physics of the wave of the spacetime itself that would be the gravitational wave according to Einstein.</dd>
<dd>The movement of the particles and the propagation of the electromagnetic wave happens within a frame that is the spacetime with dimensions x, y, z, t.</dd>
<dd>If gravitational waves are ripples of spacetime then which is the frame of the gravitational wave?. How is it possible to speak of wave? Speed?</dd>
<dd>The first concept, that is necessary to verify, is geometric concept since always the variation of n dimensions generate n+1 dimensions. Is penta continuous geometric frame the Einstein’s gravitational wave frame?.</dd>
<dd>In that case would be impossible experimentally to measure anything on gravitational wave because is impossible from four dimensions to access fifth dimension.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4 The experiment of Sergei Kopeikin</dt>
</dl>
<p>However, the speed of the gravitational waves would be 1.06c, with an error between 10% and until 20%, in agreement with the experiment of intercontinental radio-Interferometry, that combined 10 radio telescopes on a vast distance in order to form a giant antenna able to capture very remote radio waves and obtain a set image, made, the 8 of September of 2002, by the team of astronomers directed by the scientific Sergei Kopeikin, of the university of Missouri, in Columbia, and Edward Fomalont, a radio astronomer of National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which speed of gravity?. In agreement, with the email that in answer received the author of doctor Kopeikin, the 11 of January of 2003, 20:43, really this speed are not the speed of the gravitational waves anticipated by Einstein, but if the change of the gravitational Jupiter field, throughout the trajectory of the radio ray, between quasar J0842+1835 and the barycentre of the Solar System, as a result of its accelerated movement does not uniform with respect to this quasar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which change of the gravitational field?. The model of gravity of Kopeikin introduces a force, produced by something that it transmits and in this sense, Kopeikin does transition to the quantum theory. Since, in this model through the gravity field it transmits moment between Jupiter and the radio waves ray.</dd>

<dd>The force that speaks Kopeikin is a species of preformation, inside the gravity field nearby, of the wave gravity that occurs far away. Therefore, this force neither moves to the celestial bodies in its translations around other, of the model of the celestial mechanics of the general theory of the relativity. This force in the near field of gravity static would be originated with the speed c. In addition, as preformation of the wave gravity should possess the same speed of this wave, that if is the gravitational wave of Einstein. This was that Kopeikin proposed to measure, with the object he confirms the theory relativist of Einstein. That is to say, the preformation of the wave of gravity remits to Kopeikin to the wave of gravity of Einstein.</dd>
<dd>Kopeikin said, "The gravitational waves are inherent in the zone of radiation (distant) of a system that is emitting the waves. Nevertheless, the waves of gravity do not spread freely inside the interior of the zone of not radiation (nearby) of the system. But, the process of generation of the gravitational waves produces effects retarded in the nearby zone that appears mainly as a force in the equations of movement of the relativity for bodies extended, inside a system of astronomical gravity. The existence of that force is the consequence of the finite speed of the propagation of the gravity."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kopeikin said “The existence of this force was proven by J. H. Taylor in 1994", a year before Taylor gained the Nobel prize of physics by its most shining investigations on binary pulsars. Taylor found the existence of a force that according to Kopeikin can be generated in the near radioactive field of gravity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kopeikin took the model of Schwarzschild of the spherical symmetrical static gravity field but in its mathematician model includes the Shapiro retards of the Sun, the Land and Jupiter, also, the transverse retard of the moment that the gravity static field would transmit, as result of the finite speed of the preformation of the gravitational wave. According to Shapiro the pulses of the electromagnetic currents of radiation suffer a retard, in front of its rectilinear path, directly proportional to the value of the curvature of the space-time of a region local that cross. :</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kopeikin with its explanation of the deflection devises a mixed model of the phenomenon of gravity that would be then geometric effect of the curvature of the space-time and quantum effect of the gravitational wave. Thus, Kopeikin reformulates the general relativity in quantum terms¡. This does none reach still with success.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the explication of Einstein of deflection the gravitational field is not transmit a force and, therefore, has not speed. The static gravitational field is indeed the force absence. This phenomenon would be the simple consequence of the curvature of the space-time The measurements made in the past of the deflection by the Sun talk about the effect of the gravitational potential on the electromagnetic waves, that is to say, deflection is caused by the curvature of the space-time, that in its proximity causes a spherical body, on the electromagnetic ray that inertial follows such curvature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kopeikin it proposed to use the quantum effect of the preformation of the gravitational wave in the deflection of the Jupiter gravity of the originating radio waves of quasar J0842+1835, that according to him must depend on the speed of propagation of the gravity. Doctor Kopeikin says: "If the speed of gravity were infinite quasar he would appear to circulate in the sky to the Jupiter passage. But, if the speed of gravity is finite quasar will have to appear elliptical ". For, to carry out this Kopeikin calculation rewrote the equations of general relativity, concerning the deflection, in such a way that the terms of the speed of gravity, masses and speeds of Jupiter and J0842+1835 during its visual alignment of the 8 of September of 2002. Kopeikin hoped this way to obtain the speed of the gravitational wave.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kopeikin design your experiment, very similar to that, in 1919, permitted to verify the prediction of Einstein of the deflection that suffers a ray of light originating from a star by the gravity of the Sun. Although in this case, a quasar replaced the star, the Sun by Jupiter and the ray of light by a radio waves ray. In addition, his objective was not to establish the deflection that the radio waves ray suffers by the gravity but if the speed of gravity. Kopeikin takes Jupiter by the Sun for to eliminate the retard that causes the solar plasma when it interacts with the photons that compose the rays of the electromagnetic wave. This retard is very difficult to measure and constitutes the main problem to obtain a dependable result of the deflection and for Kopeikin the speed of gravity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The experiment of Sergei Kopeikin eludes to confront the debate scientific that in the terms of the speed of gravity requires first theoretically to resolves if the gravity is according to the relativity general of Einstein or to the quantum gravity theory. And second, to design a crucial experiment for to establish the speed of transport of the force of interaction between the source and the objective gravity, that gravity static field transports.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The scientific Paul Marmet and C Couture, of the Department of Physics of the University of Ottawa, by means of E-MAIL of May 15, 2003, 18:05, respond my consultation about if solar plasma affected the experiment of Kopeikin. They are authors of a magnificent study on the deflection of the electromagnetic rays of radio-waves by the plasma of the Sun. They declared, "We read that Sergei Kopeikin compared the speed of light near Jupiter with the speed of light after its retard proper to the plasma near Jupiter. He found that the difference is too much small measuring it (same value of c). You should announce that at present has been measured is the speed of light. This is not the speed of gravity." Therefore, Kopeikin does not have measured the speed of gravity.</p>
<dl>
<dt>5 Is superluminal the speed of gravitational wave in near field?.</dt>
</dl>
<p>The scientific William D. Walker, of the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH-Visby, Department of Electrical Engineering, in Sweden, carried out an experiment that indicates that the electromagnetic fields spread superluminal in the field close to an electromagnetic source of waves constituted by a dipole electric oscillating. Walker found that the transverse electric component travel to infinite speed since the first quarter of the formation of the electromagnetic wave. This speed decreases progressively until c, very closed to the moment in which it completes the first length of the electromagnetic wave, and remains constant of there.</p>
<p>This result is consistent with the theoretical model for the propagation of the electric field and the magnetic field, in the nearby field of the dipole electric oscillating, that Walker obtained of the electrodynamics standard theory.</p>
<p>Due to the similarity between the theoretical model of the dipole electric oscillating and that of two oscillating masses that radiates gravitational waves, in the sense of Einstein, Walker foresees that these waves in the nearby field spread, also, with a superluminal speed.</p>
<p>If for the propagation of the wave of gravity in near field, the contradictory results, obtained by the einstenian relativist Kopeikin and the revisionist Walker, are formally analyzed, it has that the experiments throw the result that the theoretical model predicted according to the intention that its author had. This remit us to that the fundamental thing in the measurement of the speed of gravity is the theory in which the same it base.</p>
<dl>
<dt>6 Witch is speed of gravitational waves?</dt>
</dl>
<p>General Relativity, with their conception of pseudo force of gravity and the Quantum Mechanics, with their conception of the other fundamental forces like real interaction forces, are incongruous and incompatible theories. Bridge that unfruitful has treated to tend between both is the quantum gravity. Nowadays it is had the theories of the gravidynamics quantum (QGD) for the force of gravity in the quantum scale and General Relativity for the force of gravity in the scale of macrocosms. But, neither in the terms of the theory of General Relativity, nor of the alternative metric theories, nor of the quantum gravity theories as the theory of Supergravity, with base in the quantum field, and in the theories of All the Things, with base in the superstrings, an integral and universal quantum theory of gravity exists at the moment. Therefore, a true quantum theory does not exist either about the gravitational wave, is to say of the real graviton in spite of the quantization in real gravitons of the gravitational radiation of geometric origin, predicted by General Relativity</p>
<p>In the 2001, the scientific Valery Nesvizhevsky of the Institute Laue-Langevin found for first time quantum effects of the neutron gravity that moved through jumps, from a height to another one, in a field of gravitation, as it is predicted by quantum gravity. And in the 2007 NASA has planned the launching and its terrestrial orbit collocation of Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope whose intention is to measure the interaction between the virtual graviton and the gamma rays during its trip in the space.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the gravity is also like the other three fundamental forces, an interaction force and consequently the gravity is a real force and not a pseudo force. "Two particles are attracted gravitationally because continuously they interchange virtual gravitons". Therefore, the gravitational interaction between particles happens through the infinitesimal virtual graviton that all existing particle, from its mass-energy, produces and with which it tends to occupy to the infinite all the points of the three-dimensional space at all moment of the time, giving rise to the static field of gravitational vectorial force, that must generate gravitational waves due to a great contribution of energy to this field that maybe be by transformation de mechanical energy of binary pulsars or other energy form from macro celestial phenomenons. In quantum gravity the real graviton would result of very energetics virtual graviton. The speed of virtual and real gravitons must be equal in analogy with some speed between virtual and real photons.</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, with base in the ideas about quantum gravity of the scientific Andrei Saharov, M Vasiliev, and K Staniukovich, in Bogota, Colombia, in 1969, I formulated and published my theory about that the speed of gravity is superluminal. The foundations of this theory are:</dd>
<dd>1. All the existing particles in the nature have inertia, that is, according to cuadri- vector -moment as the particles of the matter with mass greater than 0 as the particles of the energy with mass equal than 0.</dd>
<dd>2. The inverse dependency of the speed of particles of the magnitude of its inertia is a law of the nature.</dd>
<dd>3. The inertia of particles of energy of the waves is not just like the inertia of particles of the matter. Inertia in the matter is caused by the action-reaction law between the mass of particles of the matter and the vacuum and the inertia of the energy is caused by the absorption-emission law between the vacuum and the energy of the particles that compose the electromagnetic and gravitational waves. The particles interact with the vacuum because the vacuum is filled with free fields of its sources.</dd>
<dd>4. The inertia of the energy depends of the frequency of the absorption-emission during the propagation of waves in vacuum. The process of absorption is of energy of real particles of waves that cause virtual particles of vacuum passes to real particles and the back process emission of energy is of real particles passes to virtual particles. The absorption-emission consumes time that contains the passage of the waves. This mechanism of interaction of the electromagnetic and gravitational waves with vacuum and its effect on the speed of propagation of these waves is similar to the mechanism of interaction between the electromagnetic wave with atoms of the matter and that reduction of its speed c, that in several experiments has been managed to take zero. The pioneering scientific Lene Hau, in February of 1999, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, pull the light down to 17 meters by second and in the 2001, light was stopped by two different groups of scientists, in the universities of Harvard and Colorado in Boulder, USA. In consequence the contention of the waves by the vacuum is inverse dependent of the frequency of the absorption-emission between the waves and the vacuum. This inertia is increased so much with the greater energy of component particles of the waves that increases its frequency of interaction with vacuum, like with the greater density of the energy of the vacuum that increases its interaction with the waves. Consequently, the interaction of the electromagnetic and gravitational waves with the fields of the vacuum is dependent of the energy of photons and gravitons.</dd>
<dd>5. In the 2001, in the electromagnetic field, this is, for the phenomenon of the electromagnetic energy, the scientific Dimitri Nanopoulos of the Theoretical Physics Division of the Academy of Athens, Nikolaos Mavromatos of King's Collage, in London, and John Ellis of the European for Center Particle Physics (CERN), in Geneva, discovered a new expression for the speed of light, the one that depends on its frequency, that is to say, of their energy in agreement with the relation to greater energy smaller speed. This discovery will be confirmed in project GLAST</dd>
<dd>6. The maximum value of the equivalent energy in mass of the real photon is less that 10<sup>(-51)</sup> grams, in agreement with its more recent calculation of the 2003, made by the scientific Jun Luo and its colleagues in the Huazhong University of science and technology in Wuhan, China and the maximum value of the equivalent energy in mass of the real graviton would be less that 4.5 × 10 <sup>(-66)</sup> grams, considered by the scientific S S Gershtein, A A Logunov and M A Mestvirishvili, in 1997, with base in the observed parameters of the expansion of the Universe.</dd>
<dd>7. The speed of the real graviton is greater than the speed of the real photon because the graviton is less inertial than the photon. Also, the speed of the virtual graviton is greater than the speed of the real graviton and speed of the virtual photon is greater than the speed of the real photon by the same cause. Particle in nature with the least mount of energy must to have the highest speed.</dd>
<dd>8. For the vacuum, with refractive index = 1, the speed of gravity is maximum 2.2222 × 10<sup>(10)</sup> × c, in agreement with the equation of Cramer-Collins, fit by the author with the considerations of Schaefer for the speed of photon and the measurement of Tom Van Flandern for the speed of gravity.</dd>
<dd>9. Since 1992, in the University of Colony, Germany, the scientific Günter Nimtz has been produced very weak electromagnetic waves that propagate up c. Doctor Nimtz explains them like virtual photons. These are evanescent waves, because its number of wave is an imaginary value and take place by the microwaves pass through of dielectric photonic barriers that are of two types. The first type of barrier is constituted by the central part of the guided waves, which is a sufficiently narrow section, less than half of the wavelength in both directions, perpendicular to the propagation, through which they only pass the very low frequencies of wave. The other type of barrier is the double prisms in which the microwaves undergo total reflection within the entrance prism and the very low remainder that is refracted pass through a hollow of air to the exit prism. The evanescent waves in their pass by the barrier do not spend time, since they do not present change of phase, and is the cause of their superluminal speeds. In both cases is the refraction with maximum limit of .001 from the energy of the source waves. Apparently Doctor Nimtz has found that the virtual photons have superluminal speeds that surpass several times speed c of the real photon.</dd>
<dd>10. In 2007, in project GLAST, NASA it will establish if the gamma rays, which had are their high inertia, when interacting with the quantum gravitational field, travel in the vacuum under c. the opposite also will have to be certain, then the NASA indirectly will prove the theory of the author that he exposed in 1969, approaches that the graviton has greater speed than the photon, because the graviton has minor energy, that is, minor inertia and graviton also interacts with the field of gravitation.</dd>
