<p><b>Alfred Waterhouse</b> (<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a> – <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>) was an <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a>, particularly associated with the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_revival.html" title="Gothic revival">Gothic revival</a>.

Financially speaking, Waterhouse was probably the most successful of all Victorian architects. Though expert within Gothic and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_architecture.html" title="Renaissance architecture">Renaissance</a> styles, Waterhouse never limited himself to a single architectural style.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Waterhouse_27be.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Waterhouse was born on the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">19th July</a> <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a> in <a href="../../../a/i/g/Aigburth.html" title="Aigburth">Aigburth</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, the son of wealthy mill-owning <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Society_of_Friends_321e.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> parents. He was educated at the Quaker run Grove School in <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottenham.html" title="Tottenham">Tottenham</a> near <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. He studied architecture under Richard Lane at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Manchester_aff5.html" title="University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, and spent much of his youth travelling in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and studying in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Upon his return to England, Alfred set up his own architectural practice in Manchester.</p>
<p>Waterhouse continued to practice in Manchester for 12 years, until moving his practice to London in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>. Waterhouse's earliest commissions were for domestic buildings, but his success as a designer of public buildings was assured in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a> when he won the open competition for the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_assize_courts.html" title="Manchester assize courts">Manchester Assize Courts</a> (now demolished). This work not only showed his ability to plan a complicated building on a large scale, but also marked him out as a champion of the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic</a> cause.</p>
<p>In 1860, he married Elizabeth Hodgkin (1834-1918) sister of the historian <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Hodgkin_%28historian%29_fb9c.html" title="Thomas Hodgkin (historian)">Thomas Hodgkin</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Waterhouse_27be.html" title="Edit section: London practice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">London practice</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, Waterhouse was one of the architects selected to compete for the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Courts_of_Justice_a594.html" title="Royal Courts of Justice">Royal Courts of Justice</a>. The new <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Club_3b01.html" title="University Club">University Club</a> was undertaken in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> and nine years after his work on the Manchester Assize Courts, another competition secured for Waterhouse the design of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Town_Hall_417f.html" title="Manchester Town Hall">Manchester Town Hall</a>, where he was able to show a firmer and more original handling of the Gothic style. The same year he was involved in rebuilding part of <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caius_College%2C_Cambridge_3fc7.html" title="Caius College, Cambridge">Caius College, Cambridge</a>; this was not his first university work, for he had already worked on <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balliol_College%2C_Oxford_8bce.html" title="Balliol College, Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a>, and the new buildings of the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Union_a17e.html" title="Cambridge Union">Cambridge Union</a> Society, in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>.</p>
<p>At Caius, out of deference to the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_architecture.html" title="Renaissance architecture">Renaissance</a> treatment of the older parts of the college, ths Gothic element was intentionally mingled with classic detail, while Balliol and <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembroke_College%2C_Cambridge_7657.html" title="Pembroke College, Cambridge">Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>, which followed in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, are typical of the style of his mid career with Gothic tradition tempered by individual taste and by adaptation to modern needs. <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girton_College_a292.html" title="Girton College">Girton College</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, a building of simpler type, dates originally from the same period (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>), but has been periodically enlarged by further buildings. Two important domestic works were undertaken in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> respectively — <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eaton_Hall_%28Cheshire%29_0d7a.html" title="Eaton Hall (Cheshire)">Eaton Hall</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> for the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Westminster_24df.html" title="Duke of Westminster">Duke of Westminster</a>, and Heythrop Hall, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxfordshire.html" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, the latter a restoration of a fairly strict classic type.</p>
<p>Waterhouse received, without competition, the commission to build the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_History_Museum_6eb4.html" title="Natural History Museum">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Kensington_e38b.html" title="South Kensington">South Kensington</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>–<a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>), a design which marks an epoch in the modern use of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architectural_terracotta.html" title="Architectural terracotta">architectural terracotta</a> and which was to become his best known work. Waterhouse's other works in London included the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Liberal_Club_54e4.html" title="National Liberal Club">National Liberal Club</a> (a study in Renaissance composition), <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_Hospital_51ce.html" title="University College Hospital">University College Hospital</a>, the Surveyors' Institution in London's Great George Street (<a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>), and the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea%2C_London_7702.html" title="Chelsea, London">Chelsea</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>).</p>
<p>From the late <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860s.html" title="1860s">1860s</a>, Waterhouse lived in the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading</a> area and was responsible for several significant buildings there. These included his own residences of <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxhill_House_1c2d.html" title="Foxhill House">Foxhill House</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>) and Yattendon Court (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>), together with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Reading_44f7.html" title="Museum of Reading">Reading Town Hall</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a>) and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_School_e906.html" title="Reading School">Reading School</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>). Foxhill House is still in use by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Reading_894e.html" title="University of Reading">University of Reading</a>, as are his Whiteknights House (built for his father) and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_English_Rural_Life_2206.html" title="Museum of English Rural Life">East Thorpe House</a> (built in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a> for <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Palmer_13d8.html" title="Alfred Palmer">Alfred Palmer</a>).</p>

<p>For the <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prudential_plc.html" title="Prudential plc">Prudential Assurance Company</a>, Waterhouse designed many offices, including their Holborn Bars head office in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holborn.html" title="Holborn">Holborn</a> and branch offices in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton.html" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham.html" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>.
