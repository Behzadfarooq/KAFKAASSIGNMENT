	    <p>Alfonso Domenico Carnucci was born on the 3rd of October in the year 1981 in Washington D.C. Both his mother, Eugenia Migale (later to be changed under U.S. law to Carnucci) as well as his father, Salvatore Carnucci (never to be changed because he is a man) were born in the small township of Cutro, located in Calabria, Italy. Little is known of the childhood life of Alfonso aside from his love of rocks. Due to this love of rocks as well as a lack of economic resources, Alfonso would often be seen playing with rocks in the dirt road adjacent to his house as well as during recess at J.C. Parks Elementary School, where he began a modest academic career. When fortune fell his way as a youth, he was allowed to play with heads of lettuce. This proved to be a generous turn of fate as when he would build up an appetite after playing, he could simply eat his toy. Rumors swirled of his being a fan of collectables. Alfonso did indeed have a car collection that contain upwards of 75-80 name brand cars and trucks of which he was only allowed to play with 2 of them at a time. Other collections of his included football cards, rocks, and pencils. All of these were fun for Alfonso to look through in his spare time. His summers were spent dusting, vacuuming, door-washing, bar-cleaning, and mail-checking indoors as well as picking up sticks, getting groceries from the van, and mowing the lawn outdoors. One weekend a year he was fortunate enough to help put mulch across the beds of flowers in his yard. Also, he was fortunate to be able to aid his parents in picking upwards of 15 bushels of tomatoes in one day so that the subsequent weekend he could help his mother make tomato sauce from scratch to survive the harsh winters of Waldorf, Md. Upon graduation from J.C. Parks Elementary school, Alfonso attended Matthew Alexander Henson Middle School where he continued his monotonous education. Socially, Alfonso had one girlfriend in his 12 years of life. During the summer of 1994, Alfonso had a brain anyeurism. This would be the turning point in his life as his skull was placed back together with screws and plates made of titanium. It was the presence of these plates that allowed Alfonso to flourish socially as his next full year of school proved him to be a pimp. Girls were always on the phone with Alfonso. In that one year, Alfonso had upwards of 11 girlfriends. The names of these girls cannot all be remembered as is part of the definition of a pimp. He learned his lessons of breaking numerous hearts and vowed to think a little more before acting with regards to the ladies. Upon graduating from Matthew Alexander Henson Middle School, Alfonso took off his pants and spent the summer preparing for his four years at Maurice J. McDonough Senior High School. It was here that his life was to start shaping how he would be remembered. At the ripe age of 15, he chose to stop working at home for free and was hired at a local Italian chain restaurant. He continued to do well scholastically with the addition of paid work and searched for a further challenge. This challenge was found his last year of high school as he became a male cheerleader. The name Alfonso Carnucci was no longer associated with his three brothers (Frankie Thomas, Anthony Joseph, and Salvatore Carnucci Jr.) who were, and still are, all known for their looks and charm. He became what no Carnucci before him had been....a male cheerleader. This seemed to be the pinnacle of his senior year as the name Alfonso spread throughout not just his high school, but all of Charles County high schools. Upon graduation from high school, Alfonso continued to have girlfriends and lived an honorable life. His scholastic career dissipated until 2006. It was then that Alfonso turned back to school, and not just any school, a university. Among classmates of whom he was easily 6 years thier elder, he continued to perfom in his classes in manners that were unheard of for a man missing 30% of his brain (due to the anyeurism). His work life no longer consisted of the devilish Italian chain restaurant or their Carribean cousin, but now consisted of an upscale restaurant which consistantly received positive reviews. It is now, at his current age of 25 that he feels blessed with all his life which consists of his parents, brothers, sister (J-Me), nephew and niece (Nico and Aysa, respectively), and his beautiful girlfriend, the heffer.</p>
