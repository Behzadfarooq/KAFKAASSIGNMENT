<p>Alfie was a cheeky <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> chappie who was good at having a laugh with his mates and dispensing advice to anyone who needed him. He tended to put up a front and hide his true emotions as he never wanted to upset anyone. He was also well known for his catchphrase 'Shut up, you muppet' and his unique dress sense for colourful shirts.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfie_Moon_00e3.html" title="Edit section: First episode">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First episode</span></h2>
<p>Alfie Moon was introduced to <i>EastEnders</i> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">21 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. He made his entrance to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Square_f1ed.html" title="Albert Square">Albert Square</a> by being chucked off the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> for train fare evasion, and soon caused havoc in the marketplace by getting a refund from Winston for a video he stole and tricking <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Fowler_%28EastEnders%29_7324.html" title="Martin Fowler (EastEnders)">Martin Fowler</a> into giving him free fruit. He also lied to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Butcher_eb03.html" title="Ricky Butcher">Ricky Butcher</a> in the café about needing a mechanic for his car, pretended to have left his wallet at home, and left Ricky to pay his bill.</p>
<p>After acquainting himself with a few of the Square's residents, he sneaked into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Queen_Vic_1098.html" title="The Queen Vic">The Queen Vic</a> and helped himself to a drink behind the bar. The landlady, <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Mitchell_6b4e.html" title="Peggy Mitchell">Peggy Mitchell</a>, jumped to the conclusion that Alfie was Chris Wright, the new manager an agency was sending. Alfie took advantage of the misunderstanding to commit identity fraud against Wright.</p>
<p>Alfie packed any stock he could find in a binbag, ready to do a runner. Potman <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Branning_4fec.html" title="Jim Branning">Jim Branning</a> caught him, but assumed Alfie was throwing away outdated stock and tricked Alfie into giving him a pint on the house. Winston, Martin, Ricky and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Mitchell_%28EastEnders%29_c42f.html" title="Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)">Sam Mitchell</a> found that Alfie had been feeding them all different background stories. However, Alfie managed to worm his way out of the tricky situation by reconciling the inconsistent stories. Later, Alfie advised Martin on how to woo his girlfriend Alison.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode, Alfie answered the phone to the real Chris Wright, told him the position was filled and hung up, revealing his intention to stay.</p>

<p>Alfie's parents were killed in a car crash on <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrove_Tuesday_ab97.html" title="Shrove Tuesday">Shrove Tuesday</a>; the Moons commemorate their death each year. Although young, he took responsibility for his hapless younger brother <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_Moon_ec08.html" title="Spencer Moon">Spencer</a> and his senile grandmother <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria__Nana__Moon_9880.html" title="Victoria &quot;Nana&quot; Moon">Victoria</a>, widely known as Nana, who arrived unannounced in Albert Square and moved into The Queen Vic, much to Alfie's dismay.</p>
<p>Parts of Alfie's past are much murkier. He spent three years in prison for a credit card scam after taking the rap for his cousins <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Moon_fea2.html" title="Danny Moon">Danny</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Moon_2c56.html" title="Jake Moon">Jake</a>; he pretended his parole officer was an ex-girlfriend. He was also blackmailed by bent ex-copper <a href="../../../d/o/u/Dougie_Slade_a401.html" title="Dougie Slade">Dougie Slade</a>, who revealed Alfie's true identity to Peggy, forcing the Moons to flee Walford with the Vic's takings. However, Alfie subsequently left the money on Peggy's doorstep addressed to "The Duchess", his term of endearment for her.</p>
<p>Peggy managed to track Alfie down, and after he confided in her about his parents' death, she gave him another chance. Alfie reluctantly accepted her proposal and left his past behind him, at least until the arrival of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kat_Moon_e31c.html" title="Kat Moon">Kat Slater</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Despite it being revealed that Alfie served time for credit card <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walford.html" title="Walford">Walford</a> residents still adored him. He shared a very close friendship to barmaid Kat Slater, and he fell in love with her. After months of harbouring his secret, he decided to tell her everything, but she came home from a trip to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engagement.html" title="Engagement">engaged</a> to local gangster <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Hunter_8092.html" title="Andy Hunter">Andy Hunter</a>. Just before the wedding, Kat visited Alfie's ill grandmother, Victoria, in hospital, and, falsely believing she was asleep, admitted to loving Alfie. Victoria told her grandson this news upon his next visit, and he rushed to the ceremony to confess his true feelings to Kat just as she was about to be married. The pair risked their lives by jilting Andy at the altar, but when Andy was battered by some heavies, they took him in and nursed him to health.</p>
<p>Kat had set her heart on marrying the following month on Christmas Day 2003, so Alfie had to visit his wife, <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liza_Moon_85b2.html" title="Liza Moon">Liza</a>, in secret to get a divorce. She eventually agreed to divorce him, and Kat and Alfie married in The Vic on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>After just five months of running The Queen Vic, Alfie borrowed several thousand pounds from Andy to bail out Kat's father, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Slater_fde4.html" title="Charlie Slater">Charlie</a>, who had been arrested for battering <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Foster_a147.html" title="Graham Foster">Graham Foster</a>, the man who <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">raped</a> Charlie's daughter <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Mo_Mitchell_8d40.html" title="Little Mo Mitchell">Little Mo</a>, but Andy turned nasty and began to demand sums of cash every week, which he knew Alfie couldn't afford. Andy's plan to wreck the Moons' marriage started to work, and the strain grew strong. Andy offered Kat a chance to pay off the whole debt easily — by sleeping with him. She reluctantly went through with it just as, unbeknownst to her, Alfie had finally handed over all the money. Andy kept the money and gave Alfie a video tape of him and Kat having sex. The marriage quickly started to rip apart, and after Kat's boozy antics, Alfie threw her out, and she went to stay with a friend.</p>
<p>Between the split in November 2004 and Kat coming home to Walford in May 2005, Alfie started a fond relationship with Kat's sister, Little Mo, whose own marriage to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Mitchell_%28EastEnders%29_018e.html" title="Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)">Billy Mitchell</a> had fallen apart after she had refused to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abort</a> the child which was conceived after her rape. Alfie helped Mo bring up her baby, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Mitchell_%28EastEnders%29_f323.html" title="Freddie Mitchell (EastEnders)">Freddie Mitchell</a>, and the pair had decided to announce that they were becoming an item, when Kat walked back into their lives. They decided to delay their relationship until things cooled down, but Kat made it clear that she wanted Alfie back. They grew a strong attraction and Alfie was secretly torn between the two sisters, eventually choosing Kat. He let Mo down gently, and they gave each other a final goodbye hug, which Mo's estranged husband Billy (the only other person to know of their secret romance) mistook for them getting together. In the pub, Billy drunkenly announced a congratulations to Alfie and Little Mo, blowing the secret. Kat blew a fuse, and after a dramatic showdown, decided not to get together with Alfie, so as not to break her sister's heart.</p>
<p>However, the couple continued to grow closer, due to Kat's relationship with Alfie's grandmother, who was dying. After Kat helped Alfie complete some of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Moon_f50f.html#Wish_list" title="Victoria Moon">Victoria's final wishes</a> and overcome her death on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, it was obvious that they longed for each other. Alfie announced that he was leaving to drive across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> (purchasing a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Capri_8569.html" title="Ford Capri">Ford Capri</a> for this purpose), and it seemed that he had gone when he waved goodbye to a tearful Kat on Christmas Day 2005. After getting drunk and drowning her sorrows in the pub, Kat was stunned to walk outside and see Alfie waiting for her. She jumped in the car with him, bare-footed, and they drove off together.</p>
