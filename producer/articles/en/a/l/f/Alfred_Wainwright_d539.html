<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Wainwright_d539.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Alfred Wainwright was born in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn.html" title="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, into a family which was relatively poor, mostly due to his <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonemasonry.html" title="Stonemasonry">stonemason</a> father's alcoholism. He did very well at school (first in nearly every subject)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> although he left at the age of 13. While most of his classmates were obliged to find employment in the local mills, Wainwright started work as an office boy in Blackburn <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borough_status_in_the_United_Kingdom_64a7.html" title="Borough status in the United Kingdom">Borough</a> Engineer's Department. He spent several further years studying at night school, gaining qualifications in <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accountancy.html" title="Accountancy">accountancy</a> which enabled him to further his career at the Borough Council. Even when a child Wainwright walked a great deal, up to 20 miles at a time; he also showed a great interest in <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawing.html" title="Drawing">drawing</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartography.html" title="Cartography">cartography</a>, producing his own maps of England and his local area.</p>
<p>In 1930, at the age of 23, Wainwright saved up enough money for a week's walking holiday in the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_District_79ed.html" title="Lake District">Lake District</a> with his cousin Eric Beardsall. They arrived in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windermere_%28town%29.html" title="Windermere (town)">Windermere</a> and climbed the nearby hill <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrest_Head_8bc1.html" title="Orrest Head">Orrest Head</a>, where Wainwright saw his first view of the Lakeland <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fell.html" title="Fell">fells</a>. This moment marked the start of what he would later describe as his love affair with the Lake District. In 1931 he married his first wife, Ruth Holden, a local mill worker, with whom he had a son Peter, but the marriage ended when she walked out circa 1958.<sup id="_ref-smithsonian_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smithsonian" title="">[2]</a></sup> (Later in life he would meet and marry Betty, also a divorcee, who eventually carried his ashes to the top of <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haystacks_%28mountain%29.html" title="Haystacks (mountain)">Haystacks</a>.)</p>
<p>In 1941 Wainwright was able to move closer to the fells when he took a job (and with it a pay cut) at the Borough Treasurer's office in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendal.html" title="Kendal">Kendal</a>. He lived and worked in the town for the rest of his life, serving as Borough Treasurer from 1948 until he retired in 1967.</p>

Book One of the <i>Pictorial Guide</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wainwright started work on the first page of his <i><a href="../../../p/i/c/Pictorial_Guide_to_the_Lakeland_Fells_cefd.html" title="Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells">Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells</a></i> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_9.html" title="November 9">9 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> He planned the precise scope and content of the seven volumes from the start, and worked conscientiously and meticulously on the series for the next 13 years at the rate of one page per evening.</p>
<p>According to Wainwright in his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> <i>Fellwanderer</i>, he initially planned the series for his own interest rather than with any intention of publication. When he did come to publish his first book it was <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-publishing.html" title="Self-publishing">privately</a> through a local printer, as he could not face the prospect of finding a publisher; however, his friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, took charge of publicity and administration and his name appears as publisher on the early editions. This arrangement continued for the first editions of the next three books in the series, after which they were taken over by the local newspaper <i>The Westmorland Gazette</i> in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendal.html" title="Kendal">Kendal</a>. Wainwright's books were in turn taken over by Michael Joseph in the 1990s. When they ceased publication in 2003,<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2657249.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2657249.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> the rights were bought by Frances Lincoln.<a href="http://www.wainwright.org.uk/article/030214_franceslincoln.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wainwright.org.uk/article/030214_franceslincoln.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Pictorial Guides</i> are currently being updated, for the first time since their original publication, to take account of changed conditions on the fells. The revisions are being made by Chris Jesty, who uses an imitation of Wainwright's hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of 2006</a> the first three books in the series had been issued in a revised edition, with the project planned for completion in 2012.</p>

<p>Wainwright followed the Pictorial Guides in 1968 with the <i>Pennine Way Companion</i>, applying the same detailed approach to Britain's first long-distance footpath. This was for many years a leading guide to the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennine_Way_bc78.html" title="Pennine Way">Pennine Way</a>, rivalling the official guide book by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Stephenson_0c28.html" title="Tom Stephenson">Tom Stephenson</a>. Wainwright's book consists of a continuous strip map of the route with accompanying commentary, with an unusual quirk: because the route goes from south to north (bottom to top on a <a href="../../../m/a/p/Map.html" title="Map">map</a>), contrary to normal reading order, the map and commentary start at the bottom of the last page and work upwards and backwards towards the front of the book. The guide was prepared with the aid of four helpers (Harry Appleyard, Len Chadwick, Cyril Moore and Lawrence Smith) and its preparation was affected by the major outbreaks of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_and_mouth_disease.html" title="Foot and mouth disease">foot and mouth disease</a> in 1966 and 1967, which closed access to many of the moors.</p>
<p>In 1972 Wainwright devised the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_Walk_c783.html" title="Coast to Coast Walk">Coast to Coast Walk</a>, partly as a conscious alternative to the Pennine Way. The Coast to Coast, he declares in his guidebook to the route, which follows the same format as the <i>Pennine Way Companion</i>, "puts the Pennine Way to shame" for scenic beauty, variety and interest.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> The 190-mile route traverses the north of England from <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Bees_0a50.html" title="St Bees">St Bees</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood%27s_Bay_587b.html" title="Robin Hood's Bay">Robin Hood's Bay</a>, passing through the Lake District, the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Dales_ce07.html" title="Yorkshire Dales">Yorkshire Dales</a> and the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_York_Moors_e8f3.html" title="North York Moors">North York Moors</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_park.html" title="National park">national parks</a>.</p>
<p><i>The Outlying Fells of Lakeland</i> (an idea he had previously rejected), published in 1974, was his last major guidebook. Thereafter he concentrated on sketchbooks of larger-size line drawings until his eyesight began to fail in the mid-1980s. By this time he was starting to become a TV personality; several TV series based on his work were largely devised and presented by the farmer and broadcaster Eric Robson. His <i>Ex-Fellwanderer</i>, an autobiographical work published in 1987, was clearly intended to be his last written work – to the relief of some, shocked by the misogyny and right-wing views it revealed – but he continued to lend his name and some written commentary to a series of "<a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee_table_book.html" title="Coffee table book">coffee table books</a>" featuring the photography of Derry Brabbs. Although commercially successful, these were not highly regarded by fans of Wainwright's earlier work as they contained little new information and the octogenarian's prose had become stilted and humourless.</p>

<p>Wainwright died in 1991 of a heart attack. According to his biographer <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_Davies_4d1e.html" title="Hunter Davies">Hunter Davies</a> he failed to leave anything to his son Peter, the product of his first, unhappy marriage.</p>
<p>Wainwright's <i>Pictorial Guides</i> have been in continuous publication since they were written and have sold more than two million copies.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> Although a large number of more up-to-date guides are now on the market, his books remain among the most popular available for their depth, detail and unique style. Moreover, his division of the Lake District into seven areas, and his choice of fells to include, have been followed in whole or in part by subsequent writers such as Mark Richards.<a href="http://www.markrichards.info/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.markrichards.info/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_Walk_c783.html" title="Coast to Coast Walk">Coast to Coast Walk</a> too is one of the most popular long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom despite its lack of official status, and has spawned various guidebooks by other authors. In 2003 it was voted the second best walk in the world in a survey of experts conducted by <i>Country Walking</i> magazine.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> The popularity of Wainwright's books of drawings and large-format photographic books has not matched that of the guides, however, and many of these are now out of print.</p>
<p>The 214 fells described in the <i>Pictorial Guides</i> are now generally known as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Wainwrights_8f1a.html" title="List of Wainwrights">the Wainwrights</a>, and visiting them all is a common form of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_bagging.html" title="Peak bagging">peak bagging</a>. According to Alan Castle of the Long Distance Walkers' Association, 331 people were known to have climbed all the Wainwrights as of 2003; Dave Hewitt estimates that the actual number of completionists lies around the 500 mark.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wainwright was a strong supporter of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a>, and gave most of the profits from his books to animal charities. In 1972 he became chairman of the recently founded Animal Rescue Cumbria, and over the years he donated enough money to the charity to enable the foundation in 1984 of Kapellan, a shelter for stray cats and dogs in Kendal. After his death the society was renamed "Animal Rescue Cumbria – The Wainwright Shelter" in his memory.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Wainwright Society was inaugurated in 2002, with the aim of keeping alive the things he promoted through his books. A BBC documentary has been shot about Wainwright's life and was aired on Sunday 25 February 2007 on BBC4, prior to a new 4-part series of walks beginning on Monday 26 February 2007.</p>
