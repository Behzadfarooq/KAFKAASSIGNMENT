<p>Is this from the 1911 encyclopedia? Or where? I somehow doubt that it's original to Wikipedia. Representative quote: "We come now to what is in many ways the most interesting of Alfred's works, his translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, the most popular philosophical manual of the middle ages. Here again Alfred deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his genius." (If 1911, or other public domain source, fine but should be noted until we add/edit enough for it to be a different article.) <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a></p>
<p>I agree with you that it is not an original entry, and it does read like an encyclopedia. A while ago I added the story of the cakes and a few other minor details - it seemed to me than any entry which only referred obliquely to the cakes was seriously flawed. It also referred to Asser without explaining who he was. So I've rectified that, and added a few more bits and pieces - which I hope is helpful. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a></p>

<p>I have changed the place of burial in the little info box on the right of the page. Alfred is not and never was buried in the Winchester Cathedral. It would be more accurate to say he was buried in the Hyde Abbey. He was originally buried in the Old Minster, then moved to the New Minster, and then transferred to Hyde Abbey in the year 1110. His grave was subsequently disturbed. --26 Jan 2006 by Ump</p>

<p>Alfred The Great was and is the only English monarch to be given the title of 'The Great'. I think we should respect his title, for it is not easily given.</p>
<p>I quite agree, he should be referred to as King Alfred. Not Alfred the Great, for that is very subjective and around his 'greatness' surrounds much historiographical debate...</p>

<p>I recently altered "Berkshire" to "Oxfordshire" on the grounds that Wantage has been part of Oxon since 1974. TharkunColl reversed this, commenting <i>rv - Alfred was born a number of years before 1974</i>. However, unless I'm much mistaken, Alfred was the man who ordered the laying out of our historic county boundaries - in other words, although Wantage was in Berkshire by the end of his reign, no such entity as Berkshire existed at the date of his birth. Is this correct? I have altered the wording to <i>modern Oxfordshire</i> for now, as <i>Berkshire</i> seems to me to be incorrect for both the present time and the time cited - 9th Feb 2006 Dave Taylor</p>
<p>The counties of Wessex, i.e. those south of the Thames, are historical divisions of Wessex that long pre-date Alfred, therefore Berkshire existed when he was born in it. The counties of the Midlands were layed out by his son Edward the Elder, mimicing the West Saxon system, and those further north later still. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:02, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This seemed sensibly settled when I last looked in, but since then Owain has deleted the county description three times despite being rv'ed. Why? Undoubtedly, "historical articles deal with historical facts", as he asserts, but one must still place these general articles in a modern context for the general reader. You can't write a good encyclopaedia article for a modern reader by pretending that you were writing it 1150 years ago! In summary, this repeated deletion seems very POVish (I infer from the Traditional Counties of England content on his user and user talk pages), and I'm reverting it. Please discuss before doing it again. - Dave Taylor 3rd Aug 2006</p>

<dd>The location of Wantage in an administrative/ceremonial/historical context is described on the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wantage.html" title="Wantage">Wantage</a> page. It seems a pointless sideshow to go on about "ceremonial counties" on a page about a person who was born and died 1,000 years before they were created.

<dd>I take your point about relevance, but I think a little onhand context for the modern reader is a helpful thing here. After all, it doesn't interfere with the dynamics of the article, and adds a little understanding to Alfred himself. What do other people think? Your point about NPoV I find a little dubious! I think "NPoV" isn't the right phrase here - maybe "uncontentious" is what you meant? DT 3/8/06 14:57 BST</dd>

<dd>Beginning in the 16th century according to the intro of <i>Asser's Life of King Alfred</i>, so it is a far from contemporary label, but there was only one King Alfred and thus no need to distinguish him by an epithet or patronym. By comparison Æthelred was <i>ill-advised</i> by the twelfth century, Edgar was the <i>peacemaker</i> (and the sense is not far from the idea of a Colt revolver being a peacemaker, <i>peaceable</i> is a later error) at around the same time. Edwy/Eadwig was called <i>All-Fair</i>, Edward <i>the Elder</i> and Edmund <i>Ironside</i> before the Conquest. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:23, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have read contemporary Anglo-Saxon literature referring to our subject, and his name is spelt with the letter "Æ" (pron. 'ash') instead of "A", meaning the title of this article should be "Ælfred the Great" instead of "Alfred the Great". His name is a compound word of two Anglo-Saxon words- "Ælf"+"Red", being "elf"+"wisdom", or "one who has the wisdom the elves". There was differentiation in old English between the letters "Æ" and "A", just as there was between the now defunct characters Đ ("eth") and Þ ("thorn"), even though superficially they were pronounced similarly. In addition, there has only ever been one Ælfred, meaning there is no need to call him Ælfred I of Wessex or Ælfred I the Great - Ælfred the Great is sufficient. Surfren 04:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)Dave (Surfren)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But the general Wikipedia rule is to prefer the title that is commonly used in English (i.e., current English). Alfred is commonly used now; and this form is easier for non-specialists and also easier to type into a search box. Generally, giving the original spelling, original script, variant forms, etc., is best done in the first paragraph of the article, I think. <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Dalby_2d43.html" title="User talk:Andrew Dalby">rew D</a></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 14:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe it would be helpful if perhaps there was a section devoted to anecdotal stories regarding Ælfred - separating what we know about him courtesy of contemporary documents such as Asser's work and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; from other, later depictions where romance took precedence over academic investigation.

<dd>Yes, that's a good idea. Mind you, there has been controversy about whether Asser is a contemporary source or not! <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Dalby_2d43.html" title="User talk:Andrew Dalby">rew D</a></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 14:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May I also add my support to this proposition? I think that the entry is more or less fine, but it could certainly do with more contributions from historians or enthusiasts centred on the numerous stories attached to Alfred! saintjohnny</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaftesbury_df5e.html" title="User:Shaftesbury">user:Shaftesbury</a> added links to ShaftesburyTown.co.uk to three wikipedia pages, including this one. I removed all links to that website from the site because most were off-topic, and had been repeatedly added to inappropriate pages. The user has since complained on my talk page that these were not spam, and that the articles were written by shaftesbury and are based on that site. I traced the link on this page back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_the_Great&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49497747" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_the_Great&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49497747" rel="nofollow">21 April 2006</a>, when it was added by an IP whose only edits were to add links to that site. The link was added at the top of the list of links, but I can find no evidence for its importance or contribution to this article. The site itself appears to be somewhat broken. Unless anybody of the writers of this article think it provides and important and unique contribution I intend to submit it to the spam filter if, and when, it next appears? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 18:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
