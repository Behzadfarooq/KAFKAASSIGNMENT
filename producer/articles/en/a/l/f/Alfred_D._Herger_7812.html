	    <p><b>Alfredo Domingo Herger</b> (born <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>) is a famous former <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> show host and a psychologist. He is considered by many to be <i>the <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Sullivan_828e.html" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a> of <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a></i>.</p>
<p>Herger, of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">British</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> ancestry, was born in <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arecibo%2C_Puerto_Rico_0c3a.html" title="Arecibo, Puerto Rico">Arecibo</a> and was raised in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico_38f5.html" title="San Juan, Puerto Rico">San Juan</a>. As early as in 1958, while he was a teenager, he would provide local newspaper <i>"El Mundo"</i> with hit rankings of the most popular songs among San Juan youth. He would eventually become a radio disc jockey, renowned for his sense of humor and affable character.</p>
<p>Herger was an essential part of the <i>Nueva Ola</i> music revolution of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> in Puerto Rico. He became very famous across Puerto Rico with his nightly television shows, which lasted until the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. He helped the careers of many young singers of the time, such as <a href="../../../e/d/n/Ednita_Nazario_3d62.html" title="Ednita Nazario">Ednita Nazario</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/l/Yolandita_Monge_33a2.html" title="Yolandita Monge">Yolandita Monge</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmita_Jimenez_62e8.html" title="Carmita Jimenez">Carmita Jimenez</a> and others. He was also responsible for bringing in to Puerto Rico various visiting artists, including <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Croatto_5fcc.html" title="Tony Croatto">Tony Croatto</a> (with his sister Nelly) and Luisito Rey, the father of Latin American pop sensation <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Miguel_38a7.html" title="Luis Miguel">Luis Miguel</a>, who was born in Puerto Rico and for whom Herger was his <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godparent.html" title="Godparent">godfather</a>.</p>
<p>Herger became a popular radio host during the mid- to late 1970s. He also studied <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> during that period, but did not finish his studies at the time.</p>
<p>It was in the early 1970s that he befriended future <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Menudo_%28band%29.html" title="Menudo (band)">Menudo</a></i> creator <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgardo_Diaz_1ec6.html" title="Edgardo Diaz">Edgardo Diaz</a>, who was working in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> as manager of <i><a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Pandilla_c9c6.html" title="La Pandilla">La Pandilla</a></i>. Diaz contacted Herger about having <i>La Pandilla</i> go to Puerto Rico to make some recordings and be shown at Herger's show, and Herger accepted. Herger became such a large propulsor of that group in Puerto Rico that he garnered the nickname <i>The biggest Pandillero</i>.</p>
<p>Later on, jumping on the wave of a popular <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_scheme.html" title="Pyramid scheme">pyramid scheme</a> craze that swept Puerto Rico in 1980, Herger produced and hosted a game show, <i>"La Pirámide"</i>, complete with an <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egyptian</a>-themed set and imagery, tons of bad pyramid <a href="../../../p/u/n/Puns.html" title="Puns">puns</a> and jokes in the program's scripts, and his entire family (father, brother, then-wife and three children) involved in the show's production. Herger's oldest son Alfredo and daughter Grace Marie went on to be successful teen show hosts in Puerto Rico, more notably with <a href="../../../w/a/p/WAPA-TV_98f3.html" title="WAPA-TV">WAPA-TV</a>'s show <i>Party Time</i>. They were both renowned for their stunning good looks, which allowed Grace Marie to become a part-time model and Alfredo to attempt luck as a solo singer.</p>
<p>Herger retired from radio and television to dedicate himself fully to his career as a psychologist during the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> due to his personal experience rebounding from <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a> after the murder of another of his children, Bennie. Bennie was a minor player on "La Pirámide", was a part-time music producer, and later moved to the United States to become a <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterinarian.html" title="Veterinarian">veterinarian</a>. Visiting Puerto Rico during one of his winter breaks he was <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carjacking.html" title="Carjacking">carjacked</a> and shot dead. Herger was deeply affected by his son's death and his marriage ended during the ordeal, but his inner search for sense from the whole experience gave him enough motivation to revive his interest in psychology, and eventually completing a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Philosophy_8163.html" title="Doctor of Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree. His constant interest in youth themes made him popular as a youth counselor. After learning to have a cordial relationship with his ex-wife (for which he openly gives her most of the credit) he later became a marital counselor also.</p>
<p>Grace Marie's first husband, a medical doctor, suddenly died from an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaphylaxis.html" title="Anaphylaxis">allergic reaction</a> to <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrimp.html" title="Shrimp">shrimp</a> at a dinner honoring him. This led some Puerto Ricans to believe that the Hergers were somehow cursed, in a way similar to that of the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Curse_1b45.html" title="Kennedy Curse">Kennedy Curse</a> (some even blamed their stint producing "La Pirámide" and their irreverent treatment of Egyptian themes for their bad luck). Dismissing this as nonsense, Herger went on to produce self-help radio programs in which he was the host. He has since written more than ten books on psychology since.</p>
<p>Herger still exercises his profession as a psychologist at a private office in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico_38f5.html" title="San Juan, Puerto Rico">San Juan</a>.</p>
