<p><b>Alfred Stieglitz</b> (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_13.html" title="July 13">July 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>) was an American-born photographer who was instrumental over his fifty-year career in making <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a> an acceptable art form alongside <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a>. Many of his photographs are known for appearing like those other art forms, and he is also known for his marriage to painter <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_O%27Keeffe_6a09.html" title="Georgia O'Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>.</p>
<p>Stieglitz was born the eldest of six children in <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey_7814.html" title="Hoboken, New Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a> and raised in a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownstone.html" title="Brownstone">brownstone</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>'s <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_East_Side_9503.html" title="Upper East Side">Upper East Side</a>. His father moved with his family to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in 1881. The next year, Stieglitz began studying mechanical engineering at the <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technische_Hochschule_3f2b.html" title="Technische Hochschule">Technische Hochschule</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and soon switched to photography. Traveling through the European countryside with his camera, he took many photographs of peasants working on the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> seacoast and undisturbed nature within Germany's <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Forest_dce3.html" title="Black Forest">Black Forest</a> and won prizes and attention throughout Europe in the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a> .</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Stieglitz was infatuated with younger women. He married Emmeline Obermeyer in 1893, after he returned to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, and they had one child, Kitty, in 1898. Allowances from Emmeline's father and his own enabled Stieglitz to not have to work for a living. From 1893 to 1896, Stieglitz was editor of <i>American Amateur Photographer</i> magazine; however, his editorial style proved to be brusque, autocratic and alienating to many subscribers. After being forced to resign, Stieglitz turned to the New York Camera Club (which was later renamed <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Camera_Club_of_New_York_eb94.html" title="The Camera Club of New York">The Camera Club of New York</a> and is in existence to this day) and retooled its newsletter into a serious art periodical known as <i>Camera Notes</i>. He announced that every published image would be a picture, not a photograph - a statement that allowed Stieglitz to determine which was which by his <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Big camera clubs that were the vogue in America at the time did not satisfy him; in 1902 he organized an invitation-only group, which he dubbed the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photo-Secession_1073.html" title="Photo-Secession">Photo-Secession</a>, to force the art world to recognize photography "as a distinctive medium of individual expression." Among its members were <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Steichen_66a3.html" title="Edward Steichen">Edward Steichen</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertrude_Kasebier_176f.html" title="Gertrude Kasebier">Gertrude Kasebier</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Hudson_White_0fac.html" title="Clarence Hudson White">Clarence White</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Langdon_Coburn_9d1d.html" title="Alvin Langdon Coburn">Alvin Langdon Coburn</a>. Photo-Secession held its own exhibitions and published <i><a href="../../../c/a/m/Camera_Work_c63a.html" title="Camera Work">Camera Work</a></i>, a pre-eminent quarterly photographic journal, until 1917.</p>
<p>From 1905 to 1917, Stieglitz managed the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Galleries_of_the_Photo-Secession_45b7.html" title="Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession">Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession</a> at 291 <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Avenue_1e78.html" title="Fifth Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> (which came to be known as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_291.html" title="The 291">the 291</a></i>). In 1910, Stieglitz was invited to organize a show at Buffalo's <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albright-Knox_Art_Gallery_b2da.html" title="Albright-Knox Art Gallery">Albright-Knox Art Gallery</a>, which set attendance records. He was insistent that "photographs look like photographs," so that the medium of photography would be considered with its own aesthetic credo and so separate photography from other fine arts such as painting, thus defining photography as a fine art for the first time. This approach by Stieglitz to photography gained the term "straight photography" in contrast to other forms of photography such as "pictorial photography" which practiced manipulation of the image pre and/or post exposure.</p>

<p>Stieglitz divorced his wife Emmeline in 1918, soon after she threw him out of their house when she came home and found him photographing <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_O%27Keeffe_6a09.html" title="Georgia O'Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, whom he moved in with shortly thereafter. The two married in 1924 and were both successful, he in photography (he would take hundreds of pictures of her throughout his life), she as an artist who had received notoriety from Stieglitz at <i>the 291</i> years before. However, their marriage became strained as she had to care more for Stieglitz's health due to a prevailing heart condition and his <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypochondria.html" title="Hypochondria">hypochondria</a>. By the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, she would spend six months out of the year away from him in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Stieglitz took a series of photographs, some nude, of heiress Dorothy Norman, who became in O'Keeffe's mind a serious rival for Stieglitz's affections. Both these photographs and those of O'Keeffe are often considered the first photographs to recognize the artistic potential of isolated parts of the human body. In these years, he also presided over two non-commercial <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> galleries, The Intimate Gallery and An American Place. It was at An American Place that he forged his friendship with the great 20th century photographer <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansel_Easton_Adams_87f4.html" title="Ansel Easton Adams">Ansel Easton Adams</a>. Adams displayed many prints in Stieglitz's gallery, corresponded with him and also photographed Stieglitz on occasion.</p>
<p>Stieglitz was a great philantropist and sympathiser with his fellow human beings. He once received a phone call on one of Adams' visits. A man wanted to show Stieglitz some work. He invited him over, looked at the prints, looked at the man in a rather disheveled state of affairs, looked at the work again. He then offered to buy the paintings and gave him a ten dollar bill, told him to get something warm to eat, get cleaned up, and come back so that they could iron out the details. The look in the man's eyes could have been an eternal testament to the kindness that was Alfred Stieglitz.</p>
<p>Stieglitz's camera work ended in 1937 due to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_disease.html" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a>. Over the last ten years of his life, he summered at <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_George%2C_New_York_4a02.html" title="Lake George, New York">Lake George, New York</a> and worked in a shed he had converted into a <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkroom.html" title="Darkroom">darkroom</a> and wintered with O'Keeffe in Manhattan's <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelton.html" title="Shelton">Shelton</a>, the first <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscraper</a> hotel in that city. He died in 1946 at 82, still a staunch supporter of O'Keeffe and she of him.</p>
