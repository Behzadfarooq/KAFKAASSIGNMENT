<p>Born in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Middlesex%2C_Pennsylvania_585f.html" title="West Middlesex, Pennsylvania">West Middlesex, Pennsylvania</a>, in 1887, Landon grew up in <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>. He moved with his family to Kansas at age 17. He graduated from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kansas_7e6d.html" title="University of Kansas">University of Kansas</a> in 1908. He first pursued a career in banking, but in 1912 he became an independent petroleum producer. During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, he served in the Army as a first lieutenant in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_warfare.html" title="Chemical warfare">chemical warfare</a>. He became a millionaire in the oil industry by 1929.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf_Landon_5dfa.html" title="Edit section: Political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
<p>Landon's interest in politics began early. He supported <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Party_%28United_States%2C_1912%29_4a48.html" title="Progressive Party (United States, 1912)">Progressive Party</a> in 1912, and, in 1922, was private secretary to the governor of Kansas. He later became known as the leader of the liberal Republicans in the state. He was elected chairman of the Republican state central committee in 1928 and directed the Republican successful presidential and gubernatorial campaigns in Kansas in that year.</p>
<p>Landon was elected <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Governors_of_Kansas_38ec.html" title="List of Governors of Kansas">Governor of Kansas</a> in 1932. He was re-elected governor in 1934--the only Republican governor to be re-elected that year. He served as governor from 1933 until 1937. As Governor, Landon gained a reputation for reducing taxes and balancing the budget. Landon is often described as a fiscal conservative who nevertheless believed that government must also address social issues. He supported parts of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> but opposed labor unions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf_Landon_5dfa.html" title="Edit section: 1936 Election">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1936 Election</span></h2>
<p>In 1936, Landon sought the Republican presidential nominee opposing the re-election of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">FDR</a>. At the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_National_Convention_c1fb.html" title="Republican National Convention">Republican National Convention</a> in 1936, Landon's campaign manager John Hamilton mobilized the younger elements of the party against the faction led by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>. Landon won the nomination on the first ballot; the convention selected Chicago newspaper publisher <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Knox_ee56.html" title="Frank Knox">Frank Knox</a> as his running mate.</p>
<p>Landon proved to be an ineffective campaigner who rarely traveled to make appearances. Most of the attacks on FDR and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_security.html" title="Social security">social security</a> during the 1936 election were developed by Republican campaigners rather than Landon himself. In the two months after his nomination he made no campaign appearances. As columnist <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westbrook_Pegler_b934.html" title="Westbrook Pegler">Westbrook Pegler</a> lampooned, "Considerable mystery surrounds the disappearance of Alfred M. Landon of Topeka, Kans.... The Missing Persons Bureau has sent out an alarm bulletin bearing Mr. Landon's photograph and other particulars, and anyone having information of his whereabouts is asked to communicate direct with the Republican National Committee." [<i>Time</i>, Aug. 31, 1936]</p>
<p>Landon respected and admired Roosevelt and accepted much of the New Deal but objected that it was hostile to business and involved too much waste and inefficiency. Late in the campaign, Landon accused Roosevelt of corruption--that is, of acquiring so much power that he was subverting the Constitution. Landon said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The President spoke truly when he boasted... 'We have built up new instruments of public power.' He spoke truly when he said these instruments could provide 'shackles for the liberties of the people . . . and . . . enslavement for the public.' These powers were granted with the understanding that they were only temporary. But after the powers had been obtained, and after the emergency was clearly over, we were told that another emergency would be created if the power was given up. In other words, the concentration of power in the hands of the President was not a question of temporary emergency. It was a question of permanent national policy. In my opinion the emergency of 1933 was a mere excuse.... National economic planning—the term used by this Administration to describe its policy—violates the basic ideals of the American system. . . . The price of economic planning is the loss of economic freedom. And economic freedom and personal liberty go hand in hand.</i> [<i>Time</i> Oct. 26, 1936]</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1936_d935.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1936">1936 Presidential election</a> was extraordinarily lopsided. Although Landon gained nearly 17 million votes and obtained the endorsement of track star <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Owens_8689.html" title="Jesse Owens">Jesse Owens</a>, he lost the popular vote by more than 10 million votes. He carried only <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> for a total of 8 electoral votes to Roosevelt's 523. FDR's win was the most crushing electoral victory since 1820. The overwhelming Roosevelt victory prompted <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic</a> party boss <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Farley_ce7a.html" title="James Farley">James Farley</a> to joke, "<a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Maine_goes%2C_so_goes_the_nation_25b1.html" title="As Maine goes, so goes the nation">As Maine goes, so goes Vermont</a>."</p>

<p>Following his defeat, Landon finished out his term as governor of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a> and returned to the oil industry. Landon did not seek elective office again.</p>
<p>The Republicans' defeats in 1932 and 1936 plunged their party into a period of bitter intraparty strife. Landon played an important role in ending this internal bickering in 1938, in helping to prepare a new group of leaders for the presidential campaign of 1940, and in trying to bring about a compromise between the isolationist and internationalist viewpoints in foreign policy. Landon failed to enter Franklin Roosevelt's Cabinet because he made his acceptance contingent upon the President's renunciation of a third term. [Mayer 1966]</p>
<p>After war broke out in Europe in 1939 Landon fought against isolationists such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_First_Committee_425f.html" title="America First Committee">America First</a> who supported the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality_Act_0045.html" title="Neutrality Act">Neutrality Act</a>; he feared it would mislead <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> into thinking the United States was unwilling to fight. In 1940 he argued against <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lend-lease.html" title="Lend-lease">lend-lease</a>, urging instead that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> be given $5 billion outright. After the war, he backed the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Plan_4ea5.html" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a>, while opposing high domestic spending. After the communist takeover of China, he was one of the first to advocate recognition of Mao Zedong's communist government, and its admission to the United Nations, when this was still a very unpopular position among the leadership and followers of both major parties.</p>
<p>In 1961, he urged the U.S. to join the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Community_a343.html" title="European Community">European Common Market</a>. In November 1962, when he was asked to describe his political philosophy, Landon said: <i>I would say practical progressive, which means that the Republican party or any political party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I don't think the Republican party is really wide awake to that.</i> Later in the 1960s, Landon backed President <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> on <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28United_States%29_b379.html" title="Medicare (United States)">Medicare</a> and other <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Society_cbeb.html" title="Great Society">Great Society</a> programs.</p>

Landon's lecture, titled "New Challenges in International Relations" was the first in a series of public issues lectures that continues to this day and has featured numerous world leaders and political figures, including seven U.S. presidents (<a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H.
