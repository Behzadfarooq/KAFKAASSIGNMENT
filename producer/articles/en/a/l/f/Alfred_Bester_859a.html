<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Bester_859a.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Born in in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Bester attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> where he was a member of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philomathean_Society_fd7d.html" title="Philomathean Society">Philomathean Society</a>, and in 1936 married Rolly Goulko. His first short story, "The Broken Axiom", was published in <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrilling_Wonder_Stories_eaf5.html" title="Thrilling Wonder Stories">Thrilling Wonder Stories</a></i> (April <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>) after winning an amateur story competition. This competition was arranged so he could have a start on the business. He already knew some people and had given them some work to read, and they came up with the contest. He continued to publish short fiction, most notably in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Campbell_8e49.html" title="John W. Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_Science_Fiction_3926.html" title="Astounding Science Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a></i>, and in 1942 he began working at <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> as a writer for <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Lantern_12db.html" title="Green Lantern">Green Lantern</a></i>, and other titles. It is popularly believed that Bester wrote the version of the Green Lantern Oath that begins "In brightest day, In blackest night". However, when queried on this point by <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Gwynplaine_MacIntyre_6007.html" title="F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre">F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre</a> at the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Science_Fiction_Convention_ad66.html" title="World Science Fiction Convention">World Science Fiction Convention</a> in Brighton, England in 1979, Bester stated that this oath was already in place before he began writing for that title.</p>
<p>Bester was also the writer for <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Falk_0d0a.html" title="Lee Falk">Lee Falk</a>'s comic strips <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_8f78.html" title="The Phantom">The Phantom</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandrake_the_Magician_3f85.html" title="Mandrake the Magician">Mandrake the Magician</a></i> while their creator served in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. It is widely speculated how much influence Bester had on these comics. One theory claims that Bester was responsible for giving the Phantom his surname; "Walker".</p>
<p>Bester stopped writing for <i>Astounding</i> around 1950 when its editor, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Campbell_8e49.html" title="John W. Campbell">John Campbell</a>, became preoccupied with <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a>, the forerunner to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>. Bester then turned to <i><a href="../../../g/a/l/Galaxy_Magazine_29cc.html" title="Galaxy Magazine">Galaxy Magazine</a></i>, where he found in <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._L._Gold_a48c.html" title="H. L. Gold">H. L. Gold</a> another exceptional editor as well as a good friend.</p>
<p>He also wrote one little-noted mainstream novel about this time, the 1953 <i>Who He?</i> (also published as <i>The Rat Race</i>).</p>
<p>After four years in the comics industry, Bester turned his attention to radio scripts, writing for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shadow_1fea.html" title="The Shadow">The Shadow</a></i>, <i>Nick Carter Master Detective</i>, and <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Chan_556e.html" title="Charlie Chan">Charlie Chan</a></i>. One of his radio scripts is "Stamps for Murder", written for <i><a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero_Wolfe_75c4.html" title="Nero Wolfe">Nero Wolfe</a></i>. He later wrote for the <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_Radio_Mystery_Theater_b61f.html" title="CBS Radio Mystery Theater">CBS Radio Mystery Theater</a>. His short fiction was initially collected in <i>Starburst</i> (1958) and <i>The Dark Side of the Earth</i> (1964), with further collections appearing in the 1970s, including <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Light%2C_Star_Bright_%28book%29_dcad.html" title="Star Light, Star Bright (book)">Star Light, Star Bright</a></i>.</p>
<p>From the 1950s to the 1970s, he was chief literary editor of <i>Holiday</i> magazine. After the magazine ceased publication in the early 1970s, Bester returned to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> with more short stories and several more novels, although none approached the full brilliance exhibited in his earlier period.</p>
<p>His short stories, such as "The Men Who Murdered <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Mohammed</a>" (about unsuccessful attempts to change history through <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a>), cemented his reputation, but he is best known for two of his novels, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Demolished_Man_f6a5.html" title="The Demolished Man">The Demolished Man</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stars_My_Destination_c5f5.html" title="The Stars My Destination">The Stars My Destination</a></i> (also known as <i>Tiger! Tiger!</i>). Bester also wrote one mainstream novel in the 1950s, <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_He__4269.html" title="Who He?">Who He?</a></i>, also published as <i>The Rat Race</i>. Bester's other novels include <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Computer_Connection_87bf.html" title="The Computer Connection">The Computer Connection</a></i> also published as <i>Extro</i> and <i>The Indian Giver</i> (1975), <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golem100.html" title="Golem100">Golem<sup>100</sup></a></i> (1980), and <i>The Deceivers</i> (1982). One of the strengths of his novels is the skill with which Bester integrated his science fiction elements into his future societies.</p>
<p>The producer of the 1978 <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> movie sent his son off to search for a writer. The name Alfred Bester came up. Bester wanted to focus the story on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Kent_46f6.html" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a> as the real hero, while <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> was only "his gun." Bester was devastated when the producer declined to hire an unknown writer and decided to go with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Puzo_eeb4.html" title="Mario Puzo">Mario Puzo</a>, author of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_%28novel%29_eb27.html" title="The Godfather (novel)">The Godfather</a></i>.</p>

<p>How can you get away with premeditated murder if the cops can read your mind? <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Demolished_Man_f6a5.html" title="The Demolished Man">The Demolished Man</a></i> - recipient of the first Hugo Award for best Science Fiction novel - is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_procedural.html" title="Police procedural">police procedural</a> that takes place in a future world in which <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathy.html" title="Telepathy">telepathy</a> is relatively common. Bester creates a harshly capitalistic, hierarchical and competitive social world that exists without deceit: a society where the right person with with some skill (or money) and curiosity can access your memories, secrets, fears, and past misdeeds more swiftly and with greater alacrity than even you.</p>
<p>This novel is dedicated to <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._L._Gold_a48c.html" title="H. L. Gold">H. L.

<p><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stars_My_Destination_c5f5.html" title="The Stars My Destination">The Stars My Destination</a></i> had its origins in a newspaper clipping that Bester found about a shipwrecked WW II sailor on a raft, who had drifted unrescued in the Pacific for a world record 133 days because passing ships thought he was a lure to bring them within torpedo range of a hidden submarine. From this germ grew the story of Gully Foyle, seeking revenge for his abandonment and causing havoc all about him: a science fiction re-telling of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re_e897.html" title="Alexandre Dumas, père">Alexandre Dumas</a>' <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo_7c87.html" title="The Count of Monte Cristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></i> with <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleportation.html" title="Teleportation">teleportation</a> added to the mix. It has been described as an ancestor of <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberpunk.html" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>. Chapter Nine contains the line "Millions for nonsense, but not one cent for entropy," a parody of the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Goodloe_Harper_9a38.html" title="Robert Goodloe Harper">Robert Goodloe Harper</a> quote: "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute." In Chapter Sixteen it becomes "Millions for defense, but not one cent for survival."</p>
<p>A radio adaptation was broadcast on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_4_eb17.html" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a> in 1991, although this may have been a repeat broadcast. <a href="http://www.miranda-richardson.com/mrsound.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miranda-richardson.com/mrsound.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> lists the play as a 60-minute episode, but the original running time was almost certainly 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Bester's 1953 novel <i>Who He?</i>, also published as <i>The Rat Race</i>, concerns a TV game show host who wakes up after an alcoholic blackout and discovers that someone is out to destroy his life. It did not receive wide attention.</p>

<p>Bester has been memorialized by other science fiction writers in their own works. Notably, the character of Psi-Cop <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Bester_%28Babylon_5%29_2607.html" title="Alfred Bester (Babylon 5)">Alfred Bester</a> is named after him (and the treatment of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathy.html" title="Telepathy">telepathy</a> in <i><a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a></i> is similar to that in Bester's works), as is the time-travelling pest named <b>Al Phee</b> in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider_Robinson_a517.html" title="Spider Robinson">Spider Robinson</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Callahan%27s_Crosstime_Saloon_5c76.html" title="Callahan's Crosstime Saloon">Callahan's Crosstime Saloon</a></i> series. (Bester was known as "Alfie" to many of his friends.)</p>
<p>In 1985, it was announced that Bester would be Guest of Honor at the 1987 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Science_Fiction_Convention_ad66.html" title="World Science Fiction Convention">World Science Fiction Convention</a>, again to be held in Brighton. As the event neared, Bester was plainly too ill to attend, and <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Lessing_1bb5.html" title="Doris Lessing">Doris Lessing</a> stepped in as a last-minute replacement. Bester died less than a month after the convention, but not before learning that the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Fiction_Writers_of_America_5efc.html" title="Science Fiction Writers of America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> would honor him with their <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Master_Nebula_7cde.html" title="Grand Master Nebula">Grand Master Nebula</a> award at their 1988 convention. Alfred Bester left everything to his bartender, who was surprised because he didn't even remember Bester.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Gwynplaine_MacIntyre_6007.html" title="F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre">F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre</a> has written a series of stories — beginning with "Time Lines" (published in <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_%28magazine%29.html" title="Astounding (magazine)">Analog</a></i>, 1999) — about a time-traveling criminal named Smedley Faversham, who constantly runs afoul of a scientific principle called "Bester's Law". This term is MacIntyre's invention, but it is explicitly in homage to Alfred Bester's work: specifically, to Bester's 1958 story "The Men Who Murdered Mohammed". Bester's Law, as articulated by MacIntyre, states that a time-traveler who attempts to rewrite the past can only alter his or her own time-line, not anyone else's. Bester's Law is rigidly enforced by a legion of "time cops", whom MacIntyre's protagonist sneeringly refers to as "the Bester Boosters" and "the Bester-Busters".</p>
