<p>Packer was born (as Alfred G. Packer) in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_County%2C_Pennsylvania_f4f6.html" title="Allegheny County, Pennsylvania">Allegheny County</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. He served in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29_fad6.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a> side presumably in an <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiment</a>, but was mustered out due to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epilepsy</a>.</p>
<p>In November, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, Packer was with a party of 21 who left <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo%2C_Utah_a20a.html" title="Provo, Utah">Provo</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>, bound for the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> gold country in <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breckenridge%2C_Colorado_78c3.html" title="Breckenridge, Colorado">Breckenridge</a>. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_21.html" title="January 21">January 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a> he met with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Ouray_3a88.html" title="Chief Ouray">Chief Ouray</a> (known as the <i>White Man's Friend</i>) near <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montrose%2C_Colorado_2c90.html" title="Montrose, Colorado">Montrose</a>, Colorado. Chief Ouray recommended they postpone their expedition until <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_%28season%29.html" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>, as they were likely to encounter dangerous winter weather in the mountains.</p>
<p>In spite of Ouray's advice, a party of six that included Packer left for <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunnison%2C_Colorado_d7da.html" title="Gunnison, Colorado">Gunnison</a>, Colorado on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>. The other five men were Shannon Wilson Bell, James Humphrey, Frank "Reddy" Miller, George "California" Noon and Israel Swan.</p>
<p>At an unknown date, the party got hopelessly lost, ran out of provisions, and became snowbound in the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Mountains_20b2.html" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. Packer allegedly went scouting and came back to discover Bell roasting human meat. According to Packer, Bell rushed him with a hatchet; Packer shot and killed him.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, Packer arrived alone at Los Pinos Indian Agency near Gunnison. He spent some time in a <a href="../../../s/a/g/Saguache%2C_Colorado_7384.html" title="Saguache, Colorado">Saguache</a>, Colorado bar, meeting several of his previous party. He initially claimed <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-defense.html" title="Self-defense">self-defense</a>, but his story did not pass in court. During the trial, the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judge</a> supposedly said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Damn you, Alferd Packer! There were seven <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Dimmycrats</a> in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinsdale_County%2C_Colorado_141f.html" title="Hinsdale County, Colorado">Hinsdale County</a> and you ate five of them!"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>An alternate version of the judge's outburst is</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Packer, you depraved <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> son of a bitch! There were only five Democrats in Hinsdale County and you ate them all!"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The actual sentencing statement, of course, was a little more in character for an educated state judge:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Close your ears to the blandishments of hope. Listen not to the flattering promises of life, but prepare for the dread certainty of death."</i><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Packer signed a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">confession</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>. He was jailed in Saguache, but escaped soon after, vanishing for several years.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>, Packer was discovered in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne%2C_Wyoming_c3a1.html" title="Cheyenne, Wyoming">Cheyenne</a>, <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> living under the alias of "John Schwartze." On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">March 16</a>, he signed another confession. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, a <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury_trial.html" title="Jury trial">trial</a> began in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_City%2C_Colorado_05f4.html" title="Lake City, Colorado">Lake City</a>, Colorado. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">April 13</a>, he was found guilty and sentenced to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">death</a>. Packer managed to temporarily avoid punishment again: in October <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, the sentence was reversed by the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_Supreme_Court_daed.html" title="Colorado Supreme Court">Colorado Supreme Court</a> as being based on an <i><a href="../../../e/x/_/Ex_post_facto_law.html" title="Ex post facto law">ex post facto law</a></i>. However, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>, Packer was sentenced to 40 years at a trial in Gunnison.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alferd_Packer_3b3e.html" title="Edit section: Not guilty?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Not guilty?</span></h3>
<p>Recent <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a> suggests that Packer <i>was</i> a cannibal, but <i>not</i> a murderer. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, 115 years after Packer consumed his companions, an exhumation of the five bodies was undertaken by James E. Starrs, then Professor of Law specializing in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic_science.html" title="Forensic science">forensic science</a> at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_University_e3f0.html" title="George Washington University">George Washington University</a>. Following an exhaustive search for the precise location of the remains at Cannibal Plateau in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_City%2C_Colorado_05f4.html" title="Lake City, Colorado">Lake City</a>, Colorado, Starrs and his colleague Walter H. Birkby concluded "<i>I don't think there will ever be any way to scientifically demonstrate cannibalism. Cannibalism per se is the ingestion of human flesh. So you'd have to have a picture of the guy actually eating.</i>"<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1994, David P. Bailey, Curator of History at the Museum of Western Colorado, undertook an investigation to turn up more conclusive results than Starrs's. In the Audrey Thrailkill collection of firearms owned by the museum was a Colt pistol that had reportedly been found at the site of Packer's alleged crime. Exhaustive investigation into the pistol's background turned up illuminating documents from the time of the trial: "A Civil War veteran that visited the crime scene stated that Shannon Bell had been shot twice and the other victims were killed with a hatchet. Upon careful study of Bell, he noticed a severe bullet wound to the pelvic area and that Bell's wallet had a bullet hole through it." This may corroborate Packer's statement that Bell killed the other victims and Packer shot Bell in self-defense.</p>
<p>By 2000, Bailey had not yet proven a link between the antique pistol and Alferd Packer, but he discovered that forensic samples from the 1989 exhumation had been archived, and analysis in 2001 with an electron microscope by Dr. Richard Dujay at Mesa State College turned up microscopic lead fragments in the soil taken from under Shannon Bell's remains that were matched by spectrograph with the bullets remaining in what was indeed Packer's pistol.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> While it appears certain that Bell was killed by gunshot, the question of murder itself remains.</p>
<p>Through some unexplained process, Packer's head, dissected and carefully preserved, has come to be in the possession of <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripley%27s_Believe_It_or_Not_31f3.html" title="Ripley's Believe It or Not">Ripley's Believe It or Not</a> Museum in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Quarter_9575.html" title="French Quarter">French Quarter</a> of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, where it is on permanent display.</p>

<p>Packer is a legend in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>. He has been quoted as having said, in jest, "the breasts of man...are the sweetest meat I ever tasted." In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, students at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder_4fec.html" title="University of Colorado at Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> named their new cafeteria grill the <i>Alferd G. Packer Memorial Grill</i> with the slogan "Have a friend for lunch!" Even today students can enjoy the meat-filled "El Canibal" underneath a giant wall map outlining his travels through Colorado. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> the university dedicated a statue to Packer. Also in 1982, Jim Roberson made <i>The Legend of Alfred Packer</i>, a film that took many liberties with the story, including having Bell fall on a knife, exonerating Packer of any potential wrongdoing. The film also included an incident involving the reporter <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Pry_8f0c.html" title="Polly Pry">Polly Pry</a> derived from Gantt that the film left completely unexplained and was only tangentially connected to Packer. Packer was played by Patrick Dray.</p>
<p>An urban legend has it that the Department of Agriculture's cafeteria was officially named for Packer. While untrue, the legend has a factual basis. Prankster employees of the Department, characterizing themselves as members of the <i>Alferd Packer Society</i>, surreptitiously placed a plaque on the cafeteria wall honoring Packer in ironic terms. It was displayed there until its discovery in 1977 by a low-level bureaucrat in another agency, who complained to Secretary of Agriculture <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bergland_99f3.html" title="Robert Bergland">Bob Bergland</a>. Wishing to avoid trouble, he asked the pranksters to take it down. Members of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Press_Club_c0ac.html" title="National Press Club">National Press Club</a>, ever happy to preserve memorabilia of national significance, today display it with pride on the wall of <i>The Reliable Source</i>, a members-only bar. It doubles as a memorial to the late Stanley Weston, an extraordinary and gentle soul who left his home in Colorado to work at the USDA.</p>
<p>In 1993, University of Colorado Boulder graduate <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trey_Parker_5b43.html" title="Trey Parker">Trey Parker</a>, co-creator of <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>, made a film <i>Alferd Packer: The Musical</i>, based loosely on Packer's life, with himself, billed as "Juan Schwartz" (a variation of Packer's "John Schwartze") as Packer, released commercially in 1996 by <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troma_Entertainment_4931.html" title="Troma Entertainment">Troma Entertainment</a> as <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal%21_The_Musical_53ab.html" title="Cannibal! The Musical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></i> and subsequently produced by various companies as a stage play.</p>
<p>Folksinger <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Ochs_9da7.html" title="Phil Ochs">Phil Ochs</a> composed a song about Packer's life, included on "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Broadside_Tapes_1_5c4b.html" title="The Broadside Tapes 1">The Broadside Tapes 1</a>". Singer <a href="../../../c/2E/w/C.W._McCall_d45c.html" title="C.W. McCall">C.W. McCall</a> wrote (with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Davis_67bb.html" title="Chip Davis">Chip Davis</a>) and sang a song about Packer called "Comin' Back for More." It was included on his 1999 release <i>The Real McCall: An American Storyteller.</i></p>
<p>Death metal band <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal_Corpse_89da.html" title="Cannibal Corpse">Cannibal Corpse</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> debut, <i><a href="../../../e/a/t/Eaten_Back_To_Life_b782.html" title="Eaten Back To Life">Eaten Back To Life</a></i> is dedicated to Packer with the inscription "This Album is dedicated to the memory of Alfred Packer, The First American Cannibal (R.I.P.)"</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> movie, <i><a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravenous.html" title="Ravenous">Ravenous</a></i>, was loosely based on aspects of the Alferd Packer story, which <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screenwriter.html" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a> <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Griffin_0014.html" title="Ted Griffin">Ted Griffin</a> says he first encountered when reading <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thin_Man_24a9.html" title="The Thin Man">The Thin Man</a></i> by <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashiell_Hammett_c287.html" title="Dashiell Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>, wherein the entire story is printed as it appears in Thomas Duke's "Celebrated Criminal Cases."</p>
<p><i>Devoured: The Legend of Alferd Packer</i> is a 2005 film by Kevin Rapp that is also produced by Troma. This film depicts Packer as an unkillable monster fifty years after the original incdent.</p>
<p>A 2001 novel, "Lone Survivor", written by Ken Hodgson, recounts the story of how, in 1873, that Alferd Packer had led a party of twenty-one men from Utah to Colorado to pan for gold, but three months later returned to Utah alone, after an adventure in which the others died amidst harsh conditions and he survived against the odds at a heavy price.</p>
