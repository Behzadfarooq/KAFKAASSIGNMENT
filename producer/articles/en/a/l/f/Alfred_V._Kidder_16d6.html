	    <p><b>Alfred Vincent Kidder</b> (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_29.html" title="October 29">October 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a> - <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">June 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>) was considered the foremost <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeologist.html" title="Archaeologist">archaeologist</a> of the southwestern <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and Middle America during the first half of the 20th century. He saw a disciplined system of archaeological techniques as a means to extend the principles of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> into the prehistoric past and so was the originator of the first comprehensive, systematic approach to North American archaeology.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquette%2C_Michigan_b7f2.html" title="Marquette, Michigan">Marquette, Michigan</a>, Kidder was the son of a mining <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineer</a>. He entered <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> College with the intention of qualifying for medical school, but found himself uninspired by premedical courses. He applied for a summer job in archaeology with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Utah_bbd8.html" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> in 1907. Kidder spent two successive summers in the mesa and canyon country of southwestern <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, southeastern <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a> and areas of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Kidder and promising young archaeologist, Jesse L.

Walter Fewkes">Jesse Walter Fewkes</a> to conduct an archaeological survey and to photograph ruins. He obtained his bachelor's degree at Harvard in 1908 and a doctorate in anthropology in 1914.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_V._Kidder_16d6.html" title="Edit section: Archaeological career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Archaeological career</span></h2>
<p>Kidder then embarked on a series of expeditions to the Southwest, many in northeastern <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. These expeditions were sponsored by Harvard’s <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peabody_Museum_of_Archaeology_and_Ethnology_31dd.html" title="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology">Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology</a> and the associated Phillips Academy in <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andover%2C_Massachusetts_afb9.html" title="Andover, Massachusetts">Andover, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>From 1915 to 1929, Kidder conducted site excavations at an abandoned pueblo in Pecos, near <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico_6a40.html" title="Santa Fe, New Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>. He excavated levels of human occupation at the pueblo going back more than 2000 years, and gathered a detailed record of cultural artifacts, including a large collection of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> fragments and human remains. From these items, he was able to establish a continuous record of pottery styles from 2000 years ago to the mid to late 1800s. Kidder then analyzed trends and changes in pottery styles in association with changes in the Pecos people’s culture and established a basic chronology for the Southwest. With Samuel J. Guernsey, he established the validity of a chronological approach to cultural periods. Kidder asserted that deductions about the development of human culture could be obtained through a systematic examination of stratigraphy and chronology in archaeological sites. This research laid the foundation for modern archaeological field methods, shifting the emphasis from a "gentlemanly adventure" adding items such as whole pots and cliff dwellings to museum coffers to the study of potsherds and other artifacts in relation to the cultural history. Pioneering archaeologists in other regions of the United States completed the transformation of professional methodology initiated by Kidder.</p>
<p>His <i>Introduction to the Study of Southwestern Archaeology</i>, published in 1924, was the first synthesis of North American prehistory based on professionally recovered empirical data. In spite of his efforts at documentation, Kidder’s conclusions have sometimes been criticized for a lack of integration between his field reports and his later synthesis and interpretation of that data. However, Kidder clearly emphasized archeology's need for a scientific "eye" in the development of fact collecting techniques and clear definitions.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, Kidder started the Pecos Conferences for archaeologists and ethnologists working in the American southwest. In 1927, a temporal system of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_classification.html" title="Scientific classification">nomenclature</a>, known as the <a href="../../../p/e/c/Pecos_Classification_cb1c.html" title="Pecos Classification">Pecos Classification</a> System, was established for use in southwestern sites. Archaeologists have since used the sequence, with later variations, to assign approximate dates to dozens of sites throughout the Southwest and to determine cultural ties and differences among them. In 1936, Kidder formally used the Navajo term “<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Pueblo_Peoples_4433.html" title="Ancient Pueblo Peoples">Anasazi</a>” to define a specific cultural group of people living in the southwest between approximately 200 BC and 1300 AD. This term had been casually used by excavators for many of the “ancient people” since the early explorations of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wetherill_1da2.html" title="Richard Wetherill">Richard Wetherill</a>, and had been informally used in the work of the Pecos Conferences.</p>
<p>As an associate in charge of archaeological investigations (1927-29) and as chairman of the division of historical research (1929-50) at the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnegie_Institution_95c5.html" title="Carnegie Institution">Carnegie Institution</a>, Kidder conducted a broad-scale multidisciplinary research program in the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guatemala.html" title="Guatemala">Guatemalan</a> highlands which established the framework of <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_civilization.html" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a> stratigraphy. In 1939 he became honorary curator of Southwestern American archaeology at the Peabody Museum, Harvard.</p>
<p>In 1951, Kidder, in discussions with Thomas Stuart Ferguson and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Willey_4a30.html" title="Gordon Willey">Gordon Willey</a> of Harvard University, was instrumental in establishing a foundation dealing with the status of archaeology in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>. In regard to those discussions, Ferguson wrote that the three scholars agreed <i>“...it was unfortunate that so little work was being carried on in so important an area and that something should be done to increase explorations and excavations....Despite the amazing discoveries made between 1930 and 1950, work on the Pre-Classic was virtually at a standstill in 1951. The result of the discussion was that we agreed to set up a new organization to be devoted to the Pre-Classic civilizations of Mexico and Central America—the earliest known high cultures of the New World.</i>” The following year, the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF) was incorporated in the state of <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, as a nonprofit, scientific, fact-finding body.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_V._Kidder_16d6.html" title="Edit section: Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation</span></h2>
<p>During Kidder’s studies and excavations at Pecos Pueblo, particularly between 1915 and 1929, pottery and other artifacts were sent to Andover, Massachusetts, while excavated human remains were sent to the Peabody Museum at Harvard. In the early 1900s, no archaeologist consulted with Native American descendants concerning the excavation of their ancestors' homes and graves. Although Kidder was aware of the long standing relationship between the abandoned Pecos Pueblo and the modern <a href="../../../p/u/e/Pueblo_of_Jemez_fcd8.html" title="Pueblo of Jemez">Pueblo of Jemez</a>, he did not consider that any local population had a claim on artifacts and remains.</p>
<p>By a 1936 Act of Congress, the Pueblo of Jemez became the legal and administrative representative of the Pueblo of Pecos, which had been privately owned during Kidder’s excavation. As a consequence of The <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act_9666.html" title="Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a> (NAGPRA), which requires federal and other museum facilities to inventory, establish cultural affiliations, and publish in the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Register_91f9.html" title="Federal Register">Federal Register</a> any and all Native American human remains and certain objects in their possession, the Pueblo of Jemez made a formal claim on behalf of the Pecos people. This repatriation was primarily due to the efforts of William J. Whatley, the Jemez Pueblo tribal archaeologist, who searched through museum records for these remains and artifacts for eight years. The human remains from Kidder’s excavations were returned to the Jemez Pueblo in 1999 and ritually reburied. In a sense, they rejoined Kidder, as he is buried on a hillside not far away, close to Pecos Pueblo.</p>
