<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Tarski_518d.html" title="Edit section: Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>
<p>Alfred Tarski was born <b>Alfred Teitelbaum</b> (<a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_language.html" title="Polish language">Polish</a> spelling: "Tajtelbaum"), to parents who were <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Jews_9098.html" title="Polish Jews">Polish Jews</a> in comfortable circumstances. Some of his brilliance is attributed to his mother, Rosa Prussak. Tarski first revealed his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's <i>Szkoła Mazowiecka</i>. Nevertheless, when he entered the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Warsaw_314a.html" title="University of Warsaw">University of Warsaw</a> in 1918, he intended to study <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, Poland became a nation again for the first time since <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_University_d4b9.html" title="Warsaw University">Warsaw University</a> became a Polish university for the first time in generations. Under the leadership of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz_bd81.html" title="Jan Łukasiewicz">Jan Łukasiewicz</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Le%C5%9Bniewski_e492.html" title="Stanisław Leśniewski">Stanisław Leśniewski</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wac%C5%82aw_Sierpi%C5%84ski_982e.html" title="Wacław Sierpiński">Wacław Sierpiński</a>, the university immediately became a world leader in logic, foundational mathematics, the philosophy of mathematics, and analytic and linguistic philosophy. At <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_University_d4b9.html" title="Warsaw University">Warsaw University</a>, Tarski had a fateful encounter with Leśniewski, who discovered Tarski's genius and persuaded him to abandon biology for mathematics. Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by Łukasiewicz, Sierpiński, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Mazurkiewicz_3959.html" title="Stefan Mazurkiewicz">Stefan Mazurkiewicz</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadeusz_Kotarbi%C5%84ski_6d1d.html" title="Tadeusz Kotarbiński">Tadeusz Kotarbiński</a>, and became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Leśniewski's supervision. Tarski and Leśniewski soon grew cool to each other. In private correspondence, Leśniewski sometimes employed anti-semitic language when talking about Tarski. In later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadeusz_Kotarbi%C5%84ski_6d1d.html" title="Tadeusz Kotarbiński">Kotarbiński</a>.</p>
<p>In 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wacław changed their surname to Tarski, a name they invented because it sounded Polish, was simple to spell and pronounce, and seemed unused. (Years later, Alfred met another Alfred Tarski in northern <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>.) The Tarski brothers also converted to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheist</a>, because he was about to complete his doctorate and correctly anticipated that it would be difficult for a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> to obtain a serious position in the new Polish university system. Tarski was a Polish nationalist and wished to be fully accepted as a Pole, which was how he saw himself. He married a Pole of Catholic ancestry, and spoke Polish at home throughout his later American life.</p>
<p>After becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the University, and served as Łukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school; before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics.</p>
<p>In 1929 Tarski married a fellow teacher, Maria Witkowska. She had worked as a courier for the army during Poland's fight for independence. They had two children.</p>
<p>Tarski applied for a chair of philosophy at <a href="../../../l/w/%C3%B3/Lw%C3%B3w_University_54d2.html" title="Lwów University">Lwów University</a>, but on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>'s recommendation it was awarded to <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Chwistek_eeeb.html" title="Leon Chwistek">Leon Chwistek</a>. In 1937 Tarski applied for a chair at <a href="../../../p/o/z/Pozna%C5%84_University_5a62.html" title="Poznań University">Poznań University</a>; but rather than award a chair to one of Jewish ancestry, the chair was abolished (Feferman and Feferman, 2004, pp. 102-3).</p>
<p>In 1930, Tarski visited the University of Vienna, lectured to Menger's colloquium, and met <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_20cb.html" title="Kurt Gödel">Kurt Gödel</a>. Thanks to a fellowship, Tarski was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unity_of_Science_034d.html" title="Unity of Science">Unity of Science</a> movement, an outgrowth of the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna_Circle_49ab.html" title="Vienna Circle">Vienna Circle</a>.</p>
<p>Tarski's ties to this movement saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> before the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Poland_%281939%29_e800.html" title="Invasion of Poland (1939)">German invasion of Poland</a> and the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Tarski left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. He was so oblivious to the Nazi threat that he left his wife and children in Warsaw; he did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his extended family died at the hands of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Once in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> (1939), <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_College_of_New_York_8e2f.html" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> (1940), and thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship, the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Advanced_Study_d005.html" title="Institute for Advanced Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> at Princeton (1942), where he again met Gödel. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.</p>
<p>In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, where he spent the rest of his career. Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death. At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an awesome and demanding teacher:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"His seminars at Berkeley fast became a power-house of logic. His students, many of them now distinguished mathematicians, recall the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision." <a href="http://www.aam314.vzz.net/Tarski.html" class="external text" title="http://www.aam314.vzz.net/Tarski.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Times</i> obituary.</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Tarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative — sometimes working all night with a colleague — and was very fastidious about priority." (Gregory Moore, "Alfred Tarski" in <i>Dictionary of Scientific Biography</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"A charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and particularly so to women — in contrast to the general trend. Some students were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom became world-renowned leaders in the field." (Anita Feferman 1999)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tarski supervised 24 Ph.D. dissertations, 5 by women, and strongly influenced the dissertations of Alfred Lindenbaum, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Scott_909b.html" title="Dana Scott">Dana Scott</a>, and Steven Givant. His students include <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrzej_Mostowski_100b.html" title="Andrzej Mostowski">Andrzej Mostowski</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Robinson_6b4c.html" title="Julia Robinson">Julia Robinson</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Vaught_e6f2.html" title="Robert Vaught">Robert Vaught</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Feferman_b1bd.html" title="Solomon Feferman">Solomon Feferman</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Montague_e850.html" title="Richard Montague">Richard Montague</a>, J. Donald Monk, Donald Pigozzi, Roger Maddux, and the authors of Chang and Jerome Keisler (1973), the classic text on <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_theory.html" title="Model theory">model theory</a>..</p>
<p>Tarski lectured at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College%2C_London_b3e0.html" title="University College, London">University College, London</a> (1950, 1966), the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris (1955), the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science in Berkeley (1958-1960), the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_at_Los_Angeles_7d09.html" title="University of California at Los Angeles">University of California at Los Angeles</a> (1967), and the <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontifical_Catholic_University_of_Chile_0562.html" title="Pontifical Catholic University of Chile">Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a> (1974-75). He was elected to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Academy_dea7.html" title="British Academy">British Academy</a>, and presided over the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Symbolic_Logic_0f39.html" title="Association for Symbolic Logic">Association for Symbolic Logic</a>, 1944-46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956-57.</p>
<p>As sometimes happens with married couples, Tarski's relations with his wife improved following their divorce. Tarski's daughter married a mathematician.</p>

<p>Tarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad for a <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_logic.html" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logician</a>. His collected papers run to about 2500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Feferman_b1bd.html" title="Solomon Feferman">Solomon Feferman</a>, see "Interludes I-VI" in Feferman and Feferman (2004).</p>
<p>Tarski's first paper, published when he was only 19 years old, was on <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Banach_7a75.html" title="Stefan Banach">Stefan Banach</a> proved that a <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Ball (mathematics)">ball</a> can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a sphere of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two spheres whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banach-Tarski_paradox_d710.html" title="Banach-Tarski paradox">Banach-Tarski paradox</a>. "Paradox" here means "counterintuitive result."</p>
<p>In <i>A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry</i>, Tarski showed, by the method of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantifier_elimination.html" title="Quantifier elimination">quantifier elimination</a>, that the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-order_theory.html" title="First-order theory">first-order theory</a> of the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_number.html" title="Real number">real numbers</a> under addition and multiplication is <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decidability_%28logic%29.html" title="Decidability (logic)">decidable</a>. This is a very curious result, because <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alonzo_Church_e7d1.html" title="Alonzo Church">Alonzo Church</a> proved in 1936 that <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peano_arithmetic.html" title="Peano arithmetic">Peano arithmetic</a> (effectively the theory Tarski proved decidable, except that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_number.html" title="Natural number">natural numbers</a> replace the reals) is not decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incompletable by <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/d/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem.html" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorem">Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a>. In his 1953 <i>Undecidable theories</i>, Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lattice_theory.html" title="Lattice theory">lattice theory</a>, abstract <a href="../../../p/r/o/Projective_geometry.html" title="Projective geometry">projective geometry</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closure_algebra.html" title="Closure algebra">closure algebras</a>, are all undecidable. The theory of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abelian_group.html" title="Abelian group">Abelian groups</a> is decidable, but that of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_theory.html" title="Group theory">non-Abelian groups</a> is not.</p>
<p>In the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometry.html" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. In 1929, he showed that much of Euclidian solid geometry could be recast as a first order theory whose individuals are spheres, a primitive notion, a single primitive binary relation "is contained in," and two axioms that, among other thing, imply that containment <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial_order.html" title="Partial order">partially orders</a> the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mereology.html" title="Mereology">mereology</a> far easier to exposit that Lesniewski's variant. Starting in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, Tarski devised an original <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarski%27s_axioms.html" title="Tarski's axioms">axiomatization</a> for plane <a href="../../../e/u/c/Euclidian_geometry.html" title="Euclidian geometry">Euclidian geometry</a>, one considerably more concise than <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilbert%27s_axioms.html" title="Hilbert's axioms">Hilbert's</a>. Tarski's axiomatization is a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-order_theory.html" title="First-order theory">first-order theory</a> devoid of <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, whose individuals are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point.html" title="Point">points</a>, and having only two primitive <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_relation.html" title="Mathematical relation">relations</a>. In 1930, he proved this theory <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decidable.html" title="Decidable">decidable</a> because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.</p>
<p><i>Cardinal Algebras</i> studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_number.html" title="Cardinal number">cardinal numbers</a>. <i>Ordinal Algebras</i> sets out an algebra for the additive theory of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_type.html" title="Order type">order types</a>. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.</p>
<p>In 1941, Tarski published an important paper on <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_relation.html" title="Binary relation">binary relations</a>, which began the work on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relation_algebra.html" title="Relation algebra">relation algebra</a> and its <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metamathematics.html" title="Metamathematics">metamathematics</a> that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of Roger Lyndon) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiomatic_set_theory.html" title="Axiomatic set theory">axiomatic set theory</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peano_arithmetic.html" title="Peano arithmetic">Peano arithmetic</a>.

Of these four, he was the best mathematician and the most prolific author. Neither Frege nor Gödel ever supervised a single Ph. D. or coauthored a paper; Tarski, on the other hand, supervised 24 Ph. Ds and coauthored over 100 books and papers. Frege was sternly aloof in person and often bitingly sarcastic in print, and Gödel was a notorious recluse. Meanwhile, Tarski loved to interact with people intellectually and socially.</p>
<p>Tarski produced axioms for <i>logical consequence</i>, and worked on deductive systems, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_theory.html" title="Model theory">model theory</a> he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.</p>

<dd>"In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only its concepts and results can be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics." (Sinaceur 2001)</dd>

<p>Tarski's 1936 article "On the concept of logical consequence" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as <i>Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences</i>.</p>

<p>In 1933, Tarski published a very long (more than 100pp) paper in Polish, titled "Pojęcie prawdy w językach nauk dedukcyjnych," setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages. The 1936 German translation was titled "Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den Sprachen der deduktiven Disziplinen," sometimes shortened to "Wahrheitsbegriff." An English translation had to await the 1956 first edition of the volume <i>Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics</i>. This enormously cited paper is a landmark event in 20th century <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytic_philosophy.html" title="Analytic philosophy">analytic philosophy</a>, an important contribution to <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_logic.html" title="Symbolic logic">symbolic logic</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_language.html" title="Philosophy of language">philosophy of language</a>.

<p>Some recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correspondence_theory_of_truth.html" title="Correspondence theory of truth">correspondence theory of truth</a>. The debate centres on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences P of the language for which truth is being defined:</p>
<dl>
<dd>'P' is True if and only if p.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(where p is the proposition expressed by "P")</p>
<p>The debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white</dd>

<p>as expressing merely a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflationary_theory_of_truth.html" title="Deflationary theory of truth">deflationary theory of truth</a> or as embodying <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Tarski_518d.html" title="Edit section: Logical consequence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Logical consequence</span></h2>
<p>In 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris. A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).</p>
<p>This publication set out the modern <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_theory.html" title="Model theory">model-theoretic</a> definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_number.html" title="Cardinal number">cardinalities</a>). This question is a matter of some debate in the current philosophical literature. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Etchemendy_9e7d.html" title="John Etchemendy">John Etchemendy</a> (1999) stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.</p>
<p>Tarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. "What are Logical Notions?" can thus be viewed as continuing "On the Concept of Logical Consequence."</p>
<p><a name="What_are_logical_notions.3F" id="What_are_logical_notions.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Tarski_518d.html" title="Edit section: What are logical notions?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What are logical notions?</span></h2>
<p>Another theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical literature is that outlined in his "What are Logical Notions?" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave in 1966; it was edited without his direct involvement.</p>
<p>In the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he calls "notions") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria was derived from the <a href="../../../e/r/l/Erlangen_programme.html" title="Erlangen programme">Erlangen programme</a> of the German 19th century Mathematician, <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Klein_2c06.html" title="Felix Klein">Felix Klein</a>. (Mautner 1946, and possibly an article by the Italian mathematician Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.)</p>
<p>That program classified the various types of geometry (<a href="../../../e/u/c/Euclidean_geometry.html" title="Euclidean geometry">Euclidean geometry</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affine_geometry.html" title="Affine geometry">affine geometry</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topology.html" title="Topology">topology</a>, etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, "rotate 30 degrees" and "magnify by a factor of 2" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.</p>
<p>As the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">polygon</a> from an <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annulus.html" title="Annulus">annulus</a> (ring with a hole in the centre), but does not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.</p>
<p>Tarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations (<a href="../../../a/u/t/Automorphism.html" title="Automorphism">automorphisms</a>) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe_of_discourse.html" title="Universe of discourse">universe of discourse</a> of a model for the semantic theory of a logic. If one identifies the truth value True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:</p>
<p>1. <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth-function.html" title="Truth-function">Truth-functions</a></i>: All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all <i>n</i>-ary truth-functions for finite <i>n</i>. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)</p>
<p>2. <i>Individuals</i>: No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.</p>
<p>3. <i>Predicates</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-place total and null (the predicate that has all members of the domain in its extension and the predicate that has no members of the domain in its extension).</li>
<li>Two-place total and null, as well as the identity and diversity predicates (the predicate with the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension, the predicate with the empty set as extension, the predicate with the set of all order-pairs &lt;<i>a</i>,<i>a</i>&gt; where <i>a</i> is a member of the domain and the predicate with the set of all order pairs &lt;<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>&gt; in its extension, where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are distinct members of the domain.</li>
<li><i>n</i>-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_conjunction.html" title="Logical conjunction">conjunction</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disjunction.html" title="Disjunction">disjunction</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negation.html" title="Negation">negation</a> (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite).</li>
</ul>
<p>4. <i><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantifiers.html" title="Quantifiers">Quantifiers</a></i>: Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as "Exactly four", "Finitely many", "Uncountably many", and "Between four and 9 million", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates <i>Fx</i> and <i>Gy</i>, "More(<i>x, y</i>)", which says "More things have <i>F</i> than have <i>G</i>."</p>
<p>5. <i>Set-Theoretic relations</i>: Relations such as <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusion.html" title="Inclusion">inclusion</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection.html" title="Intersection">intersection</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union.html" title="Union">union</a> applied to <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subset.html" title="Subset">subsets</a> of the domain are logical in the present sense.</p>
<p>6. <i>Set membership</i>: Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_theory.html" title="Type theory">type theory</a>, but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zermelo-Fraenkel_set_theory_3cdc.html" title="Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory</a>.</p>
<p>7. <i>Logical notions of higher order</i>: While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.</p>
<p>In some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Russell</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_North_Whitehead_a6bd.html" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Whitehead</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Mathematica_bdd5.html" title="Principia Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a></i> are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Feferman_b1bd.html" title="Solomon Feferman">Solomon Feferman</a> and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homomorphism.html" title="Homomorphism">homomorphisms</a>. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.</p>
<p>McGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. "Arbitrarily" includes a countable infinity.</p>
