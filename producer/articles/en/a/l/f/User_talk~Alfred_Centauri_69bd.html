<p>Thank you for supporting at least some of my edits. The people who removed them seem to be practically vandals. I mean, for gosh sakes, if you have a mass bobbing up and down on a spring in a freshman lab it's not on a geodesic! My other item, also removed by the vandals or ostrogoths or people's great cultural revolution gave meaning to a spacelike geodesic. Do you see anything wrong with that part? Seems to me if you stretch a practically weightless fiber (maybe silk or catgut) over the shoulder of "The Thinker" and let it remain there, under tension, an instantaneous shot of it is a spacelike geodesic. But to define "instantaneous" you need clock synchronization over a "space section" which is why I threw in the stuff about the Killing vector.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It appears that Linas was thinking worldline when he read geodesic and he has since apologized for the revert. However, I must confess that I don't understand the spacelike geodesic stuff you wrote either as I am still a novice relativist. Let's see, the worldline of a free particle is a timelike geodesic. To 'see' a spacelike geodesic, would not the fiber above also need to be freely falling? <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 22:32, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Not sure what to do - edit back what I had in or report vandalism as well. I don't know how to do a "revert" without mouse-copying and re-editing, do you? <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 15:36, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, AC. I admit my material on spacelike geodesic was not very clear. I am trying to say, perhaps too mathematically, what "everybody knows" about geodesics in 3-space or even 2-space (like the surface of a spheroid e.g.) but it gets complicated exactly because of that timelike dimension. Maybe you can advise how to put it in simpler terms. Imagine you and a friend are making an old-fashioned toy telephone system across a street, as I did in 1949. You each have a stiff paper cup, and you get some cord that is very light and strong, and put it under tension between the two cups, across the street dividing your apartments. Imagine passing to a limit where the string is virtually massless (actually, the tension in it would interact with gravity, but let the mass -&gt;0 faster than the tension, but the tension -&gt; 0 also! ). That string, which I called a "filament" - confusing Linas - does indeed have a timelike aspect, too. Each particle composing it is moving into the future. So to the relativist it is a sheet and is not a candidate for a geodesic, which has to be a line. But if we synchronize clocks suitably and grab an instantaneous "snapshot" of that string, we have a spacelike geodesic. There are some further problems just below the surface here, however. Due to the rotation of the Earth, one has to synchronize the clocks from a central source, not by exchanging light signals between them, unless the string is oriented exactly North-South. In that case synchronizing to WWV for example, will agree with synchronizing by light signals. (If one goes East-West one runs into the Sagnac effect, and in fact even if North-South there is a small error due to the Earth's motion around the Sun). I am probably being too rigorous. The "problem" I refer to is the "snapshot" issue. If one does not make the assumption I mentioned about a Killing vector (see <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killing_vector_field.html" title="Killing vector field">Killing vector field</a>) one faces the difficulty that the "snapshot" is really a family of short segments, sort of like the fibers one can see in the feathers of a bird - they do not connect because one has not handled the simultaneity issue correctly. One can still construct a spacelike geodesic representing a slice through the sheet that is the string (as explained before), but one has to allow a tiny time variation along it by following those little feathery segments in a continuous way. I was trying to avoid time varying along the spacelike geodesic, but I am probably introducing too many caveats in trying to get a simple static entity (constant time slice). Maybe I can just say that a tightly stretched string taken at one instant is a spacelike geodesic and let the "user" worry about the meaning of "instant." But I have another problem in nomenclature: Linas found the term "filament" confusing. Now I do not want to use "string" because we have <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> nowadays, and ordinary household strings are heavy, and I do not want to use "fiber" because we have "<a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibre_bundle.html" title="Fibre bundle">fibre bundle</a> topology" so I tried "filament". I just checked it in Merriam-Webster and it looks OK. And I used to fish with a "nylon filament leader" [<a href="http://moskvich-service.com/fish-nylon.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://moskvich-service.com/fish-nylon.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] so I am stumped. Seems like a light fibre or cord one could stretch quite a ways and get a good approximation to a space geodesic (remembering to use the snapshot idea rather than to follow the world-lines of each particle making up the filament).</p>
<p>I do hope you get the picture now (you may of course disagree). A tightly stretched filament is a collection of particles each of which has a timelike world-line. Orthogonal to that family of world lines, let's call it a "warp" (not a space-warp and hyperdrive, but a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warp.html" title="Warp">warp</a>) one has a "woof" or <a href="../../../w/e/f/Weft.html" title="Weft">weft</a> . If the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warp.html" title="Warp">warp</a> is the set of timelines, the <a href="../../../w/e/f/Weft.html" title="Weft">weft</a> lines are the spacelike geodesics (provided the filament or fibre is tightly stretched, and essentially massless). <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 01:45, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alfred, I wonder if you could have a look at <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EInductance_000c.html" title="Talk:Inductance">Talk:Inductance</a> when you have some time. Im not happy with the existing defn. and have proposed an alternative which I think is more scientific/basic and doesnt need to mention <i>inductors</i> as such. The other things like Lenz law maybe could be kept to the other pages where they are mentioned. Also my proposal fits with the analogous defn of capacit<i>ance</i>. What do you think?

<p>Alfred, I have spent some(a lot) time trying to simplify and segregate the topics in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Inductance.html" title="Inductance">inductance</a>, especially by splitting 'induced voltages in inductors' from 'applied voltages to inductors' thereby avoiding the confusion of signs and back emf and all that stuff.

<p>Yes ,I agree with you here. 'Ground' seems to be an American term. Over here we use the word 'Earth'. Again not all electronics systems have their reference connected to earth (although for safety reasons many do indirectly). I have always shown the reference on my circuit diagrams (schematics) as <b>0v</b>. So: Anal 0v, Dig 0v etc. <i>Then</i>, if 0v is connected to chassis, show the connection to the chassis symbol. If the chassis needs to be 'earthed', then this is shown as a wire connected from chassis to the earth pin of the mains plug. I suppose the word 'common' is good too. I could live with that! But the 5v 'return' would normally be connected to 'common' wouldnt it? <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 21:06, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You say magnetic charge has not been observed, but magnetic flux has. Correct.</p>
<p>Now consider this: Electric <i>charge</i> has been observed. However, I would argue that, whilst we are all familiar with the concept, electric <b>flux</b>( ie flux meaning flow) is an imaginary concept that cannot be observed directly (same as magnetic charges cant). Is this any help in your thinking?? <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 15:58, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's not correct! Magnetic charge <i>may</i> exist but it has not been observed (yet). Further, if it does exist, it will be directly observable with, for example, a particle detector.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, contrast this with the question of observability of electric flux or any other field associated with EM. The answer may be suprising to you!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The magnetic flux has, in the absence of magnetic charge, zero divergence. Thus, it can be thought of as the curl of some other vector field we call the A field or vector potential. I once asked my EM professor whether the A field is physical or just a mathematical construct. His answer was "a mathematical construct". In other words, he claimed that the A field was not directly observable. However, I later found out that this isn't true. If you pass a current through a solenoidal inductor, the magnetic flux density B is zero outside the inductor. However, the A field can be non-zero outside the inductor as long as the curl of A outside the inductor is zero. This A field external to an energized solenoidal inductor has been observed by the effect it has on the phase of the wave function of electrons passing near but outside the inductor <a href="../../../a/h/a/Aharonov-Bohm_effect_aa6d.html" title="Aharonov-Bohm effect">Aharonov-Bohm effect</a>. Thus, it appears that A is the physical field and B is the mathematical construct!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is likely the same for the scalar potential. That is, V is the physical (scalar) field and E is the mathematical construct. BTW, if magnetic charge does exist, then there should be an electric vector potential and a magnetic scalar potential too. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 16:20, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although your recent work is extremely interesting and ,I think, important to the greater understanding of EM field theory, you probably wont be able to publish it on Wikipedia as recent/new work and self citing is not allowed. <b>However</b>, I feel that insights of this type are to useful to be 'hidden under the bed' and I wondered if Bill Beatty (to whose page I referred you) might be interested in your ideas.

<p>Hi Alfred,</p>
<p>In your User page, under this question you first wrote, "In DC steady state, all circuit voltages and currents are constant." This is also the meaning I understand for the term "DC". That is, not just currents, but also voltages are constant in DC analysis.</p>
<p>You then say, "a constant (DC) voltage across an inductor can exist if the current through the inductor changes at a constant rate." and therefore "the answer [to the titular question] is no." But you've contradicted the definition of DC, which requires that all currents are constant. A current that changes at a constant rate is not constant; it is changing.</p>
<p>To say it another way, for a value (current) to be constant, its derivative must be zero. Therefore the definition of DC requires that all dv/dt and di/dt are zero. Therefore, from the inductor equation v = L(di/dt), we have v=L*0, v=0.</p>
<p>There is probably an analogy here to the question of whether current "flows" or whether current <b>is</b> a flow of charge.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>You wrote (on UserTalk:The Photon):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is not contradiction. You have equated DC steady state and DC which is incorrect. A circuit consisting of an inductor and a DC voltage source has no DC steady state solution yet the voltage across the inductor is constant (DC). <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 11:27, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose you are right. You have been very subtle about the terminology difference between "DC" and "DC steady state". Your solution is a time-varying solution to a circuit with only DC sources. (But I think it would be confusing to students to call it a DC circuit or DC solution).</p>
<p>Also when you said, "It is commonly said that an inductor is a 'short circuit at DC'", this implies you define "at DC" to mean "in a DC analysis." not "in a circuit with only DC sources." The statement "an inductor is a short at DC" is obviously not correct if "at DC" means "the sources are constant in the time period of interest" in a transient analysis.</p>
<p>I guess I accept that "at DC" means either "in a DC analysis" or "in the limit as t -&gt; infinity in a transient analysis", or "in the limit as f -&gt; 0 in an AC analysis". I haven't heard the term "at DC" used to mean "in a time-varying circuit with only DC sources."</p>
<p>If I took the perfect capacitor and perfect inductor, with nonzero i and v, as described in your page, and put them together to make an ideal lossless oscillator, would you still say the circuit is "at DC"?</p>

<p>I have changed my wholesale acceptance of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell.html" title="Maxwell">Maxwell</a>'s equations now. I now believe that <a href="../../../d/i/s/Displacement_current.html" title="Displacement current">displacement current</a> does not in fact exist as a <b>flow</b> of anything at all. Current does appear to be transferred from one plate to the other in a capacitor, but this is purely an effect of the em energy flow down the distributed (TL) structure.

<p>Of course, it may turn out that Maxwell was correct all along, if the theory of vacuum polarisation can be proved.

<p>First, acceleration is not work and force over distance is not the definition of power (it is the definition of work) and second, while horsepower is important for top speed, it is torque that determines acceleration. Consider the case of an electric powered vehicle at rest. At the moment that the vehicle begins to accelerate, the horsepower generated by the motor (no matter how powerful it is) is exactly zero. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 02:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are very incorrect, a running engine (or electric motor) will never have zero horsepower. Because of how hp is measured (hp = tq x rpm / 5252) any rotating object can produce power. If you spin a bowling ball like a top and try to stop it with your hands it will put force on your hands at a certain rate, that is work being performed and to perform work you must have power. So even at idle you can imagine how an engine is making power. The thought that force starts the vehicle off and power keeps it moving is wrong because there is power at the very instant that motor begins to move. So in your electric car example the moment the car would begin to accelerate the motor would have a measurable amount of power. Also the reason power is so important to the performance of a vehicle (and the main thing many people don't understand) is that if you have more power you can create more force at a given rpm. To make a quick example, if you have an engine that makes 400 hp @ 10,500 rpm with 200 lb-ft of torque and an engine that makes 400 hp @ 5,250 rpm with 400 lb-ft of torque they will both be able to provide the same amount of wheel torque at the same rpm thanks to gearing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>200 lb-ft @ 10,500 rpm geared 4:1 = 800 lb-ft at 2625 rpm</dd>
<dd>400 lb-ft @ 5,250 rpm geared 2:1 = 800 lb-ft at 2625 rpm</dd>

<p>Sorry, but your words demonstrate that you are very confused. You are using words like power *very loosely*. Let me give you an example. You said "because there is power at the very instant that motor begins to move". This is clearly wrong. At the instant the motor begins to turn, it is by definition not turning so the power is exactly zero. This is simply by the definition. But hey, don't take my word for it. **Do the math**. To make it simple, assume the motor produces a constant torque, say 100 lb-ft, from the moment the acceleration starts until the motor reaches 1000 rpm, 10 seconds later. Since the torque is constant, the angular acceleration is constant (assuming losses are minimal). Thus, the rpm is increasing at the rate of 100 rpm per second. So, here is the result:</p>
<pre>
   Torque = 100 lb-ft from t = 0 to 10 (seconds)
   HP = 100 lb-ft * 100 * t / 5252 = 1.9 * t hp
   t = 0, hp = 0
   t = 1, hp = 1.9
   t = 2, hp = 3.8
   t = 3, hp = 5.7
   ...
   t =10, hp = 19
</pre>
<p>Don't you see? The horsepower is increasing every second yet the *acceleration* is constant!!! The torque is constant and the acceleration is constant. The horsepower is steadily increasing but the acceleration is constant. Hmmmm... Seems pretty obvious to me which one is responsible for the acceleration. Of course, if losses are *not* minimal but are increasing with rpm, then the acceleration will not be constant but will be reduced as the speed ramps up. However, the result is the same.</p>
<p>Once again, (and this is basic physics - don't take my word for it, go look it up!) it takes (net) torque to change angular speed. This is the definition of torque. Forget any of the other things you have heard - without net torque, angular speed doesn't change. And, if angular speed doesn't change, there is no linear acceleration developed by the tires on the road. To change the angular speed from zero doesn't require any power, only torque. To maintain speed, requires power only if there are losses. For an automobile traveling down the highway at high speed, there are losses from air resistance, tire to road friction as well as mechanical losses in the drivetrain. Thus, to *maintain* this high speed requires power (and therefore torque) from the engine. But, to *increase* that speed rapidly requires far more torque than horsepower.</p>
<p>Consider the following problem that I would think is more applicable to your mind set. Let's say that a car weighing 3000lbs is moving at 60 mph and engine is turning 2000rpm. Let's say the wheels are rotating at half that, 1000rpm (this implies that the radius of the wheel/tire combo is about 10 inches (the diameter would be about 20 inches). The losses (air resistance, tire friction, internal friction, etc.) require that the engine produce 10hp in order to maintain that speed. Using your hp formula above, the torque produced by the engine is 26.26 lb-ft (10hp *5252/2000).</p>
<p>Now, let's say we want to accelerate this vehicle, at the rate of 10mph/per second. This means we need to increase the angular speed of the engine by 334 rpm per second or the wheel/tire rpm by 168rpm per second. Well, at the instant the acceleration starts, the engine is still turning 2000rpm but our torque is way up. In order to *accelerate* the car, we need to change the wheel/tire rpm by 168rpm per second, which requires and additional torque of 1385 lb-ft at the wheels or 692 lb-ft from the engine. That's in *addition* to the torque required to make up the losses at 60mph. So, take a look</p>
<p>To accelerate from 60mph at the rate of 10mph/sec we need:</p>
<pre>
   Torque = 719 lb-ft which is constant
   Acceleration = 10mph/sec (actually a poor assumption since the air resistance goes up as the square of the speed!) starting at t = 0
   t = -1, hp = 10
   t = 0, hp = 273
   t = 1, hp = 319
   t = 2, hp = 364
   etc...
</pre>
<p>So, there ya go. To get that acceleration, we're going to need that torque. Note that, once again, the hp is going up as time progresses but the acceleration is remaining constant. Hmmmm... Alfred Centauri 02:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I understand that it is <b>wheel torque</b> that determines the acceleration of a vehicle. The point is that in order to make more <b>wheel torque</b> you must make more <b>power</b> at the flywheel. That is why the statement "horsepower is important for top speed, it is torque that determines acceleration." is so very incorrect. A vehicle with more <b>power</b> will be able to accelerate faster than a vehicle with less <b>power</b> because it can provide a greater amount of force at the wheels. Power to weight ratio, hmmm...wonder why that came about instead of torque to weight ratio. <a href="../../../i/j/b/User%7EIJB_TA_75e9.html" title="User:IJB TA">IJB TA</a> 02:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, to make more wheel torque requires more torque from the engine. You still don't 'get it' You are using the word power when you should actually be using torque. Please consult a physics text to learn the different. Or, try this for a second opinion: <a href="http://g-speed.com/pbh/torque-and-hp.html" class="external free" title="http://g-speed.com/pbh/torque-and-hp.html" rel="nofollow">http://g-speed.com/pbh/torque-and-hp.html</a> <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a></p>

<dd>You're forgetting the something VERY important, GEARS! Gears multiply torque. Again:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>200 lb-ft @ 10,500 rpm geared 4:1 = 800 lb-ft at 2625 rpm</dd>
<dd>400 lb-ft @ 5,250 rpm geared 2:1 = 800 lb-ft at 2625 rpm</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you do the math you will notice both of those examples have 400 hp. <a href="../../../i/j/b/User%7EIJB_TA_75e9.html" title="User:IJB TA">IJB TA</a> 02:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand the principle of gears very well. In fact, a transmission is analogous to an electrical transformer where voltage is analogous to torque and current is analogous to rpm. And, in both cases, the product of the two must equal on each side (assuming ideal lossless components). When gears multiply torque, they simultaneously divide rpm so the power product is the same. Thus, to get maximum power to the wheels, we need maximum power from the engine, period. There can be no other way to see this. The power going in to the transmission is equal to or greater than the power going out. However, if we want maximum acceleration, we want maximum torque delivered to the wheels and the transmission can certainly multiply the torque for us but not the horsepower! Thus, if want the absolute maximum torque delivered to the wheels, we want the engine rpm at it's torque max to be reduced (usually) to the *current* rpm of the wheels. So, if we're going slow, we want a large ratio and if we're already going fast, a not so large ratio. Still, it is the max torque of the engine that determines the max acceleration. No way around that, I'm afraid. The max horsepower determines the max speed because, and again there is no way around this, the **transmission cannot increase the power delivered to the wheels**. Sure, if you want to be cute and stay in first gear then some other parameter will limit the speed.</p>
<p>Look, assume that the losses at some speed due to air resistance etc, exceed the maximum power output of the engine. Can the car go that fast continuously? Obviously, it cannot. What if the losses, exactly equal the maximum power output of the engine. Can the car go that fast continuously? The answer is yes if the gearing is correct. That is, when the engine is turning the rpm required for max power and that is reduced (usually) to the wheel rpm required for the speed at which losses match the max power, then all is good. If you reduce the hp output of the engine, that speed must now decrease. If the gearing isn't right, then the max speed will be lower because the engine power output will be lower at a different rpm. It's that simple. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 03:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
