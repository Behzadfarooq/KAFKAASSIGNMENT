<p>Alves dos Reis was a child of a humble family; his father was a financially troubled <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undertaker.html" title="Undertaker">undertaker</a> who ended up being declared <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insolvent.html" title="Insolvent">insolvent</a>. Reis wanted to study <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>. He started his degree but quit in the first year to marry Maria Luísa Jacobetti de Azevedo. In 1916 he decided to emigrate to <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angola.html" title="Angola">Angola</a> which, at the time, was a Portuguese <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colony</a>, to try to make a fortune and escape the humiliations from his wife's family, due to the differences of their in social status.</p>
<p>Reis forged himself a diploma of engineering, supposedly from <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>, although in reality it was from a school which didn't exist: the "Polytechnic School of Engineering". According to the diploma, he had studied engineering sciences, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology.html" title="Geology">geology</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometry.html" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallurgy.html" title="Metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, pure <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleography.html" title="Paleography">paleography</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_engineering.html" title="Electrical engineering">electric</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_engineering.html" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical engineering</a>, applied mechanics and physics. He started as a public employee in the public <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewers.html" title="Sewers">sewers</a> constructions and repairs. With an uncovered <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheque.html" title="Cheque">cheque</a>, he bought the major part of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stocks.html" title="Stocks">stocks</a> of the Transafrican Railways of Angola, in <a href="../../../m/o/%C3%A7/Mo%C3%A7%C3%A2medes.html" title="Moçâmedes">Moçâmedes</a>. He became rich and gained credit.</p>

<p>Reis returned to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>. Back in Portugal he acquired a US car dealership and tried to take over the ailing company "Ambaca". He forged checks for over <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_dollar_3927.html" title="US dollar">US $</a>100,000, enough money to buy Ambaca, and then used its money reserves to cover the checks. He used the remaining money in an attempt to take over the Angola Mining Company. He was found out before he could take total control of the company and was arrested in July 1924 in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porto.html" title="Porto">Porto</a> for <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embezzlement.html" title="Embezzlement">embezzling</a> the Ambaca money. He was arrested for 54 days and was released on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_27.html" title="August 27">August 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> because of a technicality; he blamed a criminal conspiracy for his arrest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/v/Alves_dos_Reis_5129.html" title="Edit section: Banco de Portugal plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Banco de Portugal plot</span></h2>
<p>During his time in jail Reis conceived his most ambitious plot. It consisted in forging a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a> in the name of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banco_de_Portugal_734e.html" title="Banco de Portugal">Banco de Portugal</a> - the central bank, responsible for emitting banknotes and partly private at the time - that would allow him to obtain illegitimate banknotes printed in a legitimate company and with the same quality as the real banknotes.</p>
<p>In 1924 Reis contacted potential (<a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_faith.html" title="Good faith">good faith</a>) business partners and detailed his new plan. Between his <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accomplice.html" title="Accomplice">accomplices</a> and collaborators were the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> financer Karel Marang van Ijsselveere; German spy Adolph Hennies; Adriano Silva; Moura Coutinho; Manuel Roquette and José Bandeira, brother to António Bandeira, Portuguese minister to the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague.html" title="Hague">Hague</a>.</p>
<p>Through José Bandeira, Reis acquired his brother's signature for his contract. Then Reis wrote up the fraudulent contract and had it officially <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notary.html" title="Notary">notarized</a>. He also acquired three certifications for the notarization in embassies of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Then he rewrote the contract with a French translation, forged <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signature.html" title="Signature">signatures</a> of the Bank of Portugal officials and affixed the notarizations to the new contract with large banknotes. With this contract Reis gained cooperation of some Dutch entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Next Karel Marang approached a Dutch printing company who declared that the specific banknotes had been printed by a British company, Waterlow and Sons Limited of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">4 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> and Marang approached Sir William Waterlow with a Dutch letter of introduction. He explained that for political reasons the contract required utmost discretion and promised that he would shortly receive appropriate documentation from Lisbon. The <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleged.html" title="Alleged">alleged</a> objective for the banknotes was to conceal a big loan to the development of Angola.</p>
<p>When Waterlow received letters that authorized the printing - more of Reis' forgeries - he accepted the contract. He also wrote a letter to the governor of the Banco de Portugal, Inocêncio Camacho Rodrigues, in which he talked about the contacts with Marang, but the letter went astray. Reis's accomplices promised that they would stamp the word "Angola" onto the new notes, because the notes were supposed to circulate only in the colonies, so Waterlow could use serial numbers similar to banknotes that were already circulating in Portugal.</p>
<p>Waterlow and Sons Limited printed 200,000 banknotes of 500 <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_escudo.html" title="Portuguese escudo">Portuguese escudos</a> (almost 1% of the country's <a href="../../../g/d/p/GDP_35c9.html" title="GDP">GDP</a> at the time) with an image of <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasco_da_Gama_3d28.html" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>, with the date of <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">17 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> worth 100 million escudos. Then, the number of false 500 escudos banknotes was almost as big as the real ones. First delivery was made in February <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, one year after the real 500-escudo banknotes with the image of Vasco da Gama began to circulate. The notes would go from England to Portugal with the help of his accomplices, José Bandeira, who would use the diplomatic advantages of his brother, Karel Marang and connections to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberia.html" title="Liberia">Liberian</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consul.html" title="Consul">consul</a> in London. Reis proceeded to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_laundering.html" title="Money laundering">launder</a> them into smaller denominations of genuine money.</p>
<p>Although Reis was the inventor of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> and the forger of all the documents, he received only 25% of the proceeds. Still, he became very wealthy and created the "Bank of Angola and Metropolis" in June 1925 to aid in circulation by promising higher interest. To obtain the license to open the bank, again he forged some documents. He invested heavily in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market.html" title="Stock market">stock market</a> and even created a minor upsurge in Portuguese economy. He bought the <i>Palace of the Golden Boy</i> (Palácio do Menino de Ouro, nowadays the building of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Council_e1fd.html" title="British Council">British Council</a> in Lisbon), 3 farms, a taxi fleet, and spent an enormous quantity of money in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery.html" title="Jewellery">jewellery</a> and expensive <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothing.html" title="Clothing">clothing</a> for his wife and José Bandeira's lover, Fie Carelsen, a Dutch actress. He intended to purchase the newspaper <a href="../../../d/i/%C3%A1/Di%C3%A1rio_de_Not%C3%ADcias_eb99.html" title="Diário de Notícias">Diário de Notícias</a>, but failed.</p>
<p>However, the intent on Reis' investments were to gain control of the Bank of Portugal so he could thwart any possible investigations to his scheme. During the Summer of 1925, he bought 7000 stocks of the Bank. By the end of September he had 9000 and in November 10,000 stocks - he required 45,000 stocks to gain control of the bank.</p>

<p>Throughout 1925, rumours of fake bankotes arose, but the experts didn't detect any banknote that looked fake. On October 1925, a teller in <a href="../../../o/p/o/Oporto.html" title="Oporto">Oporto</a> became suspicious and phoned bank officials in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. Starting on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">23 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, Alves dos Reis and his shady business deals began to attract the curiosity of journalists at the newspaper <i>O Século</i> (<a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> for "The Century"), the most important daily newspaper at the time. Journalists tried to understand how it was possible that Reis' bank, Banco de Angola e Metrópole gave loans with low interest rates without the need of receiving deposits. Initially, it was thought that it was a German tactic to disturb the country and obtain advantages within the Angolan colony.</p>
<p><i>O Século</i> publicly revealed the fraud on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">5 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>. The day before, the Bank of Portugal had sent the inspector of Counseler of Bank Commerce, João Teixeira Direito to Porto, to investigate the huge deposits by the Bank of Angola and Metropolis in banknotes of 500 escudos in the <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exchange_rate.html" title="Exchange rate">cambist</a> firm Pinto da Cunha. They finally found banknotes with duplicated serial numbers. Authorities gave all the bank agencies an order to put their notes in the vault by order of serial number to control the duplicates and many more forged notes were found. Bank of Portugal contacted Waterlow and Sons and Reis' scheme fell apart. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">6 December</a> Reis' bank's wealth was confiscated and Reis and most of his associates were arrested. Reis himself was arrested on board of <i>Adolph Woerman</i>, returning from Angola. He was 28 years old. Only Marang and Adolph Hennies, who was with Reis at the moment of his arrest, escaped.</p>
<p>In the following trial, Reis' forged documents were convincing enough for judges to suspect that the Bank of Portugal officials might be really involved. This delayed the sentence for five years but Reis was finally tried in May 1930. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In prison he converted to a Protestant sect and was released May 1945. Reis was offered a job as a bank employee, but he refused. He was convicted for fraud in a sale of <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> from Angola, but didn't serve time.</p>
<p>Alves dos Reis died of a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> in poverty in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>.</p>

<p>Bandeira received a sentence similar to Reis. He died on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">9 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> in poverty.</p>
<p>Marang was tried in the Netherlands and sentenced for only 11 months. He later gained <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> citizenship and died very rich in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannes.html" title="Cannes">Cannes</a>.</p>

<p>Reis's fraud had enormous repercussions on the economy and politics of Portugal. By the end of 1925 Reis had managed to introduce escudo banknotes worth £1,007,963 at 1925 exchange rates into the Portuguese economy, which was equivalent to 0.88% of Portugal’s nominal <a href="../../../g/d/p/GDP_35c9.html" title="GDP">GDP</a> at the time.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_escudo.html" title="Portuguese escudo">Portuguese escudo</a> was fiscally disturbed and lost much of its credibility. After the scheme was found out, the Bank of Portugal ordered the withdrawal of all 500-escudo banknotes within 20 days, until <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">December 26</a>; 115,000 counterfeit notes were withdrawn.</p>
<p>When Reis's fraud became public knowledge in December 1925 it brought about a crisis of confidence in the Portuguese government. Although events of this period are still little understood, this crisis had a strong effect on the nationalist military <a href="../../../2/8/t/28th_May_1926_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_f32b.html" title="28th May 1926 coup d'état">28th May 1926 coup d'état</a> against the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_First_Republic_2d68.html" title="Portuguese First Republic">Portuguese First Republic</a> government and President <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernardino_Machado_9f0c.html" title="Bernardino Machado">Bernardino Machado</a> that brought the <i><a href="../../../d/i/t/Ditadura_Nacional_6292.html" title="Ditadura Nacional">Ditadura Nacional</a></i> (National Dictatorship) to power, heralding the dictatorship of Prime Minister <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar_8ee9.html" title="António de Oliveira Salazar">António de Oliveira Salazar</a> from 1932 to 1968 (See: <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estado_Novo_%28Portugal%29_ebfd.html" title="Estado Novo (Portugal)">Estado Novo</a>).</p>
<p>Banco de Portugal sued Waterlow &amp; Sons in the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Justice_9cca.html" title="High Court of Justice">High Court</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.
