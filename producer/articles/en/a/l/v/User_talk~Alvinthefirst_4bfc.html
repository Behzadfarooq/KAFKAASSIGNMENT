	    <p>The SINKEX information was NOT cut and pasted from ANYWHERE. It came from <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/nhcorg12.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/nhcorg12.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/nhcorg12.htm</a> This time , the Sinkex info was given WITH a source and you have been reported for vandalism on editing CREDIBLE sources. Get off it.navysite.de/navy/sinkex/hawaii/cg18.htm IS another source for the Sinkex and the site is a spot for divers of the coast of Hawaii and Many want to know where it is . STOP meddling. You have NO clue as to even what you are doing. You made it personal.</p>
<p>The Bandar Abbas " stuff " wasn't placed there by me , it came from the ships 1977 Cruise Book and also came from the NAVY Source YOU cited. It seems JUST to toss a lug at me , you vandalized the article out of spite. You seem like you're an 8 year old. Better check WHO placed what where before you start editing. Check Wikipedias' policy on editing wars before you go any further . I have requested arbitration concerning this and can back up everything I posted with credible sources , you're making changes out of spite and for personal gratification , go get your jolies elsewhere, you know absolutely NOTHING about the USS Worden while I can name every Captain and executive officer from Commissioning to Decommissioning and even name who ( with citations ) fired the shot on the sinkex that sunk her. This makes you unqualified.</p>

<p>I assumed , perhaps wrongly ,that the talk page was a personal page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alvinthefirst (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alvinthefirst_1845.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alvinthefirst">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I understand. No, article talk pages (like the talk page for USS Worden) are not personal pages. When they get too long, we <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_archive_a_talk_page_629d.html" title="Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page">archive</a> them, but we generally do not delete content from article talk pages. Your own talk page is a personal page, and you can generally do with it as you see fit, with some limitations; see <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia's user page guidelines</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 16:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you're looking for accuracy on the U.S.S. Worden , which this page is vaguely accurate , you might want to look here . <a href="http://cg-18.com/Command_History_1985/" class="external free" title="http://cg-18.com/Command_History_1985/" rel="nofollow">http://cg-18.com/Command_History_1985/</a> . It gives the Command History year by year , incidents , and narratives from former crew members such as myself . I attempted to make some changes to the page by placing in things from the Command History but I was edited by Dual Freq and told they were erroneous. As a former crew member I have everything on the ship on microfiche from launch to sinking , and assumed my input would be valuable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dual Freq didn't say that your edits were erroneous. He said that they were unsourced. On Wikipedia, every piece of information in articles must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">published reliable sources</a>. Neither Dual Freq nor I are trying to imply that you're in any way unreliable, but information must be found in a book or other published source before it can be put into an article, and you must be able to provide accurate and precise information about where it can be found. That allows other users to easily verify the information and also find out more.</dd>
<dd>The web site above looks like a great source for information. If you'd like to include information from that site in the article, I think that'd be a great idea, but keep in mind that an encyclopedia article should be a summary and you shouldn't try to add every detail of the ship's history. Also make sure to provide the exact web address where the information is found. We can also put a link to that site at the bottom of the article, so that people who want more information can find it easily.</dd>
<dd>I don't see any mention of the incident that you wanted to describe in detail on that site. Am I just missing it? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 18:50, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article I wanted mentioned in detail came from a series of articles on Yokosuka Drug busts in 1976 dating from January to October of 1976 which were in the Overseas , ( Yokosuka ) edition of the Stars and Stripes , which I have nearly every copy of the 1976 Yokosuka Stars and Stripes either on Microfiche or the actual copy. The incident WONT be mentioned in the Command History because of the nature of the incident as the XO , the Chief Master at Arms and several of the ships officers were involved in FORGING evidence in order to convict the personnel involved , therefore it was omitted from the ships Command History ,as it would be if there were any illegalities involved .However , the National Archives would have the exact narrative of the ships history that isn't watered down , as I have it , as much as isn't redacted because it isn't classified . When I listed it , I cite the exact article from Stars and Stripes and the date. As per DUAL FREQ , it's not a personal soapbox , men comiited suicide and some rotted in prison because they were framed by overzealous officers looking for better performance ratings. They deserved better BUT as this is a community encyclopedia , there are other forums for JUSTICE , not here. I think the two sentences listing the article is fine and I will only use historical information of merit if I edit the site further. Personally , I have the ENTIRE SHIPS HISTORY from 1964 to decommissioning , including copies of the ships log during the 1976 drug trials , some original copies or photos taken by personnel on watch or myself .</p>
