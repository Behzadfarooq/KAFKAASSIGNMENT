<p>I cleaved a sentence from the first paragraph, "Plantinga's works are often considered to be responsible for the resurgence of theist philosophy in recent years," because it violates the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">weasel terms</a> policy of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Philosophy_88d8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Philosophy">WikiProject Philosphy</a>. Upon proper citing of those who "often consider" this should be reinstated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The claim follows from the verifiable fact that his work on his respective interests has either been widely discussed with respect by philosophers, or has become largely normative. Whether it is the argument against naturalism, the free will defense, the ontological argument, discussion of actualism, etc., Plantinga's work has been significant in this regard.

<p>According to his autobiography, his education was a bit more complex than it is made to seem here. He attended Jamestown College for one semester Fall 1949. Then When his father was offered a job at Calvin he moved there and attended for the following semester before being offered the scholarship at Harvard. I know these details seems trivial, but since he is such a major figure in contemporary Philosophy, it seems as if it should be shown that he did go straight to Harvard.--<a href="../../../b/k/c/User%7EBkcraft_902a.html" title="User:Bkcraft">Bkcraft</a> 19:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Plantinga is listed as having studied w/ Nancy Cartwright at Michigan- that can't be right- she's much younger than he is and earned her PhD from Illinois-Chicago.</p>
<p><br />
As far as I know, Harvard itself doesn't give scholarships. They only offer financial aid. (Their argument: "All of our students deserve scholarships.") However, it is possible he got a scholarship from other organization for which he used to attend Harvard.</p>

<dd>I think that either Plantinga's "evolutionary argument against naturalism" should be made into its own article (since it is both serious and widely discussed in the field), or should be (re?)added to the article on naturalism (philosophy). The alternatives are undesirable; it is of course tedious to include <i>all</i> of a philosopher's arguments in one article, but it is awkward to only include substantive discussion of one. What do you people think? (Also, how do you put in block suggestions into an article? I know nothing about Wikipedia.) Dextris Dei 00:45, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I've found a reference; <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA120.html" class="external free" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA120.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA120.html</a> It seems that Plantinga argument boils down to "an evolved mind is fallible, its conclusions untrustworthy" leading onto "I don't want to have a fallible mind, therefore my mind must have been created". Not making sense? It screams <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacy.html" title="Fallacy">fallacy</a>, but then what did you expect? — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 17:40, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The argument makes perfect sense to me, and your paraphrase certainly does not do it justice. It is unlikely that naturalistically evolved minds would be geared towards truth-finding, especially abstract truth-finding, for the reasons in the Churchland quotation. That is, that naturalistically evolved minds would be geared towards "feeding, fleeing fighting, and reproducing". Not only is it not fallacious, it is very similar, if not identical, to arguments that have led contemporary postmodern philosophers like Richard Rorty to anti-realist epistemological positions. — <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoethean_f9d1.html" title="User talk:Goethean">ॐ</a> 18:05, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be ridiculous to interpret POV issues according to a user name. A better method is: look at the contributions. The name "Dextris Dei," meaning "Right hand of God" in Latin, is quite funny actually, for a Wikipedia username.</dd>
<dd>As for Plantinga's argument being "asinine," the opinions of those on talk origins, or infidels.org, etc., are completely irrelevant, since there is ample material in actual scholarship on the matter. It is not often that a living (and Christian) philosopher's critique of something a prominent as naturalism elicits an anthology of discussion from reputed scholars. Plantinga's argument has done this. Your reformulation of the argument appears to be a reformulation of a completely different argument. Plantinga is not talking about purpose or being made in God's image and so on. He is demonstrating the low or inscrutible probability of true beliefs being produced by naturalistic mechanism and, furthermore, the irrationality in believing such production has occurred. The Christian "answer" to the problem is an afterthought, but it certainly is interesting for a theistic epistemologist. Surely, if "properly functioning cognitive faculties operating in a congenial epistemic environment with a design plan aimed at truth" have both a powerful and benevolent origin, they are going to be trustworthy (at least, belief in their trustworthiness is warranted).

<p>Look, the issue isn't whether Plantinga is wrong, but whether this particular argument deserves an article in itself, however wrong it might be. I can think of two reasonable justifications for branching off an article: 1) there's too much material to comfortably fit here or 2) the argument is often searched for by people who aren't looking for Plantinga. As far as I can tell, though, neither one of htese possible justifications applies.

<p>If you say so. Frankly, it's really not much of an argument. As with so many of Plantinga's arguments, it's best received by those who already agree with the conclusion, but not necessarily taken all that seriously when preached to those not already in the choir.

<p>Since the article is on Alvin Plantinga, it only needs to describe his views.

<dd>I understand your point, but for practical reasons, I have to disagree. A philosopher's (or charlatan's) bio page is where a summary of their overall views belongs, and that includes a summary of criticisms. If there's more to be said, it can be broken out into appropriate pages (such as <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_philosophy.html" title="Objectivist philosophy">Objectivist philosophy</a> as distinct from <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a>), but that doesn't mean the original page should be silent on the matter. Consider that, for every link you place between the starting point and destination, you lose a large number of readers who just want a brief overview. That's why relegating criticism to sub-articles often serves to minimize criticism. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 16:05, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It just seems less-than-desirable. There is a difference, I think, in cases like an article on <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, where criticism ought to be given significant mention, probably because there is after all such a thing as <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kantianism.html" title="Kantianism">Kantianism</a>.

<p>Dextris, unless you are a friend or associate of Professor Dennett, calling him "Dan" seems false. And although some might see Plantinga as a charlatan as well, the request for other viewpoints is not an ad hominem attack. We should note that <i>Naturalism Defeated?</i> *is* about his ideas.

If I were trying to end dissent, I'd be looking to remove Plantinga altogether. Instead, let's insure all views are represented.

It is <i>not</i> perfectly obvious why anyone should pay the slightest attention to your autobiographical comments in this respect. It <i>is</i> obvious that your opinion and feelings are irrelevant, since they are contrary to evidently all peer-reviewed scholarship, as literally five minutes' research into scholarly search engines reveals.

<dd>The comments were meant for illustration; it is hard to believe that you did not notice that, and so you leave the reader to wonder what you're playing at. Your claims to critics on this page being irrelevant and your suggestion that we look solely to journals is nothing more than the fallacious argument from authority. It is also expected from a person in your position, that is, an undergrad in a philo department. Now, all of your red herrings aside, there <i>are</i> 'scholars' who disagree with Plantinga; since you're spending so much time in journals, and hold them up as founts of knowledge, won't <i>you</i> cite a few articles in the spirit of the love of wisdom? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.240.122.161 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.240.122.161.html" title="User talk:63.240.122.161">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.240.122.161_d5a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.240.122.161">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>This has nothing to do with me being an undergraduate, or with the argument from authority. I am not arguing for the truth of anything because a credible person says so, although really that would be justifiable in most cases. It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority#Conditions_for_a_legitimate_argument_from_authority" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority#Conditions_for_a_legitimate_argument_from_authority" rel="nofollow">perfectly legitimate</a> if I say that the earth is billions of years old, even though I am merely going with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_consensus.html" title="Scientific consensus">scientific consensus</a> on the issue. I am just trusting a reliable source with credentials, that is, the scientific community. So here I am saying that, trasparently, Plantinga's argument is respected and taken seriously - that means noticed and discussed in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-review.html" title="Peer-review">peer-reviewed</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarly_method.html" title="Scholarly method">scholarship</a>. That is more or less a matter of definition for the terms <i>respected</i> and <i>taken seriously.</i> I can't think of a better usage, certianly not the elevated thoughts of you or me. Also, of <i>course</i> there are numerous scholars who disagree with Plantinga; philosophy and science are not supposed to be <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogmatic.html" title="Dogmatic">dogmatic</a> in that respect. That's how progress works. And I'm not holding up journals as "founts of knowledge," I'm just taking seriously the benefits of peer-reviewed scholarship. What is peer-reviewed scholarship? A collection of rigorous work done by highly and verifiably educated people in a field, subject to mutual criticism and development by like persons. As I said, I can't think of a better way than those <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credentials.html" title="Credentials">credentials</a> for defining what is serious, respected, and so on. On the other hand, statements like "I'm inclined to agree," "I find them risible," etc. are <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiographical.html" title="Autobiographical">autobiographical</a> comments and therefore uninteresting. By the way, the proper stereotype for undergraduates is not reference to philosophy and science journals. Faculty would love that. The stereotype for undergraduate is, oddly, what you are doing, which is making outlandish claims which <i>ignore</i> the work in the field, just going by what so far appear to be your whims and feelings.

<dd>I wrote up a little summary of their conclusions. I actually was going through the paper and writing a summary of the arguments, but it got too long. Here is what I came up with:
<dl>
<dd><i>They show that if traditional theism and 1990s naturalistic evolutionary theory are the only choices available, then Plantinga's claim that the probability that traditional theism is true has a 'comparable' probability as naturalistic evolutionary theory being true is impossible under the axioms of <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_logic.html" title="Bayesian logic">Bayesian logic</a> (section 1.5)<a href="http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. There is another way to interpret Plantinga's argument. In order for Plantinga's argument to avoid self-contradiction,</i> prior to the argument <i>the probability of traditional theism must be very high for the subject (around 95%) and the probability of naturalistic evolutionary theory must be very low (around 5%). So on this intrepretation, Fitelson and Sober continue, the argument is "entirely deprived of all probative force."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That only goes about halfway through the paper. Maybe I'll come back and finish it sometime. — <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoethean_f9d1.html" title="User talk:Goethean">ॐ</a> 15:02, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I restored this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, asserting that naturalistic evolution is true is also asserting that one has a low probability of being right in any of his assertions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe this is an accurate summary of Plantinga's argument. Am I mistaken? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 22:23, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the sentence is fine, although a bit awkward. The propositions themselves are not the same, but it's true the argument is that the latter follows from the former. That's just a slightly careless formulation, since as I said the assertions themselves are not said to be <i>identical,</i> but are said to <i>follow.</i> Since, however, people read and understand the English language, it should be fine, and probably gets the point accross well since it is terse.

<p>Perhaps this sentence should be reworded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has argued that anyone who holds to the truth of both naturalism and evolution is irrational in doing so, an argument that finds much support within the intelligent design movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to naturalism and evolution as "the truth" in reference to Platinga seems out of place, from what I can gather. <a href="../../../e/j/e/User%7EEjectgoose_7754.html" title="User:Ejectgoose">Ejectgoose</a> 21:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
