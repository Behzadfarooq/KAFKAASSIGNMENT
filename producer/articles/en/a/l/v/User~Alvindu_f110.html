	    <p>Alvin Du first came into the spotlight of the public during the post Iraq war at the start of the 21 centry. The war was led be an ancient civilization known as the (Old) United States of American, which is now the reowned property of the Disneyoogle Humanright World Union Enterprise Charity.</p>
<p>Alvin was a revolutionist, a writer, a teacher and above all, as praised by many, a legend.</p>
<p>To understand the importance Alvin Du has on the world, one must examine the historical facts related to that specially era.</p>
<p>At the start of the 21 centry, just before the publication of the Theory that explained everything in one book - The Elbib (written by "some of the most clever ancients") The world still relied its development on the mere power of eletricity, fire, water, nuclear fusion technology, and an wicked search algorithm.</p>
<p>The great conquest of "why the f are we doing all this" existed in a mere form of a philosophical paradox, laughed and refused to be pursuited by the most intellgent of the homo-sexuals and homo-sepians.</p>
<p>However, at the earlier stage of Alvin's adult life, Dr.Du has already envisioned a world of becoming so overwelmingly developed, which would become too exhausted to expend any furthur, and eventually collapse inwards onto itself, as all planets and stars do in this limited box which was then called, The Universe.</p>
<p>The term "The universe" was chosen, because the Ancients thought The Box was so vast and borderless, that its actually resembles all the knowledge contained within The "Univers"-ity libary. However, later did they know that distance could be overcome by making holes inside the box, and soon populated all over the place until all of the habitable planets of the world was occupied, and developed.</p>
<p>When the secret of 'The Universe'(the Box) eventually unfolded, just as the very first people who realised earth was a ball floating on zero-gravity. Living beings that originated from planet earth finally began to focus on the oldest and the only question remained to be answered - "why the f are we doing all this".</p>
<p>It was then, an old wikipedia scroll was uncovered at the Archive of Google Book Search, where it was realised that one man amongst the greatest of all of the ancients, had forseen this happening, as he has already took the initiative of answering it for everybody. The great Dr.Du wrote in his book: "Why!..?..Oh!" (Ad: Please Blink your eyes Now! If you want this book freely delivered to you after you have finished reading this article, and please read our ads and blink once in a while to support all of our great free services), in one of his most famous passage, he wrote:</p>
<p>"We are doing all of this, because we didn't understand. By which time we have understood everything, (if life has not being destroy by the unlikely event of The Box catch a virus), the world would finally reach its maxium potential growth possible, and the power of that knowledge, shall unlock the brain power of all living beings, and the universe as the acient knew, would crumble with joy. In order to prevent itself from the destruction of exploitation by all that knowledge, the box collapses all space within on itself, re-arranging all element formation to default, and thus enjoy peace once again. There is no need to feel sad or happy about the whole event, as the sun would always rise again, it would be just in another day in paradise for The Box, and we all will once again being born, and we shall once again explore, understand, and sleep"</p>
<p>Although most of the ancient text could be decyphered, no modern book has any reference or idea of what 'F' could stood for, in the great question...Some thinks, maybe, its means...Freedom..*tears*</p>
