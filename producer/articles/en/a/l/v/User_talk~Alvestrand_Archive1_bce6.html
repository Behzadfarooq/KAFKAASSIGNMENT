<p>Hi Alvestrand. I agree that the ToC of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbert_Einstein_dfdf.html" title="Talk:Albert Einstein">Talk:Albert Einstein</a> looks awful. It was even worse, though, IMO, when it had dozens of separate sections covering the Einstein, Hilbert, Lorentz, and Poincaré dispute, because it was difficult for a newcomer to see which sections were and were not related to that dispute. There should probably even be an entirely separate talk page to discuss that dispute so that people can effectively discuss other content issues for the Einstein article. Anyway, the <i>MEINER THEORIE</i> section is part of that dispute, right, or have I missed something? <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 00:44, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Rod! I've tried to push the debate towards the "disputes about..." page, but since Licorne won't budge, it's kind of hard. In my opinion, there should be one talk page for "debates with Licorne/De kludde" and one page for "the rational discussions". But that depends on Licorne's cooperation, which is not forthcoming, it seems. Is it time to archive the page? --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 06:05, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We could ask the talk page participants to support moving the dispute sections to the "disputes about..." talk page and leaving only a link to it on the main talk page. If a consensus results, we would be justified in moving subsequent similar dispute posts to the new talk page. However, it has been suggested that somebody first summarize the existing dispute in NPOV terms. Are you up for such a challenge? <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 15:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The existing Wikipedia dispute, or the larger dispute about Einstein &amp; co? I've tried to make the "disputes about" (now "Priority disputes about") page as NPOV as possible, but it's hard to make a NPOV summary of a debate between one rabid outlier and a slightly rough consensus..... --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 15:36, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was referring to the Wikipedia dispute, but I see the good work you've done already on the "disputes about" page. At first glance, that page appears to cover the major points made in the main talk pages, so I'll start straw polls on the main talk pages to see whether there is consensus to use the dispute talk page going forward. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 19:25, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll see what I can do about making a summary of the Wikipedia dispute - I started collecting some stuff on <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_POV-history_2a64.html" title="User:Alvestrand/POV-history">User:Alvestrand/POV-history</a>, but so far, it's more about who's involved than about what it's about.... --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 19:32, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alvestrand, see my talk page for the response to your question. Also, as you have contacted John Stachel, would you be willing to contact <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albrecht_F%C3%B6lsing_db67.html" title="Albrecht Fölsing">Albrecht Fölsing</a> (Einstein biographer quoted by CRS) as well? He might be a reasonably neutral witness to ask about the question whether or not the cut off part of the printer proofs is relevant to what CRS claim in their paper.De kludde 01:26, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what I'd ask him - I contacted Stachel to hear if he had an online copy of his original article (he didn't). But he seems a little more reclusive than Stachel was. Do you have contact details for him? --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 15:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the nice comment on the article. I hadn't really realized how much I had on the guy until I started writing it down! By the way -- which Stachel article are you referring to above?

<dd>Alvestrand, could you explain where I show disregard for fact in the WN Wiki articles I linked? You may not like my <a href="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper#Conclusion_and_acknowledgments" class="external text" title="http://wnwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Corry_Renn_Stachel_paper#Conclusion_and_acknowledgments" rel="nofollow">conclusion of my article on the GRT priority issue</a>, but I point out the facts and try to explain why I come to the conclusion that Einstein probably plagiarized Hilbert. You may not support this conclusion but it seems that you found the list of references useful and accepted the way I represented the facts.De kludde 13:56, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to have an example of disregard for fact, you may have one in the Wikipedia naming Hilbert's action functional the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein-Hilbert_action_ec91.html" title="Einstein-Hilbert action">Einstein-Hilbert action</a>. There is absolutely no indication whatsoever that Einstein developed this independently of Hilbert, even if you believe the CRS claims.De kludde 13:56, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, speaking about political motives, why do you think Renn &amp; Co don't have political motives of their own? After all, Renn published a polemic against Wuensch in a newspaper, with some of his pupils writing an article about German Physics on the other page and Renn claiming that one has to keep the antisemitic intentions of Lenard and Stark in mind when considering the objections raised by Wuensch and Winterberg?De kludde 13:56, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main point where I think you show bias and not respect for fact is on the front page, where you claim that Wikipedia has a strong Jewish bias. Of course my opinion on matters like the "reality" presentation in the "ZOG" article on WNWiki is rather strong too. I even object to the term "White Nationalist" being appropriated by racial bigots - I'm white, I have great care for my nation, so I may fit both labels - but I can never, ever use them together, because the Jew-hating, racist bigots calling themselves "white nationalists" have appropriated the term.</dd>
<dd>All that said - I think you personally, in this case, have done a reasonable job of presenting facts, drawing conclusions I disagree with, and keeping the two separate - something I admire you for, even though your choice to associate yourself with the "white nationalist" label as it is currently used means that I am likely to find very many opinions of you to dislike.</dd>
<dd>And of course Stachel has a definite interest - he wants to keep his job as "Einstein professor". That doesn't mean he can't be right, of course. I don't know anything about the background of the others. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 15:19, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alve, Was your suspicion that De kludde might be Licorne based on De kludde appearing when Licorne is banned? I notice after a long silence De kludde is back, while Licorne is banned for 72 hours. Just a coincidence I guess, or did you notice a similar pattern? <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 01:30, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Partly - but de Kludde apperaed first (Feb 6), Licorne appearing on Feb 12. What I thought first was that 66/69 had created the De Kludde account, lost the password, and then created the Licorne account. But they have been working concurrently at times, and their behaviours are somewhat different, as noted above, so I no longer believe it. De kludde may be avoiding conflicts with Licorne, however. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 06:06, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I kind of think the protection has outlived its usefulness.... the other page in the dispute, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, is unprotected, and Licorne's edits get reverted pretty quickly when they're undocumented or POV - as is the case most of the time.

<dd>Fair enough. I suppose that now the RfC has started, continued bad editing will just provide more evidence. I'll leave a note on the talk page, and if there are no objections in 24 hours or so, I'll unprotect. For future reference, <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> deals with unprotection requests aswell as protection requests, if the protecting admin is not available. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 02:45, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>care to open the straw poll you suggested, so that we can get our list of Licorne sock-puppet IP addresses refreshed? Or do you think it's better to wait until it's become obvious that Licorne won't respond to his RfC?

<dd>Licorne's IP addresses will probably be investigated as a result of the RfC. Few people have expressed any enthusism for moving the talk page dispute discussion to the new talk page, and a straw poll does not seem very useful if the RfC results in a restraint for Licorne. If you don't mind, then, I'll wait either for more suggestions regarding the move or for the RfC to conclude. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodasmith_9e4e.html" title="User talk:Rodasmith">☎ Smith</a>)</small> 20:18, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it's recent, it's not likely to be the same one - I've scanned the "contribution" log of both Licorne and his 2-3 most common IP addresses, and they don't touch on anything related to Gödel.

<dd>Alvestrand. Some people seem to think Licorne is Bjerknes. In a few places you have indicated that you know how old Licorne is and when his PhD was awarded. What information do you have? A Ph D "Dean Leo Mamas" was award by UCLA in about 1979 or so (this from UCLA library catalog, and I think it has the year of birth). There are three papers around the same time in good journals where D L Mamas is one of the authors. I cannot find anything recent. The "Dean Mamas" who emails me told me he lives near or in St Petersbug Florida. There is an unlisted telephone number for D L Mamas in the St Petersburg phone book. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 03:05, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fastfission's info is the stuff I'm using - the post where he admits to his name, the PhD record. I'm occasionally mixing it in with my comments to see if I can get Licorne to confirm or deny it. The collection is on my "POV-pusher" page. No really original research.... but it all seems to fit. I felt strange realizing how much information I could find about a complete stranger starting only with his name..... --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 08:29, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Just as a thought, I'm not sure the sockpuppetry charge works. 1. Sockpuppetry usually involves trying to pretend you are <i>not</i> the same person as the other accounts which come in (i.e. to stack votes, pretend there is more opinion on your side than there is), and in most cases Licorne's 69/66 accounts are obviously him and he doesn't deny it; 2. For the accounts which are not obviously Licorne (17/67/64) and could be reasonably considered sock-puppets if they were indeed Licorne, it seems like it would be difficult if not impossible to show that they actually were Licorne. So I think it is somewhat of a weak charge, and probably unnecessary (the POV pushing and insults are more than enough), and might be worth removing just to keep things focused? My fear is that we'll get bogged down with discussions about whether he is or isn't those other accounts, and since the involvement of those other accounts is so minimal, it doesn't seem to be to be worth it to bring them up. It might also look like we are looking for "anything we can get" on the guy, which isn't the case at all (the evidence of his POV pushing and insults could fill a novella). Anyway -- just my two cents on that particular point, though I do appreciate your help in compiling the evidence (I am very busy this week -- I am under a number of deadlines with my own work -- so am only poking in when I get the chance). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One reason to keep them in the case is an episode when he was banned for a while - he surfed in under one of his sockpuppet IP addresses and did some editing; being able to point to pre-made notes saying "this is a sockpuppet" was a Good Thing.

I just ran a check on every revert triggered under the rule and they're all good, let me know if any other auto reverts seem suspicious.

<p>This is a big subject to capture in two sentences, but here goes. In <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tort.html" title="Tort">tort</a>, liability in <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negligence.html" title="Negligence">negligence</a> depends upon the court imputing a duty of care owed by one person to another simply by virtue of the activities they happen to be undertaking at the same time, e.g. both driving cars on the same stretch of road. This is completely different from a legislature imposing a duty of care upon a person by virtue of the office that that person holds. The latter duty is owed all the time the person holds the office. The former duty is only owed to those people who are foreseeably at risk during the time they undertake whatever activity it is. Hence, although the terminology is the same, they deal with completely different ideas and so a link in the See also is better. If I had left it embedded within the text, a person without any legal background might have been confused. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 11:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not worried about it. The ArbCom voted to block him on account of his editing activities, none of which were ridiculous enough to warrant an indef block on their own. Being a POV pusher and occasionally attacking others is not a reason for an indef block alone, of course. However his reaction to the ArbCom is definitely enough for an indef block, and he is not repentent in the slightest (see, i.e., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.22.98.146&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45371102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.22.98.146&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45371102" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).

<p>_ _ Our work together on LoPbN has, for me, been in satisfying contrast to the sporadic structure-related activity of <a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemanshu_2a0a.html" title="User:Hemanshu">User:Hemanshu</a> starting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHemanshu%2FArchive_1&amp;diff=2361114&amp;oldid=2201723#List-of-people-by-name_Structure" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHemanshu%2FArchive_1&amp;diff=2361114&amp;oldid=2201723#List-of-people-by-name_Structure" rel="nofollow">almost 2.5 years ago</a>. That archive might appear to have lost its context, but the context Hemanshu gave it is complete bcz they never responded to either me or (at least publicly) to <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">User:Angela</a>. (And if you'd to like to see the (long since repaired) context of broken-and-abandoned pages i referred to, i'll dig out URLs for them &amp; point out what happened.)<br />
_ _ (I hasten to mention that Hemanshu has been a prolific contributor of LoPbN <i>entries</i>, and i have no criticism of those edits.)<br />
_ _ Their most recent round of structure edits began with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Chf-Chq&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20060529191543&amp;limit=6&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Chf-Chq&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20060529191543&amp;limit=6&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">the recent history</a> of a bullet-heading-ed LoPbN page. Experience suggests that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060615034248&amp;limit=10&amp;target=Hemanshu" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060615034248&amp;limit=10&amp;target=Hemanshu" rel="nofollow">their most recent session</a> may be the beginning of a series of sweeps thru the structure, and ignorings of requests for discussion and civility, until active opposition to their aggressiveness are abandoned.<br />
_ _ I would be grateful if you would consider some kind of attempt to dissuade Hemanshu from this disruptive behavior. I think <i>two</i> editors sharing a concern in such situations can be much more influential than one alone.<br />

<p>Your right that it's not worth editing these pieces of text, and in fact they should be avoided, like quotes, template names, image names URLs etc.. The difficulty in doing this is one of the reasons that there are not more bot edits.

<p>Well, Special:Lonelypages only lists 1,000 pages at a time and I don't think that's going to change. So to get new articles to tag on the next refresh, I list them temporarilly on my user subpage... this technically de-orphans them, but realistically they are still orphans until actual articles link to them. It's kind of a crude method, but it works... eventually special:lonelypages should just list under 1,000 orphans at a time (less than 1,000 seem to be created per 3-4 day period, which is how often the page refreshes). If I can tag all articles orphaned in the last 3-4 days,the creators/recent editors will be more likely to see the tag and create links. If it's added 90 days later (which is common, given the state of the backlog) the creator will probably never see it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope that makes sense. My hope is to eventually move the list out of my userpage to the project space, and also to have the bot automatically remove the template (and thus, the listing) when any article has incoming links from other articles. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:34, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Er, if any have no incoming links from articles and are still tagged, feel free to remove the tag as they're not really orphaned anymore.

<p>Yes, you're right, but I am hoping (eventually) to make "orphan" the main template and "linkless" the redirect, two main reasons: people often think "linkless" means it has no links <i>in</i> the article, and the categories are called "orphaned articles".

<p>In all honesty, describing Scott Travis' drumming as 'crisp' and so on while dismissing Holland as someone with a 'simpler' style seems quite opinionated to me. The truth is that Holland's always been exactly what I put down originally, a groove-oriented player who aimed for the feel, never allowing the drum track to overshade the song itself. I would rather appreciate if you could find a better suited word instead of that bland 'simple' (and if you have ever heard Holland outside of The Priest, you would have known that actually, he could be, and quite often was, anything but simplistic...).</p>
<p>All in all, I can understand that we're viewing the situation from two totally different angles: me an old-school hard rock connoisseur, you most probably a contemporary metal aficionado. I could have very well pointed out that to my taste, Scottt Travis' rather mechanical drumming suffers from a serious lack of feeling and taste, but I somehow tried to stay true to the neutral POV. I wish you would at least keep the neutral POV policy of Wikipedia in mind while doing your subsequent edits on similar issues.</p>

All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>). Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, or, if you disagree with the notice, discuss the issues at its talk page.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm wondering why you deleted TheYack.com from Wikipedia. I went over the criteria for deletion, and it doesn't meet them. Yes, it's new, but it also has merit. It's the first social networking site on the Internet exclusively for everything literary. It has been covered by Publisher's Weekly, the book industry standard. And it is growing at a rate that compares with older sites. So I think it deserves inclusion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alpha1906 (<a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlpha1906_5016.html" title="User talk:Alpha1906">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alpha1906_7de4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alpha1906">contribs</a>) 18:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Show the references. Everything about Wikipedia is related to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If it's been covered by Publisher's Weekly, cite the issue number and page number, and say what Publishers Weekly has to say about it. Don't look at the criteria for deletion, look at the criteria for notability, in particular <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you can make an article that fulfils the criteria for notabilty, it will stay around. If not, not. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 19:20, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't have the database dump anymore; I deleted it because it uncompresses to 8GB. Did you want me to try to recreate Wikipedia:Links to (disambiguation) pages? <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 22:50, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought it might be easy for you - but I don't think there's a big hurry. If you can think about it the next time you pick up a dump on behalf of the dead-end pages, that's certainly early enough. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 22:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
