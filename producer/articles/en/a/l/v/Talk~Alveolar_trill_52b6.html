Listening to the attached wav, it sounds to me like a computer speaking the word "lamp-post"! Am I hearing right? Where does the word "lamp post" have any "r" or Alveolar Trill sound? <a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 15:14, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>After listening to it some more, I figured out that the computer might be actually saying "repulse". But the repeating of this word over and over without any waits interestingly lets you hear it differently... In any case, it would have been much better if the voice was human, speaking slowly, with obvious beginning and end and pauses before and after the speach. <a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 15:14, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It took me six years of middle- and high-school Spanish to learn how to make the sound, and then I still had trouble in certain environments. I don't know if that makes me especially well qualified, or completely unqualified to teach other people, but I'll give it a shot. Remember, this is what I think would work for <b>me</b>, but everyone learns a little differently. Maybe other people could add other approaches?</dd>

<dd>I was born in Italy, and people roll all their R's (not just some as in Spanish), but I've still been unable to pronounce a decent rolled R until a few years ago (I'm 22 - say until 4 or 5 years ago). Like you, I still can only pronunce it easily in certain situations; in others I have to make quite an efforts, and there are words where I can't fluently roll an R no matter how much effort.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and learning how to trill didn't eventually come as something natural... I had to train myself for it. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 17:02, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, first the flap. (There are different types of taps and flaps (if you read that article); you've probably noticed that the Spanish and English taps don't sound all that similar.) Place the tip of your tongue against the alveolar ridge (the place where the roof of your mouth bulges out a little, just above your gum line, before it slopes up to your palate)—or perhaps better, curl your tongue a little so that you touch with the underside of the tip. Now say <i>d</i>, but blow at the same time, so that your tongue flicks out from behind your teeth. (You don't blow when pronouncing a flap normally, of course, but this should give you a feeling for how your tongue should move.) Now try the same thing, but with a vowel like <i>ah</i> after (then before and after) the flap. Repeat, making the contact with your tongue and mouth gradually faster and gentler, and reducing your breath until you're not blowing at all, but your tongue is still flicking out from behind your teeth.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once you're comfortable with that, can say <i>a ra ra ra ra ra</i> with very gentle contact between tongue and mouth, and aren't blowing at all: now start blowing again, probably harder this time, and hold your tongue in position at the alveolar ridge but still <i>very gently</i>. It's a bit like playing a flute: blow too hard and nothing happens, too soft and nothing happens, wrong tension in your lips, and nothing happens. With a trill, you'll need to play around with how hard you blow, and how much tension you put in your tongue. When we get frustrated, we tend to put more force into things, but that's self defeating. You need to keep your tongue loose so it can vibrate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You only need it to vibrate twice! Most of the time, in most languages around the world, the tongue only makes 2 or 3 strikes when pronouncing a trill. Literally, one strike is a flap/tap, two is a trill.* That's all you need. But like holding a note with a flute for only a second at first, you can gradually extend it as you become comfortable with it, until you can trill as long as you have air in your lungs. (Actually, that's a good excercise: by trying to keep up the trill when you're running out of air, you learn to make it with less air flow, which will sound more natural. You only need lots of air when you're first learning how.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This of course will make an <i>apical</i> (tongue-tip) trill. There's another kind, which some of you may find easier. (Learn whichever is easier first, because it's not hard to switch over once you've got the basic idea down.) That's a <i>laminal</i> (tongue-blade) trill. Instead of curling the tongue up so that the tip (or underside of the tip) touches the alveolar ridge, lie it flat, so that the top surface of the tongue, in the very front, makes contact from the alveolar ridge to the back side of the teeth. For me, it helps if I pull my lips back, as if I were saying 'cheese' for the camera. This makes a slightly different sound (a little higher pitched, maybe?), but may be easier for some of you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For all of this, your jaw should be slack (or at least not tense). That's why I suggested using the vowel <i>ah</i>. Your jaw doesn't need to move at all. <i>a ra ra ra</i>, <i>a rra rra rra</i>, it should just be your tongue that moves. (It's okay if your jaw does move a <i>little</i>, especially if it helps, but I don't think you should try to make the flap or trill by <i>using</i> your jaw. If you find you have to move your jaw, try using the vowel <i>e</i> or <i>o</i> instead of <i>a</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once you can make a trill with <i>ah</i>, try it with other vowels. It's easier if all the vowels are the same: <i>e rre rre, i rri rri, o rro rro, u rru rru</i>. Don't try mixing them up until you feel you've got it down with all the vowels separately.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, for the longest time after I learned how to make a trill, and could get it between <i>most</i> vowel combinations (<i>i rra</i> is still a bit difficult), I couldn't say the name <i>Enrique</i> for the life of me. In the Mexican Spanish I'm used to, that ar is rolled. Maybe just twice, but it's not a simple flap. The trick I found was that there's a very very faint fricative between the en and the ar, at least in the native Spanish speaker I imitated, so that the name was almost <i>Enðrique</i>. Very brief, so it almost disappears (really an approximant rather than a true fricative), but just enough existence to separate the en and ar: [en.ðri.ke] (or perhaps [en.<sup>ð</sup>ri.ke]. For some of you, it might be easier to syllabify it differently, as [e.nri.ke], instead of using the eth (ð) (can you say <i>nr</i> at the beginning of a syllable or word?), but I imagine the little eth will help more of you.</dd>

<dd>*This is a simplification, and close enough for most purposes. But trills are very often also pronounced with a single contact. There are two differences between trills and taps: trills vary in the number of contacts, whereas taps do not; and taps are made as a contraction of the tongue, whereas trills are left to 'flap in the breeze', so to speak.</dd>

<dd>dont know if this will help anyone, but in order to produce a trilled sound with the tongue one needs a much greater amount of air flow (air pressure) than for any sound in American English varieties. so, this will feel very unusual for many people. futhermore, since the Spanish /r/ (which is what many want to produce) is a voiced sound, it is takes a little bit more air pressure from the lungs to produce and maintain a trill. compared to the uvular trill, the alveolar trill may be harder for many because the tongue has more mass than the uvula &amp; is thus harder to vibrate. so perhaps, one may keep in mind that it will seem like it takes much more effort to make an alveolar, but this is normal &amp; it will probably feel more &amp; more natural as you practice. happy languaging! – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 03:29, 2005 July 22 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's weird, though, I have more difficulty pronouncing a <i>voiceless</i> /r/ than a voiced one. Perhaps it's just 'cause I've trained myself to pronounce the voiced version only. The Spanish and the Italian /r/'s are, for all I can tell, the same (the flap technically isn't found in Italian, which uses a trill all the time, but in reality, every Italian speaker I'm aquainted with <i>uses</i> the flap in almost every single "r" situation, and the trill for "rr" only); I could listen to some sound files and tell "how right" the various trills sound, if anyone thinks this would be of any help. Note that I definitely <i>can</i> tell if an /r/ is pronounced correctly for Italian, even though I have problems pronouncing it myself.</dd>
<dd>At one point, I used to be able to pronounce an uvular but not an alveolar; now, though, while I can pronounce both, the alveolar one comes out easier than the uvular. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 16:53, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm learning Russian and all of the r's are trilled&#160;:( All of my friends can make the sound but I can't, only 2 weeks on though, so I hope!!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Russian has <b>two</b> trills, the apical-alveolar one and the palatalized one. I never had problems with the palatalized one: it's the automatic outcome when I put my tongue into the palatalized position and try to say "R" (which is, by default, the uvular trill for me). The alveolar one was much harder to learn, see below.</dd>

<p>Interesting. All this reminds me strongly of my experience of learning alveolar trills – even though I have a trill, the uvular one, in my mother tongue (German). For years, even the 4 years when I had Russian in school, I thought what turned out to be the apical alveolar trill was articulated <i>behind</i> my own (which I didn't know to be uvular; after all, the entire oral cavity and the air in it vibrates, and there isn't any other uvular sound in my kind of German). Outcome? Yet another uvular trill with a lot of added pharyngeal tension or something. Never sounded right. <i>Ô surprise.</i> Only last autumn (5 1/2 years after school...!) did I hear enough Spanish to find out that I had been pulling in the wrong direction. This came as quite a surprise to me; I used to believe I'm very good at imitating sounds from hearing, and I have successfully and quickly learned exotic phenomena like the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> <i>x</i> (hint: it is <b>not</b> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɕ]</span>, even though almost everyone transcribes it that way). As you can guess from my surname, I had been infrequently but regularly been exposed to the Serbocroatian apical-alveolar [f]-tinged trill for basically all of my life. (Sounds best with tightly clenched teeth!&#160;;-) )</p>
<p>Today I use a lot of tongue and jaw (!) muscles to keep the position and shape of my tongue for getting alveolar trills right. I can't explain most of this stuff, and most of it is definitely completely unnecessary, so I probably can't help any of you by giving written advice. I can only offer giving audio examples over Skype.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>BTW, something important needs to be worked into the article. There are (at least) two different alveolar trills, the apical one (Slavic languages, Spanish, apparently Arabic, Swiss German, arguably some Styrian dialect of German as well...; tongue straight) and the laminal one (Italian, Finnish, apparently lots of others; tongue arched so that the tip touches the lower teeth – if you try that one with a straight tongue, you won't be able to pronounce anything but [i] behind it!). They sound pretty different. I guess the entire continuum between these extremes occurs in different languages...</p>
<p>David Marjanović | david.marjanovic_at_gmx.at | 00:42 CET-summertime | 2006/4/2</p>
<dl>
<dd>David, are you sure about the laminals? It seems incredible that you could keep the tip of your tongue behind your bottom teeth, even if you started out that way. And I seem to remember that all coronal trills involve the tip of the tongue by necessity, even if they're not exactly apical. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 01:49, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry!!! In the laminal trill, the tip of the tongue touches the lower alveoli, not the lower teeth. Otherwise it would sound like a garbled <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[θ]</span>!</dd>
<dd>However, the tip of the tongue does not vibrate in the laminal trill and, I think, hardly in the apical one either (where it is behind the lower alveoli and doesn't touch them). The place where the business happens is the front or blade or something – the part opposite of the upper alveoli –, not the tip.</dd>
<dd>~:-|</dd>
<dd>Yeah, I think I'm right, and "apical trill" is a misnomer... but don't quite take my word for it.</dd>

<p><i>It is impossible for people who possess the recessive gene for tongue rolling to produce this sound.</i></p>
<p>I find this very hard to believe. There aren't whole swaths of speakers of languages with trills that simply can't make the trill.

<dd>I was wondering that, too. However, it's not true that there aren't "whole swaths of speakers" etc, at least depending on how you define a "whole swath". I'm an Italian who can't roll his R's (actually, I have somewhat learned by now, so it can't be a gene in any case), and I'm definitely not alone: "erre moscia", like this speech defect is familiarly called, is common enough in Italy that virtually nobody doesn't know what it is, or doesn't know anybody who has it. It's not dialect specific, although I think certain dialects of Italian do not (always) roll their R's, but that's not generally perceived as the same thing as having "erre moscia". I've read that some Spaniards also have this problem -- and from the wording of what I read, it seemed that it was common enough there, too. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 18:06, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like any difficult sound, such as English R, there will always be a certain number of native speakers who have difficulty producing the sound, but with <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_therapy.html" title="Speech therapy">speech therapy</a>, most can be trained to correctly pronounce the sound. I can't speak to the specifics of [r] in Italian, but I know that [r] is the last sound acquired by Spanish speakers, and thus the most common sound that speech therapists work on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An ordinary recessive gene will have approximately the same distribution among the populations of Spanish, Italian, and English speakers, but the number of English speakers who claim to be unable to produce [r] is much greater than the number of Spanish or Italian speakers. This also strongly points to the ability to produce [r] being learned and not genetic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the "recessive gene for tongue rolling" has to do with the ability to curl up the sides of the tongue to form a U shape. This ability has nothing to do with the ability to produce [r], which does not involve a U-shaped tongue.</dd>

<dd>Is there any evidence at all that the inability to produce [r] is genetic? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 18:38, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know. Hm, now, in my Italian R (that is, when I can pronounce it correctly, i.e. isolated or in simple words), the tongue is in about the same position and shape as with my English R. The English one can actually be further back in the mouth, depending on the time of the day (but I think the one further back in the mouth is the "correct" one).</dd>
<dd>So, in any case, I don't really see how a gene could impede me from pronouncing the Italian R without causing me problems with the English R too. Wikipedia says that a trill is produced by holding the tongue in place, and making it vibrate by means of the air stream, and not by muscles; I think this implies that no particular abilities are needed for producing a trill compared to an ordinary English R, except for some "experience" on how much air to exhale and how hard to press the tongue in order for the "trill trick" to work.</dd>
<dd>By the ways, it's news to me that many English speakers have difficulty with the English R: personally, I've always found it a blessing of the English language (one of the very few, with regard to pronunciation...), compared to the Italian R or even to other "easier" (for me) R's like the French and the German ones. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 19:29, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>While it might be appropriate to mention that [r] tends to be the last sound learned by children in Spanish, or that it is commonly a problem with speech defects (if we did something similar with [l] and lithps), I don't think that this 'gene' statement is justified.

<dd>I agree. I also agree that we should possibly mention the commonness of R-related speech defects. What I found strange after a (previous) search on the Web is that while in Italian we have a term that everyone knows for that kind of speech defect ("erre moscia", though of course it's not a technical term, quite the contrary), I couldn't find similar terms in Spanish or, say, Swedish -- which made me think this kind of defect was much more common in Italy than in other places where rolled R's are used. Really, this all puzzles me somewhat. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 22:38, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That may simply be accidental. In English we have a special word for [s] defects ("lisp"), but none for [l] -&gt; [w] or [r] -&gt; [w] defects, despite the fact that they're well known. For example, the [r] defect has been popularized by the cartoon character Elmer Fudd, who says "Be vewy vewy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits." He's been saying that since the 1930's, but there's no word for it. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:20, 2005 July 21 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Elmer Fudd /r/ impediment I've heard is described as a "whorl". The "joke" is that the name of a speech impediment is the one that cannot be pronounced by someone who has it: lisp (lithp), stutter (stu-stu-stut-ter), whorl (whowew). I've just asked a Colombian and he says there is a (fairly rude) word <i>gago</i> that means someone who produces a uvular trill instead of an alveolar trill for /r/ in Spanish. Having trouble verifying either of these with Google searches at the moment though. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 23:23, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After further practice trying to articulate a trill in the right spot, I seem to have produced both velar (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʀ̟/</span>) and palatal (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r̠/</span>) trills.

<dd>Well, the approximant ar is quite rare, and the trill quite common, so that would smack of Anglocentrism. If you can do a palatal, that may be close enough (do you mean retroflex? is it the tip of your tongue that vibrates?). As for the velar, that's been judged to be impossible for good reason: it's not thought that you can get the entire body of your tongue to vibrate. If you're really producing a velar trill, you should send a recording to Ladefoged! <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 18:44, 2005 July 30 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it's not retroflex at all, because the tip of my tongue is pointing straight. And when I look at the IPA consonant table, <s>it shows the "palatal trill" articulation to be judged impossible, but not the "velar trill."</s> When I make a conscious attempt at a velar trill, I can feel the body of my tongue vibrating against my soft palate. <span style="border: 2px solid #ba0000;">&#160;<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenelson83_2b5d.html" title="User:Denelson83">Denelson</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenelson83_28f5.html" title="User talk:Denelson83"><b>83</b></a>&#160;</span> 19:58, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm... I, too, think (!) I can produce a velar trill. There is a slight chance it's actually palatal; but it's definitely not palatalized, and I've taken a lot of care not to make it uvular (my default rhotic). It sounds quite ugly, however, and I don't expect it to occur in any language. (Needless to say I find it rather difficult, too.)</dd>

<p>Incidently, my phonetics professor (Leiden University) did tell us in class that some 4% of the population are unable to pronounce the [r] due to genetics, amongst which he himself, so there may be some truth to this. (He mentioned speakers of Spanish being discriminated against for this.) It may not be the tong rolling gene (if that even exists) that is responsible and it may be so that people affected may still learn to approximate the [r] through speach therapy, but thas does not preclude a gene being involved here. We need to find some research into this. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 16:14, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just found out that my valiant attempts at making an <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r]</span> are still resulting in <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʀ]</span>. Putting the tip of my tongue against my alveolar ridge and blowing still makes the back of my tongue vibrate against my uvula.</p>
<p>I talked to one of my college instructors, who is a native <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_language.html" title="Czech language">Czech</a> speaker, and she showed me visually how to make an alveolar trill. I observed her rapidly vibrating the tip of her tongue against her alveolar ridge. And then when I try to do that, I just get <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ\ɾ\ɾ\ɾ]</span>, which is not the same thing. She told me to try pronouncing <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[td]</span> as the first step towards making the elusive alveolar trill, but I don't think that will work for me.</p>

<p>I recently learned how to roll my Rs (and by recently I mean last week). I haven't got it down perfectly yet but I can pronounce it in most instances, which is amazing considering how I couldn't even begin to pronounce it before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nobody can tell you how to trill your Rs. It's a very serendipidous moment and I think it's that way for everybody. I'll give my advice, but it won't be bulletproof; every sure-fire way to learn R-rolling that I've ever followed has ended in failure. What I hate more than anything in the world is the advice to "just purr like a cat". If we could purr like cats, we wouldn't be asking how to do it, now would we? A close second is to say "pot of tea" over and over -- while that is useful later on, it's worthless advice in teaching how to do it.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to keep trying; the second, to be very, very patient.</p>
<p>The way it happened for me: first, forget any notion that the sound is an R. Don't try to make anything resembling an R while doing it or it will not work. Your tongue is going to be flopping around on your alveolar ridge; it's an alveolar consonant like any other and you should think of it as such. Now to begin, just play around with your mouth, lips, tongue... blow raspberries like you did when you were a kid, buzz your lips, vibrate your mouth area as much as you possibly can. Just pretend you're five years old again and making noises.</p>
<p>When you're vibrating your lips, stick your tongue around where they meet, not so much that it stops your lips from moving but just enough to catch the vibration (sort of like the positioning for a "th" sound). Your tongue will catch the lips' vibration and begin to vibrate. This is it -- this is the vibration that you want to reproduce. The R will feel an awful lot like this, and it's a lot easier to learn a letter when you know what it feels like.</p>
<p>Now imitate a motorcycle or whatnot -- something with a loud engine, or a machine gun -- and try to make that same kind of vibration in your tongue. With any luck it'll start flailing around wildly and you'll churn up air and spit everywhere. As long as your tongue is moving, that's good! Practice some more, but don't add voicing yet. Now try to contain it a little bit so you at least have the ability to trill your tongue against some mouth surface on command. The hard part is over; the difficulty is entirely in getting your tongue to "buzz" the way it has to, and it's pretty simple from that point.</p>
<p>Now try to contain your untamed trill a bit: say "pot of tea pot of tea pot of tea..." repeatedly, or some other magic phrase that's supposed to make you roll your Rs right then and there, and get a feel for where the tongue is landing. Trill your tongue again and aim it right there. If it's going up and down a lot, gently take some force off of it. There's a sweet spot in how much force to apply, and you'll know it when you feel it. Finally, add the voicing (this may take several attempts in itself) and you've got yourself a crude, but genuine, trilled R. Refine it by going through vocabulary lists in your target language and pronouncing all of them so you can iron the wrinkles out of your pronunciation and also learn how to say it in connection with other consonants and vowels (altough be warned that learning letter combinations can be almost as frustrating as learning the rolled R itself).</p>
<p>And there you go. That may or may not help you, again, but that's the way it happened for me and it all happened over the course of a day. If it doesn't work, keep at it. I tried several methods before I learned it and not one of them worked; I had to discover it on my own. From what I've read, most people do. It took me eight years of trying to do and I've often wondered if I was genetically cursed, but I think it's possible for anybody to do... it's just as hard for English speakers as "th" is for non-English speakers. I'd go so far as to call it the most difficult sound in all of the European languages, excepting R-hacek. Most people have an affinity for either the front trill (this R) or the back trill (the French R); the French R has always been second-nature for me but the alveolar R took years and years of work. I'm not sure why people are generally good at one trill or the other, or sometimes neither, but rarely both. It's interesting to wonder, but that's all based on a highly-unscientific observation, after all.</p>
<p>N.B. Knowing how to breathe is half the battle. It's hard to explain but it's the key to getting that wild flapping under control. You'll find it eventually, and once you tame it well you'll have pretty full control over your tongue. Being able to use it in combinations, though, is the hard part (R before or after non-dental stop consonants tends to trip me up). <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.238.164.118 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.238.164.118_862c.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.238.164.118">contribs</a>) 01:10, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>In most of my phonetic texts, the expression "rolled r" is used to refer to the uvular trill. "Trill" is used to generally to the alveolar trill. And "burring" is the standard English pronunciatioin for an initial "r". This treatment is fairly consistent all the way back to some texts written in 1900. The use of the expression "guttural r" to refer to the uvular trill is very rare, and somewhat ambiguous anyway, since the word "guttural" is just an antiquated synonym for "velar". It survives into modern English lay writing in the expression "guttural speech" used to describe languages such as Dutch or Swiss German which contain an inordinate portion of strongly pronounced velar fricatives and affricates. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.118.87.154 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.118.87.154_efe4.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.118.87.154">contribs</a>) 00:23, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>That's uvular. Swiss German has the voiceless uvular but no velar fricative; Dutch has both, depending on the dialect or something (like, <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch language</a> says &lt;g&gt; is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[γ]</span>, but I've heard Belgians pronounce it as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[χ]</span>.</dd>

<p>I've noticed the "rolled R" being used by Japanese TV characters who are a bit thuggish, and this page: <a href="http://www.jingai.com/yakuza/introduction.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jingai.com/yakuza/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> tends to support this. Am I right or is it a different sound? (I'm no linguist, so I couldn't tell an aveolar flap from a hole in the ground...) It would be ironic that a sound the French consider a form of verbal flourish would also be a sign of uncouthness in Japan! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave-ros_0552.html" title="User:Dave-ros">Dave-ros</a> 17:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, many speakers I've come across can do it, though many can't and will express their desire to be able to trill their ラ行 in anger. As far as I can tell it's the same sound; laminal and alveolar, and some speakers may pronounce it post-alveolar or pre-palatal, though I can't think why seeing how the flap in Japanese is alveolar. 218.229.72.163 11:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>From what I've heard of trills in Japanese, they sound like straightforward alveolar ones. According to my Japanese teacher who lived in Japan for quite a while, rolling one's "r"s was associated with members of the <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakuza.html" title="Yakuza">yakuza</a> almost as much as their trademark tattoos and missing pinkies.</dd>
