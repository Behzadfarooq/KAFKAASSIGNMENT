<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Karpis_394e.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Karpis was born to Lithuanian immigrants in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and was raised in <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topeka.html" title="Topeka">Topeka</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>. He started in crime at about age 10 running around with gamblers, bootleggers, and pimps. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> he was sentenced to 10 years at the State Industrial Reformatory in <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutchinson%2C_Kansas_e94a.html" title="Hutchinson, Kansas">Hutchinson</a>, Kansas, for an attempted burglary. He escaped and lived with his parents for a time in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. After moving to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, he was caught stealing a car and sent back to the Reformatory. Transferred to the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas, he met Fred Barker who was in prison for killing a policeman during a car theft {The report of Fred Barker in prision for killing a poiliceman may be folklore-according to FBI records Fred Barker was in Prision for bulgary}. Barker was one of the notorious members of the "Bloody Barkers" as the newspapers of the time had called them. The Barker family included the brothers Herman, Lloyd, Arthur or "Doc", and Fred, the sons of <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma_Barker_5296.html" title="Ma Barker">Ma Barker</a>. Growing up impoverished in a <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharecropping_system.html" title="Sharecropping system">sharecropping</a> family, all the boys soon turned into hardened criminals, robbing banks and killing without provocation. Doc, the leader, was sentenced to life imprisonment in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> after murdering a night watchman. Herman committed suicide in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> after being badly injured in a shootout with police following a robbery. Lloyd was sentenced to 25 years in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> for mail theft. Ma did her part to help her sons. In her lifetime she was never wanted for, nor charged with, any crime. Nevertheless, she badgered parole boards, wardens, and governors to the point where she won Fred's release in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, and even managed to get Doc released on a governor's pardon. After he was released in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, he joined up with Fred Barker in <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulsa.html" title="Tulsa">Tulsa</a>, <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma.html" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, and they soon put together the Karpis-Barker gang.</p>
<p><a name="Alliance_with_Barkers" id="Alliance_with_Barkers"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Karpis_394e.html" title="Edit section: Alliance with Barkers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alliance with Barkers</span></h2>
<p>The Karpis-Barker gang became one of the most formidable criminal gangs of the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. They did not hesitate to kill anyone who got in their way, even innocent bystanders. They robbed a number of banks, hijacked mail deliveries, and soon turned to the lucrative field of kidnapping. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> they kidnapped William Hamm, a millionaire <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota.html" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> brewer. His ransom netted them $100,000. Shortly after this, they abducted Minnesota banker Edward Bremer, Jr., whose ransom brought them $200,000. The group was led by Alvin, who had a <a href="../../../e/i/d/Eidetic_memory.html" title="Eidetic memory">photographic memory</a> and was described as "super-smart" by fellow gang member Fred Barker. The other leaders were Doc and Fred, both now out of prison, and included about 25 others. At this time a myth was started that Ma Barker ruled the gang with an iron fist, but the facts do not seem to support these claims. It is highly unlikely that criminals as adept as Karpis, and even Ma's sons for that matter, would have listened to her. Karpis later wrote about this subject in his memoirs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Ma was always somebody in our lives. Love didn't enter into it really. She was somebody we looked after and took with us when we moved city to city, hideout to hideout. It is no insult to Ma's memory that she just didn't have the know-how to direct us on a robbery. It would not have occurred to her to get involved in our business, and we always made it a point of only discussing our scores when Ma wasn't around. We'd leave her at home when were arranging a job, or we'd send her to a movie. Ma saw a lot of movies."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The kidnappings, however, would lead to the gang's end. The father of the kidnapped Edward Bremer Jr. was a friend of president <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. FDR had even mentioned the kidnapping in one of his <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireside_chats.html" title="Fireside chats">fireside chats</a>, and fueled also by the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindbergh_kidnapping.html" title="Lindbergh kidnapping">Lindbergh kidnapping</a>, the FBI and local police bureaus greatly stepped up their pursuit of those engaged in these type of crimes. The FBI had by this time organized a group of highly skilled agents called the "flying squads" who specialized in hunting down the leading public enemies, and much progress was being made. The year <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> alone saw the deaths of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dillinger_47d0.html" title="John Dillinger">John Dillinger</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_and_Clyde_3c21.html" title="Bonnie and Clyde">Bonnie and Clyde</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretty_Boy_Floyd_bd93.html" title="Pretty Boy Floyd">Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Face_Nelson_ab36.html" title="Baby Face Nelson">George "Baby Face" Nelson</a>.</p>
<p>With these big-name hoodlums out of the way, the FBI stepped up one of the most persistent manhunts of the time for the Karpis-Barker gangmembers. One incident that aided the FBI greatly was when the gang shot and killed one of their own members, George "Shotgun" Ziegler. Ziegler had been one of the masterminds of the Bremer kidnapping, but after he collected the ransom money, which he kept most of, he began loudly bragging to underworld associates that he was the genius behind the kidnapping. It appeared the one-time hitman for Al Capone, and a lead suspect in the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Valentine%27s_Day_Massacre_0dc4.html" title="St. Valentine's Day Massacre">St. Valentine's Day Massacre</a>, had lost his senses, and the gang knew it couldn't risk having him spill valuable information. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, members of the gang shot four slugs into Ziegler as he was coming out of his favorite restaurant in Cicero, Illinois, which nearly decapitated him. The assassins left the corpse, however, and subsequently FBI agents found names, aliases, addresses and other valuable information on the gang in Ziegler's pockets. Armed with this information the FBI used it to pick them off one by one, and soon they began getting the big names. Doc was captured on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melvin_Purvis_d376.html" title="Melvin Purvis">Melvin Purvis</a> who, nearly six months earlier, had hunted down John Dillinger. (Sent to Alcatraz, Doc was shot and killed by guards during an attempted escape in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>.) Just one week later agents tracked down Ma and Fred at a cottage in Lake Weir, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">January 16</a>, Ma and Fred were shot to death after a 4-hour gun battle.</p>
<p>Just after Ma and Fred's death, Karpis nearly met his own violent end when the FBI located him in Atlantic City, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Karpis and a couple of other partners managed to shoot their way to an escape, though Karpis's eight-month-pregnant girlfriend Dolores Delaney was shot in the thigh by police. He continued his crimes with others, but had to be on the move more than ever as he was the fourth and last Public Enemy Number 1 left (the previous three having been killed). He did manage to pull off a crime that echoed times of the "Old West", a train robbery in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrettsville.html" title="Garrettsville">Garrettsville</a>, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, which netted $27,000. After the death of Ma and Fred, Karpis sent word to J. Edgar Hoover that he intended to kill Hoover the way Hoover had killed Ma and Fred.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Karpis_394e.html" title="Edit section: Pursuit and capture by FBI">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pursuit and capture by FBI</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> had come a long way since its reorganization and renaming in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> (from the Bureau of Investigation, created in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>). J. Edgar Hoover was appointed as the acting head of the Bureau in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> and completely transformed the agency. Despite its successes, however, the agency had many problems. In those days, when the application of science and technology to fight crime was still in its infancy, the agency was at the mercy of public citizens for information. Often agents were sent off to remote locales that turned out to be <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herrings</a> due to bad information. The personal nadir for Hoover came at an April, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate.html" title="Senate">Senate</a> hearing. <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> Senator Kenneth D. McKellar lambasted Hoover for the performance of the FBI and the fact that Hoover himself had never personally arrested anyone. After the hearing a determined Hoover vowed he would capture Karpis personally.</p>
<p>Hoover would not have to wait long. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, the FBI located Karpis in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, and Hoover flew in to be in charge of the arrest. As a dozen or so agents swarmed over Karpis's car, Hoover announced to Karpis that he was under arrest. A couple of versions of the arrest are reported. One, told by Karpis in his memoirs, was that Hoover came out only after all the other agents had him seized. Only then did the agents call to Hoover that it was safe to approach the car. The official FBI version, however, states that Hoover reached into the car and grabbed Karpis before he could reach a rifle in the back seat. In fact the car, a <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_automobile.html" title="Plymouth automobile">Plymouth</a> coupe, had no back seat. The whole fiasco was further aggravated when Hoover told his men to "put the handcuffs on him". Not one agent had brought handcuffs and Karpis was tied up with the necktie removed from an agent's neck. Whatever the real story, the capture of Karpis catapulted Hoover's name into the public eye, and that name would be synonymous with law enforcement until his <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> death.</p>
<p>The capture of Karpis essentially ended the age of the big-name depression-era criminals. In addition to those mentioned earlier, others killed violently in the '30s were <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Diamond_5420.html" title="Jack Diamond">Jack "Legs" Diamond</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Dog_Coll_fc5f.html" title="Mad Dog Coll">Vincent "Maddog" Coll</a>, Frank "Jelly" Nash, and <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Schultz_727d.html" title="Dutch Schultz">Dutch Schultz</a>, and while as an inmate of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcatraz.html" title="Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capone_36a3.html" title="Al Capone">Al Capone</a> was slowly going insane from <a href="../../../s/y/p/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a>. The country had gradually started to recover from the Great Depression and economic times had improved, and law enforcement agencies had improved as well.</p>

<p>Sentenced to life imprisonment, Karpis was incarcerated at the recently formed Alcatraz federal penitentiary from August <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> to April <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>. For six months in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> he had been transferred to the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leavenworth.html" title="Leavenworth">Leavenworth</a> federal penitentiary, but was then returned to Alcatraz. His main job at Alcatraz was working at the bakery. He was far from a model prisoner, frequently fighting with other inmates. In April <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, with Alcatraz in the process of being closed, he was transferred to McNeil Island Penitentiary in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a> state. While at McNeil he met a young inmate named <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a>. It is interesting what Karpis wrote about Manson in his memoirs "On the Rock: Twenty-five Years at Alcatraz" (written with Robert Livesey, published in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>):</p>

<p>After Manson had actually become somewhat proficient on the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>, he asked Karpis for help in getting a job playing in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> as Karpis had contacts with nightclub and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino.html" title="Casino">casino</a> owners there.

Manson was moved to a <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> facility in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, which proved to be one of the most ominous <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> transfers ever. Later Karpis added "The history of crime in the United States might have been considerably altered if 'Little Charlie' had been given the opportunity to find fame and fortune in the music industry. He later became the infamous Charles Manson."</p>

During his first book tour across Canada for <i>Public Enemy Number One</i> for MacClelland and Stewart (published in the United States as <i>The Alvin Karpis Story</i>), Karpis, looking more like an accountant than a gangster, still showed a wry sense of humour. In Edmonton, Alberta, while shuffling Karpis between various interviews with the media, M&amp;S book rep, Ruth Bertelsen made a stop at her bank. Asking Karpis if he wanted to come in with her, Karpis replied "No dear, you take care of the vault, I'll drive." He became a mentor to her young son until the obvious sociopathy of some of his advice to her child caused Ms. Bertelsen to break off their relationship.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

Some closer to the scene say <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foul_play.html" title="Foul play">foul play</a> may have been involved. Robert Livesey, who co-wrote Karpis's <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> book, said Karpis was not the type to have committed suicide. Livesey said Karpis was a survivor, having served 33 years in prison, and also stated Karpis was anticipating the publication of the book. Livesey believed Karpis had been introduced to pills and alcohol by his last girlfriend Nancy, to give a relaxing high, and perhaps Karpis accidentally over-indulged on one occasion, with fatal consequences. No <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopsy.html" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a> was done, and Karpis was buried the next day in Spain.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
