<p>Dear Nik,</p>
<p>Sorry if I hurt you in my previous message. Let me explain.</p>
<p>You were constantly editing to proselytize your thoughts. See, the majority here in Wikipedia hates such attittude. It doesnt matter whether it is a guy from tvm or from ekm (<b>infact many members who are reverting your edits are not from the either cities</b> - even me; <b>or may be from your city itself</b>).</p>
<p><b>For the editions, we normally arrive at a consensus through discussions, and will go by logical conclusions</b>. Here the majority feels that you are doing <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> in the pages.</p>
<p>You can see that irrespective of the places they belong, many users are reverting your editions. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeepujoseph_8e53.html" title="User talk:Deepujoseph">Deepu</a>, who is a constant editor in the <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi.html" title="Kochi">Kochi</a>/<a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> related articles, hails from Kochi. But he goes by logical conclusions and is ready to accept facts without any prejuidice.</p>
<p>Hope you understand me. Infact, <b>here in wikipedia, for the countries/states/districts/cities related articles, all are forced to follow the technical statitics which is officially published by the concerned governments.</b></p>
<p><b>Whether or not they are derived with vested political interests</b>, an encyclopedia reflects that.</p>
<p>I also agrees that there are more skyscrapers in Kochi than in Tvm. But, we have to follow the official declarations. Please visit the <a href="http://www..corporationofcochin.org|official" class="external text" title="http://www..corporationofcochin.org|official" rel="nofollow">city site of Kochi</a>.</p>
<p>You can enter your details about Greater Cochin in the wikipedia articles viz. <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Agglomeration_of_Kochi_70b8.html" title="Urban Agglomeration of Kochi">Urban Agglomeration of Kochi</a> or <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi_Urban_Agglomeration_9904.html" title="Kochi Urban Agglomeration">Kochi Urban Agglomeration</a> or <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi_UA_c70e.html" title="Kochi UA">Kochi UA</a>. Infact, all these links redirects to a common page&#160;: <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi_UA_c70e.html" title="Kochi UA">Kochi UA</a> .</p>
<p>HAPPY EDITING in those pages. Hope you will corporate.</p>
<p>And last but not to be the least; The development of Kochi is not at all dependent upon Wikipedia or your editions. Kochi is a booming economy and you can definitely contribute to that by many means. Wikipedia, or your previous stage Skyscrapercity, cannot block that.</p>
<p>So please refrain from vandalising the pages.</p>

<p>Dear Nik,</p>
<pre>
 You have boycotted Skyscrapercity since the administrators did not allow you for your hate campain. Now you are doing it here.
 Just tell me one thing. As you know I am working here in Kochi. How can a city with length from Palarivattom to Thevara and breadth from Marine drive to Vytila is larger than a city with length from Sreekaryam to Thiruvallom and breadth from Airport to Vattiyoorkavu?
</pre>
<p>Also consider the population and wards based on population. Do not try to fool the people. You may be correct that appartment buildings(skyscrappers) are more in Kochi, this is because of the lack of space due to huge water body. In terms of other infrastructure like roads, huge R&amp; D educational campuses and IT, Kochi is nowhere in comparison with Trivandrum. Kochi has advtantages in many other ways.Look at the first green airport,vallarpadom,LNG terminal etc. Understand those facts. Stop this hate campain--<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> 03:35, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Samalek</p>
<p>You have not mentioned a single instance of my misquoting a fact. I do not agree, like most of the world, if you say that Kochi is the second largest city. It does not matter which city you belong. What matters to me is that <b>you are wrong</b>. I have mentioned this in a talk elsewhere. If you are deciding a city by the boundaries set by politicians, then you will see that they keep changing regularly. This is due to an odious practice by our politicians called <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrymander.html" title="Gerrymander">gerrymander</a>. So I and 99% of this world, including 99% of Trivandrumites (of course, people like the above "lal" do not belong to this sane majority) go by the word of census authorities, which is the correct technical definition of a city. I treat your opinions with full respect they deserve. For example, CPM kept on expanding Trivandrum corporation because it suited it to win elections, while Congress tried to scuttle it. Both Congress and CPM stalled expansion of Kochi corporation as both were worried over their prospects in elections after expansion.</p>
<p>Final word on this is that technical definition is the one that matters, as proved by <a href="../../../j/n/n/JNNURM_058e.html" title="JNNURM">JNNURM</a>. <b>Kochi was the</b> only city from Kerala to be chosen under <a href="../../../j/n/n/JNNURM_058e.html" title="JNNURM">JNNURM</a> as a million plus city <b>, while</b> Tvp'm managed get in only becoz it was capital.</p>

<p>Hi AlNiko,</p>
<p>Please sign up when you make remarks. Or else, i will find it difficult to reach back to you. Here, Kochi refers to the city corporation of Cochi .See the fact box. The city mayor's name, population, density, etc are entered there. That means the page <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi.html" title="Kochi">Kochi</a> is refers to the city corporation of Kochi.</p>
<p>I too agree with some of your arguments. But, since the page is about the corporation, please stop the repeated edits.</p>
<p>There is another page about the Greater Cochin (Vishala Kochi). You can find the page here&#160;: <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi_UA_c70e.html" title="Kochi UA">Kochi UA</a>.</p>
<p>Post the new projects, and related stuff there. You can expand that page.</p>

<p>Hello Alniko. I thought I'd clarify the reasons for my revision of the Kochi article. The article is written based on the guidelines set by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Indian_cities_3cb2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Indian cities">Indian cities Wikiproject</a>, and we have to follow it strictly in order to get the article to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article__91fe.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article?">featured status</a>. The article has to be dressed up in <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">summary style</a>. When doing that, only the most relevant things should be written on this page. All excess information should be moved to the respective sub pages like <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Kochi_3330.html" title="Economy of Kochi">Economy of Kochi</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Kochi_048f.html" title="Geography of Kochi">Geography of Kochi</a>, where it can be elaborated. Hence, the list of companies in Kochi are to be given in the Economy of Kochi article under the <i>Information Technology</i> section. Another thing to keep in mind is that everything should be written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral way</a>. We need to follow all these policies on wikipedia.<br />
I'd really appreciate it if you could list out the problems with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kochi_%28India%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66811647" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kochi_%28India%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66811647" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the article that is bothering you. We can discuss it out, and then later decide. Please do not keep <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">reverting</a> the article. Looking forward to your reply. -- <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepujoseph_dfb3.html" title="User:Deepujoseph">thunderboltz</a><sup>a.k.a.D<font color="green">e</font>epu<font color="white">&#160;</font>Joseph&#160;|<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeepujoseph_8e53.html" title="User talk:Deepujoseph"><font color="green">TALK</font></a></sup>05:09, 1 August 2006 (UTC)~</p>

<p>Its OK. Even I am not fully accustomed to the rules and guidelines of Wiki yet. It will become digestable as you proceed.<br />
Btw, the Kochi Economy page is here&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Kochi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Kochi" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. You can expand it as it still lacks many info (for eg; the Retail section). You should include only the most relevent points, otherwise, it will appear as an ad.board.<br />
Include the links to all the information you are inputting. For eg; if you are including a sentence like, "Infopark is the largest tech park in Asia"; you have to provide the links (official links are more desireable), which confirms that. For any disputed information, discuss in the talk page, and reach in a consensus.<br />
Deepu is really trying very hard to get the article on Kochi featured in Wikipedia (there are already two featured articles related to Kerala&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_pepper.html" title="Black pepper">Black pepper</a>). For getting it featured, we have to comply to the guidlines. It would be better if you can go through those<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Nik, If you are trying to say that a park with constructed area of just 4.5 lakh sqft(0.45 million) is the biggest in Asia and crying that people are not allowing you to put that information, imagine what people will think about you</p>
<pre>
 Let me ask one interesting question. Then it should be the park with highest revenue or exports. But why it is a mere 65 cores? It is the smallest I have worked in India.
</pre>
<p>Please try to be realistic. Please look at the mirror before blaming others.</p>
<p>Also be very specific and tell me what is beyond east of bypass in Kochi? What is there in the south beyond Marad(8 km from the city center). Towards the North east Kakkanadu(just 10 km from the city center) is like a remote village and is included in the population. Towards the north at least up to Kalamassery I agree that it is urbanized. You have to consider that all these areas are included in Kochi population, even though they are less populated compared to Trivandrum suburbs.</p>
<p>But in Trivandrum, Technopark is very populated area and is extended till Attingal(around 36 kms towards north). Tell me, in the stretch (City-Sreekaryam-Kazhakkutom-Technopark-Kaniyapuram-Pallippuram(20 KM) stretch) which area is not populated? Currenty beyond sreekaryam is not included in the TVM population.Similarly south of Trivandrum(Karmana-Balaramapuram-Neyyattinkara-Parassala) is very crowded till the border(around 40 Kms) and East extends up to Vattiyoorkavu and West up to airport. If the politicians do real justice, Trivandrum will be many times larger than Kochi. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> 04:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<i>If you are trying to say that a park with constructed area of just 4.5 lakh sqft(0.45 million) is the biggest in Asia and crying that people are not allowing you to put that information, imagine what people will think about you</i> &lt;&lt; I hate replying to such jerks. But just to give a sample read the <i>italicised</i> statement quoted above. I dont know how he dared to insert his dumb ideas into my mouth.</p>
<p>Despite being such, what he mentions "makes sense". Trivandrum city is a very <b>crowded</b> area with population density <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/1/3/c1399cf0392e78376b70104374313fef.png" alt="\frac{745,000}{194} = 3850" /> per sqkm. And thats just the 194 sqkm city corporation. Outwards you move, it wears thinner. Take 632 sqkm icluding Kochi corporation. It has more than 2.5 million population (see Greater Cochin page). That makes population density <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/7/2/57228ab9dfa137f3c5df6b7e938f0131.png" alt="\frac{2500000}{632} = 3955" />. Corporation area has population density <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/2/9/c297b301dbced111e811716ca5db45c9.png" alt="\frac{650000}{94} = 6914" />per sqkm. Just take 194 sqkm including Kochi corporation it has more than 1.2 million population. Now which is crowded or dense&#160;? Kochi or Trivandrum&#160;? Why is Kochi's boundary smaller than Trivandrum&#160;?</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, I am sure the above lal's head is dense - in fact thick - nothing goes in&#160;! Poor thing is still in the evolution, may have reached anthropoid state at best&#160;!</p>

<p>Alniko, please stop your personal attacks. Thiruvananthapuram subburbs are more populated than Kochi. And also Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi are not 1 million cities. That is why they are getting only 80 % of the funds. If you are still not convinced I can cite the relavant articles here. But Trivandrum city is more populated, Subburbs are more populated and even the district is more populated. Please check any official data. Also you did not answer my specific questions.</p>

<p>Alniko, your intentions are clearly visible. You do not have any thing specific.You just wanted to create problems and chaos in Thiruvananthapuram page, because you are jealous of the city and that turned into hatred. (due to same you are running hate blogs against TVM). I could not stop my laugh at your figures put above. Chenkal slum in TVM has population dencity 25000p/sqm). So can I say that TVM population is 25000*194? Your cochin population math is similar like this.Kochi is too small.If you go to Marad or Kumbalam(10 km from the city) population dencity is less than 500. Places like Kizhakkambalam,brahmapuram etc are yet to see human life(they are not far from city).So please do not bluf the people with your own math. In TVM, infrastructure,roads,palaces,sprawling campuses together forms more than the area of Kochi city.People in TVM, work in those sprawling campuses and go to subburbs for their stay. Even if one wishes, he/she can not construct a home at those working places, since they are public properties.That is why city is expanding several kilometers to subburbs.</p>
<p>With more than 80%of IT exports happening from the city,it is growing at much realistic rate than hype. So I can understand your hate.</p>

<p>Dear Alniko,</p>
<p>The page of Kochi is about the Kochi city corporation. Not about the <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi_UA_c70e.html" title="Kochi UA">Kochi Urban Agglomeration</a>. Please see the article about <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi_UA_c70e.html" title="Kochi UA">Kochi UA</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest city doesnt mean that it should have the largest density of population. Biggest city is dependent upon AREA and POPULATION.</p>
<p>See the below image. This shows what all villages and muncipalities are added to the Kochi Urban Agglomeration. Obviously the places listed below is not in the city of Kochi. Even Chalakkudi and Kodungallur (which is not in Ernakulam district), is included in the Urban Agglomeration of Kochi.</p>
<p>If you dont know about that, please see the PRD site of the government of kerala&#160;: <a href="http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/home.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/home.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Hope you will corporate with all. These things are already well discussed, and even brought to the notice of the Admins. And now, the things are well settled.</p>
<p><b>Every body is adhering to the neutral point of fact.</b></p>
<p>Now, <b>you are creating an edit war here. It will not help in stabilizing the articles.</b> All other editors feel that you are creating editwars in the pages.</p>
<p><b>See, you have received so many warnings from several users</b> including <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaleks_7ba9.html" title="User:Samaleks">Samaleks</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepujoseph_dfb3.html" title="User:Deepujoseph">Deepujoseph</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a>, etc.</p>
<p>So, it is very clear that the point of view that you are projecting is not acceptable by others. The projection you are making is about the density, which will not count in ranking the biggest city.</p>
<p>When you are making blind reverts, just to include some of your biased points, you are reverting several other constructive changes too..., which have been made after your editions. We are then forced to correct all that again (including the spelling mistakes and other addition of information).</p>
<p>So please stay back from the blind edit wars, which will make you acceptable among the fellow editors.</p>

<p>Alniko, please do not bluff the people with your own math. If you are talking about city population, compare only city population. And also the discussion is only about city popuation.If you are adding near by towns to one city do the same with other. According to your math you should compare TVM+Neyyattinkara+Nedumangadu+Kazakootam+Sreekaryam. That is much more than Kochi UA.</p>
<p>But any way who cares. We have official data. Gov data and all relaible data, then why should one care on fatasies of individuals -- <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESathyalal_2b33.html" title="User talk:Sathyalal">Talk to Sathya</a> 13:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I fail to understand the reason fro not responding to even polite messages while you are over-active on few select pages. You may respond here. In case, you do not reply, it may be construed that you do not have anything to say, and roll over the block for a further period shall be in order, depending on the type of edits which you may do after the block expires. I would suggest you to please concentrate on some other pages - wikipedia is so big now that each one, including me, have many options to volunteer our contributions here, unless one has specific reasons, negative or positive, to remain associated with only few pages.
