''''''''''<b><i>Topic 1: Black Studies: Racism</i></b> Contemporary need for identifying the genre Afro-American stems from the world experience of Africans' subjugation and identity crises. All around the world including in the US individuals from African descents have been going through radical transformations. For some, the experience has been about extricating themselves from the diasporic subjugation connected with their ancestral migration (through slavery). Issues like bearing with identity terms such as "negro", "black" and "nigger" not only make them feel derogatory but highly negative towards the "whites" as well. For others, the need for recognition is as much important in contemporary society as they feel that despite their large population in various countries of the world, they still lack origin and history to associate with their identity. Consequently, the Africans have become an invisible group of indigenous people with no real individuality. They blame this lack of identity and conceptualization of the African society to racism. Racism has been dominant centuries ago and still continues to be a problem in today's institutionalized society. In the US for example institutional racism is most common which have set back the Afro-American's progress in terms of political, social, economical and national development. For these reasons Afro-Americans continue to feel inferior to the whites despite their progress in the world equal to the whites. To resolve racism is a difficult task but not impossible. Experts suggest (Alkalimat 24) institutionalization of black studies to develop African ideology and consciousness before its people can come to terms with their past and identity.</p>

Topic 2: Kwame Nkrumah Kwame Nkrumah was one of the notable leaders who made the pursuit for African independence a reality. Nkrumah was born in Nkroful, Gold Coast of Ghana. He earned a Masters of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1942. He began his early career as an African advocate in the US and Canada but it was later when he was in Manchester, England organizing a Pan-African Congress, that he really began work on decolonization of Africa. In 1947 he became the General Secretary of the United Gold Coast Convention. It was under this post that Nkrumah gained fame as anti-colonialist when he was suspected and arrested for a rioted incident under the British rule. After his arrest, Nkrumah went on a formal tour of the countryside in Ghana to spread the message of self governance. He organized a political party called The Convention People's Party, and through it caused a series of protests against the British government. Seeing Nkrumah gaining strength, the British government drafted a New Constitution to diffuse the political turmoil within the Gold Coast. Nkrumah on the other hand organized his own People's Assembly to drive against the government and proposed an independent rule. This proposal was rejected which led to a series of movements known as Positive Action organized by Nkrumah. He was arrested for creating riots but eventually he won the election which the British government organized before its departure from the Gold Coast. He became the new government in 1952. Nkrumah was Ghana's ideological leader who not only carried out the movement for independence to its conclusion but continued to struggle for its upkeep. Under his government Nkrumah organized a formal ruling institution, attempted to create unity among the four territories of the Gold Coast, and pursued complete political independence for Ghana. He was a staunch believer of non-aligned Marxism for which reason he was considered an anti-capitalist. His political career declined abruptly with his ascension as some of his policies clashed with the interests of the opposition parties. Eventually he was ousted, remained in exile in Conakry, Guinea and died in 1972.</p>

Topic 3: Amistad The slave trade was an institution which has had great impact on the history and civilization of African Americans. It was a period in time in which "man's inhumanity to man" reached its peak (Alkalimat 51). The practice of slavery emerged from capitalism and the triad trade agreements between the British, Spaniards and the Portuguese. The destination was the New World whereby the slaves were brought to work on cotton farms. It was not so much as the practice of bringing labor to the farmlands but the institution itself which was degrading and highly uncivilized. One example was the passage of the Amistad, a Spanish schooner that was destined to transport slaves to the New World. The slaves were kidnapped African natives which a Portuguese merchant bought from a Spaniard on the Guinea Coast of West Africa. At the time Britain, Spain and Portugal made a pact to prohibit trade among themselves. When the Amistad set sail for the New World the Africans rebelled and killed the captain. Ruiz and Montes who were the original merchants who bought the slaves were ordered to transport them back to Africa. The pilot instead, transported them to Long Island, NY. There the US government seized the ship, merchants and slaves, and brought them to trial. Ruiz and Montes declared the Africans murderous rebels whereas the Africans led by Singbe-Pieh protested that they were free citizens in their own country. Eventually the US declared the Africans illegally enslaved citizens and had the right to freedom.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 4: Cotton King - Eli Whitney and Nat Turner The slavery institution was held by a system of plantation owners who were backed by the industrialists in the North and powers in England. It was through these "mechanisms" that cotton plantation owners successfully attained dominant power and the ability to influence the economy and political organizations in the US which instilled the slave trade. However, eventually slavery was weakened by a series of anti-mechanisms which included invention of cotton machinery and revolts from the slaves. Eli Whitney perhaps was the most notable in the history of cotton machinery. He invented the cotton ginning machine which reduced the need for labor and eventually the decline of the slave demand. Later on social turmoil like industrial slavery, runaway slaves, and race mixing gave rise to revolts. Slaves collectively revolted against their owners in the beginning of the 19th century. Among these rebels, Nat Turner had a major role in turning the movement into significant crusade for the slaves. In 1831 he began a crusade under the Christian religion to liberate the slaves. He first killed his master, and then recruited more slaves to kill whites within the area. This soon led to a military confrontation between the blacks and whites. Eventually Turner and his troops were ousted by soldiers brought in to the countryside by the plantation owners. The soldiers started to slaughter slaves which marked the beginning of the divide between Africans and the whites not only on land but at sea as well. Some scholars considered this period a revolutionary period.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 5: Underground railroad, Abolitionism, Civil War In a society where oppression became too stifling, the oppressed were bound to resist and rebel. In the early 19th century the slaves in the South rebelled against the whites and persuaded the North to help them to abolish slavery. The Colonization Society which was formed by free blacks became the platform for abolition and the beginning of a Civil War. The free blacks at the time undermined the white society by adopting strategies to aid slave fugitives to freedom and to concentrate on political action. The basic premise had been to boycott against the whites where they are most efficient - socially, economically and politically. For this purpose, the Underground Railroad was organized to free slaves and helped them to become mobilize to other places. Aiding the free black fugitives and other slaves was easy as it entailed helping to free the slaves and sending them to the North or Canada. On the political front the Colonization Society pursued through publication and campaigns against the barbarous whites' treatment of the blacks. As a result the North took to legally freeing the slaves from Southern plantation owners. This abolitionism movement became seriously detrimental to the South which adopted strict measures to become vigilant of runaways and free blacks. However, they could not stop the movement against whites which eventually led to the Civil War, and complete abolition of the slavery institution in the United States.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 6: Sharecropper, Blues, lynching in the United States After the Civil War plantation owners no longer had slaves. They had to hire blacks for working on their plantations and pay them in cash rent or sharecropping. The black farm workers worked while the landowners shared their land with the workers by providing them with tools and seeds. In this manner the black and white shared their harvest. Although this form of sharecropping institutionalized blacks' freedom nevertheless the white farmers were not satisfied with sharing their crops as they became poorer and could not afford the black workers. The blacks on the other hand were able to secure living place in the form of cabins on the farm, resulting in diasporic settlement patterns. It was during these eras that the free slaves found time to explore their antebellum roots. They started to construct churches, roads to connect with other settlers and formed community with united families. However, this brief period of reconstruction was marred by the emerging trend of lynching. Lynching became the affirmative action which the whites took against the blacks for causing them destruction and poverty. It was the pervasive threat that was designed to create terror among the blacks so that they would not rise socially. Most of the lynchings were public events which were used to create social dominance. In retrospect the blacks reconciled with their social stigma and status within the white society by resorting to blues music. The majority of the blues were the creation of free blacks who wanted to rebel and give voice to their protest against the social injustice they have had to suffer since the time of the slave trade to the butchery they witnessed in lynching.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 7: Harlem, Madame C J Walker, Bronzeville Throughout the history of black people they have fought against the whites for their rights to be free. Yet at every turn they have been down treaded and degraded so that they would always rebel and resist against the society which struggle hard to oppress them. The Harlem Renaissance period was one such period in which the black people struggled against the white to make them recognize them as separate groups with specific art, literature, music and culture. It emerged from the 1930s, a period which was considered to be a recovery from the Great Depression for both the whites and black. The blacks took this period more seriously as they were protesting against the injustices done to them during other periods in American history. It was during this period that the new generation of blacks took to the challenge of creating a separate identity for the Africans from the whites in terms of political, social and economical progress. One such progressive story was the rise of Madam C. J. Walker. Walker was born a free individual but raised on farms in Mississippi. She was orphaned at the age of seven. By the time she was fourteen she was married and widowed at the age of twenty. From then on she struggled to work to bring up her daughter. She became a prominent figure in the Harlem age as she created an empire for herself through the selling of hair tonics. She founded the company C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company and became the first black woman tycoon to have entered the field of business. What has made her prominent in the history of black civilization was not her entrepreneurial achievements but her support for the educational, social and economical institutions for the blacks.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 8: Jazz, Duke Ellington, Bessie Smith, Black Arts Movement The culture of a nation is a reflection of its development. It is the basis for nationality and identity. Although African culture has its roots in Africa, European colonialism has been prominent in altering its patterns which is why African American culture today is a reflection of both Western and Eastern cultures. The altered culture has emerged during the 20th century with Emancipation whereby the blacks adopted Christianity, and gradually used it as the basis for extricating themselves from the oppression of the whites. Field slaves began to sing folk songs in retrospect of their ancestors' and their own experiences. It was during this period that urban slaves evolved to develop jazz, a form of music that relied on the oral tradition of the Africans. Folk tales were narrated in jazz music to depict the lives and tribulations of the slaves. Among the notable jazz musicians was Duke Ellington. Ellington was a significant contributor to jazz music as he excelled in this genre beyond the expectations of his fellow Africans and the whites. Similarly, Bessie Smith also contributed to the blues history as she was the most popular blues singer during the early years of the 20th century. She has become an influential jazz figure for contemporary blues musicians. It had also been during this period in time that the blacks also broadened their artistic base by identifying with their art forms such as blacksmiths, artisans, and basket makers etc. as well as Western art culture like literature, fine arts and music.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 9: Brown v Board of Education The primary purpose of education in any society is to develop its work force and people economically and socially. However, African American education development, which took years to evolve to its current status, has its roots on the premise that education is the tool for training skilled labor to support the capitalist system, and to indoctrinate ideas, beliefs and values of the existing socioeconomic order (Alkalimat 227). This can be exemplified by the landmark case of Brown v Board of Education. Earlier in Plessy v Ferguson, the State through the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment established that public schools should be separate but provide equal opportunities and facilities to black students. However, in 1952 in Brown v Board of Education the plaintiff argued that separate but equal did not really serve the purpose as black public schools did not offer the same opportunities for the blacks as do white public schools for the whites. Hence, the concept separate did not mean equal. In this landmark case, the judge decided that the Fourteenth Amendment should be re-interpreted as it was not conclusive that separate necessarily means equal opportunities for education for the blacks. This case formed the basis for future cases for the African Americans as it was based on this platform that African Americans gained their right to equal opportunities in education and development in other walks of life.</p>
<p><br />
Topic 10: Martin Luther King, Civil rights movement Throughout the history of black freedom struggle, each period has formed the basis for social rights for progression. During the Civil War for example the blacks struggled for human rights; during Emancipation it was a struggle for civil rights; and during the Harlem Renaissance it was the struggle for social rights. However, each of these "rights" movement was focused on social rights. The new generation of blacks during the later part of the 20th century was no longer interested in social rights. Instead they rationalize that their struggle for social rights is concentrated in their political status through which they would be able to gain equal rights in the whites’ society. This conceptualization was explored by many individuals including Martin Luther King. King was a civil rights leader who helped the blacks to achieve their political power. It was through his struggle that the blacks recognized the importance of political power and hegemony. He inspired the black nation through his message to the masses to struggle against oppression in a non-violent manner. He believed that the blacks should use tactics like sit-ins, marches to gain the attention of the political leaders. By gaining the attention of national leaders, they would be able to voice their concerns about their rights within the white American society. Although he was shot prematurely in his campaign for the blacks, his ideology formed the basis for the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
