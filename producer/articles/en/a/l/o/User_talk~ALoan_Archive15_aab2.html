<p>Hi ALoan. Some time ago, you were kind enough to prompt for this article to be a DYK. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">User:Budgiekiller</a> and I are now working to promote the article to GA status. This is a first for both of us and I'd appreciate it if you gave us guidance (I'm not looking for you to do all the work, just keep an eye and be the generally useful chap you normally are). Also, please take a look at my talk page, where Tintin has raised concerns about the article name. I think it would be a great shame if we need to change it to something more mundane, so I've posted at the <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECRIC_f681.html" title="WP:CRIC">WP:CRIC</a> talk page asking for help.

<p>I have enough trouble trying not to step on your toes with the written one! <i><a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Times_of_the_Day_7c07.html" title="Four Times of the Day">Four Times of the Day</a></i> is on my list, and I was considering adding <i><a href="../../../b/e/f/Before_and_After_9370.html" title="Before and After">Before and After</a></i> as that is a great set. I don't want to get in a Hogarth rut though, so I won't come back to them for a while. I don't know why I moved <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Four_Stages_of_Cruelty_ad06.html" title="The Four Stages of Cruelty">The Four Stages of Cruelty</a></i> away from <i>The</i>...one of those things when you get a mistake fixed in your mind as the right title - I'll move it back. Hogarth's own book which is available on Google Books is very complete with commentries from both him and others - it gives alternatives for the figure of John Gourlay in <i>Harlot</i> (whom I saw was on your list) - John Gover, or Anthony Henley. Help yourself from my list (I haven't got much on any of those you picked out, apart from Torrey scale which needs a lot of work to pull out an article from all the technical bunk). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 15:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Even though you're a meatpuppet trying to build a false consensus, I will address you as well. The sheer magnitude of the commentator's notability over the cricketeer's notability means that it is more convenient overall for everyone to have the commentator own the primary article "Bill O'Reilly". The practice of giving one person who is much more notable than everyone else ownership to the article name is common in every other situation. I guess you also believe that <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_%28disambiguation%29_1d55.html" title="George Washington (disambiguation)">George Washington (disambiguation)</a>? <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFistful_of_Questions_61e7.html" title="User:Fistful of Questions">Fistful of Questions</a> 15:37, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gosh! As far as I am aware, that is the first time I have been called a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meatpuppet</a>. Our definition of "meatpuppet" (see <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet_%28Internet%29_d717.html#Meatpuppet" title="Sockpuppet (Internet)">Sockpuppet (Internet)#Meatpuppet</a>) is</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"a new Internet community member account, created by another person at the request of a user solely for the purposes of influencing the community on a given issue or issues acting essentially as a puppet of the first user without having independent views and actual or potential contributions".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While not the oldest account on the block, you might observe that I have been around for some time. I even participated in the previous discussion about disambiguation and redirects on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_8a75.html" title="Talk:Bill O'Reilly">Talk:Bill O'Reilly</a>, well before your recent intervention. So please lay off the personal attacks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rather than asserting that everyone who disagrees with you is somehow "false", it would be more productive if you could please demonstrate consensus for your proposed changes. It should be relatively easy to do so, if you are right to say that the "sheer magnitude" of the commentator's notability makes him "infinitely more notable" than the cricketer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For what it is worth, I am not sure that "more notable" is the relevant test here: notability is relevant to whether a topic is encyclopedic (and thus eligible to have a Wikipedia article) or not (and thus liable to be deleted). In this case, both are clearly notable. The question is whether one is clearly the "primary topic" (as it is called in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>). Many people outside the US have not heard of the commentator, but have heard of the cricketer; in the US, I understand that the position is the opposite way around. On that basis, neither person is the "primary topic", so a disambiguation page is the right result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your question may just be rhetorical, but I would say that the first US president is clearly the primary topic for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, so I would not quibble there. But what about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury.html" title="Mercury">Mercury</a> - would you agree that both are pretty clear cases for disambiguation on the main page? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 16:09, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to spam you like this but I want to thanks for all your support. I'm planning to say little more on the subject unless I'm attacked again. I have proved my point about the IRC admin channel, and many people (whose opinion matters to me) now seem to believe all I have ben saying was true. The channel is now thoroughly discredited and will never be a source of power again, and used by anyone of Wikipedian value - it is now basically finished - no one will ever believe a word that emanates from it again, no doubt a few little firecrackers will continue to pop on admins notice boards and such places but I think people can now evaluate such comments for themselves and see them for what they are dying embers of a former power base. Once again thanks for your support in this. I have appreciated it. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 10:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>ALoan... Hi, I noticed that you put up a pic of the first Suribachi flagraising. I added some names to the ones you had. Here is an interesting site I think you should see. This guy has some pretty good proof that some of the men in the picture are not who they were identified as. I'll let you look at it and perhaps we can decide if we should edit the article (Louis Charlo was not there) and the pic's caption. This site has a slightly wider version of the picture that perhaps should be put on the page in the place of the one there now. Let me know at my talk page what you think.</p>

<p>Thanks for expanding the article. Just one thing that I would query: <i>He was a very large man by any standard, bearing comparison with <a href="../../../w/g/_/WG_Grace_4252.html" title="WG Grace">WG Grace</a>.</i> This suggests that they were of comparable size, but I suspect that Mynn was considerably the heavier. I don't know how much Grace weighed at his heaviest, but I'd guess it was in the region of 250 pounds. How about saying "even larger than <a href="../../../w/g/_/WG_Grace_4252.html" title="WG Grace">WG Grace</a>"? (In my initial draft, I put in a comparison of Mynn with Botham but - as you might have gussed - BlackJack soon whipped that out.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 18:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No problem - the article just caught my eye. I interpreted "very large" not just as a reference to physical size, but also to impact on the game. I added the comparison because Mynn dominated cricket in the mid-1800s like Grace did later. Both were also tall and heavy (admittedly Mynn was taller and heavier than Grace). The wording could be made more explicit.</dd>

<dd>Yes - the nominated text was ok, although it is better to pick one strong fact, or two connected ones; but the underlying article just seemed a little on the short side, to me, bulked out with the infobox and mammoth navigation template. Shrug. The article probably meets the technical length requirements, although the requirements in general seem to be getting tighter over time as the number and quality of nominations steadily increases.

<p>Dear ALoan - you'll remember me as the creator of this. RJASE1 has nominated it as a Good Article and put it up for peer review. He also placed it on the Military History Project in Start Class (on their assessment scale) and then raised it to Class B.</p>
<p>That's all well and good. However Looper 5920 has reversed the second move and attacked what he perceives as a UK bias in the article. I worry that the article will lose its character and original focus.

<dd>Well, to get well over 1,000 characters, you should aim for a lead plus at least three nice paragraphs. Well-sourced and referenced, of course, and well-illustrated, if possible.

<p>Hi. I wonder if you'd consider re-rating the article for <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECRIC_f681.html" title="WP:CRIC">WP:CRIC</a>? Rambling Man gave it his initial view, but a) I think he'll happily admit to not being a cricket expert b) the article is much improved since then and c) it would be somewhat immodest for him to give it a super rating, having contributed so much to it&#160;:-) Cheers --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 10:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the note on my talk page, ALoan; sorry for the late reply. I was determined to get through the old FAC archives and finish the articlehistory conversion work Gimmetrow and I started—but, not to be; I called it quits when I finished 2006. Seems I was interrupted a gazillion times today while I was up to my eyeballs in archives and templates, and that chore stretched my focus. Anyway, no, I've never thought of you as a "poker" at all; besides, you've always been involved at FAC and FAR. In matters such as these, I care much less about who started what or who did what or said what to whom, and much more about who Just Stops It. I simply fail to grasp the value in obsessing over ASCII characters. You were a stopper—that's A Good Thing&#160;:-) Regards, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 04:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of us <i>used</i> to be involved at FAC every single day, until it became "have you fulfilled form 3b subhash 9 for footnote citational format? have you had someone else copy edit? we must reject without reading until our requirements are met." Once indefatiguable-because-incurious people took up residence, trying to substitute blind templates for sense and education, we decided that what they were interested in was their own power, not quality. Well footnoted <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half_Life_2_3fba.html" title="Half Life 2">Half Life 2</a> was an FA with the following in the lead, "it was released to near unanimous praise." That <i>glares.</i> Reading is time consuming, but it's important. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I hear you, Geogre, I hear you. The fad for fiddly footnotes actually makes it easier to pass FAC, in some senses, as many reviewers check for form rather than content. So long as you get past the footnote people, you just have to avoid the attention of the prose people. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Some interesting speculation on Geogre's page; partly explains why I don't usually engage, as people generally have a tendency to form their own ideas regardless of the truth.</p>
<p>Anyway, I saw your mention of the "copyright" issue there. I'm here to offer my help, since my writing on multiple articles has been lifted by for-profit websites, giving no credit or mention to Wikipedia. Wiki has a page for reporting this type of violation, standardized form letters that can be sent, and its usual inability to really do anything about it—it's up to us as volunteers to do all the letter writing and followup, of course. If you're interested, I'll have to go back in history to dig up the pieces and places. I gave up, and decided it went with the territory, since I don't have time to deal with it. Considering that the articles I wrote were lifted for blatant profit motives, and are still live on the 'net, I wouldn't hold out much hope that anything will be done when it's a newspaper, which is arguably at least "educational". On the other hand, it may make you feel better to write the letters; perhaps the newspaper doesn't know it has a plagiarizing writer on staff. Let me know if you want me to dig into history to find all the pieces and places.

<dd>I'm afraid Sandy is quite wrong. Once she chose to "engage" she lost the right to "disengage" at whim. She may declare herself to be uninvolved or whatever, but having chosen to pass her opinion she must now take the replies whether she likes them or not. She does not have the priviledge of declaring what is, or is not the truth. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 22:58, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Giano - I have said several times that I think Sandy could have handled it better. None of us gets to declare what is or is not the truth, although we all have opinions. I think we all have the right to disenage, whenever we want to. One of the behaviours that makes this process work is knowning when to give up and compromise. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 23:48, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's one of these. (But I once committed the faux-pas of giving a Christmas card to a Jehovah's Witness, so if this falls into that category, please crumple discreetly behind one's back.)</p>
<p>By the way, I notice you are into new-article stubs, etc., so what do you think about one on John (Jack) Hall? I came across him when looking into <i>A Just View of the British Stage</i>. Jenny Uglow says, "Hogarth showed Booth dangling a little figure down a hole—a puppet of John Hall, the 'Chimney Sweeper', hanged in 1707 and famous for escaping from Newgate by squeezing into the sewers through the privies". If that's not notable, I don't know what is. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 09:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll just butt in uninvited...he's on my "unwritten list" but info is a little thin on the ground (not in the Newgate Calendar as far as I can see, and the Old Bailey have probably misrecorded his name). Somebody produced the <i>Memoirs of the Right Villainous John Hall</i> just after he was hanged, so there should be at least a melodramatic account of his deeds floating around. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 10:40, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Would you believe adding the death of John was on my list to-do but forgot all about it. I'm currnetly making some ammendments (hopefully improvements) to the article.</p>
<p>Thanks for converting all those curly apostrophes - that looked exhausting.</p>
<p>Anyway I'll get back to you at/by the weekend and you can assess the changes. However, I fear it will be impossible to please everyone with this article. As you know the subject matter is just too BIG - maybe too big to do him justice in an encyclopedia article - but I thought it worth the attempt.</p>
<p>Others will decide if i pull it off - although the article seams to have attracted little attention. Oh well. Thanks for your help anyway. Talk to you soon. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_Palmer_73bf.html" title="User:Raymond Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a> 16:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh dear - sorry, my mistake. I thought the original wording was a little loose and was trying to tighten it up a little. I looked through for the last date when its location was known (clearly everyone knew where it was in 1918!) and saw the mention of the Soviet invasion in 1940. I did not read carefully enough to see that there were two copies, and one disappeared before 1940. If I have spotted that, I would have amended it to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>...that the two original copies of the <b><a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Independence_of_Lithuania_9451.html" title="Act of Independence of Lithuania">Act of Independence of Lithuania</a></b> (<i>pictured</i>), signed on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">February 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, have not been seen since the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> invaded <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> in 1940?</li>

<dd>I like the constructive use of evidence in the towpath murder case! The Curtis article in the Independent caused me problems as it is half-fiction half-report, so in the end I left it out.

<dd><i>In one special case, however, Britain may be said to have had a female heir apparent: although the spouses William and Mary, once installed by the Glorious Revolution of 1688, were considered to rule as joint monarchs, it was Mary who had the true hereditary claim. Thus, although after her death William continued to reign, he had no power to beget heirs; any children sired by a subsequent marriage would not have been heir apparent. (They would have been rather high up in the succession, however, since William himself was Mary's cousin.) Thus Mary's younger sister Anne, who had been heir presumptive during Mary's life, became heir apparent upon her death during the remainder of William's reign, eventually succeeding him as Queen Anne.</i></dd>

<dd>Yes, that's true, if William had died first and Mary remarried and had children Anne would not have been heir apparent. I was shortcutting the first bit to get to the fact that William's heirs came directly after Anne's heirs by the declaration regardless of their position in the "default" succession, and hence while your assertion about Anne is correct, the bit in brackets from the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">Heir apparent</a> article above is incorrect (they aren't high up in the succession because they are cousins, they are high up because Parliament said so). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take it back -- you were right. Only the heirs of Mary would outrank Anne, not the heirs of William and some other woman. I found a paragraph about it in <i>Queen Anne</i> by Edward Gregg, p.68-69, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0300090242</a>. So, I guess in the legislated succession of the Glorious Revolution, a women could be heiress apparent. <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoemgenus_b232.html" title="User:Coemgenus">Coemgenus</a> 16:46, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The "Early and personal life" piece is rather brief - parents? siblings? Did he play school or club cricket? The "caught sub" thing would be nice to include, if we can find a reference. A brief mention of the 3rd and 4th Tests in Australia in 2007 would be good, as it currently leaps from the 2nd to the 5th. And I would swap the World Cup infoboxes for categories - did he actually play in 2003?

<p>There seems to have been a monstrous edit conflict when you edited the article, much of which you've now fixed. However, there's still some outstanding. I'd do it myself, but I don't want to create another conflict... are you still on it? Also, some specific issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't understand the template comment, but assume TRMan does.</li>
<li>I'll work on the personal life. Tintin found some useful snippets.</li>
<li>I disagree with the need for the sub catches issue. As my edit summary said, with lots of official uns, wickets and catches in the bag, he's no <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Pratt_4a68.html" title="Gary Pratt">Gary Pratt</a>, so there's no real need to go searching for a cite on a minor accomplishment. Happy to be convinced otherwise...</li>
<li>Agreed re Tests</li>
<li>World Cup boxes have been applied to all of those players by another editor, who seemed reluctant to make them consistent (2003 is captain, vice captain, alpha order. 2007 is by "batting order" apparently)</li>

<p>I had little problems following the instructions although someone partly informing the authors threw me off. I think that if it is done, you should inform all of them and not jump to editing something else first. Unfortunately, the computer I'm using at the moment is terribly slow, so popups weren't much help. But I see how the whole process improved. Now I'll go and see about preparing the next update. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Could you do the next update? Unless we get another update in today, the item about the saint, a pretty good article too, will expire which would be a shame. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>My problem was mainly getting used to the changed method since I last did it. The method itself posed no problems. I do wonder if images still need protection as the DYK template states since we now have cascading protection.

<p>Hi ALoan, can you check your recent cricket related DYK nomination - it says 88, and I think you mean 80. Can you clarify this on the page?

<dd>Thanks! Obituaries in the "quality" newspapers are like gold-dust as a source, IMHO (I have direct links to the obit sections of the four UK ones on my user page so I can check them frequently). I wish some of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_9928.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography</a> people would use them to write up more biographical articles, rather than spending so much time tagging articles. Shrug. At least I get to read (and write) about interesting people. Unfortunately, having them all chosen at once meant that I missed seeing them all on the Main Page. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 21:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And the Theatres Act has no references. Tsk Tsk. I've been wasting a lot of time recently trying to find out whether the Jack Hall escape through the privy actually happened: it seems it might have been a bit of wit by Hogarth directed at the state of the London Stage that got taken up as fact, but if true it is too good to write the article without including it (it appears that the Jack Hall in the Newgate calendar is <i>that</i> Jack Hall, and I even found a reference to him as a "cut-price <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sheppard_e53e.html" title="Jack Sheppard">Jack Sheppard</a>"). Does Uglow have any more detail on him (if you still have it)? <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 13:12, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Folklore</i> article remains temptingly out of reach. I did track down a mention that Hogarth portrayed him disappearing down the privy as a comment on the tastes of the London theatre-goers rather than because he had genuinely escaped that way, but I seem to have mislaid it. Unfortunately the Ordinary's reports from the Old Bailey for his hanging, which normally give all the juicy details, aren't online. His moment of fame as an escape artist and wide boy seems to have be eclipsed by the exploits of Jack Sheppard, so there is rather less info on him than I would have hoped. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 16:25, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
