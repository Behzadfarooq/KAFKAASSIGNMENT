<p>Hi, ALoan. I would be grateful if you would take a look at this, which may be a blast from the past! anything you can add to this to make it a richer article?

<p>Would you be able to vote on this now? I have addressed all your concerns, and currently, it will fail due to lack of votes. Thanks --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 09:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm probably breaking a load of guidelines and rules.. no idea how it really works.. this is overwhelming! Hi, my name's Major Tom and I wrote a few bits and pieces on the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windscale_fire.html" title="Windscale fire">Windscale fire</a> and a couple of other articles about nuclear physics.

<p>Thank you for closing the Sarajevo FAR. Most of the people who usually close reviews were involved in the article so we couldn't close it. For future reference the FARpassed template has two additional parameters that can be added. These are the date and version of id of when the review ended. I went ahead and added those to the template at the Sarajevo talk page so it now looks like this&#160;: {{FARpassed|oldid=67201015|date=August 2, 2006}}.

<dd>Right-ho - thanks - I had to go looking for the templates anyway. It would help to add some notes for an admin who might like to do the closing.

Despite being told by two users already (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan_239f.html" title="User:Metropolitan">User:Metropolitan</a> and I) that the sentence is perfectly fine and should stay in the introduction, he has repeatedly deleted the sentence for the same mindless literalism that you have already witnessed at List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris.

<p>I have spotted a problem in the article's footnote numbering.. it's off in the <i>Dürer's woodcut</i> section. For this reason, and this reason alone, I'm witholding support. I'd change it myself if I understood that ref system -- I only know &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

<dd>I've dropped my objection, but in the <i>Dürer's woodcut</i> section, it reads something like [6], [12], [12] -- they're non-sequential, and this is a bit jaring, policy violation or no. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik"><font color="black">Zantastik</font></a> <a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZantastik_58c9.html" title="User talk:Zantastik"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 18:32, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I owe people an explanation of my odd behaviour yesterday.</p>
<p>I went on a short wikibreak a couple of weeks ago. On my return, I quickly noticed that the atmosphere seemed to have changed. I will struggle to point out exactly what was different, but there seemed to be a marked decrease in tolerance and civility. Perhaps I have been breathing the toxic fumes in <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> too much since I got back; and the bad-tempered cross-fire from the Carnildo RFA can't have helped.</p>
<p>An added ingredient yesterday was the re-promotion of <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">User:Carnildo</a>. I had checked the RFA several times, and assumed it would fail; in my mind, that was the right result, due to the demonstrable lack of consensus. (I am fully aware of the arguments for and against his re-promotion; I seldom vote on RFAs, and had little intention of throwing my cup full of petrol on that bonfire.) But now I am no longer sure I know what consensus is, nor that I can trust the ArbCom and the bureaucrats to do the "right" thing.</p>
<p>More or less successfully, I have tried to steer clear of wikipolitics and wikilawyering for the last 9 months or so, and to concentrate on writing articles instead, and I have been a much happier editor as a result. But I can't ignore that it now seems to be a blockable offence to fully and frankly (but civilly) exchange views, or to disagree with certain admins, particularly if that disagreement is expressed in forceful (but civil) terms, and that the rules seem to change when it suits the people making the rules.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough morose rambling. I am very grateful for the concern and appreciation that some have demonstrated. The lure of the encyclopedia that anyone can edit will probably draw me back - there are still redlinks to fill, and featured articles to be written. At the end of the day, this is a project in intellectual self-gratification, and I'm not sure how much fun it will be to contribute to a project like it seems to be becoming. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, you noticed a mention of an article, did you?&#160;:) Imagine - and there I was thinking that this was a social rules-making experiment. Anyway, all being well, it will be revealed in its glory to an adoring public later this week. It should not be too hard to work out, if you are so minded, but it is only about ⅓ done now, so please don't go looking for it! If I can find the time, between wikifiddling, I will be about ⅔ there later tonight. It has some lovely images, btw (not up to Dürer's class, but I like them). -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 17:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having thought about it further, I have become more convinced that <a href="../../../b/u/l/WP%7EBULL_d507.html" title="WP:BULL">WP:BULL</a> and its <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_One_Featured_Article_d874.html" title="User:Mailer diablo/One Featured Article">1FA</a> antecedents have something to say for themselves.</p>
<p>Of course it is important that someone deals with the administrative tasks, and defends the wiki from trolls and vandals, but much of that can be done without admin-<i>potestas</i>. Other than the abilities to block/unblock, protect/unprotect, and delete/undelete, and the shiny rollback button, there is little magic about admin status, and that is why it should be "no big deal". I have often said that RFA criteria are too strict (<i>x edits in y months</i>; <i>not enough edits in foo-space</i>), and that essentially any regular editor in good standing ought to be an admin. Many hands make light work. But I do insist that an admin should have a proper understanding of the spirit of Wikipedia: I don't want admins to be just soldier ants or policy wonks, or i-dotters and t-crossers. They should be writers and editors of whole articles too.</p>
<p>Our primary purpose is the writing of encyclopedia articles, and admins should understand and care about how the Wikipedia writing process works. You can't get a more concrete example of that than the featured article. To get an article to featured standard, you have to do research, write well, resolve disputes, follow policies and guidelines, and interact with the talk page and in Wikipedia space. Not least, the process of writing a featured article often ends up creating a cascade of new content in other articles, either daughter sub-pages or new redlinks filled.</p>
<p>I want admins to be rounded people, with experience of writing substantial parts of whole articles, not just fiddling at the margins. Yes, copyediting and technical tweaks are essential to improve our articles - many hands, many eyes - but contributing substantial portions of prose to a featured article brings an understanding of the vagaries and frustrations of being a contributor. We are all human, with our own ideas and opinions and feelings. Sometimes we feel strongly about issues, and we should not hold back from expressing our opinions, short of personal attacks or incivility. We should all have respect for each other, and that means having respect for people who disagree with us.</p>
<p>I don't see the criterion that admins must have subsatantially contributed to a featured article each year as being unduly restrictive; quite the opposite: it is a simple, clear, bright-line test that anyone could pass with a bit of work. But it should not be the only test: it is really a proxy for the underlying skills necessary to make this thing work, of understanding, compromise, and adherence to the wiki spirit.</p>
<p>I just want I want to get people out of the mode that says "I am an administrator. I am right. Shut the fuck up and do as I say or I will block you."

<dd>Hang on. How can Tony Sidaway have never encountered Giano until a couple of days ago and yet say that Giano had been complaining for months and complained so often that it's a "truism" that the complaints are wrong (without any refutation)?

<dd>I think his actions and words speak for themselves, rather loudly in fact. Noticeable (again) is his failure to engage with the issues raised, but rather dismiss them by reference to irrelevancies. You have mentioned the autistic side of Wikipedia before.

<p>Hi ALoan. I have been following the events of the past few days regarding Giano et al. and must say these are indeed dark days for the wiki. If there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to ask me.</p>
<p>Anyway, the original purpose of this message was to inform you that I will be away on holiday for most of next week. I just wanted to ask if you could please keep a closer eye on WP:FLC during that time. I would not ask you this under normal circumstances, however Renata3 is threatening to leave and you seem to be flirting with the idea still, and I think it is important to avoid the risk of FLC staling for too long.</p>

<p>Thanks for stepping in ALoan. Apparently <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">User:Grcampbell</a> (aka Bob) has decided to solve the case unilaterally, which of course goes against mediation. Unfortunately he also did the same yesterday, and I don't know if you have noticed it. He edited the <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_D%C3%A9fense_eda4.html" title="La Défense">La Défense</a> article as well as 18 skyscraper articles (such as <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_Total_75fe.html" title="Tour Total">Tour Total</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_Areva_78da.html" title="Tour Areva">Tour Areva</a>, etc.). His edit consisted, among other things, in changing the wording "La Défense located west of the city proper" into "La Défense located west of Paris". By doing so he's basically assuming that Paris means only the City of Paris, which is of course the opinion of some of the people who are at mediation, but not the opinion of other people (such as you or me) who are also taking part in the mediation process. By doing that he basically decided to ignore mediation and decide things unilaterally. I tried to explain to him at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Talk%7ETour_AXA_d680.html" title="Talk:Tour AXA">Talk:Tour AXA</a> that there was a problem in the wording ("west of Paris" can mean <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> or <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreux.html" title="Dreux">Dreux</a>, but it's a bit confusing for a place like La Défense which is right in the heart of the Paris urban area). I tried to explain that "west of the city proper" is a more accurate language, but all I got as an answer was claims that it was bad grammar (yeah right), or nasty accusations such as "This is why so much of France doesn't like the Parisien attitude. Everything is in Paris, even that which is not." Check on the talk page. I reverted his changes, because we should wait for the end of mediation and not make changes related to mediation in the meantime, but he reverted me right away, and even accused me of being a vandal (!): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_D%C3%A9fense&amp;diff=76688991&amp;oldid=76688502" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_D%C3%A9fense&amp;diff=76688991&amp;oldid=76688502" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. This looks to me as a very anti-civil (or should I say anti-social?) behavior. What can we do? These articles should be reverted to how they stood at the start of mediation. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 22:45, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ALoan, <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">User:Grcampbell</a> has again reverted the <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_D%C3%A9fense_eda4.html" title="La Défense">La Défense</a> article as well as about 20 skyscraper articles to push his vision that the name "Paris" can only be used for the City of Paris, completely ignoring the mediation going on.

I notified the mediator (<a href="../../../g/o/f/User%7EGofG_9903.html" title="User:GofG">User:GofG</a>), but he seems to be on vacation or something and doesn't answer his messages anymore. Grcampbell (aka Bob) first framed the wording "located west of the city proper" as "redundancy" and "grammar 101" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_D%C3%A9fense&amp;diff=76690105&amp;oldid=76689752" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_D%C3%A9fense&amp;diff=76690105&amp;oldid=76689752" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>).

I also contacted Andrew Norman and Trödel (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html#Paris_skyscrapers_.28sequel.29" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">User talk:Andrew Norman#Paris skyscrapers (sequel)</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html#Paris_skyscrapers_.28sequel.29" title="User talk:Trödel">User talk:Trödel#Paris skyscrapers (sequel)</a>), perhaps you remember them, but they haven't responded so far.

<p>Well, I think it is extremely unhelpful for articles which relate to the mediation to be edited in a manner which one or other side to the mediation supports but the other does not, even if not they are not the subject matter of the mediation per se. As it happens, I prefer the "west of the city proper" formulation to "west of Paris", because the former makes clear that La Défense is part of the continuous urbanisation of Paris, while also clarifying its relationship to the City of Paris, but I am sure another form of words could be found to express this point elegantly rather than just ignoring it completely. Perhaps these pages should be added to the mediation.</p>
<p>I have to say, given the entrenched positions of the parties, not to mention the disappointing standard of conversation (in terms of civility and avoiding personal attacks), I doubt whether the mediation will succeed, but we should let it run its natural course. The next stop is presumably some sort of <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, please, both of you, stop cluttering up my talk page on these issues. That is what the mediation page is for. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 14:48, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know you've followed <a href="../../../d/y/k/WT%7EDYK_84c9.html" title="WT:DYK">WT:DYK</a> a lot more than I have, ALoan. Over in IRC, as part of the notion that it is time for Wikipedia to focus a bit more on improvement of existing stuff and a bit less on growth, the suggestion came up that DYK be reworked to feature recently-improved articles rather than new articles. (Although I suppose it could include both, since new articles are by definition improved, right?) Is this a perennial suggestion? It feels like it would be. Either way, I'm wondering about your thoughts on this idea and also if in your opinion this it could have a chance of getting implemented. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:23, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That would not be such a complete overhaul - substantial expansions of existing articles (i.e. stubs that get turned into proper articles) are already eligible for <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a>, on the basis that it would be unfair for a useless stub to gazump an essentially new article. DYK has operated that way for some months - many of my recent DYK entries existed as one- or two-line articles before I expanded them substantially (mostly, recently, very short biographies that I have expanded using obituary notices). There is recent discussion on the point in <a href="../../../d/y/k/WT%7EDYK_84c9.html" title="WT:DYK">WT:DYK</a>, where some contributors were complaining that some DYK entries were not all entirely new articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There has been a relatively recent move (last few months) to insist that DYK entries are properly referenced, which is definitely a step in the right direction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you are suggesting a new DYK criterion: for example, any article can become a DYK if it is expanded by <i>x</i> bytes, or <i>y</i> hundred words, or <i>z</i>-percent? I wonder what you would choose as <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> or <i>z</i>? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:14, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It wouldn't even be about expansion any more -- a long article that was an unreferenced POV mess that got turned into a tight, referenced, encyclopedic piece should be eligible. I recognize the problem: how *do* we define the crtieria for inclusion? Unlike FAC, we don't have time at DYK to have full-blown discussions about every entry. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:20, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I see what you mean. You are right: it would be very difficult to set appropriate criteria for eligibility, and rather difficult to judge candidates too. DYK is a relatively peaceful corner of Wikipedia at the moment, and I can see this causing all sorts of potential problems. However, I think it is worth floating as an idea on <a href="../../../d/y/k/WT%7EDYK_84c9.html" title="WT:DYK">WT:DYK</a> though. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 15:37, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be better to resolve the formatting issues that come up first. In other words, although I think it is ok to have a featured list that is "in process," I don't think it reflects our best work to have a major change like the formatting one proposed as a featured list - but rather work out such a major issue first, so that the list reflects the our best work. I realize that it might have to go through the whole process again, but I think it is necessary for full disclosure.
