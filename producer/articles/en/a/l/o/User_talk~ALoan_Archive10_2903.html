<p>Pretty sure it's Unity, with a majiscule and everything, which suggests that it was some sort of Thing. The DNB said that it was a pre-fabricated Unity house.

<p>Oh! From the map, I can tell you <b>exactly</b> where the house that killed Edward Pilgrim is. If we give letters on the Y axis and numbers on the X axis, then his house was at C 1-2, in the brown "works" at the very bottom of the map. He lived on Marlborough St. and bought a lot <i>next door</i> that was eaten by the Mawney Rd. development, so we take the intersection of Malrborough and Mawney, and that has to be it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:47, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

They need to follow the same order in each one so that if someone is browsing from Featured articles to featured lists to featured pictures, the links stay in the same order (rather than confusingly jumping around). That's the reason why having a standard interface is desirable - to cut down on that kind of confusion. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 18:10, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the bottom links are going to change between different sorts of featured content (is that confusing too?) so why should the top ones have to stay the same? If someone is browsing from FAs to FLs to FPs etc, then the current-page one will be black in any event: if we adopt your style, the black one will be hopping about (again, isn't this a little confusing?) whereas my style puts the black one at the top of the list, whichever page the reader is looking at. If one is browsing from FL to FLC to FLRC, then surely it makes sense for the FL link to be at the top of the list each time. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 18:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's all right if the links at the bottom change - it's not too terribly difficult to make the inference that clicking on "featured articles" brings up the featured article tools, "featured pictures" brings up the featured picture tools, 'etc. However, to the contrary of what you say, it *is* very much confusing if the links rearrange themselves everytime you change pages, which is exactly what I am trying to avoid. It's not necessary to put the current one at the top because, as you say, it will be bolded black in any event. Rearranging links confuses people with no real benefit. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 18:20, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I definitely do not desire that. The thing is, we've gone to all this trouble to give them a nice, sleek, standard interface. It's supposed to have a nice, intuitive behavior - when you click on a FA link, it becomes black and you get "featured article tools". When you click featured pictures, it becomes black and you get "featured picture" tools. Users do not expect the links to change order - it's very much counter-intuitive behavior, which is what we want to avoid. I have an idea though - if you want, we could make it more explicit by putting an arrow in the various templates to explicitely indicate which section you are in. In other words, you go to "featured picture candidates", and the links are still in the FA/FP/FL/FPO order, but there's an arrow pointing left at featured pictures. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 18:30, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would you like to have another look at Sayers - I think I've done with him for now. I didn't want him on the fromt page it is not ready - people will jump the gun here so! Just out of interest what do you think of that form of referencing - what is one supposed to do when "Havarding" to an internet site. personally I think it looks foul and incongruous, but then I don't like all this having to justify every statement at all, I've always thought if people are that bothered they can go out and buy the bloody book, just as they must with everything else that carries references at the back.

<li>No I've no idea who nominated it either? Can't think why, it's not that fascinating. I wish they had not, I've just had to revert some twit who had not bothered to read the page (probably incapable). The referencing, you recommend, (nice article) looks better, do the notes appear by magic at the bottom of the page? - I have huge problem with magic and computers in general because what seems to happen by magic for other people seldom seems to happen for me! Are you sure the assorted odds and sods (who never write a age themselves) who inhabit FAC are happy with this, or will they want to change it tomorrow - one just can't keep track of these people's thoughts - but then I suppose - does one really want to?</li>

<p>Thank you for your comment at <a href="../../../o/l/g/Talk%7EOlga_Rudge_c762.html" title="Talk:Olga Rudge">Talk:Olga Rudge</a>, I have very mixed feeling still about FACs etc. On one hand I think a page has a wider audience if it is a FA, and who does not like to see one of their pages on the main page - However, I think the current preoccupation with peer reviews, inline citations and God know's what else lead me to the view that it is not worth the effort, a view confirmed by the thorough ignoring "Olga Rudge" received last time - one solitary voter, who did not now what he was talking about and the page failed. I don't feel inclined to see any more hard work rejected in what can only be described as an offhand manner. I did briefly think that "Good article" may be the way forward but this edit summary on my fist attempt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brympton_d%27Evercy&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brympton_d%27Evercy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (blatantly untrue) has led me to the same conclusion. At the end of the day I know what is a "proper" FA and I also know what is not. I am frequently surprised when pages like "Cynna Neele" are easily promoted, and other pages like "Henry James" seem to have a real problem - and that has rather confused me as to what exactly we are all supposed to be doing to achieve a FA. It seems laws and requirements change depending on the subject. Contrary to my latest series of articles I am not in fighting mood, and I can't be bothered to dance attendance on the "prose police" and the whims of those who know nothing about a subject.

<p>Thanks for your remarks about the Leg and Reg Bill. I am so glad that some other people have taken an interest in it. I have been telling everyone I know about it as soon as I saw the Bill. It is quite the most breathtaking attempt at pulling a fast one by the government I have seen in a long time. Do you have a personal view on it? Do you know if there is a pressure group that is going to act against it, or will either of the professional bodies. The second reading had very little publicity. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 21:10, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was brought to my attention by Aldabra today (are you aware that son-of-GROGGS continues on the web?). I am intending to write an article in the next few days, if you don't beat me to it. It is an outrageous try-on. I have just found an "anti" Law Society briefing note - <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/secure/file/152472/e:/teamsite-deployed/documents//templatedata/Internet%20Documents/Parliamentary%20briefings/Documents/legregrefbillhoc2ndreading090206.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/secure/file/152472/e:/teamsite-deployed/documents//templatedata/Internet%20Documents/Parliamentary%20briefings/Documents/legregrefbillhoc2ndreading090206.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>I had no idea son of GROGGS was still around. The Today programme had something on it this morning. I'll leave you to write the article (I am sure you are better at it) unless you want my help, in which case I am happy to give it. One worrying thing is that the minister this morning said that they wouldn't be using it for "highly" contraversial proposals. This has mutated from only using it for uncontraversial proposals, which was where we started. Thus, can we infer that the government are going to create merely contraversial law with it? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That's why there's a question mark against that birthdate in the Lead, but the 24 can be used as birthdate in the timeline, IMO, as baptism normally was in fact on the day of birth. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ノート</a> 13:12, 24 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Thanks - but what about <i>before</i> he was 18? Where did he live? Which schools did he go to?

<dd>Chester. Dad was a "sugar-baker" in Chester. (That's a Barbadoes sugar importer, see explanation in "Early life".) Oh, oh, I've got a timed event: Vanbrugh moved from London to Chester at the age of one! On account of the 1665 London plague breakout, so it's colorful and everything. He went to... uh, some school, in Chester. Years aren't known. What I <i>picture</i> him doing between 18 and 22 is youthfully plotting to overthrow the House of Stuart while wearing a frilly shirt and galloping handsomely back and forth to Amsterdam, or wherever William was hanging out, with dispatches from the English resistance. Maybe you could put "Some people picture him..." in the empty space? I didn't bother to put in the baptism thing, no. The Germans asked about the question mark and I told them, so the German article has something about it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ノート</a> 16:30, 24 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p><a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> comes to a page near you. <i>Assuming you accept that the article could be featured, it would be interesting to know what you think should be added or changed. Compare <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">Spoo</a> for example.</i> Spoo is an entirely differenct article from Bulbasaur. Not knowing spoo from...Adam, I can read the article and come out of it quite well versed in spoo. The concept of "food" being quite clear in advance helps. And that's all there is to it, "fictional food". With Bulbasaur, it is a fictional species, a Pokemon character, a game play element, a cartoon series character, a trading card... This I get from the first sentence. The article doesn't proceed to fill me in on much more than that. Knowing about powers and availability (grass?, poison?, trainers?) might as well be gibberish without context. A bunch of plot points tells me more about...what, exactly? Random mentione of a MacDonald's promo? Etc. The article is a (very) few bits of "fact" (children's books, that it appeared in manga,...). This is mostly MEANINGLESS to me unless I understand something about Pokemon. There is no general contextual information in this article, beside the fact that B is one of 386. You asked how I might structure this article... (and this is based on the little I picked up about Pokemon):</p>
<p><b>1.</b> LEAD: Set it up. In the franchise, what are the main components? I gather in terms of popularity, sales, use, whatever, it's video game, trading cards, anime series. Make that clear (and make sure there's a following section on each). Throw in some general stats: "B is part of the $6 billion/yr Pokemon...". That's the main notability of this topic, so say it... (And don't bother with silly attempts to add stature by including incidental stuff from "CNN" and "Time" that aren't followed up in the article).</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Describe Bulbasaur. Keep it neutral unless sourced. Don't link to photosyntheis and solar energy unless there's a reason. "B is a fictional species that looks like a cross between a..." Fine. Some info about when created, by whom, whether (like other cartoon characters), the design has changed, that sort of thing. This is a product description, so give me the basic specs...</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Supply a context: how does Bulbasaur fit into Pokemon? This for each of the main sections.</p>
<p><b>For VG</b>, what is the BASIC Pokemon game play (that takes all of maybe three sentences, and is CRITICAL for being self-contained). Does a player use B in the first person role (do you play as B?) or is it some sort of tag-a-long critter? Do you attack people? Quest? Eat lucky charms? How does the game, and B in it, WORK? Then, if one must list all of the various powers, INTRODUCE THE SETTING. "There are three/eight/44 different types of Pokemon, with powers that offset each other. B is a...") Throw me (the poor reader) a bone. Introduce the generations before reeling off the details ("To date, five generations of...each being..." that sort of thing) <b>For TV</b>, what is the series about? How does it connect to the VG and cards: "The anime is independent of the other..." or whatever. Clue me in. <b>The trading cards</b>, perhaps the most mainstream publicized aspect: How does this work, and what is the B card's role? Are their rare cards and common ones... This doesn't take up much space, and with editing, the article could have all of this and be the same length...</p>
<p><b>4.</b> "Real world" tie-in: Does Bulbasaur have an independent career (like Pikachu!)? IOW, spin-offs like movies, books (yes, two children's books), clothing line, action figures, etc. Is it a moneymaker on its own? Or just say, "While amongst fans B is one of the more popular of the 386 basic Pokemon, it is still just another character." It's OK to ADMIT that. Tell me, one way or another, don't make me GUESS. Here also a place for fluff/filler/interesting extras, like: The translated names ("Pokemon is available in 16 languages, each with a unique Bulbasaur translation..." A treat!) And so on...</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Throw in a picture or two.</p>
<p>That's the BASICS. The article as it is now misses almost 100% on meaningful context, relies on often ridiculously transparent bits and pieces cobbled together to give importance (Livingstone, Time/CNN, MacDonald's promo,...), and is almost entirely based on a straight description of a video game character, and some appearances in a TV series. I'm not picking on this, it's truly bad, it is a parody of an FA, made more so by trying at all costs to conform to FA guidelines... You asked!&#160;:) (Thank whomever for archives, huh?!)

<p>Don't worry too much about it, it was nice of you to defend it, but I realised long ago that the FAs we all did a while back would be swept away by this hysteria for inline cites. I know that the Matthew Brettingham article here is still the most complete article about him anywhere and that is what is important. I even bought the one book on him (useless) to write it. Of course I could go back and add the inline cites, but I don't think I choose too. Let the likes of "Miss Madeline" sweep away all we did before - but with what will she replace it I wonder!
