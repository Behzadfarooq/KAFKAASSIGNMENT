<p>Aloan, thanks for the comments. As I mentioned on my talk, I don't think I'm cut out for wikipedia. I'm a top down incremental writer. I start with an overview, see what it looks like and keep adding. It normally works out well in the end. As you said, I could have used my sandbox, IF I HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO IT (I took an hour reading various things on sub-pages) and IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT. Anyway, thanks for the advice, cheerio<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 19:54, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aloan, thanks for the kind words. Could you please, please, please do something about the way wikipedia treats people like me who want to help. The natural entry point int Wikipedia is the "create new page". If however you do that, its all down hill and completely demoralising. I've also a reluctance to use a "sandpit", I love climbing on children's playparks, but I only do it when I've got the excuse of taking the kids. But people would think I was mental if I went into a public place and started playing in a playpit. It is the kind of thing paedophiliacs do and I've got a cultural aversion to doing anything that might label me as such <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 09:10, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ALoan, I just wanted to thank you for having solved this mediation cabal. I must confess that I'm really surprized about how big this thing has become. Anyway, the best in order to make sure that everything remains behind us would be probably to archive the discussion in the article's talk page, what do you think&#160;? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan_239f.html" title="User:Metropolitan">Metropolitan</a> 20:53, 2 October 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Thanks. I am not really sure that I contributed very much, nor, indeed, that the mediation solved anything. I think the result is the best of a bad lot - I would still go with the original title every time. But thanks for your input - it is really your page, after all.</dd>

<p>Hi, I see you added "&lt;!--such as?--&gt;" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_inhabited_islands_of_Croatia&amp;diff=79215767&amp;oldid=79186791" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_inhabited_islands_of_Croatia&amp;diff=79215767&amp;oldid=79186791" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Well, all the examples before the tag (charging no tolls on bridges, and providing cheaper or free ferry tickets for islanders) are the answer to "such as?", and "other measures" indicates that those are not the only measures. I mean, I could add more measures (the whole law talks about measures, you bet theres hundreds of those), but I feel 2 measures are just fine, this is just list lead, not an article on government spending on islands... --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 09:45, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, fine - thanks for responding so quickly. The previous wording, with "and various other measures" at the end, just left the sentence up in the air, and prompted the question, "what other measures?".

<p>I just moved the above page to Wiki space with a view to encourage more FA writing. I thought it might be up your alley and that you might sign-up. It will only work if people know about it, so, if you think it's a good idea, pass it along. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>An interesting idea. To be honest, I am more of a "fill red links" or "expand stubs" or "copyedit" person than a straight "write FA" person (unlike some people I could mention, whose FAs seem to drip effortlessly from their pens - can you tell how jealous I am?). Having said that, I am - cross fingers - on course for another one in the next few weeks... if I ever find the time to finish off the last part, that is... And my <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_redlinks_7e0d.html" title="User:ALoan/redlinks">collection of redlinks</a> is badly neglected at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is the intention that people would sign up for several quarters in advance, naming the articles that they will work on? Because it is quite nice to be able to work up an article quietly before unveiling it on an adoring public&#160;:) And it is also nice to be able to alight on a topic and write it up, without feeling bound to write about something else instead. For example, I did an <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_L%C3%B6b_acb6.html" title="Martin Löb">obscure mathematician</a> and an <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Hansen_6db0.html" title="Hank Hansen">American war hero</a> so far today. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 15:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The main idea, to be honest, is to get people to think "ya, I should write one" who wouldn't otherwise. As noted in the Considerations, if it lists what was going to happen anyway there is no harm but also no benefit. I left a note for you and (so far) a half-dozen other people involved in FA not so much to prompt them to work (which you and they do anyway) but to create a bit of a snowball (i.e., tell all your friends).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The list also creates a bit of urgency—it's easy to get 80% there with an article and then kind of forget about that last bit of polish (I want to avoid this with <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnard%27s_star.html" title="Barnard's star">Barnard's star</a>, so knowing I've listed will keep it in my mind).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If you'd like to keep what you're working on under wraps, no problem—though of course there's much to be said for having people look at it.

<p>Can you explain why you moved the List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_Paris_region_b7ed.html" title="List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region">List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region</a>? There was (and still is) no consensus for that move. What you did by moving this article is basically giving a green light to ThePromenader's uncompromising and tedious attitude. Basically, ThePromenader can only conclude that it works to harass people till the point where harassment becomes so unbereable that they give in.

<dl>
<dd>Besides, I note that the exact same problems remain. The "Paris region" title suggests some sort of regional list, like a list of tallest buildings in Catalonia, or a list of tallest buildings in New England, and does not convey the idea that this is essentially a city list because all these skyscrapers are at the center of the very dense Paris metropolis. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 21:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you don't realize is that you've opened the Pandora box. This user was puting so much energy in this because it was a defining moment for him. I've seen all his edits for a year now, so I know him better than you do. All he's ever tried to do was to deny the reality of the Paris metro area. Of course he's clever and will never admit it upfront. But when you look at his edits, insidiously you can't help noticing that they tend toward this goal: Paris is the City of Paris, period, and let's hide as much as possible the existence of a 11 million people metro area: (e.g., removing that the highest point in the Paris urban area is at 640 ft in the Forest of Montmorency, and leaving only that the highest point in the City of Paris is at 426 ft on top of Montmartre: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paris&amp;diff=64089293&amp;oldid=64089054" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paris&amp;diff=64089293&amp;oldid=64089054" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Now he will use this title change as a justification for changes in further articles. His next target is already <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Paris_135d.html" title="Economy of Paris">Economy of Paris</a>, which he wants to rename "Economy of Île-de-France. He also wants to remove all metro area economic data from this article and replace them with Île-de-France regional data. Then there's also the Paris article which he has hinted many times that it needs major "changes". Not to mention that he's been willing to delete the [Template:Paris Metropolitan Area] for a very long time, and will probably feel encouraged to do so now after your title change. Here you can read his "condemnation" of the metro area template: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Paris/archive_06#Metropolitan_Area_Template" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Paris/archive_06#Metropolitan_Area_Template" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. So I can only feel disgusted by your giving in to pressure and opening the Pandora box. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 09:34, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By the way, so you know this goes really far, another way for him to deny the existence of French metropolitan areas is to argue that what INSEE (the French statistical office) calls "aire urbaine" cannot exactly be translated as "metropolitan area" in English, because the INSEE definition of an "aire urbaine" is not exactly the same as the American definition of a "metropolitan area". See his recent changes at <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aire_urbaine.html" title="Aire urbaine">aire urbaine</a>. In the past he has also argued that the French "unité urbaine" cannot exactly be translated as "urban area", again because definitions are not 100% the same (see <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit%C3%A9_urbaine.html" title="Unité urbaine">unité urbaine</a>). Using the same litteral reading logic, one could also argue that the French PIB cannot be compared with US or UK GDP because definitions of GDP in the US, the UK, and PIB in France are not 100% the same. And since we're at it, one could also argue that census figures in France cannot exactly be compared with census figures in the US or the UK, since US, UK, and French censuses don't count people exactly 100% the same. He also deleted all the large french cities infoboxes that I had created (they took many hours of work!) and replaced them with infoboxes of his own because apparently my infoboxes made metro area information too prominent (here is an example of my infoboxes: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Toulouse_infobox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Toulouse_infobox" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Now, in his infoboxes (check <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>), the metro area is only given two lines, at the very bottom of the infobox, trying to hide it as much as possible. See how deep goes the iceberg beneath the water? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 09:49, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you feel strongly about this, mediation is not going to solve it, because there is no middle ground on a yes/no question like this (actually, I think "of Paris" would do, but there was little support for that), and, as a content dispute, ArbCom are not going to be interested. I think that means that the only option is an RFC. I entirely accept your position - Paris as a city is obviously larger than the small City of Paris - but I am afraid I have plenty of other more interesting things to be doing than fighting zealots on this kind of question.

<p>I was following your contributions, saw the Lar mess, and got a little miffed at what looked like a big logic hole from kingboyk. The fact that he would say that my presence on Bishonen's talk page proved...something...didn't bother me. I figure that those people who could be magnetized by the current RFAR would treat me like a pole for a while (or a shaft or something), but the thing about "I see no contributions from Bishonen" prompted me to stick my foot in. It's a sad discussion there, IMO. Obviously, I agree with you and Bishonen, and I'm saddened by Lar going from miffed to militant about a personal disagreement, but, if you see my comment there, I wanted to let you know that I'm not going to follow up. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rather oddly, the list already has summaries for the first 4 episodes of the current series (season 3) but only the first has aired yet. I don't think weekly updating counts as "unstable" - that is really trying to catch lists that change on a daily or hourly basis (for example, an Olympics medals table during the Olympics). Once per week is not that too stable, in my book. However, I would be inclined to wait until, say, Friday to see how it pans out after the second episode.</dd>

<dd>Images are a problem here. I would leave them out, and I think that absence of images is not really a valid objection (but having the wrong sort of images would be).</dd>

<dd>Hi, you need to say that it is a scan of a photo of the painting in a book, and the give the book's name and publishing details etc. (also the photographer if it's mentioned). Whether it is public domain is questionable. Regards Arniep 11:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still don't understand.
<ul>
<li>I thought we took the view that there could be no copyright in a photograph of a two-dimensional artwork which was intended to be as close as possible to the original, separate from the copyright in the original artwork, following <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeman_v_Corel_732a.html" title="Bridgeman v Corel">Bridgeman v Corel</a></i>. (Although I am sure the position is not the same in some jurisdictions outside the US.)</li>
<li>The original artist died over 70 years ago, so I added a {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old-70_4502.html" title="Template:PD-old-70">PD-old-70</a>}} tag. Perhaps I should replace it with {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-art_cc11.html" title="Template:PD-art">PD-art</a>}}.</li>
<li>I have already added a source: the original is a painting in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Portrait_Gallery_%28United_Kingdom%29_1cef.html" title="National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)">National Portrait Gallery</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If I am wrong, are any of our images of old artworks free of copyright? I doubt whether Wikipedians have been scouring the museums of the world, taking photographs of the paintings, so they must have come from somewhere, and someone must have created them. Are they all to be deleted?</dd>

<p>ALoan: Simply replace the "no source" tag with a statement saying that you scanned the image from a book, say which book, and which page. Ignore Arniep's statement "Whether it is public domain is questionable" -- it is certainly PD, no worries. Even though it is public domain, and the "original" source is the painting in the NPG, we still like to know what the immediate source is for the particular image in question -- hence wanting to know you scanned it, and from where. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why? Pace debate over <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeman_v_Corel_732a.html" title="Bridgeman v Corel">Bridgeman v Corel</a></i>, the copyright status is obvious.

<dd>This is not a pipe. It is a scan of a reproduction of a pipe.

<p>Sorry, but what has the source got to do with the copyright in this case? That rather annoying template at the top of this section says that the copyright status of this image is unclear because I have not specified who created the content, but its copyright status only depends on me telling you that I made a scan from a book plate, and which book it comes from, if you refuse to that accept that slavish reproductions are denied copyright protection as a result of Bridgeman v Corel. The original painting is clearly PD; the intermediate source is only relevant if Bridgeman v Corel does not make the photograph (and this scan) PD, like the painting. Anyway, I have now added {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-art_cc11.html" title="Template:PD-art">PD-art</a>}}, which makes the usual assertion the original and copies are PD on the basis of Bridgeman v Corel (not in the UK most likely, but they can sue me). The original creator of the painting (Challen) is already stated, and that is the important thing, in terms of attribution and PD (at least, until someone tells me that we have to take our own photos of artworks because Bridgeman v Corel does not work). Who cares about pixels and colours? They change, depending on whether you display it at 50px or 100px or full size anyway.</p>
<p>Now, if someone wants to be really helpful, they could remove the scan's slight lean to the left - I tried my best to to get it straight on my scanner: you should see the other ones!</p>

<dd>What I would like to know is what is the situation if you, if you find the ancient painting in a book of website that claims it is copyright to them - I've never seen a book or website that does not make this claim - so does one still list the source, or does "PD-art" ,mean one does not have to give the source - I thougth I understood all this, now I'm confused. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 16:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think BG is saying that someone (who?) has imposed a requirement (where?) to specify the immediate source of the image (the book, website, etc, from where the particular jpg or gif or whatever was copied), not because of the copyright issue, but to verify where the particular image comes from (why?). It seems to be dressed up as an issue of provenance or verifiability ("yes, this really is the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Lisa_763f.html" title="Mona Lisa">Mona Lisa</a>", or "it is <i>this</i> image of the Mona Lisa, which is not necessarily exactly the same as <i>that</i> image of the Mona Lisa").

<dd>I'm with you, ALoan. I don't think this is busywork as much as "I made a template, and now the template is in charge." Templates that are aimed at vandals and kiddies are getting thrown around robotically, if not actually by a bot, and this unreading judgment takes precedence over what is clearly stated. Someone somewhere <i>wants</i> the print source. Great! I want recognition for my true value to society. However, the world is unlikely to oblige, and I do not get to delete it. This is the rage of civil servants again. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:34, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Let me join the voices who find this needless copyright paranoia of certain users annoying and disruptive. If the image is clearly PD who cares about the particular place where it comes from. I, and even more so Ghirla, uploaded hundreds of images of the old art that I found at some web-sites. I pasted the link originally. Some of the web-sites are now dead and the links to "source" are useless. By the logic of our copyright policemen those 18th century paintings now have to be deleted. I wish those who don't want to write articles found themselves a more productive activity at Wikipedia than stripping the articles from clearly harmless images which are anything but the threat to the foundation. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Giano, what a hero. The article <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salute.html" title="Salute">salute</a> has a section on "aerial salute", mainly to do with dipping wings, etc.; I have added a sentence or 2 and crossref about flypast to that article. Anhow, the parade of aircraft that my article deals with is almost universally referred to as <i>flypast</i>, whether in martial or ceremonial contexts (and also in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airshow.html" title="Airshow">airshow</a>). In the US it is called <i>flover</i>, but almost everywhere else, it's <i>flypast</i>. I've been very careful about this in the introduction and in crossreferencing. I have actually said it's a type of aerial salute in the introduction and I've cross-referred it in the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salute.html" title="Salute">salute</a> article as well. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 22:59, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just making some small vocab changes ie using one word instead if two etc, you can revert if you want - there sdoes seem though to be quite a few sentences that don't follow through with relevant facts begging the "so what?" and "and?" comment. it is interesting though, just need tightening up. Thanks for the West Wycombe job that is great, I'm not sure about FACing it though now, I don't think I care for the current pedantics and quibbling that seems to on FAC at the moment, I'm not sure I want to be bothered with it, also I may have to go away for a few days at end of next week, so would not be arownd to address the quibbles, allthough that may not be a bad thing!!!<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 13:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the congratulations! Yep, my first DYK update was a bit sketchy, the two under 28 October kind of blended together with the "not used", and I didn't think of checking the articles themselves for free images at the time (<a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">User:Yomangani</a> hadn't submitted the image alongside the nom), so it was just a case of not looking close enough. At least I didn't do anything <i>really</i> silly, like leave the image unprotected. I'll be around at 23:00, so if noone's updated by then I'll make sure the two get in in the nick of time.

<dd>Alrighty, I'll make sure to add the link in the archives in the future. As to the other, I guess it's a settings issue.

<p>They probably shouldn't appear on any page except that of persons who were French monarchs. It's silly for the younger son of a King of France, perhaps a dynast in his own right, to have a big infobox topped with the undifferenced arms of France. That still dodges the question of whether it's sensible to have a navigation/infobox for a <i>dynasty</i>, rather than for French monarchs, but it's a start. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 22:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the current templates have ended up getting rather large, swamping the shorter articles to which they are added. Perhaps making a few smaller templates would be better. I think it makes sense to have a navigational box for Kings of France - at least within a sizeable dynasty, as succession boxes should deal with simple "before and after" in any event - and probably also one for a monarch's children - particularly where, like Louis XV, there are ten of them - but I am not sure that it makes sense to combine the two. What are the chances that a reader will want or need to navigate to a random great grandson, or great uncle? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:27, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I only nominated it at the last minute yesterday, hoping it would get into the next update before it became too old. I did an update myself, so didn't select my own article, and then it missed the final choice before it became more than 5 days old.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To explain, I often expand biographical articles using obituaries as sources, and I nominate them at DYK if I think it is worth it, but I usually exclude the ones that have only one reference (it is surprising how often obituaries disagree on details, so I try not to rely on one obit, but to corroborate where possible with a second). Fortunately, several obits of interesting people will often appear in the few days after death, so I can nominate within 5 days of the inital expansion; unfortunately, sometimes obits don't appear until days or weeks later, by which time the article is too old for DYK.

<p>Hi ALoan, thanks for the encouraging words on the now failed candidacy page for making Narnian timeline into a FL. As for images, I don't think there are any fair use ones out there that are slightly relevant. (The Commons has only three, and none are that good anyway.) Still, I don't think that should detract from making it featured, no? Still, you said I should "try again" in nominating it. Should I say anything special in the renomination? It seems to me it would look like I'm just trying to go through the whole process again without any major changes. The thing is that there was no consensus reached after 10 days because only one person had commented on it -- that seems like a strange reason to fail a nomination. I look forward to your response.

<p>I'm afraid that my college workload is too great to permit me to be as regular an editor as I would have liked.
