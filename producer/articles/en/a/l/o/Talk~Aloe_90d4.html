<p>The flower of the superb plant - Aloe Vera</p>
<p>Understand that there are different types of aloe vera 'plant'. But have not really heard of flowering aloe vera in Singapore. I mean the aloe vera plant that whose leaves is edible. I had one plant that grows in a pot and is about 2 feet plus. Recently it started to flower or maybe fruits. I saw the flower of the aloe vera on this page and seems to look different from what I have here. My plant grew a little sort of stem which looks exactly like the leaf but 10 times smaller with 3 little sort like fruit at the tip of this little stem. Very curious and yet waiting for it to grow larger. This stem is now abt 6 inches long!</p>

<p>I don't think the heraldry link is right....its to the wrong kind!</p>
<p>aloe is of the family liliaceae (the lily family) or aloaceae, not whatever is written here</p>
<p>i really do like this article it is very awesome.</p>
<p>The phrase "The dose is 130-320 mg, that of aloin being 30-130 mg. " What sort of way is that to start a paragraph? The portion that follows that line is overly scientific, and meaningless to a layman. What's a "haemorrhoid" anyway and where's the hyperlink? "The drug is obviously contraindicated" Obviously? What the hell is obvious about that?</p>
<p>Eh, the whole article just annoys me...</p>

<p>The article seems to be... self conflicting somewhat. For example <i>They are native to the drier parts of Africa, especially South Africa's Cape Province and the mountains of tropical Africa.</i> and <i>This is often the most common known use of the plant and the rubbing of aloe vera leaves onto sun-burned skin dates back to civilizations such as the Mayas and the Incas</i> I do wonder how the Incas and Mayas could use a plant that, according to the article, grows only in Africa...

<p>Are the previous comments debating whether aloe is proven/effective as a topical skin treatment or the other alleged benefits such as lowering blood sugar, use as a laxative, anti cancer agent and asthma treatment? ||||| Um, interjection: Aloe Vera is used as a skin treatment--Fawxes 09:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)||||| Your information regarding a study which supported it's use as a burn relief agent seems to substantiate aloe's use in this area. Perhaps you could add information detailing how the plant soothes burns in humans. Is it the amino acids or vitamins contained in the plant that produces the soothing results? This could help to support these claims.</p>
<p>sorry i triple posted this info. . . i'm a novice--Mickydog 15:20, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did fnd some information on the vitamins and minerals that are in aloe vera that will be useful to add to the benefits section. Thank you for the comment-it helps to add evidence to my claims. --Heatherlange24 00:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>HELFUL HINTS:</p>
<p>I think that this article needs a little improvement. There are sections that are too wordy and too confusing to understand. I think that the good points would be all of the uses and the history of the uses. It might be a good idea to explain more about how the mayas and aztecs used aloe and how it was discovered. I think that the first picture is good, but the others are not as necessary. Overall I found it interesting but around the middle I found myself loosing interest because of the wordiness, maybe try to use some simpler words. Arobutz</p>
<p>I removed that black and white picture of the plant. it blocks the text (in a firefox browser, anyway) and it wasn't that good looking anyway. -Guy</p>
<p>I understand that there have been some perhaps overly aggressive multi-level marketing operations who have may have oversold Aloe's benefits. But, as with the Dan Rather-Memogate case (just because the memos saying W was AWOL were phony doesn't mean W WASN'T AWOL), the shadiness and agressiveness of SOME Aloe miracle-cure marketers should not blind us to some pertinent facts:</p>
<p>(1) As mentioned in the current Wiki article itself, Aloe contains 19 of the 20-22 Aminos, and 7 of the 8 Essential Aminos. It's also very rich in a broad and comprehensive array of Vitamins and Minerals.</p>
<p>(2) It also is a very good source of some Glyconutrients -- which have been getting quite a lot of buzz lately, not only on the web but also from Big Pharma (currently pursuing about 15 trials to see if they can "package" these Glyconutrients). Glyconutrients are getting a lot of attention because they seem to function as a "communication" medium between cells -- making them important in situations such as apoptosis (where "bad" eg cancerous cells get killed) and immunity (where "bad" eg foreign cells also meet the same end). The "communication" function of glyconutrients reminds one of the proximity between cells providing host immunity and cells involved in the neurological system -- and communication, intelligence, and immunity are intuitively similar functions, it being necessary for natural killer cells, macrophages, etc to quickly "learn" and adapt to foreign pathogens and home-ground neoplasms -- the better to snuff them.</p>
<p>This could all seem like touchy-feely bullshit if it weren't for all those Big Pharma companies researching glyconutrients... Check out Acemannan or Mannose -- a glyconutrient very present in Aloe. Both naturopaths and Big Pharma and a few peer-reviewed papers have spread a lot of buzz about Acemannan -- so this isn't just the multi-level marketing scams talking.</p>
<p>I think that in order for the main Aloe article to be properly "balanced" in the Wiki sense, we need to go a BIT more into the lab results that led to the FDA's approval of injectable Acemannan in 1994 -- and the later studies leading up to their ban of it.</p>
<p>Personal disclosure -- I chop huge leaves from the plant and put the gel in a blender (NOT the green skin of the aloe leaf (which is the laxative part overly emphasized in the current wiki article, and which, as a protective integument, is OBVIOUSLY going to have a very different function than the inside) -- just the succulent interior, a gooey gel which I also rub all over including IN my eyes and nose. -- ScottAlexander</p>

<p>2 points: 1 I know of an aloe vera plant 6 feet tall. The current text says "may grow to 4 feet". How do i supply a photo of it next to a human? This is in Bridgewater, Adelaide Hills, South Australia 2 I personally healed a tropical ulcer on my hand overnight by applying raw aloe vera. A doctor told me that this was not possible as tropical ulcer are caused by agents in the blood requiring antibiotics: topical treatment useless he said. Not so.

<dd>=== Chemical properties of Aloin ===</dd>
<dd>Aloins are soluble and can be water extracted by water. According to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of Aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picric_acid.html" title="Picric acid">picric</a> and <a href="../../../o/x/a/Oxalic_acid.html" title="Oxalic acid">oxalic acids</a> with <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitric_acid.html" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a>, and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), chrysammic acid (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), and picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbadoes aloes, and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Socotrine and Zanzibar aloes, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>7</sub>Â·H<sub>2</sub>O) forms bright yellow scales. Barbaloin (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) forms yellow <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prism_%28geometry%29.html" title="Prism (geometry)">prismatic</a> crystals. <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<dd>The dose is 130-320 mg, that of aloin being 30-130 mg. Aloes can be absorbed from a broken surface and will then cause purging.

It hardly affects the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_intestine.html" title="Small intestine">small intestine</a> but markedly stimulates the muscular coat of the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Large_intestine.html" title="Large intestine">large intestine</a>, causing purging in about fifteen hours. There is hardly any increase in the intestinal secretion, the drug being emphatically not a hydragogue cathartic. There is no doubt that its habitual use may be a factor in the formation of haemorrhoids, as in the case of all drugs that act powerfuly on the lower part of the intestine without simultaneously lowering the venous pressure by causing increase of secretion from the bowel. Aloes also tends to increase the menstrual flow and therefore belongs to the group of emmenagogues. Aloin is preferable to aloes for therapeutic purposes, as it causes less, if any, pain. It is a valuable drug in many forms of constipation, as its continual use does not, as a rule, lead to the necessity of enlarging the dose. Its combined action on the bowel and the <a href="../../../u/t/e/Uterus.html" title="Uterus">uterus</a> is of especial value in <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorosis_%28medicine%29.html" title="Chlorosis (medicine)">chlorosis</a>, of which amenorrhoea is an almost constant symptom. The drug should not be taken during pregnancy and when haemorrhoids are present. Many well-known patent medicines consist essentially of aloes.</dd>

<dd>== Lign-aloes and Agarwood ==</dd>
<dd>The lign-aloes are quite different from plants of the genus <i>Aloe</i>. The term "Aloes" is used in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> (Numbers 24:6), but as the trees usually supposed to be meant by this word are not native in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, it has been suggested that the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> reading in which the word does not occur is to be preferred. Lign-aloe is a corruption of the Latin <i>lignum-aloe</i>, a wood, not a resin. <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dioscorides.html" title="Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> refers to it as <i>agallochon</i>, a wood brought from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, which was odoriferous but with an astringent and bitter taste. This may be <i><a href="../../../a/g/a/Agarwood.html" title="Agarwood">Agarwood</a></i>, a native of East India, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Asia_e921.html" title="South East Asia">South East Asia</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, which supplies the so-called eagle-wood or aloes-wood, which contains much resin and oil.</dd>

<dd>Request for article on Aloe Venenosa, in what part of the world does it grow and what does it look like for example? If you are thinking of using the juice of a local Aloe plant you need to know if it might be the poisonous type. I couldn't find location information on the web as of 27Aug06 although there was one image in google images.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/o/Talk%7EAloe_90d4.html" title="Edit section: Incorrect Citation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Incorrect Citation</span></h2>
<p>The statement that aloe is genotoxic isn't supported by the citation: <a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/aloe.html" class="external free" title="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/aloe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/aloe.html</a></p>
<p>That citation cites another article on pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9020301&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9020301&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9020301&amp;dopt=Abstract</a></p>
<p>The abstract states "results from some of the studies suggest that components of senna products, particularly emodin and aloe-emodin, have genotoxic activity."</p>
<p>A better citation would be: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10434060&amp;itool=iconabstr&amp;query_hl=3&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10434060&amp;itool=iconabstr&amp;query_hl=3&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10434060&amp;itool=iconabstr&amp;query_hl=3&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum</a> stating that there is a good chance that anthraquinones are genotoxic and mutagenic.</p>
<p>Citing the citations in the citation?</p>
<p>I don't have access to the pubmed articles, but someone who does could rewrite it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10829589&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10829589&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10829589&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum</a> is another citation, using aloe vera hydrogel in the treatment of mouth ulcers.</p>
<p>Mucilage is known to be in aloe, and known to be a soothing compound. Probably marshmallow and plantain (plantago major) would be a less controversial treatment (and cheaper.)</p>
<p>People love aloe though. I've stopped using it. Some doctor in Arizona did an online article about using aloe vera gel in the eyes as a treatment. That may have sparked the craze for aloe vera eye treatments. He was careful to specify using just the gel, but I can't find the article now.</p>
<p>The current article talks about supposed treatments, research and fads. I suspect that someone more knowledgable could come up with a timeline and history of aloe fads, that'd be awsome! Jeanne Rose states (Herbs and things, 1972, 1978) that aloe is poisonous used in large doses or for an extended period of time. So the current research is nothing new to herbalist knowledge (possible genotoxicity and hematotoxicity are just flavors - taking internally is a big caution anyways.)</p>
<p>There's no writeup here about possible contact dermatitis resulting from exposure to the juice (not the gel) and I don't have a citation reference for that one.</p>
<p>The article also references cascara sagrada. That was also known as a potentially dangerous plant to herbalists (Jeanne Rose, 1972, 1978.)</p>
