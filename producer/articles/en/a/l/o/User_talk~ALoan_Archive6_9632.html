<p>Under what grounds did you (a) pull the debate on the name change after only 4 days, and (b) under what grounds did you decide there was no consensus to move the name of the article. I make it 4 yeses and 1 no, please explain your actions and your ignoring of the consensus, ideally on the talk page.-Also Rastafari needs removing as a disambiguation, with <a href="../../../r/a/s/Ras_Tafari_0c0a.html" title="Ras Tafari">Ras Tafari</a> redirected to <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haile_Selassie_fb29.html" title="Haile Selassie">Haile Selassie</a>, there has been no-one denying that.

<p>I saw the argument made that _any_ alteration of Parliament's powers or composition made under the 1911 Act would be invalid - which I would suppose include abolishing the right for Welsh bishops to sit in the Lords. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 22:15, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>BTW, I looked around, both at academic publications (theses and dissertations) and at Google and it seems that Rastafari <i>is</i> more widely used than <i>Rastafarianism</i>, with <i>Rastafarians</i> as the people. (see <a href="../../../r/a/s/Talk%7ERastafarianism_f878.html#Looking_at_the_data" title="Talk:Rastafarianism">Talk:Rastafarianism#Looking_at_the_data</a>).

<p>I started off with the opinion that Rastafarianism probably <i>was</i> the more common usage, but that Rastafari was more appropriate. Looking into things I am convinced that Rastafari is the more common usage. I realise a lot of people disagree, which is fine, I don't have that much invested in it either way, although of course coming from the Caribbean I am far from disinterested. Unless/until I can find something more convincing I intend to back away from the issue. One way or the other, the best usage will work itself out if people are interested enough; that belief is why I put the effort into Wikipedia - well, that and my desire to make Trinidad the best documented country in Wikipedia&#160;;) <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:09, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, of course, edits are always welcome if you see something I missed. I try to get articles relatively complete before publishing, but I'm not going to pretend that they're perfectly polished.

<p>Probably testing my luck here:) However, I should be grateful if you would still have a look at this - particularly as now I'm gonna have to update it for <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">16 March</a> before I can make it into a featured article:( . It's a shame really that we don't live in an autocracy, or I could "persuade" you to explain what the "I minus E" basis that I have to keep mentioning as an exception is.

The Star of IC article should probably remain separate as it has the potential to expand into a large article all on its own.

<p>I was wondering if you could tell me why the socratic method entry was merged with the entry on socrates? it seems to me that these are two very different things- you wouldn't find <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonic_love.html" title="Platonic love">Platonic love</a> under <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartesian_coordinate_system.html" title="Cartesian coordinate system">Cartesian coordinate system</a> under rene descartes, and it seems similar in this case.

<ul>
<li>Hi there - I've just seen that you removed the tables at HIGNFY. I put them in to reduce the vertical space that those long lists of people take up. Was there a particular reason for you removing them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Because it looked awful, TBH, with three columns on top of two and neither lining up.</p>
<p>I played about with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Have_I_Got_News_For_You&amp;oldid=12576483#Appearances_and_guest_presenters" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Have_I_Got_News_For_You&amp;oldid=12576483#Appearances_and_guest_presenters" rel="nofollow">two columns for a while</a> (total apps. to the left, presenters to the right) in an attempt to save it, but while that looked a bit better the asymmetry in length sunk it. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoM_3601.html" title="User:SoM">SoM</a> 19:59, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it was the first thing I thought of. Perhaps a single table with 3 columns: (shown on <a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESoM_0b1f.html#HIGNFY" title="User talk:SoM">my talk page</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem with that is that there's no clear distinction between the two - it looks like either three lists or one (and the headings don't stand out enough to make any distinction, especially since they're not lined up right).</p>
<p>I see what you're getting at here - and I kinda agree, which is why I tried the two-columns - but I don't see that there's a good way to make the tables work right, especially if it involves breaking one list up but not the other.</p>
<p>Plus the vast majority of lists on Wikipedia are single column, even hugely long ones, so keeping this as single column is more consistant anyway. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoM_3601.html" title="User:SoM">SoM</a> 20:26, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, shame we didn't run them very close, even - if the questions had come in a different order I'm sure we'd have done a lot better. And, we were the best human team in the contest. I'm actually not annoyed at all that we lost&#160;:) It was all great fun anyway.</p>

<p>Just a warning. Portalspace hasn't officially been set up yet, though there is clearly a lot of support for it, and I'm sure it's only a matter of time. When it is set up, everything starting with "Portal:" will be deleted to make room for it (which is why I have a copy of the cricket portal in my userspace in case the developer creating it accidentally deletes it). So if you do move your UK portal, I recommend you take a similar precaution. I'd also recommend reducing the editor-friendly bits to an "if you would like to contribute bit", but that's because I see Portalspace as being a readerspace rather than an editorspace.

<p>I return for a quick look and what do I find, ramblings about some green activist no one has ever heard of, or wants to hear of, and looks like the man in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_f0e0.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a>, (nothing so nice as real coral on the bathroom wall, and a stuffed albatross suspended from the ceiling, I've always thought). A huge kerfuffle because someone was so bored they put a Dalek going "exterminate" on the front page in an article about Daleks, presumably in an effort to liven things up, and Bishonen involved in a dispute so long and boring, that those who can determine what its about must have lost interest years ago. I'm worried about that woman, I think she's become genetically cloned into an admin zombi. Well to mark my partial return I've written a page on a literary figure myself <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairy_Maclary_e0e6.html" title="Hairy Maclary">Hairy Maclary</a> - so go forth my children and bring it up to FA status. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 17:40, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll have to take the family back, then - the house was under scaffolding last year, hence no piccy. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 08:30, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I was actually fishing, but no matter. I've loads of fotos of it, I keep meaning to upload them and make an FA, but time and entheusiasm for the place are not really there. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 08:35, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
