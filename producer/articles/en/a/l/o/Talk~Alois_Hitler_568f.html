<p>Did Alois Hitler really marry his own half-sister's daughter? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:41, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, he didn't marry a niece. Klara (mother of Adolf Hitler) was a cousin, grandaughter of either his father or uncle. In the context of that time and place this was not at all unusual and in truth wonted.</p>
<p>You likely have this confused with his son Adolf's relationship with Geli Raubal, who indeed was Adolf's half-sister Angela's daughter. This sort of relationship was a bit close but still fairly normal for people of AH's socio-economic background at the time. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 12:24, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I was going by the family tree at the end of the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> article. It claims that Alois was the illegitimate son of Klara's grandfather, Johann Hiedler/Hüttler. Anyway how can Klara be Alois's cousin is she's his uncle's <b>grand</b>daughter? As for Geili Raubel, I've not even heard of her. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 13:33, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A "grand-niece" would be a cousin. Anyway they were all related in multiple ways (in truth, we all are, but the relationships in that small village were particularly close and familial). Alois was born out of wedlock but his father was almost certainly one of the Heidler brothers and his birth was later "legitimized" as such by the parish, which is how AH was legally born a "Hitler." See <a href="../../../g/e/l/Geli_Raubal_6c1c.html" title="Geli Raubal">Geli Raubal</a> for more about her. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 14:57, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many articles about Hitler's relatives claim a possibility of Klara being Alois's half-niece. But I suppose the exact truth will never be known. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 15:30, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Are there any direct descendants of Alois Hitler alive today? From what I've seen on Wikipedia, none of Adolf Hitler, Paula Hitler or Geli Raubal ever had children, and Alois Hitler Jr.'s only son William Patrick Hitler had four children, one of which died when he was young. The other three have vowed never to have children. Does this mean that when they die, there will be no Hitlers left in the world? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 15:30, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Officially" yes, the last I heard the only remnant of AH's childhood family was living in New Jersey USA (including two or three sons of WPH, who was AH's nephew) and one way or another the family has taken public steps to wipe out their line. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:27, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was the woman (whose last name is unknown) really called "Thelka"? "Thekla" was a common name then, Thelka I have never heard before. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> 11:00, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's widely recorded and documented as <i>Thelka</i>. That said, since nobody knows anything else about this person (even her last name), it's reasonable to assume it was long-ago mis-spelled by some clerk or historian. However, since we should follow the documented record (and not get into the murky waters of original research by correcting something we think might be an ancient typo... without any support other than reasonable speculation), I'd leave it be... perhaps a parenthetical note on the question would be ok though. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 11:24, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given his subsequent behaviour, it seems unlikely that Alois reached his mid-twenties before discovering sex. Therefore it seems likely that Adolf may have had other half-brothers and sisters apart from Thekla/Thelka's child. Is there any indication that anyone came forward claiming to be a half-sibling during Adolf's rise to power? If so, what became of them?</p>
<p>Also, how strictly was the ban on Jews enforced prior to 1860? I expect there were illegal immigrants them as there are today. Could a wealthy tobacco merchant (Frankenburger) have bribed officials to ignore his presence?</p>

<p>It isn`t right that Frankenberger is a alternative to Alois` father, because when he was birthed there were not any Jews in Graz. But some people said that Hitler`s mother told him (on her last day) that the grandmother (her mother-in-law) worked by a Jewish man from Hungary and that is his grandfather. Perhabs it is true, but I think it`s lie. Simon Mayer</p>

<p>"Closely related to his support of education was his tolerant skepticism concerning religion. He looked upon religion as a series of conventions and as a crutch for human weakness, but, like most of his neighbors, he insisted that the women of his household fulfill all religious obligations. He restricted his own participation to donning his uniform to take his proper place in festivals and processions. As he grew older Alois shifted from relative passivity in his attitude toward the power and influence of the institutional Church to a firm opposition to "clericalism," especially when the position of the Church came into conflict with his views on education." - Smith, Bradley F.
