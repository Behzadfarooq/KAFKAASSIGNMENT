<p>Hi ALoan, how come you deleted my comment on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_articles_c405.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured articles">Wikipedia talk:Featured articles</a>&#160;? It was probably not done on purpose, but since there was a fair amount of time between our two edits, it can not be an edit conflict or anything like this, so I was wondering what happenend. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchutz_72ef.html" title="User:Schutz">Schutz</a> 16:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. You've removed the Recent Changes to Test Cricketers link on the Wikiproject:Cricket page. I'm not wise enough to know how to re-create it there or elsewhere, but it's the one link I use to check whether cricket bios are being updated constructively (or not). Could you either restore or provide me with a link to put it somewhere else, such as my user page, please. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 20:32, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for that. I'll add them to my user page, so if you want to take them off the Project page that'd be fine. I just use them a bit to see what's going on elsewhere. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 13:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliment, though as I replied on talk page, the credit is due to original writing team.

<p>Hi. Concerning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost&amp;curid=1370330&amp;diff=57015228&amp;oldid=56987717" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost&amp;curid=1370330&amp;diff=57015228&amp;oldid=56987717" rel="nofollow">this revert</a>, a good standard Wikipedia practice is that reverts which are not plain vandalim better be reverted using an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summary.html" title="Edit summary">edit summary</a>, as otherwise it is not clear why you did the revert, and the good faith editor which was reverted may get offended that his/her edits are treated as vandalism. This is a small thing, but I thought I'd mention it. You can reply here if you have any comments.

<dd>Thank you for your concern, but the reason for that link to be capitalised in that particular way had already been discussed on the talk page. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 09:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that's exactly what one should write in the edit summary, or at least, saying "see talk". I am not saying you did the wrong thing, I am picking at <i>how</i> you did it.&#160;:) <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 15:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm fixin' to do this one. He's part of a particular family: If he's who I think he is, then his aunt was <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Scott_c34c.html" title="Sarah Scott">Sarah Scott</a>, and his other aunt was <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Montagu_b192.html" title="Elizabeth Montagu">Elizabeth Montagu</a>, both of whose articles I did. It struck me at the time that this was a very, very dark family. Between you and me, I think that Matthew Robinson Sr., patriarch and father of SS and EM and MR father of 6th Rokeby, was a child molestor. It would explain SS and EM's truly <i>pathological</i> fear of sex and their views of sex as Satanic. (You'd have to read <i>Millennium Hall</i> to see what I mean, and I don't actually wish that book on anyone. If you find yourself overwhelmed by curiosity and pick it up, be sure not to read the introduction to the "Virago" edition, as it's written by a true chowder-head.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:00, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gosh! I can add some sources on his life and career as an Army officer, from Waterloo to the Crimea.<a href="http://thepeerage.com/p2540.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://thepeerage.com/p2540.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/nightmare.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/nightmare.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/gh-diaries/charlieusherwood-8.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/gh-diaries/charlieusherwood-8.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/guards/f-3SG.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/guards/f-3SG.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> He was indeed the 6th Baron (Henry Robinson-Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby or Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby - redirects required).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The family history seems a bit confused. From the dates, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Montagu_b192.html" title="Elizabeth Montagu">Elizabeth Montagu</a> (incidentally, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Montagu_a561.html" title="Edward Montagu">Edward Montagu</a> goes to completely the wrong place) seems to be the sister of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Robinson%2C_2nd_Baron_Rokeby_c628.html" title="Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby">Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby</a>. His article says that he is the son of Septimus Robinson, but <a href="http://thepeerage.com/p14832.htm#i148317" class="external text" title="http://thepeerage.com/p14832.htm#i148317" rel="nofollow">this source</a> says their father was Matthew Robinson (1694-1778) who marrried Elizabeth Drake (which reconciles with Elizabeth Montagu's article, which says that Matthew Robinson was her father). The second Matthew apparently changed his name to Robinson-Morris in 1746. He died without issue, so the children of his (?)younger brother Morris Robinson (?-1777) inherited the title (Morris Robinson, 3rd Baron Rokeby, 1757-1829; Matthew Montagu, 4th Baron Rokeby, 1762-1831).
<dl>
<dd>Ok, interlining here: Yes, believe it or not, that's correct. Elizabeth's <i>mother</i> was related to the Robinson-Rokeby, while her <i>father</i> was not as directly. Her father's family were all Matthews. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:19, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>4th Rokeby changed his name to Montagu in 1776 (it is not clear to me why, as the various peerages with that name - <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton_eeb5.html" title="Baron Montagu of Boughton">Baron Montagu of Boughton</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Sandwich_0ec4.html" title="Earl of Sandwich">Earl of Sandwich</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Manchester_b12d.html" title="Duke of Manchester">Duke of Manchester</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Montagu_7f4b.html" title="Duke of Montagu">Duke of Montagu</a> and others - all seemed to be going strong). 4th Rokeby had masses of long-lived daughters. Edward Montagu, 5th Baron Rokeby (1787-1847) was his 9th child and 6th Rokeby was his 10th.<a href="http://thepeerage.com/p3070.htm#i30696" class="external autonumber" title="http://thepeerage.com/p3070.htm#i30696" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> 6th Rokeby had two daughter, so presuambly the title is in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abeyance.html" title="Abeyance">abeyance</a> rather than extinct.
<dl>
<dd>Alright, I know why 4th did that. He had been adopted by Elizabeth when he was very young and his father died. She left him all the <i>MONTAGU</i> money (which was a ton), making her her sole heir, as her only child died at the age of two. The matrilineal Robinson money didn't amount to much compared to the Montagu money, and the Rokeby money didn't amount to much in comparison, either, as Montagu had done a great deal to increase his money, and Elizabeth was no fool with money, either. So, Robinson becomes Robinson-Montagu. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:19, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the copy edit, there is quite a bit more to do yet, I have to write a much longer and complete lead, and then expand the 20th century section and the interior section - I don't want to drag on about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but I suppose if I don't some-one else will only go and shove it in in the wrong place. I'm thinking of FACing it eventually, bit I think it will have to be reduced in size first as it's a bit verbose at the moment.

<p>You seem to have promoted the list ignoring my concerns with the neutrality of the "Freedom House" ratings. That's no big deal, however, I find it a bit disrespectful and against the promotion criteria. <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/User%7EM%C3%A1rio_f9b6.html" title="User:Mário">Mário</a> 11:14, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I've just noticed that you edited the list before promotion, nonetheless, the "Freedom House" ratings still have a major presence in the article, the list was much better before. <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/User%7EM%C3%A1rio_f9b6.html" title="User:Mário">Mário</a> 11:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you may be misunderstanding <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> if you think that we can only use neutral sources, and that "partial" sources are off limits (ignoring for the time being whether Freedom House is neutral or not). So long as the criteria and source are cited and explained in a neutral way, that is enough. If you can find a contrary source, feel free to add it. There are links to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a>, where there is already a criticism section: it would make sense to add your concerns there so readers can see for themselves what the issues are. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 11:53, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's no big deal, sorry if I was a bit harsh, it wasn't my intention, I'm not a native speaker and I often don't use the better words. You removed the references to the Freedom House opinion from the lead, that's the part I criticized, so, excluding the map, the article is good now. I just don't think the article should include "Freedom House claims x,y and z about the EU countries" in the lead, like if Freedom House was the major and the only source of political opinions in the world, also, it is not even European. Along with that, the presence of such considerations would allow anyone to include the opinion of any other think tank in the lead. That wouldn't improve the article's neutrality.

<dd>I have been working through my redlist - see the DYK things above - and adding new ones to it, as you might have seen (it seems like every time I write an article I create another six redlinks). I have also been adding lots of recently dead people - there really ought to be a WikiProject to write up biographies of anyone who has an obit in a mainstream "serious" newspaper (The Times, NYT, WaPo, etc). It is such excellent fact-packed material to crib from, and there are so many really interesting people (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_Lloyd%2C_Baroness_Lloyd_of_Highbury_236e.html" title="June Lloyd, Baroness Lloyd of Highbury">her</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Mather_c3c0.html" title="Carol Mather">him</a>).

<p>I just was fishing for a compliment on that article -- just "gosh, that looks pretty good" or "it has pretty colors" or something. Anyway, Dove Cottage is one of those very, very rare finds: a truly major cultural touchstone that no one has even attempted. By the way, your "her" is a very interesting figure, but I don't know "him" at all. With those people, there are Who's Who bits to grab from, too, and there are probably multiple online obits. In some cases, there will even be "assessments" afterward, too ("Maynard Keynes and the Passing of an Era" kinds of things). Very fruitful. We should keep it quiet, though, or everyone will do it...and probably with a blinkin' infobox. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:42, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - I'm writing because you encouraged me to consult you about inline citations. Please note I will also copy this to the Help Desk for other views, but I would appreciate your replying to me individually on this: -</p>
<p>I am trying to learn inline citation so that I can raise articles to Featured Article standard. Please could you take a look at the article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenadier_Guards_5d97.html" title="Grenadier Guards">Grenadier Guards</a> which I do not see as a FA. I have made an attempt to generate a footnote as a test case for other articles I'm working on.</p>
<p>However, I have enountered difficulties in execution and also in terminology. Let me first say I know about bibliographic and citation style, but have had trouble with</p>
<ul>
<li>working with the "ref" and "note" templates. Having checked the appropriate Wikipedia How-to page - <a href="../../../i/c/_/WP%7EIC_3d88.html" title="WP:IC">WP:IC</a> - on this, I'm thoroughly confused. I tried to create a footnote in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenadier_Guards_5d97.html" title="Grenadier Guards">Grenadier Guards</a> using the "ref" and "note" templates. The note looks OK, but the ref in the text (it's in the Marches section) is NOT ok. Could you please take a look and advise me as to where I'm going wrong on this? I will keep a watch on your Talk Page or - possibly better - could you reply to mine and keep a friendly eye on me for the moment?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Relating what seems to be "Reference" advice to my Footnotes and Reference section. The instructions on the How-To page do not clearly distinguish between a Footnote and a Reference. To my understanding, the Reference section is a bibliography and each reference item would appear therein only once. Meanwhile, Footnotes can refer to the same text a number of times - i.e., Ibid. and Op. Cit. references, etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are the "ref" and "note" templates actually for footnote use? What am I missing here?</p>
<ul>
<li>And finally: in the article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenadier_Guards_5d97.html" title="Grenadier Guards">Grenadier Guards</a> have I placed the Footnotes, References, See Also and External Links categories in the right order?</li>
</ul>

<dd>This is to let you know that User Fuhgettaboutit (I hope I've spelled that right) fixed things from my Help Desk request. by using some advanced formats.

<p>My final queries - I think some of them may be unanswerable (they are certainly unrepeatable, heh-heh): I'd be so grateful if you could bullet your answers separately</p>
<ul>
<li>Are References basically considered as identical to "Notes"? - see the last reply to me on the Wikipedia HelpDesk (In some articles they do the job of Footnotes or Notes; in others, e.g., <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, there are sections for both References and notes.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>!!!But I observe in B Pal that the Notes section does not use normal footnote crediting format - it is just used to amplify the text.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I see that the cite format employs inversion of first and final names. That's fine for a Bibliography, but in Footnotes the firstname comes first normally and parentheses are used for publishing data e.g. (London: John Murray Ltd., 1979) ...can I alter the order of things when doing the piped links on the cite template OR does it not matter? OR - see the first and second bullet point above - should Notes NOT have the full form of the reference, but just use a surname (as Giano does in B PAL)?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I am probably in OK shape to start applying what I know but any further clarification you can give will be welcome. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(Talk)</a> 12:51, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>References are not quite the same thing as notes, although they often merge together.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is little in the way of mandatory practice here. The &lt;ref&gt; system is the easiest way to do footnotes, and many people put their references in the footnotes and put the &lt;references/&gt; tag in the "References" section. Others like to have proper footnotes (Smith, 1999, page 20) and use the &lt;ref&gt; system for that, putting them in a "Notes" section with separate fully-cited references in a separate "References" section. Horses for courses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>None of the these formats are mandatory (neither &lt;ref&gt;s not the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} format) although some people consider them best practice. I must admit to never having used the various cite formats. Some people may winge about format, but at the end of the day, so long as the information is cited, that is the main thing. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 13:06, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good question you asked. I'd be delighted if the referencing were tweaked to satisfy trivial complaints; I suggested the article because it's beautifully written and illustrated, and has none of the political issues that surround the current example. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks - I was eavesdropping on Giano's talk page and saw your comment. I suspect the references issue with <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanssouci.html" title="Sanssouci">Sanssouci</a> is that external links have no "last accessed" date (which is a technical fault) or that the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} templates are not used (as those templates are not mandatory, I would have less sympathy with this complaint).</dd>

<dd>I think our copyediting standards differ slightly (from your comments on <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>, it seems that you are rarely satisfied!) but we certainly agree that <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanssouci.html" title="Sanssouci">Sanssouci</a> is excellent.

<p>My dear ALoan, tho we have never talked before, after eavesdropping at Geogre's talk page I couldn't resist and I really wanted to drop by and say hi. I've found your latest articles fascinating, and I'm positive I'm not the only one - you are so talented! I also wanted to give you a little tip regarding another possible entry you may be interested in, since you included it at your list of red links. In case you didn't know, there's quite a substantial article about Hansken the elephant at <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansken_(Elefant)" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansken_(Elefant)" rel="nofollow">de.Wikipedia</a>, and quite a bit of material at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hansken" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hansken" rel="nofollow">Commons</a> too. I tried to make a basic translation of the German article, but I'm afraid my knowledge of the German language is comparable to those of the breeding habits of the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves_%28Tolkien%29_250b.html" title="Elves (Tolkien)">Elves</a>... in any case, I hope that helps, and please, keep up the awesome work!

<dd>Hello. Gosh, thanks for the compliment&#160;:) Yes, I had noticed the materials on Hansken, but thanks for the pointer anyway. I find machine translation (e.g. babelfish) side-by-side with the original makes translation a bit easier. A project for next week, now, but feel free to have a stab if you have some time. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi ALoan, based on a discussion with Phaedriel, I've begun work by copying the de: text over and pasting in the babelfish translation here: User:Lar/Hansken (elephant)... since you said you're busy, I'll take a crack at it if you like. Perhaps we can collaborate to refine the text further after I give it a go. My German is not very good but I do have some small knowledge.

<p>I have made substantial additions to the History section, with concomitant additions to Footnotes and References.</p>
<p>I do hope that you like the material, which mostly deals with the early history of the site that no-one ever confronts....</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice which I have put into practice. Please feel free to improve my Reference entries of the websites if you think they could be cleaned up.</p>
<p>Dear ALoan, could you please show me how to CITE a website? I know how add it to References, but do not know how to CITE it in the body of the text (and consequently, how to &lt;ref&gt; &lt;ref/&gt; it. (By the way - I've learned the "nowiki" bit from you as well - thanks...)The "cite web template" was confusing to me in this regard. i.e., I tried it and it didn't work well. (I will look over your notes again, having kept them). I know it's complicated and they warn not to use it, but how do you, in effect, quote and footnote a website? hmmmm.</p>

<p>Although it is fine to block the page, I suggest you read through the talk page before coming to any final decision. Although some would like to pretend otherwise, Paris is very unlike other agglomerations, and I don't think it a very likely idea to try to bend reality to a "greater scheme" that doesn't at all exist for anyone in the country spoken of. 70% of the article content is not in Paris, and there are <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html#Follow_local_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Wiki naming conventions</a> to consider for reasons of referencability - much of the contents of this article you will never find in any reference under the heading "Paris", unless of course this silliness goes on so long that Paris annexes the Île-de-France first. Apologies for my terseness, but I would not waste my time were I not certain of what I speak, and it is opinion and pigheadedness that is winning out here, not fact. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 14:20, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: The motion to move to "Paris region" was defeated, but the counter-proposition to move to the Wiki-correct "Île-de-France" won, albeit by a narrow margin. I left that one for seven days instead of the usual five for additional votes, and even did the rounds to garner more participation beforehand. This is supposed to be about fact before anything, an I had hoped that by opening a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> that the fact of the matter would emerge - it did, as you can well see by the talk page. Since 70% of the article is not at all "in Paris" the next official administrative step up is the Île-de-France. The French version of the same article is titled "in Île-de-France", and this is not for nothing - it is not for vanity that I promote this renaming. Sorry for the move-revert mess, but sole opposing party has a long history of 'editing' this way - even in lack of reference. Excuse me but I'm sure you can understand my (temporary) frustration. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 14:41, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the messages, and my apologies for the rather premptory protection, but I was alarmed to see the page move three times in a short period of time. I have not reached a final conclusion, but 2:1 does not look much like consensus to me. Hopefully a little more time will allow more people to express their opinions so a broader consensus can emerge. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 15:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No apology needed - I understand completely. It's not the block that bothered me, but it was your seeming at-a-glance understanding of the problem - I am concerned about the final outcome, that's all. Fact aside, there is only one opposing the move and (always) reverting - and, as you may have guessed, this argument goes beyond this page. Sorry for my seeming vehemence but being a simple observer of <i>largesse</i> taken with the ignorance of others seems quite against the very reason I contribute to wiki. You'll notice that only one other contributor to the talk page in question speaks of naming conventions and fact - "sounds good" is neither. Anyhow I am still a bit steamed so time to chill.

<dd>Wow! Thanks. If I may nit-pick, the arms of <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonville_and_Caius_College_d7a9.html" title="Gonville and Caius College">Gonville and Caius College</a> are:</dd>

<dd>The Gonville side is fine; on the Caius side: (i) the "flowers gentle" are apparently meant to be <i>Amaranthus melancholicus</i>, a species <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaranth.html" title="Amaranth">amaranth</a> which seems to be the same as <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaranthus_tricolor.html" title="Amaranthus tricolor">Amaranthus tricolor</a></i> (despite what the other images show! And, unhelpfully, I also think the illustration in our article shows <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaranthus_caudatus.html" title="Amaranthus caudatus">Amaranthus caudatus</a></i>, <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love-lies-bleeding.html" title="Love-lies-bleeding">Love-lies-bleeding</a>, instead); (ii) I am not sure that your "sengrene" is quite right either - you have drawn something like a daisy, but it should apparently be a green <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houseleek.html" title="Houseleek">houseleek</a>, <i>Sempervivum tectorum</i> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Caius_e1f7.html" title="John Caius">John Caius</a> was a physician, and the houseleek has medicinal qualities); (iii) the tails of the "serpents" are tied together with string, not interlooped (see <a href="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/rota.php?count=3" class="external text" title="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/rota.php?count=3" rel="nofollow">this</a>); (iv) the "vert" slab of marble could be a touch greener (it looks a bit blue to me); (v) the book is actually meant to be sable (black), with red bands and gold clasps, not red furnished gold.</dd>

<dd>Now that <i>is</i> service.&#160;:) Thanks - excellent. There will probably be complaints, because the semy is different to the college's standard version at their website (<a href="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/</a>) which looks to me more like a semy of white flowers (lilies?) but this looks more like the original. My only comment now is that the "flowers gentle" look a bit too much like red roses, and don't have enough green, but they will do.

<dd>No problem&#160;:-) I'll fiddle with the design later when I have some free time. The escallops still look rather like rubber gloves, so I'll work on those too. Incidentally, do you know what the copyright situation would be with the Robinson college arms? Obviously it isn't all that old, so I assume I'd be infringing someone's copyright if I traced in the Pegasus image from the image we're using at the moment. Is there a royalty-free alternative somewhere? -- <a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakurambo_f58b.html" title="User:Sakurambo">Sakurambo</a> <a href="../../../s/a/k/User_talk%7ESakurambo_d013.html" title="User talk:Sakurambo"><font style="color: #f06; border: 1px solid #f6a; background-color: #fff8f0;">桜ん坊</font></a> 12:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
