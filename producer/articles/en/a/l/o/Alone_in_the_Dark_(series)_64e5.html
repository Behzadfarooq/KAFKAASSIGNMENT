<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/o/Alone_in_the_Dark_%28series%29_64e5.html" title="Edit section: The original trilogy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The original trilogy</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Edward Carnby</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The protagonist of the original trilogy, Carnby is a red-haired, mustachioed private detective who wears a neat suit and bowtie. Carnby was once a seedy private detective known as "The Reptile", investigating adulterous husbands and the like. One day, he was hired to go to the remote manor of Derceto and appraise its contents following the suicide of the owner, Jeremy Hartwood. Trapped overnight in the haunted mansion, Carnby eventually manages to defeat the supernatural forces threatening him and escape, earning him the nickname "The Supernatural Detective". Additional paranormal adventures would follow. In <i>Alone in the Dark 2</i> he explores the fortified mansion of Hell's Kitchen to rescue Grace Saunders from One-Eyed Jack's gangsters, and avenge the death of a fellow private eye named Stryker. In <i>Alone in the Dark 3</i>, he explores the ghost town of Slaughter Gulch to investigate the disappearance of Emily Hartwood's film crew.</p>
<p>Carnby is one of the few survival horror protagonists who can punch a zombie to death using only his bare hands. However, when the zombies start carrying firearms in later games, this tactic becomes slightly less effective.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Emily Hartwood</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The second playable character in the original <i>Alone in the Dark</i> game. Other than the fact she fired the revolver one-handed with the other hand on her hip instead of with both hands, playing as her was exactly the same as playing as Carnby. The niece of Jeremy Hartwood, Emily went to Derceto to investigate the apparent suicide of her uncle there. Although in the original game, only Emily OR Carnby enter Derceto (not both), the series' continuity seems to suggest they both were trapped together and fought their way out. After the Derceto incident, Emily would go on to become a successful Hollywood film producer. In <i>Alone in the Dark 3</i>, she and her crew disappear while shooting a Western in the ghost town of Slaughter Gulch, and it is eventually revealed that she has been kidnapped and possessed by the disturbed ghosts of the town's outlaw inhabitants. She is freed by Carnby, and there are a couple brief sequences in which the player takes control of Emily to help Carnby escape from a trap or other predicament.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grace Saunders</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>A young girl from a wealthy family, Grace is kidnapped by One-Eyed Jack's crew and held at Jack's mansion of Hell's Kitchen. On several occasions, Carnby is captured at the same time Grace manages to escape, and the player takes control of Grace in attempts to rescue Carnby. Being only a small child, Grace cannot fight and runs very slowly, so instead she must hide from the gangsters while cobbling together <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Alone_1df3.html" title="Home Alone">Home Alone</a></i>-style boobytraps to dispatch them.</p>
<p>Grace also stars in <i>Jack in the Dark</i>, a short adventure in which she uses her puzzle-solving skills to rescue Santa Claus from an evil "One-Eyed Jack" Jack-in-the-box.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ezejial Pregzt/Eliah Pickford</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The original <i>Alone in the Dark</i> villain. In 1620, Pregzt was one of the world's most bloodthirsty pirates. He was also heavily involved with the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">occult</a>, and one day left his crew to disappear into the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamps</a> of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. Pregzt learned dark <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">sorcery</a> and became a disciple of <a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu.html" title="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a>, gaining occult powers and immortality. He eventually took the name Eliah Pickford, and used his vast pirate wealth to found a Louisiana plantation mansion by the name of Derceto. Pickford hired workers to dig a vast, secret network of caverns below Derceto. Pickford apparently intended these caverns for supernatural purposes, and they connected to a large, natural subterranean chamber linked to the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Ones_9534.html" title="Old Ones">Old Ones</a>. Pickford was killed before he was able to summon Cthulhu into the world, after he attempted to poison a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29_fad6.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> named Norton while soldiers bunked at Derceto.</p>
<p>Although his body was dead, Pregzt did not truly die. His corpse was brought to the subterranean chamber by his servants, where it was placed on a throne carved out of a vast underground tree. Pregzt's body merged with the tree and became a mummified corpse that harbored Pregzt's spirit. Although Pregzt was trapped within the shell of his corpse, he was still able to exert influence on the world above. He invaded the dreams of the Hartwood family after they rebuilt and reoccupied Derceto. Pregzt intended to possess the body of a Hartwood and continue his work in summoning Cthulhu, but each Hartwood died before Pregzt could possess them. In the original <i>Alone in the Dark</i> game, the attacking zombies are Pregzt's attempts to immobilize Carnby or Emily so that they can be possessed. However, Carnby and Emily manage to defeat Pregzt's creatures, and confront him in his subterranean tomb, where Pregzt's corpse fires magical fireballs and is defended by an army of <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Ones_e780.html" title="Deep Ones">Deep Ones</a>. Carnby eventually manages to defeat Pregzt's magic with a <a href="../../../y/a/e/Yael.html" title="Yael">Yael</a> sign and burns Pregzt's corpse using a lantern (which has special significance, as it happens to be the first item the player acquires in the game).</p>
<p>Pregzt/Pickford appears to be at least partially inspired by the character Robert Sudyam from the H.P. Lovecraft story <i>The Horror at Red Hook</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>One-Eyed Jack</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The main villain of <i>Alone in the Dark 2</i>, One-Eyed Jack is an infamous Louisiana <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootlegger.html" title="Bootlegger">bootlegger</a> who makes his hideout in the forbidding mansion of Hell's Kitchen. As his name implies, he wears an <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyepatch.html" title="Eyepatch">eyepatch</a> to cover a missing eye. In reality, Jack is an ancient pirate who gained immortality of a sort after allying with Elizabeth Jarret, a powerful Voodoo witch. Jack's gangsters are actually his pirate crew who have lived for hundreds of years as a result a spell that gives them eternal youth and regenerates their bodies hours after they are killed. However, the spell requires the periodic human sacrifice of innocents, which is where Grace Saunders comes in. Unlike his crew, whose bodies can temporarily be destroyed, Jack himself is nearly indestructible. Jack is also an extremely skilled fighter, wielding two swords and fighting with an extremely quick and deadly martial arts style. In the game's finale, Carnby duels Jack one-on-one and eventually manages to defeat him using the sword of Captain Nichols (a man from Jack's pirate days who swore eternal revenge after Jack killed him). With large chunks of his flesh missing, a half-skeletal Jack revives briefly, only to be permanently destroyed when Carnby blows up Jack's pirate ship with Jack on it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Elizabeth Jarret</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>One-Eyed Jack's Voodoo Queen, Elizabeth Jarret has lived for several centuries through extensive use of black magic. She eventually hooks up with Jack's crew of pirates, giving them immortality through regular human sacrifices. Elizabeth's magic allows her to remotely view occurrences throughout the house, manipulate inanimate objects (she brings a clown doll to life to kill Stryker with), and summon horrible creatures from beyond. Her powers also make it impossible for Carnby to fight or kill her (as soon as he even steps into the same room as her, she simply immobilizes him with a Voodoo doll and causes his body to float in the air), but she is eventually killed when Grace manages to turn her own Voodoo magic against her (by brandishing a chicken leg).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jebediah Stone</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The main villain of <i>Alone in the Dark 3</i>. During the Wild West era, Jebediah Stone was a prospector who discovered <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Indian</a> soil. Word soon spread of the discovery, and soon prospectors came to mine the gold, killing the Indians in the process. Jeb Stone founded the town of Slaughter Gulch on their land over the site of the gold mine (which also lay on top of a canyon along the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Andreas_Fault_428c.html" title="San Andreas Fault">San Andreas Fault</a>). Stone and his fellow outlaws ruled with cruelty and lawlessness, but were eventually killed when the local blacksmith rallied the town citizens against him. The ghosts of Stone and his cronies are disturbed when Emily Hartwood's film crew comes to Slaughter Gulch to film a movie, killing the crew one by one and eventually taking physical form.</p>
<p>Jeb appears several times throughout the game, always just out of the main character's reach, until the game's final battle. Unlike the series' previous villains, Jeb has no apparent supernatural powers, instead relying on technology and his trusty <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_rifle.html" title="Winchester rifle">Winchester rifle</a> to obstruct Carnby's progress.</p>
<p>A diary discovered late in the game reveals that Stone is, improbably enough, the son of Ezejial Pregzt and Elizabeth Jarret. He was raised in an orphanage but disappeared one night after a mysterious fire destroyed it. It is also revealed that Stone discovered an evil ore in his mine (hinted to be <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">Uranium</a>), from which he planned to create a bomb powerful enough to crack the San Andreas Fault and sink <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> into the ocean (apparently, ancient Indian legends stated that the man powerful enough to accomplish this would be granted dominion over the Earth). Stone's resurrection allowed him to continue his mining operation and pursue his goal of destroying California. In the game's finale, Stone puts on a primitive suit of <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Armor_1828.html" title="Power Armor">Power Armor</a> (complete with arm cannon) to battle Carnby with, but is defeated when Carnby uses ancient Indian spirits (and a large dose of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a>) to disintegrate Stone.</p>
<p><b>Minor Villains of the Original Trilogy</b></p>
<p>During the course of each game, Carnby usually fights the Arch-villain's main henchmen. They are more unique than the other minions of evil the player confronts, and aside from posing a special challenge, most of them have richly detailed life <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">stories</a>, written in some of the books, letters and other documents the player can find.</p>
<p><i><b>Villains of Alone in the Dark</b></i></p>
<p>Few identifiable characters can be found, but some include ghosts resembling the union soldiers billeted in the mansion, who dance in the ballroom when the appropriate music is played, and a sword and eypatch wearing apparition who could be a manifestation of Pregzt from his pirating days. Several Lovecraftian creatures also appear, including two Nightgaunts, a Cthonian and a number of Deep Ones.</p>
<p><i><b>Villains of Alone in the Dark 2</b></i></p>
<p>Using Voodoo magic, One-Eyed Jack's men were granted immortality. The magic has also given them regenerative powers: if they are killed, they will be <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrected.html" title="Resurrected">resurrected</a> in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>As a result, if Carnby kills One-Eyed Jack's main henchmen during an early stage of the game, he will encounter a <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirate</a> <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">incarnation</a> of each of them later on, in One-Eyed Jack's ship.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jeremiah "Shorty Leg" Johnson-Tucker</b>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sean "Music Man" O'Leary</b>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tom "T-Bone" Flaherty</b>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Alister "Black Hat" Fein</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Alister Fein, a charm-school graduate, began his career as a ruthless killer at the age of 8. He placed a teddy-bear stuffed with gelignite at the gates of Killarney jail to free his father. The resulting explosion took the lives of nine men.</p>
<p>All that remained of Captain Dickerson was a black hat. Alister kept the hat and decorated it with sharp blades. Soon, the outlaw Fein was in Trinidad, where he honed his skills and became an expert of firearms and manhunting. One-Eyed Jack could not ignore his talents.</p>
<p>In combat, "Black Hat" is a durable sharpshooter who wields a pair of pistols. He is defeated by Carnby.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mister Eye</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lookout of One-Eyed Jack's ship, his true name is unknown. Born in Nouamghar and was eventually deported to Haiti. Mister Eye had lived a meaningless life, until he became familiar with Elizabeth Jarret and voodoo magic, and became her servant. Mister Eye was made lookout because his exceptional view. He was also able to wield the harpoon with remarkable skill.</p>
<p>During his attempt to finally save Grace Saunders and stop One-Eyed Jack once and for all, Carnby fights Jack's few remaining men while dodging the harpoons Mister Eye flings at him. Eventually, Mister Eye climbs to the lookout post, closely followed by Carnby.</p>
<p>In combat, Mister Eye wields the harpoon and kicks at close range. Carnby defeats him, and continues to confront One-Eyed Jack's last henchman - Bubble-Blade.</p>
<p>Note: During Grace's attempt to sneak around the deck of One-Eyed Jack's ship, it is possible to see Mister Eye is quite a dancer.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bubble Blade</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Villains of Alone in the Dark 3</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jim "Lone Miner" Burris</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>One of Jeb Stone's henchmen. As written in his Wanted Man post, he is frighteningly greedy, yet his greed is his greatest weakness - he can only be harmed by a golden bullet.</p>
<p>Carnby confronts the "Lone Miner" at an early stage of the game. He is invulnerable to Carnby's kicks, punches and head-butts, as well as most of his bullets. But a carefully aimed golden bullet, fired from a Winchester, can spell out the Lone Miner's defeat.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method of eliminating the "Lone Miner". It is possible to use the bullwhip to whip him, causing him to drop a bag full of gold coins. Strangely, these coins can be used as ammo for the Shotgun. They function just like the golden bullet, and therefore, they can be used to kill the "Lone Miner".</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lei "Cobra" Tong</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>A member of Jeb Stone's private army of cold-blooded killers.. According to the Wanted Man post found in the Sheriff's office, "Cobra" escaped Jail by putting a 30/30 bullet in the lock of his cell, and hitting it with the side of his hand! This tactic is used later on by Carnby to open a door. Carnby confronts "Cobra", a vicious and highly capable Martial Arts warrior, yet ultimately, Carnby is able to defeat him.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Elwood brothers</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>More of a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gameplay.html" title="Gameplay">gameplay</a> device than true <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villains.html" title="Villains">villains</a>, the Elwood brothers are Jeb Stone's main henchmen. They are a pair of invulnerable gunslingers who block Carnby's path to certain areas in Slaughter Gulch, forcing the player to advance and perform actions in a certain order, as Carnby is eliminated if he tries to approach them.</p>
<p>Mostly, Carnby should just avoid the Elwood brothers, yet sometimes he must escape them, or prevent them from tracking him down and eliminating him (for example, by using a large wardrobe to block their point of entry).</p>
<p>Eventually, the Elwood brothers are killed by Carnby during his confrontation with Jeb Stone, using a powerful magical wand Carnby crafted earlier.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The sheriff</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The sheriff of Slaughter Gulch is a character of unknown name that is usually seen only in the game cutscenes, mostly along Jed Stone. He is supposed to be a ghostly sheriff giving his clothing.</p>
<p>The only time the sheriff can be met in the actual gameplay is when Carnby eventually transforms into a Puma, as he is torturing two werewolfs outside the Saloon. However, he must be avoided by the player as he can't receive any kind of damage with Carnby being in the animal form.</p>
<p>After Carnby returns to his human form and rises from his grave, the sheriff is no longer seen in the whole game (except for a death cutscene in the mines) and as he is not fought in the game final confrontation with Jed Stone and the Elwood brother, little is known about what eventually happened to him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/o/Alone_in_the_Dark_%28series%29_64e5.html" title="Edit section: The New Nightmare">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The New Nightmare</i></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Edward Carnby</b>: One of the game's playable characters. Carnby's path involves more combat and fewer puzzles than Aline's. This new Carnby is younger and edgier than his predecessor, with long hair and a more "Goth" appearance. Also unlike the original Carnby, who was an ordinary private detective who kept being unwittingly thrust into supernatural cases, this new Carnby is apparently an <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_Mulder_2829.html" title="Agent Mulder">Agent Mulder</a>-style paranormal investigator specializing in battling the occult. Other than the name, he does not appear to have any relation to the Edward Carnby of the original trilogy. Carnby goes to Shadow Island to investigate the death of his partner Charles Fiske (similar to the Carnby's arrival at Hell's Kitchen to investigate the death of his partner Stryker in <i>Alone in the Dark 2</i>). His signature weapon is a double-barreled revolver, which looks impressive but deals the exact same amount of damage as Aline's "regular" single-barreled revolver. Throughout the game, he proves sarcastic and a bit thick-headed, but otherwise decent. Towards the end of the game, it is suggested that Carnby is the spiritual son of Hecatonchires, the Abkanis God of Light, and destined to dedicate his life to battling the darkness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Aline Cedrac</b>: The game's other playable character. Aline's path involves less combat and more puzzles than Carnby's. As a result of sudden monster attacks, she starts the game frightened and co-dependent, yet she eventually gains confidence and ends up taking a leading role in the investigation of Shadow Island. An expert in ancient languages with a <a href="../../../p/h/d/PhD_8f5b.html" title="PhD">PhD</a> in <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeology.html" title="Archeology">archeology</a>, Aline is sent to Shadow Island by Agent Johnson to translate Obed Morton's Abkanis tablets. However, her true motivation in going to Shadow Island is to meet Obed Morton, who she believes may be her father (who left her mother before Aline was born). When Aline finally encounters Obed, she learns that he's never had children, and that Johnson deliberately misled her into believing Obed was her father in order to lure her onto Shadow Island. Aline's true father remains unknown, although there are hints in the game that, like the Morton Twins, her heritage is not entirely human (in a nightmare sequence, she encounters her father as a child only to see his monstrous face revealed, and if she chooses to look in De Certo's mirror to see her "true self" her face's reflection is a cackling skull).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Edenshaw</b>: Edenshaw is the last of the Abkanis Indians, inhabitants of Shadow Island and the descendants of the original guardians of the Gates of Darkness. An old friend of the Morton family going back to Jeremy Morton, Edenshaw is responsible for raising the Morton Twins as well as teaching the Mortons much of the lore involving the World of Darkness. Through inaction and weakness, Edenshaw fails to prevent Alan Morton from growing up to be an evil man obsessed with the World of Darkness. He enlists the aide of Edward Carnby and Aline Cedrac to prevent Alan from opening Shadow Island's Gate of Darkness, and when that fails he redeems himself by performing the Abkanis sealing ritual to close the Gate of Darkness forever. Presumably, he is killed when the ritual causes Shadow Island to collapse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Lucy Morton</b>: The mother of Alan and Obed, Lucy is an old woman who was blinded and paralyzed in her youth after an accident while horseback riding. She spends her time alone and bedridden in her room, surrounded by hundreds of burning candles to keep the shadows at bay. Aline meets her shortly after crash-landing on the Morton mansion, and the two of them have several conversations in which Lucy warns Aline about the Creatures of Darkness and begs her to save her son Obed. Lucy eventually locks herself in her room after she realizes her dead husband Howard has been resurrected as a monster by Alan, and she is presumably killed when Shadow Island is destroyed at the end of the game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Obed Morton</b>: The owner of Shadow Island. A prominent archeologist and expert on ancient languages, Obed is famous for his research into the Abkanis Indians that once dwelled on Shadow Island. In reality, Obed is a fraud and a coward. All of his famous research was stolen from his much more brilliant brother Alan, who cared nothing for academic honors and allowed Obed to use his work in exchange for supplies for his experiments. Obed is also in league with Christopher Lamb, who bullies Obed into translating the Abkanis tablets containing the ritual needed to open the Gates of Darkness. Lamb abandons Obed and Alan after they give him the translation, and sends Carnby and Aline to Shadow Island so that the four of them can eliminate each other. Although Obed fears the World of Darkness, he is too much of a coward to fight his brother Alan, and spends much of his time hiding in locked rooms. Somehow, Obed is pulled into the World of Darkness after Alan opens the Gates of Darkness. There he is transformed into a huge two-headed Creature of Darkness, and attacks his brother Alan in revenge. Insane and schizophrenic, Obed confronts Aline and blocks her escape from the World of Darkness. However, after Aline shoots him several times, Obed regains his sanity. He saves Aline's life, and uses his new monstrous body to battle a swarm of Creatures of Darkness, giving Aline time to escape by sacrificing his own life.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Alan Morton</b>: Alan Morton is Obed Morton's twin brother, and the game's primary villain. He looks exactly like Obed Morton, except for the fact he wears an eyepatch over one eye. The world does not know that he exists, as he prefers to remain on Shadow Island and study the World of Darkness, with which he has been obsessed with all his life. Alan has been conducting twisted experiments in his laboratories below the island, attempting to merge Light and Darkness by injecting human corpses with a serum derived from cells of a Creature of Darkness. The results of his work are the Hybrids, the zombie-like creatures that roam the Shadow Island area near the Morton manor. Alan also killed his father Howard for opposing his attempts to free the World of Darkness, then injected his father's corpse with a serum that turned him into a mindless, hulking brute. Alan eventually succeeds in his goal of opening the Gates of Darkness, which he fearlessly enters. He is pursued by Carnby and Aline, and eventually attacked by his mutated brother Obed. Alan himself is infected and mutated into a Creature of Darkness. In the end, Carnby and the monsterous Alan have one final showdown. Alan proves impervious to conventional weapons, but Carnby eventually manages to slay him with a mystical Abkanis spear.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Judas de Certo</b>: Another mysterious friend of the Morton family, this one with a more sinister agenda. de Certo was the partner of Archibald Morton, the first Morton to inhabit Shadow Island. His origins are unknown, but he was responsible for turning Archibald's interest to the occult and the World of Darkness. Even after his death, de Certo lives on as a ghost guiding the Morton family in their research on the World of Darkness. He apparently has the ability to appear in any mirror in the mansion, and has been battling Edenshaw for many years. de Certo meets Aline and enlists her help, ultimately attempting to trick her into gazing into his mirror and seeing her "true self". Aline rejects him, however, and destroys de Certo's mirror. de Certo's spirit is apparently tied to the mirror, and shatters as soon as the mirror breaks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Agent Fred Johnson</b>: A Bureau 713 agent working directly for Christopher Lamb. Johnson, under Lamb's orders, lures Carnby and Aline onto Shadow Island through fabricated evidence suggesting that Fiske died on Shadow Island and that Obed is Aline's father. Towards the end of the game, Carnby and Aline learn of Johnson's deception, and develop a deep distrust of him. However, at the end, Johnson has a change of heart, and shows up with a helicopter to rescue Carnby and Aline from Shadow Island. Apparently, Johnson is a government agent sent to infiltrate Bureau 713 and investigate Lamb, but who was betrayed and cut off by his handlers, leaving him with no choice but to continue obeying Lamb. In spite of this, Lamb manages to learn of Johnson's deception, and marks him for death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Christopher Lamb</b>: A shadowy character, Lamb only appears briefly in the game's opening and ending cutscenes. The head of Bureau 713, Lamb's official mission is to combat <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, but in reality he has transformed the organization into his own personal army for the purposes of paranormal investigation and exploitation. Lamb's family, obscuring its <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> roots, managed to infiltrate the U.S. government and thrive under the guise of the fight against Communism. Partially paralyzed by an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> attempt by the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a>, Lamb walks with the assistance of a cane and wears a neck brace. Lamb is ultimately responsible for sending Carnby and Aline to Shadow Island, intending for the Creatures of Darkness to kill them. Lamb appears to dislike light, as he keeps his office in total darkness, with the shades drawn to block out the sunlight from outside. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Lamb has acquired the text of the ritual needed to open the Gates of Darkness, although what he intends to do with such dangerous power is not addressed. Although the Shadow Island Gate has been destroyed, many others still exist across the world.</li>

<p>The original game engine was created by <a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9rick_Raynal_22b1.html" title="Frédérick Raynal">Frédérick Raynal</a> as a pet project while working at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infogrames.html" title="Infogrames">Infogrames</a>. With the help of Didier Chanfray, who made the 3D models, a working prototype of the attics (the game's first room) was designed. An internal contest was held to create the art to complete the 3D prototype. Yaël Barroz's art was selected and she was introducted into the game's core team. Frédérick Raynal directed the project.</p>
<p>Shortly after <i>Alone in the Dark'</i>s initial release, a major disagreement between the team and Infogrames' director (<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Bonnell_b871.html" title="Bruno Bonnell">Bruno Bonnell</a>) took place regarding the direction of the sequel. As a result, most of the original team left Infogrames to create a new studio named <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeline_Software_International_ce2e.html" title="Adeline Software International">Adeline Software International</a>.</p>
<p>According to an interview<sup id="_ref-CatTOM_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CatTOM" title="">[1]</a></sup> made just after the release of <i>Alone in the Dark</i>, portions of the sequels were designed by the original team before leaving. The interview presented a sketch of the house that was used in the sequel and mentioned the fact that Carnby could be dressed as Santa Claus.</p>

<p>The game engine is the first known to use interpolated animation. This keyframe-driven system relies on computer power to compute the animation frame between the keyframes. This approach has the advantages of reducing the game's memory footprint (requiring less memory to store) and adapting to each computer's power.</p>
<p>The game engine developed for <i>Alone in the Dark</i> was reused in its first two sequels (<i>Alone in the Dark 2</i> and <i>Alone in the Dark 3</i>) without substantial changes.
