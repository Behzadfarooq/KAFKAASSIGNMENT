<p>Hi there. Hope you enjoyed the eclipse. Time's got too much for me - I'm not going to be able to get the obituaries list on <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_ToDo_feb4.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus/ToDo">User:OpenToppedBus/ToDo</a> up to date. To be honest I probably couldn't even spare the time to restart it afresh without the missing three weeks - I just don't have an hour a day to keep it updated. Feel free to take it over if you wish. Thanks for the work you contributed in the time that it was live. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 15:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Yeah, I was damned wikistressed. I was not as upset about the GNAA article as might be seemed, though I was pissed that some people seemed to be objecting to things that I thought weren't reasonable: perspective is a wonderful thing, I probably was wrong. It's just a pity I managed to piss off a lot of good people. I've only started realising that I can do that very easily.</p>

<p>We've been friends since I fist came here, so I have to say ALoan I was surprised and a little hurt by your comments. I have been completely vilified by that man, and a good few people on that RFA page to, and for what, realising Tony was not quite as nice as those who recommended him for FA thought he was. He has threatened Wikipedia with legal threats, thrown another of his former supporters out of some club/group he runs, taken back copyright music he uploaded, generally been completely foul to anyone who had the guts to oppose him. And now threatens to rubbish the whole project on the internet. You talk about Wikilove and walking away, where would we all be if Bishonen and I had walked away? - on the eve of Tony becoming an administrator that's where. Perhaps the next person he would have crossed would have been less able to defend themselves than me, where would your Wikilove be then. Yes ALoan you just think on that.</p>
<p>I have deliberately only mentioned this business on pages I regularly go and to people who know of the subject, as yet he has wrongly accused me, and Bishonen of whipping up opposition on other people's talk pages, You go through my recent edits and find one instance; and then check his. I only mention this to you now as you seem to be familiar, if in my opinion misinformed, on the subject.</p>
<p>While in spite of his disgraceful behaviour he has received numerous messages of support and pleas to stay. Bishonen and I have received no support from anyone. Let us not fall out, but please do try to be a little more considerate of other feelings. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 17:50, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi ALoan</p>
<p>Sure, I realise exactly what you're saying. The only reason I haven't withdrawn the nomination is because the longer it continues, the more WP might see that it should be drastically changed. I'm disappointed to find that you've received flack above from two contributors who are important to you; I'm sorry that what might, in calmer times, be seen as even-handed comments, has caused other tension for you. I hope that Giano and Bishonen will move on and enjoy a good working relationship with you.</p>
<p>However, to further my purpose in exposing why this terrible process is very bad for WP, I've decided to paste the above comments onto the RfA page, excising the bits that refer to you. People can hunt down the recipient of those messages if they wish, but it won't do you any harm—just the opposite, I'd have thought.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your intelligent, measured and kind words.</p>

<p>These are the arguments posted on the page of "Moldovan language".</p>
<p>For these <b>facts</b> many users have been blocked and more forced to accept an unilateral point of view of the Administrator Mikkalai and 16 years old Kid [[Node _ue]]. <b>He does not bring arguments as we do</b>, instead he uses his power <b>to block many times</b> (for one week or 24 h). Like for yourself, he warned you and mock on you saying that you don't have the right to say something.</p>
<p>I agree with you when you say to redirect to "Romanian language". Anyway "Romanian" was once recognized in the constitution as official language of the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldova.html" title="Moldova">Moldova</a> between 1991-1994 and many attempts to remake this were done.</p>
<p>"Moldovan language" is <b>in fact</b> <b>indentical</b> with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a>, renamed as a "language" for political reasons by the government. Although similar theories have been fielded for other languages, this proposal is now believed to have been made to serve political purposes only, and nobody has provided any evidence so-far towards the idea that Moldovan and Romanian are not from common linguistic stock.</p>
<p>The term "Moldovan" is also a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">soviet</a> <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention.html" title="Invention">invention</a> (see Dept. of State &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>). A separate language based on these was declared and promoted for political reasons, in order to further advance a Moldovan identity separate from that of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>.</p>
<p>The soviet Russians called people of Moldavia Republic: "Moldovan" because they wanted to create a new nation different from Moldavians/Romanians.</p>
<p>There is also in Romania a region called Moldova.</p>
<pre>
Russians manipulated people of Republic of Moldova and washed their brains to create a new person, the soviet "Moldovan". The real name in English is Moldavian, in Romanian is Moldovean and in Russian is Molidavanin. So "Moldovan" belongs to no language!

<p>"The name 'Moldovan language' (in Russian, МОЛДaВCKИЙ ЯЗБIK 'moldavskii iazyk'); in Romanian, limbă moldovenească, or, in Cyrillic characters, ЛИMбЗ MOЛДОBeНЯCKЗ was applied in the Soviet Union, as during earlier periods of Russian occupation of the area in question, to the * Romance language used in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (corresponding more or less to the formerly Romanian territory of Bessarabia, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940). In reality, 'Moldavian' is nothing else than the *Romanian language as spoken in Moldavia, i.e. both east of the river Prut in Bessarabia (now the Republic of Moldova) and west of the Prut in that part of the former province that remains as part of Romania. Claims made in the post-Second World War period by the Soviet linguists that 'Moldavian' should be recognized as a distinct Romance language were not taken into seriously by western scholars. Under Soviet domination, the *Cyrillic alphabet was in the use in the Moldavian SSR until the passing of a law on 31 August 1989 (i.e. before the break-up of the Soviet Union) proclaiming Moldavian as the official language of the Republic and the use of Latin script. Apart from a few lexical differences (mainly technical terms borrowed from Russian rather than, as in standard Romanian, from western languages), the written language was thenceforth indistinguishable from that in use in Romania and moves are afoot to harmonize the technical terminology of Moldova with that adopted in Romanian specialized dictionaries. After the Republic of Moldova declared its independence of the Soviet Union in 1991, its Constitution (1994) declared that the official language was limba moldoveneasca 'the Moldavian language'. At the time of writing, moves to have this amended to 'limba română' the Romanian language have not yet succeeded.</p>

Evolution from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">Romanian</a> to so called <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavian.html" title="Moldavian">Moldavian</a></span></h2>
<p>Lately were discovered some facts that prove that the theory of the both languages <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">romanian</a> and "moldovan" - was prefab since the 1812-1918. Some important aspects of the problematics: functioning of the romanian language in the sphere of the laic education system from Bessarabia of the year 1812-1918, the attempts to codyfing the romanian language in conditions of a linguistic situations, causes that determined to degradation of the language compared with spoken romanian on the right side of the river Prut, taking out the name "romanian" and introducing the term "limba moldoveneasca", the intention of the tsarist government "to create a dialect neared to the slavic language".</p>
<p>In the first years of russian occupation (after 1812), because 95% of the population being romanians which they knew only their mother tongue, romanian was admitted as an official language in the institutions of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessarabia.html" title="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>, used along with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>. Gradually the russian language win importance. According to the dates offered by the Dept. for ruling the Bessarabia from <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>, the papers from bureau were held only in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>, and around 1835 it is established a term of 7 years time in which the state institutions will still accept acts in romanian language. As concerning the education, romanian was admitted as language of teaching only until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>, after that being taught as a separate object. Thus, at the theological Seminar of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="Chişinău">Chişinău</a>, romanian language is found on the list of compulsory subjects, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the department of romanian is closed for good. At the highschool no. 1 from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="Chişinău">Chişinău</a> the pupils had the right to choose between romanian and german or between romanian and greek until 9th of Feb. <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, when the state counselor of the russian government interdicts teaching of the romanian language because the pupils "know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals". Around <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, the tsar published an ucaz "On the suspension of teaching the romanian language in the schools from Besserabia", because "In russian Empire are not taught local speeches".</p>

<dd>Not at all. I rarely vote at FA, but when I do go there, I usually have a look at what intersts me and vote on several at once. Far be it for me to tell anyone else what is right or wrong. Have you read the Portugese page, it's quite brilliant, I could have written it myself, and that is part of its problem, its author like me is to passionate on the subject, frightened of missing a fact out, so crams them all in, with his mind jumping ahead to the next one regardless of flow. Perhaps you ought to give it one of your copy edits, before some fool jumps in and alters the meaning and content.

<li>It improves by the moment. Since I wrote it I've been given some more information on the subject, all in beautiful Italian reference books, hence by barbed comment on FAC, so I may well re-write it completely in the new year.

<p>Hi there, thanks for nominating this article as a FA candidate but it seems that most people who voted have an issue with the size of the article. I commented on that problem on the respective FA candidate page. To me, the 32k number is not a strict limit but a recommendation to prevent trivial topics from being blown out of proportion. As Tfine80 wrote, there seem to be sort of cultural differences between the German and the English Wikipedia regarding article size and splitting. The German counterpart of this article, for which I'm the main author, passed FA voting with flying colors. The German article about the Geneva Conventions is similar in size, Tfine80 suggested to translate it as well to replace the current English article which is a mess right now. Back to the Red Cross article. As it is right now, three out of four people object solely or primarily due to size without much significant comments on other issues. I would suggest to cancel the FA nomination and try to find a consensus on the issue of size and possible splitting. I strongly object to splitting (and I would prefer a single coherent article over FA status for several smaller ones) but being a Wikipedian I would accept any solution which is based on consensus or a clear majority. My main reason for keeping this topic within one single article is the following. From my experiences, the vast majority of people who don't have insight knowledge of the Red Cross only vaguely know about something like an "International Red Cross". They don't know that there is the ICRC and the International Federation, what the differences between both organizations are and what they have in common. Somebody who arrives at a seperate article about the ICRC might think "Ah! That's the International Red Cross I heard about on CNN.", as might somebody who reads a seperate article about the International Federation. When in reality, the "International Red Cross" at Guantanamo Bay is the ICRC and the "International Red Cross" in the quake-struck areas of South Asia is the International Federation. Both readers would possibly be misled, and even with "See also" in the end or disambiguation links in the beginning of each article, most people would miss the other half of the story. --<a href="../../../u/w/_/User%7EUW_4989.html" title="User:UW">Uwe</a> 10:12, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your comment on my talk page. Actually, you did nothing wrong with nominating the article, and I very much appreciate the compliment which comes attached to that. What I'm unhappy with is on the one side the current influx of edits into the article from people who introduce POV, misinformation, smattering or other similar chunks which they read somewhere, without having the necessary insight into this complicated topic to do substantial and significant contributions. As we say in Germany, well meant is the opposite of well done. That might sound arrogant but as it is right now, the article is not a stub but quite sophisticated and well researched and has reached a rather mature level. In the process of writing the German counterpart of the article, of which the English version is a translation, I spent about $120 on books and other publications with a total of far more than 2,000 pages, and I spent several months of work to prepare a coherent Wikipedia article from those sources. The other issue I'm still unhappy with is the strict insistence by some on a size "limit" which in reality is nothing more than a recommendation. --<a href="../../../u/w/_/User%7EUW_4989.html" title="User:UW">Uwe</a> 11:08, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I do not feel any obligation to use Christmas as the featured article on December 25 (or, for that matter, any other religious article). I will address the situtation before the article goes live -- however, prior to that, I will use my discretion as I see fit. In this case, I am using my discretion not to condone or encourage the methods I have seen used. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 19:04, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
