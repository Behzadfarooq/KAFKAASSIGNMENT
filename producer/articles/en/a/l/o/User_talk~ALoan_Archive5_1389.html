<p>Hi, just wanted to explain a couple of changes I made to the Bok globules article - just that I removed your line about them being smaller cousins of Giant Molecular Clouds, because I thought it gave the impression that they were the same type of object only smaller, which I think would be a bit over-simplified a description. And I removed the bit about them being roughly spherical - Bok globules are not my field so I don't know if most of them might be, but the ones in the image look distinctly non-spherical to me.</p>
<p>Also I just thought I would say hello to a fellow astronomer, nice to see another one on wikipedia! <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 20:05, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your note. If you were only an astronomer for 3 years then your output was quite impressive - 8 papers? I know people who have been post-docs for years and haven't scraped together that many&#160;:) I see you worked with Ofer Lahav - he's head of my department now.

<p>Hi, ALoan. You found <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colley_Cibber_0789.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>, huh? I wrote the first two thirds of that, Geogre wrote the third third. I know you're not obliged to care, but we'd rather not have it featured. Not right now, at least. I've lost enthusiasm about the FA thing. Remember <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>? You were in a big hurry to nominate it on FAC, way back, because it just had to be feaured on the Main Page as soon as possible? Well, it's still waiting (and if you remember, Raul even wanted to unbold all the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_toilet.html" title="Japanese toilet">really interesting articles</a> so he could recycle them and not have to use the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">boring ones</a>). I'm proud of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, I think it's bloody good, and I'd hate to see a piece of fast-written fluff like <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colley_Cibber_0789.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a> on the Main Page before it, for one thing. There's more—well, I recently explained my problems with the article <b>and</b> with the FAC process in an exchange with <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRiis_d9fa.html" title="User:PRiis">User:PRiis</a>, I'll just refer you to that if that's OK.

Please note especially my argument about how nominating Colley Cibber would be like "disrupting Wikipedia to prove a point"! Anyway, quite apart from the discussion about to FAC or not to FAC, PRiis and I agreed, as you will see, that the article tends to fall into two disparate parts—a Bishonen and a Geogre part—and needs revising on that score. It impressed me that PRiis pinpointed this as a problem without even knowing there were two authors. Geogre is revising it now, working in a text editor. So, could you at least wait a bit, please? (Please note another thing I say to PRiis, also: I like to self-nominate. Again, not something you have to care about. Anybody can nominate anything.) Anyway, thanks for liking it.

I have written a new article on 'fictitious force'. I think it is a fascinating subject, with lots of ramifications. Please check it out.<br />
Is it OK with you if I remove your discussion with William Connolley on fictitious force:Talk? I think the current article answers the questions. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleon_Teunissen_354f.html" title="User:Cleon Teunissen">Cleon Teunissen</a> 09:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi ALoan,<br />
OK, that makes sense: de-cluttering and de-fragmentation not by deleting. I tend to ramble, so often I feel a need to clean my act.<br />
If I move a thread to the archive by way of cut/paste, I can append to the end, maybe insert somewhere if that is better for the chronology.<br />
Your signature is two links: one to your User: page and one to your UserTalk: page, how do you add the link to your talk page? Manually each time? Or is there an option to automate that? <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleon_Teunissen_354f.html" title="User:Cleon Teunissen">Cleon Teunissen</a> 12:10, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aloan - nice to see you around - just to explain why I took out your explicit dates at Buckingham Palace security, I was trying to make that section quite general rather than a catalogue or crime sheet, for that reason I had omitted names as well, but I have left your's in. If you feel strongly that the exact dates should be back then OK I won't revert, but your links do cover them. I just don't want every nutter who has ever held a placard thinking they can have a moment of fame in that section too. The article is too long as it is, and desperately need some pictures of the interior but I don't think they are likely to materialise somehow, not legally anyway. Royalty and ceremonies are not really my thing, but the page was a mess when I found it, and it is quite important with hundreds of links to it, so I took it upon myself to fix it up a little, I suspect though its a page that will be vandalised again and again.

<dd>PS You may have noted there is a secret link in there to fathers4justice, click link on 'single fathers'. I don't think the palace should have links to any political or protest groups, but as a father I do have immense sympathy for those blokes.
<dl>
<dd>PPS do you think its good enough for FA? I expect people would say its too long though, and I don't want to divide it up, there is already stubby page on the <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens_dd60.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> but apart from its address the garden is not particularly noteable, besides which all houses belong with their gardens, the same with the mews, the coaches etc are part of the palace treasures, better to have one good article than three mean little stubs - That's my POV anyway. Also do you think the rooms should have capital letters (ie Green Drawing Room) they do in the ref books I have used, is that right? And finally people will moan abot the HM for Queen at the beginning, and subsequent referals to her as just the Queen, I was aways taught she is referred to as "the Queen", untill she is dead then QEII, and Queen Elizabeth would correctly refer to her mother, or Elizabeth of York. I can just envisage all these problems, would welcome your view <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 14:44, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. we seem to agree. Proteus says The or the Queen are both correct, but The Queen is more correct so I've changed it to that. I've done all I'm going to do there now. I'm only really interested in the architecture of the place (which actually in my POV is crap or more kindly in the words of one eminent architect "street architecture") but its now a page more worthy of the subject than it was before. I'm not going to nominate it for FA because its the sort of page that will attract huge debate, also people will always keep popping in with their own bit of Palace information, and I'm not interested enough to keep changing it for it to remain FA standard constantly, and also I feel strongly it should remain complete, so I'm taking it off my watch list now, and the Brits can do what they like to it - its their palace after all! Glad you think my and Bs articles are interesting, that's kind of you. This was the first and last time I have attempted a "big" page outside architecture <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 16:33, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, thank <b>you</b>, ALoan—I must have fixed that small thing on FAC and peer review about ten times in the past month—it happens a lot, as going with the == obviously comes very easily, it's almost second nature—anyway, that's definitely the first time I got thanked for fixing it!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 15:23, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>... what was much-needed pat on the back. Now I understand what those "stress meters" on user pages are for. Perhaps you could tell how much I was fighting to hold back. I last almost "lost it" a few months back when someone "objected" to the then-excellent "bicycle" article, after five strong "supports", because he didn't "like the picture". Like any editor, I too can be a nit-picker, but unlike some of these bozos I wouldn't let a couple of nits on an otherwise exquisite monkey (tortured metaphor, but I think this is where the expression arose) cause me to kick him out of the zoo. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 23:36, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re your clever comments on the FAC talk page: I considered that maneuver, as well as the sneakier one of mounting "objections to objections" from someone else's computer. I figured it would be more satisfying getting articles to FA status while playing by the (unwritten) rules ... which it is, but you have to put up with a lot of b.s. in the process. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 15:36, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was trying to copy the text and move it to another template, but I accidentally submitted without changing the URL. When I went to revert, you had already fixed it, so I assumed that the request hadn't gone through.</p>
<p>I considered putting the Math COTW in the Wiki mainspace as well, but the UK COTW was in the mainspace, so I left it there.

<p>Thanks for your interest. In addition to the table version (<b>Your changes will be visible immediately</b> text on left, table on right), there are also full-width versions (like the current version, only with more characters, see my edit to the talk page). I'm still interested in pursuing this idea... perhaps the table was too drastic and obtrusive a change, though. A poll or request for comments might work. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 12:12, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
