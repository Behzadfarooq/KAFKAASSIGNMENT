<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Once, a King ruled over a small, yet happy, kingdom. His kingdom had few servants or people living within. In fact, the kingdom was so tiny that it was all but invisible on maps. One night Hanabishi, new to the King's harem, has been called to the King's bedchambers. Initially shy, Hanabishi's innocence immediately charmed the young King's heart, and he offered Hanabishi anything that lay within the walls of the room. Not realizing what they are, Hanabishi chose sugar cubes, since they were so pretty. The next day when Hanabishi returned to his room all of the sugar cubes within the castle were waiting for him. The more Hanabishi ate the sugar cubes, the more he fell in love with his King. Unfortuntately, this peace was not to last, as the King soon started to conquer his neighboring kingdoms, and acquired much wealth, power, and a larger harem. Soon after, the King no longer called on Hanabishi, except on very rare occasions. On each occasion the King treated Hanabishi as if it was the first time seeing him. Eventually the King's army fell, and everyone within the castle retreated, leaving Hanabishi and the King alone. Hanabishi then approached the King, offering him sugar cubes, upon which the King realized the reason he had fought the wars in the first place: to give Hanabishi a better kingdom to live in. Will Hanabishi be able to forgive him and rebuild the kingdom together with his King?</dd>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<dd>Where all of the previous stories had a magical/mystical tone to them, the next two stories are set in a more mundane setting of an everyday school. The story follows Okabe and Hidaka, two school mates, through the initial twinges of love and attraction.</dd>

<dd>Mature Flesh has Okabe confronting his classmate Hidaka over the rumour that Hidaka will have sex with anyone who asks him.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moist Flesh deals with the aftermath of Okabe's request. Okabe, insecure over the rumour that Hidaka will sleep with anyone, overhears Hidaka informing a classmate that he will no longer honor any requests.

</dd>
<dd>He is one of the top students, and is a very sensitive guy. His love for Hidaka drives Okabe to make his strange request. Okabe also has a stubborn side to him, and is considered gruff and sour faced by many of his peers. It is Hidaka's observation that this opinion is untrue that first triggers Okabe's love.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Hidaka</dt>

</dd>
<dd>Hidaka is considered the local Romeo, and is generally nice to anyone he encounters. He is also subject to a rumour amongst the female population that he will sleep with anyone who asks him. Hidaka is also very observant of people's emotions, especially Okabe's, and sees through his initial request to sleep with him.</dd>
