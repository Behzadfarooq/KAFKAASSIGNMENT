<p>Hi</p>
<p>I really like the improvements you have done at John Vanbrugh, changing the headings into sub headings (I didn't know how to do that) Bishonen and I are trying hard to bring what was a poor page up to standard, it was placed on 'featured page' without us knowing, which was flattering , but has put us under stress to finish it.</p>
<p>Castle Howard, Blenheim etc. are intended to be linked when there is more on those pages than there is at JV. which will be very shortly (I hope) at present they are poor stubs, with one photo under copyright review. I really don't think that particular heading is the place to place those links. I have great text chunks removed through shortage of space from JV to dump on those unsuspecting stubs in the near future, which will be edited into half decent pages, could the links wait until then, as at the moment they detract from what is purely an architectural appraisal, rather than article on the place. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 21:49, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I wonder if it will ever be finished anyway, sounds like you had a good stoical education like me. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 22:04, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thankyou for nominating John Vanbrugh, and your very kind words, I hope every one else shares your view. I am a little concerned though about a large gap though that has appeared at Blenheim, and could the pictures not be little larger and flamboyant, this is baroque after all, I'm not too sure how to rectify it myself, I've left a message to this effect on the talk page. Thanks <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 14:25, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Aloan, Please don't think I don't appreciate your efforts on behalf of Bishonen and myself, because I do, really do; but this article is about providing the best information there is - free. It is something, one of the few thing I feel passionate about, most of my pages are sourced from books not readily available, some are even privately published; and God knows where Bishonen is finding that information, its a first for the internet that's for sure. So I will not contemplate John Vanbrugh being dissected, because somebody can't wait 5 minutes for a page to download; at times I use computers older than me (well not quite, but you know what I mean) The whole point is for the information to be there, easily (with patience). Thanks for your help so far <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 20:47, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, ALoan. I noticed there were some page update problems today, after the big Wikipedia read-only thing this morning, so I'm wondering if perhaps that accounts for the strange things that happened at the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> page while I was trying to edit it. What it <b>looks</b> like is that you edited it while my "inuse" tag was on it, removed the tag, and reverted my effortful recoding of the small actor images. (I wanted to get rid of the big ugly frames that were making especially the oval images look bad on the page. I've only just learned how to upload pics at all, and David Remahl had kindly written me a step-by-step guide to follow for this--it took a long time.&#160;:-( ) But I'm assuming you wouldn't do that, at least not without an explanation on the Talk page. Do you think it may have been due to some complicated edit conflict? (I didn't get an edit conflict, but maybe you did?)</p>
<p>Oh, and now I see that a sentence from the lead section has been doubled, also. It appears both in its original place and in the Play section. That probably does mean an edit conflict. I don't understand it, but I'm hoping you do. Can you fix it? Sheesh ... I'm deflated at the poor result of my work today, but I can't believe you'd deliberately remove my inuse tag and invite such a mess.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 16:53, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Could you please write to me on my own page, as I am not Giano and don't get any "New messages" alert when messages appear on his page? Yes, I had gathered that a frame comes automatically when you use a thumbnail. That's the way the images were before I changed them, so I wrote "<b>Re</b>coded actor images to <b>remove</b> clumsy frames" in the edit line, trying to make it clear I was making a change. Four hours with the inuse tag is a lot? I didn't know that, but now I do, it won't happen again. It was the only time I've had for serious editing this whole week, so I indulged myself with the tag (having gotten a nightmare of an edit conflict the last time I tried to do any major edits). I'm sorry if I seemed to be shutting other people out. Please feel free to continue editing today, I have other things to do.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 17:14, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I think I know and am comfortable with the wiki way. I have no objection at all to my text--or rather, text that I've written, I know it's not "mine" once it's been posted--being edited: I'm only trying to help around here, just like you, and I don't think it's fair to cast me as that famous cliché, the editor who jealously guards her "carefully crafted prose". But I think there is also a culture here of discussing changes and especially reverts on article Talk pages.</p>
<p>(Btw, I think you can see in my previous message that I wasn't objecting to that lead section sentence being copied into a different section, merely noting that it now appears twice, which I thought suggestive of an edit conflict accident (?).)</p>
<p>But I regret firing up at what was, after all, an apology. I should have been more gracious. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 18:49, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not surprised that this Wikiproject has been going on without your knowing -- a lot of discussions, agreements etc. take place without many of us knowing about it. I've contributed to WP for about 2 years now, &amp; I'm still surprised at what I find has taken place long after a decision was made.</p>
<p>Anyway ALoan, about the points in your post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concerning your work on <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> (which is badly needed), I've been spending the last few weeks pulling together a list of kings of Ancient Egypt &amp; their reigns per the ideas the few of us have tossed out. It can be seen at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ancient_Egypt_Temp_9198.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ancient Egypt/Temp">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ancient Egypt/Temp</a>. Consider this a "proof of concept", something tangeable that we all know just what we mean by standardizing our names &amp; dates after Ian Shaw's book mentioned above. Unfortunately, there were some issues in adopting that work for our purposes (e.g., holes in the list of rulers, tracking down some well-known alternative transliterations, etc.), so I had to make some modifications. My methodology will be published on the talk page to that article, but my goal was to favor no one interpretation while making the end product as useable as possible.</li>
<li>As for your template, I'm not sure where &amp; how that will fit into Wikipedia. Would you edit a few relevant articles &amp; show us what you intend?</li>
<li>And as for the articles for the dynasties -- you're reading the words of the man who has been writing the content of most of them, &amp; I admit that they are uneven. My primary intent was to simply get some kind of content up (in the hope that material will attract more contributions) &amp; as I proceeded, the standard I began to follow was to (a) include a table of rulers for that dynasty; (b) mention in the article the more important rulers of that dynasty; &amp; (c) try to include some non-political history in the article. I'm sure more needs to be done. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:18, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's probably a good idea to let the discussion due down before doing the move - I think that last comment on the Montreal move came in only a few minutes before you did the move! As discussed in the Talk: page, in almost all cases there's no harm at all in a minor delay. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 16:03, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, you gratuitously changed the format i) without discussing it, and ii) to be different from that specified in the instructions at the top of the page. I really don't like all the extra headers (I know the buy you automatic subect attribution in the log, but the look ugly as all getout), so I propose to revert that. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 16:11, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I replied to your Talk: points over there. As to the other points: Thanks for having good thoughts about my point about disambigs - yes, I know it's not policy (yet&#160;:-), and it will obviously take a while for me to research past discussions, etc, and life of course will go on while I do that. On delay, I don't think I have anything I can usefully add to what I already said on the Talk: page, which is that there's almost always absolutely no harm in waiting a bit, and someone might have a bright idea (e.g. the comments about accents, which were still flying just as you did the move). I'm cautious on RfD (where I do most of the admin grup), and it seems to be fine. If you disklike the new format too, I will <i>definitely</i> revert it (and take care of moving the Montreal discussion, etc, all in one fell swoop) - and grateful thanks!&#160;:-) Actually, RfD seems to have roughly the same level of traffic as RM. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 16:43, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the single headers are definitely an improvement, to the point where it doesn't cause me to grind my teeth!&#160;:-) Honestly, I can't see why you think date headers are more appropriate for RfD, but whatever. I do prefer the dates, probably mostly because I'm so used to RfD, but also because it allows me to quickly scan down, and, without having to grub around the fine print in the entries, see how old they are. Plus to which I just find the bolded titles overstated - I like the understated nature of RfD listings. And they also take a lot less space, too. It's just going to be wierd, going back and forth (as I mentioned, I do most of the lifting on RfD). Maybe the answer is to go back to just RfD, and let you all handle RM.... <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 21:22, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"like" is way too strong a word to use for my attitude to the new headers! I merely said they were an improvement over the previous suggestion, which I really despised! I still prefer the RfD style. And, no, it's not too difficult to follow - we have strict formatting rules (always a blank line beween items, no blank lines between comments on an item) which make it easy to keep straight. Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Redirects_for_deletion&amp;oldid=6712857#October_14" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Redirects_for_deletion&amp;oldid=6712857#October_14" rel="nofollow">this</a> for a recent good example.

<dd>You see that horror all the time and yet you nominated it for FA...? Anyway, no, I hadn't changed the prefs and reloading didn't help, but today the numbers are gone nevertheless. Glad not to have to look at them, but what a weird option that is. Could anybody want to be told "you are now entering the first subsubsubsection of the first subsubsection of the second subsection of the third section" every time they move to a new paragraph? That <b>would</b> make the text seem cumbersome and boring (=too long). I would have tried to come up with a flatter chapter hierarchy if I'd realized some people see numbered headings. But, well, I suppose it doesn't bother people who're used to it.

<p>I don't know anything about SimonP's being asked to stop doing the clearing of VfD/Old, but there were some concerns that I was tangentially a part of. In some cases, usually schools, SimonP was deciding that the consensus wasn't sufficient for a deletion, was removing the VfD header, and restoring the article to a clean space, taking it off the VfD/Old queue. In more than one of those, users had serious questions about the votes that he was counting as "keeps." This reached a critical stage with a number of people going through his previous decisions. I do not know about any requests for him to stop, as I said, but the concerns raised by other users and admins were certainly real. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:13, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I need to decide what to do about this. This guy's request didn't get much support, and most people were against it, but that was before the requestor came up with a long rationale about why it was the right thing. Do you think WP:RM could provide any additional insight on whether this is the right thing? Technically it is a move, so in some sense WP:RM is the right place for it anyway. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 23:38, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I was leaning in the exact same way - since he's unknown, there's no "common" English usage, so with accents would be OK. I would do the move, except that the people who did weigh at in the start said "no", and I'm reluctant to blow them off. Sigh, guess I'll take it up on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_b8b0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia_talk:Naming conventions (use English)</a>, and see if I can get a policy worked out. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 11:20, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Aloan thanks for your vote and copyedit. This on Featured page was a bit os a last minute, spur of the moment decision - where the two images of Stourhead are side by side, do you think one of them needs to go - probably the one that's bent (clearly from a curved book, I mean), when I take it out the text goes funny; whatever it doesn't look too good side by side, and both are not really necessary, just seemed a shame at the time to leave one out!

<dd>Its OK thanks - I think I've fixed it, but making the images smaller, the flaw in the one is less obvious. See what you think. side by side the flaw was very obvious this way, I think, less so 213.122.21.167 16:56, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice to talk about something other than architecture, but would you agree that to the British people, the H of L is now no longer the highest court to which they can in desperation go.

<dd>No inclination at all. Sorry. I come home to sink a bottle of red wine and switch off from that, and play silly buggers on this (planning an National Heritage, is actually is my field - pardon the pun, hence the interest in architecture).
