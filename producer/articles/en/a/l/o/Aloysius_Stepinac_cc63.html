<p>Stepinac was born in the village of Brezarić, in the parish of <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kra%C5%A1i%C4%87.html" title="Krašić">Krašić</a>. He was the fifth of eight children in his peasant family. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> he moved to <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> to study in the classical gymnasium, and graduated in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. Just before his eighteenth birthday he was conscripted into the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_Army_adef.html" title="Austro-Hungarian Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a>, trained and sent to serve on the Italian Front during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> he was wounded in his leg, and captured by the Italians who held him for five months. After the formation of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Slovenes%2C_Croats_and_Serbs_e078.html" title="State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs">State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</a>, he was no longer treated as an enemy soldier, and he instead volunteered for Yugoslav legion that went to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salonica.html" title="Salonica">Salonica</a>. A few months later, he was demobilised and returned home in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>.</p>
<p>For service in the Allied army during WWI, he was awarded the "Star of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e.html" title="Karađorđe">Karađorđe</a>", an award for heroism in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_cd57.html" title="Kingdom of Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>. After the war he enrolled at the faculty of agronomy of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Zagreb_8950.html" title="University of Zagreb">University of Zagreb</a>, but left it after only one semester and returned home to help his father. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, he travelled to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> to begin studying to become a priest, and was consecrated on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>.

<p>He was appointed <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor.html" title="Coadjutor">coadjutor</a> to the see of Zagreb in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, after several other candidates by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XI_7042.html" title="Pope Pius XI">Pope Pius XI</a> were rejected for political reasons. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> Stepinac succeeded Anton Bauer as the archbishop of Zagreb, becoming one of the youngest <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">archbishops</a> in the Church's history, even though he was younger than the prescribed <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_age.html" title="Canonical age">canonical age</a> of 40.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloysius_Stepinac_cc63.html" title="Edit section: World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h2>
<p>Stepinac was the archbishop of Zagreb during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_State_of_Croatia_a8ec.html" title="Independent State of Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (1941-1945). During the earliest days of the installation of the <a href="../../../u/s/t/Usta%C5%A1a.html" title="Ustaša">Ustaša</a> regime, Stepinac, like other influential Croatian leaders (notably <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladko_Ma%C4%8Dek_979c.html" title="Vladko Maček">Vladko Maček</a> of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_Peasant_Party_3b2c.html" title="Croatian Peasant Party">Croatian Peasant Party</a>), supported the demise of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_cd57.html" title="Kingdom of Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> in favor of an independent Croatian state. Stepinac publicly called on the Church to pray for the well being of the new state and for the Lord to fill the leader, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ante_Paveli%C4%87_dbef.html" title="Ante Pavelić">Ante Pavelić</a>, with a spirit of wisdom for the benefit of the nation and so forth. He would soon meet with Pavelić and other Ustaša officials, with some of them on several occasions. His reports to the Vatican about the Independent State of Croatia were also favorable. When Yugoslavia was invaded by the German Army in 1941, Pavelic proclaimed the independent state of Croatia, receiving congratulations from Archbishop Stepinac.</p>
<p>Archbishop Stepinac said this on March 28, 1941, in note of Yugoslavia's early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs:</p>
<p><i>All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, northpole and southpole, never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The schism (Eastern Orthodoxy) is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. Here there is no moral, no principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty.</i></p>
<p>Later, Stepinac started calling on the government officials to stop the persecution of Jews and others. He communicated with the Ustaša leadership after it was known that they were responsible for the concentration camps in <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasenovac_concentration_camp.html" title="Jasenovac concentration camp">Jasenovac</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stara_Gradi%C5%A1ka_concentration_camp_1bb0.html" title="Stara Gradiška concentration camp">Stara Gradiška</a>. His letters included calls to discern people who were allegedly individually responsible for wrongdoings from those who were racially profiled or just held as "hostages"; and requests to make various exceptions for people in mixed marriages and people who converted to Catholicism.</p>
<p>He also used the pulpit to publicly condemn ethnic genocide against persecuted minorities. He has said:</p>
<p><i>“All men and all races are children of God; all without distinction. Those who are Gypsies, Black, European, or Aryan all have the same rights.... for this reason, the Catholic Church had always condemned, and continues to condemn, all injustice and all violence committed in the name of theories of class, race, or nationality. It is not permissible to persecute Gypsies or Jews because they are thought to be an inferior race.”</i></p>
<p>He was also involved directly and indirectly in numerous <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_Righteous_Among_the_Nations_e13b.html" title="Croatian Righteous Among the Nations">efforts to save hundreds of Jews</a>, before and during the war. Dr. Amiel Shomrony alias Emil Schwartz was the personal secretary of Miroslav Šalom Freiberger, the chief <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> in <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. In the actions for saving Jews, Shomrony acted as the mediator between the chief rabbi and Stepinac. He later stated that he considered Stepinac blessed since he did the most and the best he could for the Jews during the war.<sup id="_ref-Ve.C4.8Dernji_list_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ve.C4.8Dernji_list" title="">[1]</a></sup> Reportedly the Ustaša government at this point agitated at the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a> for him to be removed from the position of archbishop of Zagreb.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One of the main issues the Catholic Church in Croatia at the time seems to have had was their lenience towards the fact that the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">religious conversions</a> carried out by the clergy aligned with the Ustaše were merely a part of the persecution scheme aimed at the <i>undesirable</i> minorities — primarily the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serb_Orthodox_bbf8.html" title="Serb Orthodox">Serb Orthodox</a> faithful. Stepinac did not seem to make any public attempts to criticize the government for persecuting the Serbs per se, but he was later quoted as giving out a secret message to the priests that "when this time of madness and savagery passes, those who converted out of their beliefs will remain in our Church, and the rest will, when the danger is gone, return to their own".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloysius_Stepinac_cc63.html" title="Edit section: Post-war period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war period</span></h2>
<p>After the war, the new communist government of Yugoslavia exerted pressure on the Catholic Church in Croatia when on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, Stepinac was arrested and held until <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, when he was released. On June 4th, he met with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josip_Broz_Tito_1011.html" title="Josip Broz Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>, but did not accept the demands of the new regime, which reportedly wanted for the Church to openly accept the Communist rule and to separate itself from the Vatican by founding a <i>"National Serbo-Croatian Catholic Church"</i>. On June 22, the Croatian bishops released a public letter describing injustices and crimes done to them by the new authorities, and in September 1945, a synod of bishops discussed these issues. On October 20, Stepinac published a letter in which he stated that 273 clergy had been killed since the Partisan take-over, 169 had been imprisoned, and another 89 were "missing" and presumed dead. The letter infuriated Tito, who publicly attacked the archbishop for the first time by writing an editorial in the main communist newspaper, accusing Stepinac of "declaring war" on the new Yugoslavia, which caused other media to take his cue. It is clear that it was Stepinac's opposition to Tito and not his record during NDH that condemned him. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milovan_Djilas_6f27.html" title="Milovan Djilas">Milovan Djilas</a>, a communist leader close to the regime said that Stepinac "would certainly not have been bought to trial for his conduct in the war...had he not continued to oppose the new Communist regime." Subsequently, the opposition grew, and on November 4th, Stepinac had stones thrown at him by a mob of Partisans in <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapre%C5%A1i%C4%87.html" title="Zaprešić">Zaprešić</a>. In January 1946, Yugoslavia requested from the apostolic nuncio that the Holy See remove Stepinac from his position as the archbishop, a request that was denied.</p>
<p>By September of the same year, the Yugoslav authorities indicted Stepinac on several issues - <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaboration.html" title="Collaboration">collaboration</a> with the Germans, relations with the nationalist/fascist Ustaša regime of Pavelić, having chaplains in the NDH (Ustasha) army, forceful conversions of Serb Orthodox to Catholicism and defiance of the Yugoslav government. Stepinac was arrested on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18th</a>, 1946 and his trial started on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>.</p>
<p>The authorities held the trial as part of a wider affair of <a href="../../../i/n/v/Involvement_of_Croatian_Catholic_clergy_with_the_Usta%C5%A1a_regime_03df.html" title="Involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustaša regime">involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustaša regime</a>. In the same trial there were former NDH officials convicted and sentenced, including Erih Lisak (sentenced to death) and Ivan Šalić. Altogether there were 16 defendants.</p>
<p>The way trial was conducted was widely criticized by the Catholic Church and many Croatian people. Also Stepinac himself claimed that it was a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_trial.html" title="Show trial">show trial</a>. He gave a 38-minute long speech on October 3rd as part of the fourth day of the proceedings when he stated that his conscience was clear with regard to all of the accusations, and that he did not intend to defend himself or appeal against a conviction - instead, he would take not only ridicule, disdain and humiliation, but also death, for his beliefs. He further stated that he was being attacked in order for the state to attack the Church, that no religious conversions were done in bad faith, and that the military vicariate was created in NDH just like it was in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, to care for the faithful among the soldiers and not for the army itself, nor as a sign of approval of all action by the army. Furthermore, he asserted that he was never an Ustaša and that his Croatian nationalism stemmed from the nation's grievances in the Yugoslav Kingdom, and that he never took part in any anti-government or terrorist activities against the state or against Serbs.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that 260-270 priests were executed by the communist Partisans and deemed these summary death sentences as uncivilized. He also decried the nationalization of Church property - schools, seminaries, orphanages, printing presses, and the prevention of Church activity in education, press, caritative purposes, teaching of religion in school, as well as intimidation and molestation of clergy. He also complained against issues such as atheism, evolution, materialism, and Communism in general.</p>
<p>The Catholic community considered the process to have been entirely tarnished by extorted witness statements, false testimonies and falsified documents. The defence submitted 35 witnesses in favour of Stepinac, but 27 were rejected, and some were even imprisoned by the police in order to prevent their appearance in court. One of the documents introduced as incriminatory evidence at the trial was a letter that Stepinac was alleged to have written to the Pope in 1943, in which he expressed support for the mass conversion efforts of the Independent State of Croatia and for the state itself. Stepinac denied ever having written or signed it, while the prosecutor claimed that a copy with Stepinac's signature on it existed. The letter was accepted as evidence without any further resolution to the dispute.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_11.html" title="October 11">October 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, the court found Stepinac guilty of high <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a>, and given an extended prison sentence (initially 16 years of jail time and forced labor).</p>
<p>The trial was condemned by Vatican. The jury, mostly Catholics who were however close to the Tito communist rulership, that had sentenced Stepinac for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> had been excomunicated by Pope.</p>
<p>Alojzije Stepinac served five years in the <a href="../../../l/e/p/Lepoglava.html" title="Lepoglava">Lepoglava</a> prison before, under strong pressure from <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Vatican</a> and as a reconciliatory measure by Tito's government, the sentence was commuted to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_arrest.html" title="Home arrest">home arrest</a> in Krašić, to where he was transferred on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>. The government made it clear that they wanted him to retire in Rome, but Stepinac refused to leave his country, saying: "They will never make me leave unless they put me on a plane by force and take me over the frontier. It is my duty in these difficult times to stay with my people."</p>
<p>On November 29, 1952, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a> announced the list of newly created cardinals which included Stepinac, a move which caused <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tito.html" title="Tito">Tito</a>'s government to break diplomatic relations with Vatican on December 17, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, Stepinac was diagnosed with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polycythemia.html" title="Polycythemia">polycythemia</a>, a rare blood disorder. Seven years later, he died of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrombosis.html" title="Thrombosis">thrombosis</a> at the age of 61. His condition was considered to have been exacerbated by his imprisonment (he was not treated in a real hospital but instead only in the house; also, reportedly an official autopsy revealed traces of poison in his blood, and this was covered up, but the body was not available for independent investigation). He was buried in the cathedral in Zagreb with Tito's permission.</p>
<p>All of these circumstances caused a part of public opinion (especially in Croatia) to refer to Stepinac as a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyr</a>, although it is not clear whether he was directly killed, it was clear that he suffered greatly. The reference to martyrdom was also made by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> when he <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatified.html" title="Beatified">beatified</a> Stepinac. The Pope used the following words: <i>One of the outstanding figures of the Catholic Church, having endured in his own body and his own spirit the atrocities of the Communist system, is now entrusted to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of martyrdom.</i> <a href="http://hissheep.org/catholic/who_will_be_the_next_saint.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hissheep.org/catholic/who_will_be_the_next_saint.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In 1984, the large population of Croatians who had immigrated to Cleveland, Ohio built a Croatian American Home named after Stepinac. Croatians from all parts of Ohio gather here for Croatian Events. A gigantic statue of Archbishop Stepinac was placed in the hallway of the Croatian Home. The Croatian American Lodge is located in Eastlake, Ohio</p>
<p>A Catholic High School in White Plains, New York (USA) is named for Archbishop Stepinac. The facility includes a shrine featuring a bust of Cardinal Stepinac by the Croatian artist <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Me%C5%A1trovi%C4%87_7938.html" title="Ivan Meštrović">Ivan Meštrović</a>.</p>
<p>The beatification in 1998 infuriated many Serbs and aroused much controversy among foreign Jews. Croatian Jews did not oppose beatification, as they had experienced support from Stepinac during WW II. The <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center_2b98.html" title="Simon Wiesenthal Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> however asked for the beatification to be at least postponed pending further investigation into his affairs related to the Second World War, despite the fact that the Vatican investigates all beatification cases intentively.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">February 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_Parliament_1112.html" title="Croatian Parliament">Croatian Parliament</a> symbolically condemned the 1946 court decision and the process that led to it, predictably amid Serb protests. However, verdict has not been challenged nor overturned on the court (even between 1997. and 1999. when that was possible by Croatian laws). Cardinal Stepinac was unsuccessfully recommended on two occasions by two individual Croatian Jews to be added to the list of <a href="../../../r/i/g/Righteous_Among_the_Nations_2914.html" title="Righteous Among the Nations">Righteous Among the Nations</a>. One of those Croatian Jews, Dr. Amiel Shomrony, has recently blamed this failure on the Serbian lobby, claiming it was preventing the inclusion of Stepinac into Vad Yashem's Righteous list.<sup id="_ref-Ve.C4.8Dernji_list_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ve.C4.8Dernji_list" title="">[1]</a></sup> Esther Gitman, a Jew from Sarajevo living in the USA who holds a PhD on the subject of the fate of Jews in the Independent State of Croatia, said that Stepinac did much more for Jews than some want to admit.<sup id="_ref-Ve.C4.8Dernji_list_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ve.C4.8Dernji_list" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, the requests were denied because the proposers were not <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivors themselves, which is a requirement for inclusion in the list, and also simultaneous collaboration or a close link with the fascist regime would preclude listing, according to a statement made by a <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yad_Vashem_56e6.html" title="Yad Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> spokesperson.</p>
