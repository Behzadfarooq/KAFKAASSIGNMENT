<p><i>Apologies for eavesdropping. As you say above, the {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">featured</a>}} template really tells you when a page was promoted to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">"featured article"</a> status, and provides a link to the <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> dicussion. There may be some benefit in modifying {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">featured</a>}} to record the date of promotion, if only sliently (although this should already be implicit from the history of the relevant talk page, when {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">featured</a>}} was added), but I'm not sure it is a good idea to modify the existing {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">featured</a>}} template to add the date of an article being a "main page" feature. Again, this is implicit in the article's history, since there will be a slew of anonymous edits on that day, but many featured articles have not yet been on the main page. However, I can see the benefit in having a note on the talk page, if only for historical reasons. One solution would be to add a new template, say {{featuredmainpage}}, which links to the relevant entry in <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article">Wikipedia:Today's featured article</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 11:03, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</i> <small><i>Posted at <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">User talk:Rick Block</a></i></small></p>

<li>No apologies necessary and welcome to the conversation. One of the incidents which led me to this proposal was the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article. It was not trivial to determine that this article was promoted to <i>Featured</i> status on 4 February 2005 and that still didn't tell me when it hit the <i>Main page</i> (18 March 2005).

OK - If you went through all of that because you had a reason to know those dates, the date of the promotion, or the date of <i>Main page</i> exposure, or the evolution of the article between and since those dates then you may wonder why you had to go through such a convoluted process to get those dates. Was it last month or last year? All we're trying to do is to get those dates documented in such a way as to make them brilliantly obvious, and not hidden in the obscure folds of the <i>Page history</i> or <i>Archives</i> or well .... you know what I mean. Those dates are majestically important to the hard working editors who raised the article to these pinnacles (0.1% of all articles). I just don't understand why there is <i>any</i> reluctance to recognize those achievements. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 19:34, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I ask you to pull back this outcome for a short time. I'm now reasonably sure this was never properly designated a featured article, and the designation was added incorrectly.

<p>I'm familiar with the material you pointed on my talk page. As far as I could tell -- and running through the successive edits is a very time-consuming process -- this was the last article promoted in that fashion, and apparently was done so after that procedure was supposed to have been terminated. I also think it evaded the seconding requirement, by having two collaborative authors acting in concert, without any support from non-authors. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 17:51, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments on my work on lists of Ministers. I've been working on a range of these, eg adding the list of Parliamentary Secretaries at <a href="../../../u/n/d/Under-Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies_1ff3.html" title="Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies">Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>. I don't have access to a comprehensive list, unfortunately, so have been working backwards from the 1830-1935 ministries available at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_Governments_6680.html" title="List of British Governments">List of British Governments</a>. One of the main sources quoted there is D. Butler and G. Butler, Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900-2000, which I assume will have lists post-1935. I hope to lay my hands on a copy. As for the format, you are correct that the various Secretaries to the Treasury held office consecutively (in the main), so to follow the existing format of the page there should be end dates - I will add these. There doesn't seem to be a consistent style for these pages at present.--<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Burgess_ecd1.html" title="User:George Burgess">George Burgess</a> 09:41, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wanted to avoid pointing this out explicitly to avoid acrimony, but since you charged me with "gaming" the system, I'll do it here, where it's not so obtrusive. The self-nominating editor implied she wasn't going to bring back the candidacy for a while on the FAC page, then said so pretty explicitly on the peer review page. Then did minor (adding a few superficial paragraphs, but minor) work and renominated it the next day. I think you're way off base in criticizing me (or anybody) who assumes good faith in an editor and ends up being hoodwinked. It would have taken user:Toothpaste about two minutes to drop notes on the talk pages of the editors who took the time and trouble to comment on her proposals. She didn't even put the appropriate notice on the talk page for the article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 17:59, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, sorry - using IE and the classic skin, the original {{7break}} was virtually invisible in the table (I see you have now replaced it with an explicit "colpan" rather than a template). Is the idea to have an empty box, so simply doubling the width of the lines separating the box in the table? I thought the "&amp;nbsp;" thickness looked fine - does it look too thick for you?

<p>Hi, ALoan. Well, at least I blocked the account (just the name, not the IP) indefinitely a few minutes after they'd nominated <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longsight.html" title="Longsight">Longsight</a> yet again! I didn't notice the renomination, or I might have left the autoblocker to it, but I'm so tired of the collateral damage nightmares one keeps running into. Sometimes I think I've got the only static IP on the wiki. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:37, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your note on my userpage. It could go either way - but it's an annoyance sometimes having to go to others to do administrative stuff to do with the cricket pages I write, so I'll give it a bash. I've started Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/jguk, it only needs a nominator and a start/end date to be added - but it you have suggestions as to how to better word the answers before it goes live, let me know. Probably best to start it around going to bed US time (waking up UK time), to allow UK users first shot.

<p>Unrelated comment, probably: Just for the record, I have nothing against cricket. I have something only against an article per match of <i>any</i> sport. It's not an issue of information, either, but of granularity. Imagine every baseball game in a year. (There are 160 games played by each team. There are about 25 teams.) Now for the next year. Now for the next. Now for the next. Now for last year, since it's not here. Etc. The fact that consensus, and some loudmouths like me, were against it shouldn't have meant gaming or circumventing them. The fact that the attempt was made <i>does</i> make me fear that a person will then abuse powers when his or her interests or loves are inflamed on the next issue. If there weren't so much trouble with Tony Sidaway and Ed Poor, perhaps I wouldn't go to "oppose" but rather question the candidate privately. However, my opposition is based on going around the rules in the interests of one's passions, not the passions themselves. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:56, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I swore that the next person who invoked wp:iar would be tracked down and get punched in the nose by me, so now I have to.</p>
<p>I got nothing against the guy, and I loved <i>Night Watch,</i> but the seedling of "an article per cricket match ad infinitum" can next be "I have deleted the parts of your project page that didn't belong, undeleted all the deletes of the day because they were bad speedies, and I will not use VfU or RfC because those don't apply to administrators." There is another RFA there that I was highly, highly suspicious of. I'd almost like to see a form question for anyone who says "VfD" in their "why I wanna be an admin" thing: "The vote is 5D and 5K on Racism in Ireland. What do you do?" Then follow that with "What is your threshold for consensus on delete votes?" Anyone who says, "Remove the VfD tag and celebrate" for the former and "80%" for the latter is out, in my book, as I think there are some folks really, really wanting to overcome lack of consensus for their vision of the rules by acting out of process. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:52, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that IAR is, in its authorship and intent, not bad. I read it as a variant on "Don't be a dick," as it basically says, "Don't lawyer or insist on a new policy for every disagreement." However, it is cited precisely in the context of "I do what I want because rules are the tether of lesser mortals." Thus, I don't want to punch the <i>authors</i> of wp:iar, but those who cite it once per quarter hour as they are being asked why they undeleted out of process or deleted out of process or violated the 3RR. That's why, once upon a session, I announced that it was the <i>next</i> person who'd get the sock in the nose.</dd>
<dd>The final dispensation of the cricket season doesn't bother me, either. It's fine. However, it seems to me that a match-by-match <i>article</i> is a monstrous thing, and that's where we were while the season was underway. If the intent from the start had been to get the documentation and then add into a big merge, then user space would have been the way to go, and I'd have had nothing to say, but the matter came up on two or three VfD's. By the second already, and then by the third, the "keep" rationale was, "There's a <i>Project</i> for the cricket season, so nothing can be VfD'd." Projects are not invisible armor, and there was a playing of "This is the WikiCricket Project (notice the official name), so be awed and cowed into silence" on the vote.</dd>
<dd>As for the answer you offered to the two hypotheticals, 5D 5K on Racism in Ireland (although the vote would probably actually be 65D 22K 9M with 35 suspect votes) should, in my opinion (and by former practice) result in sending the article to a Request for Comment or should get it tagged with a disputed tag. In other words, it shouldn't just be "kept" with nothing else happening, as it has proven to be an article that deeply divides the community, and the aggregate opinion (not "consensus") is that the article is suspicious. I.e. the result should not be "remove the tag or delete the article," in my opinion, but "address the issues that got the thing listed so it doesn't become a festering sore that will result in a renomination to VfD or a triumphalist campaign by its author to write 100 more just like it or worse and cite its passage as precedent." A divisive VfD is not a seal of approval, but a sign of something desperately needing work. As for the second question, I think deletion should take place at 2/3rd majority. I only have that because that's what US law has used for its second-level opinion threshold (overriding a veto, amending the constitution, etc.).</dd>
<dd>The reason I'd personally like to see more articles go is that I'm an elitist, but it has nothing to do with why I'd like to see people "close" VfD only if they plan to work their rears off on most keeps and why I'd like to see "consensus" eliminated as the word we use and set the bar at 66%. The reason for these latter positions is that we are a <i>tertiary source of information.</i> Encyclopedias are inherently conservative and don't have content that isn't derived from people who derive the information from scholars who derive it from primary sources. If our voters are proper voters and split over an article, we can't just say that article is fine for failing to reach some lofty standard of unanimity of votes. Similarly, a vote that has the community in knots is probably not so well established and clear to be well placed in an encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>This isn't just philosophy, though. Folks have taken "OMG You deletionist troll" to heart and are now actually seeing the world only in terms of "absolute nonsense, which can be deleted, and everything else, which must not be deleted, no matter what." They're working on Everything2, IMO, and not any sort of encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:23, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your tweaking of my edits; I'm about to do a few final adjustments. I was motivated to fix them up by the poor quality of many of the nominated articles. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 06:57, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS I'm a little concerned about the criterion for referencing facts. Some Wikipedians may be confused as to how dense referencing should be, and where the boundary lies between the need to reference, the grey area in the middle, and the need to leave unreferenced. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 07:08, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would consider it important. 800x600 is the standard web resolution, and it is annoying to see the horizontal scrollbar appear. With the scrollbar, the table looks badly formatted, I have to scroll to the right each time I have need check out the dates of the hat-tricks. The periodic table is an exception, that thing just can't be represented vertically. How about merging the test &amp; innings columns together?

<dd>OK got it. In putting the template on retroactively I <i>was</i> doing MONTH DAY which works fine. Last night however I was invoking with DAY MONTH which isn't fine. The reason for my switching formats was to remind me of when the template was being used to replace the FA date statement (before there was a template). There is no problem with going <i>back</i> and changing the DAY MONTH input sequence but I don't know to enforce this requirement with future users. --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 15:28, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would not wish to invent it. Thank you &lt;said stonily&gt; ALoan for your valued input here. Before you even think, have the slightest inkling, or brain murmur. to even hint at this on Palazzo Pitti FAC (which any second NOW will become a FA) I suggest (strongly) you keep your thoughts to yourself. Do you have a family pet ALoan? a sweet little terrier perhaps, a darling little kitten, or even a horse, with a very big HORSE'S HEAD........well that's nice you take good care of them, accidents do happen so easily. Kindliest regards <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Il Siciliano</a></p>
<p>PS: Did you notice in the page (not that I bothered to read it) referred to Palazzo Pitti, not Pitti Palace. Oh and " Ritirata della Granduchessa" does not mean "Lavatory of the Grand Duchess" as your article states but "withdraw of the Grand Duchess", ie Withdraw as in Drawing Room. Not as a method of contraception or anything else remotely lavatorial, which is a subject I strongly frown upon. Whatever it is your Royal family gets up to in their Drawing Rooms I can assure you the Italian do not! Just heed my advice ALoan, I notice above your interest in obituaries - that's nice &lt;said kindly&gt;</p>
