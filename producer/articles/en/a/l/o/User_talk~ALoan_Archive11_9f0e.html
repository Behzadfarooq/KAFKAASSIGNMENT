<p>I want to be clear that, 1. I mean no insult to anyone who works on these subjects. Some of the people, notably you, approach such subjects with all the care that any scholar approaches the driest of textual editions; 2. I try to live within the rules, and so, if the guidelines say "you can't object because of the subject matter," I don't, and that's why I have only entered the lists when the content has put such enormous restrictions on the article that it fails FAC in some other way; 3. I'm not interested in fighting the "delete the cruft" battle, especially there; 4. I know that it's a matter of <i>some</i> perspective (one person's fascination with dead land surveyors vs. another person's fascination with choo-choo trains vs. another person's fascination with a pivotal fiction in his or her life), but I hope that all sides can agree that it's not <i>just</i> a matter of perspective, that there are ways of marking observable lines between rich and poor veins in the mine to strike. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:40, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, ALoan, it's nice of you to take care of the referencing system for Giano's master pugilist/murderer/homicide victim, but I'm a bit worried about the look of the thing now. Are you sure that heavy peppering of non-consecutive note numbers throughout the text, and that non-alphabetical reference list, are an acceptable price to pay for doing without a separate list of footnotes? (The one I started has disappeared.) It sure wouldn't be in an academic text, in fact I've <i>never</i> seen non-consecutive note numbers used anywhere else than at Wikipedia. They're weird and distracting AFAIC. Note, also, that having a separate note list would enable the references list to be just as concise as yours, only a lot easier to find your way about in, because it could be alphabetical, as well as being without that distracting abc effect. (I'm writing to you rather than Giano because he's always letting it be understood that he's too soulful to discuss footnotes.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ノート</a> 18:56, 2 March 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, well, I removed the separate lists because the footnotes ended up containing most of the references anyway - they could be separated out again. The note numbers are in numerical order - that is how footnotes usually work, no? I see what you mean about alphabetical references, though, but I'm not sure what can be done about that. I'm sorry you don't like it&#160;:( -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:26, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They're in numerical order in the list at the bottom of the page, you mean? Sure. I meant that in the text, the note numbers go 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, and so on. That's what I'm not happy to see; I like to see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Also, I like to see fewer note numbers in the text. Did you notice my suggestion, when I started the two separate lists, that they would make it possible to cut down on the number of notes in the text quite drastically (by replacing them with parenthetic references or just mentions, of, say "Anderson", since the link to Anderson's text is in the references list, and easy to find because alphabetized)? IMO it's <i>in the text</i> that an excess of notes are distracting, ugly, giving an off-putting faux-learned appearance, and so on; the reader-friendliness of the text, that the reader will actually read, is a bigger deal than the length of the lists at the bottom of the page, that readers are free to ignore, and that many probably will be happy to ignore. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ノート</a> 09:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Well, I suppose it depends on whether you think the superscipt numbers are footnotes or citation of references. If they are footnote, then yes they should go in ascending numerical order (1, 2, 3, etc). But if they are citations of references, and the same reference is cited more than once, then surely (IME) you should use the same reference each time (1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, etc), no? Perhaps Harvard style would be better, although I'm not sure how you cite a website in Harvard style. I understand where you are coming from, though...-- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:46, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Probably Geogre's - I always have assumed they were a cynical view of the moires and behaviour of upper class behaviour of that time. I expect impoverished earls did marry their sons to the daughters of tradespeople and the like, but the daughters as bourgeois would have been less likely to tale lovers than genuine members of the upper classes. So I would think the first half of the story arranging the marriage and it's subsequent unhappiness is possibly based on something the artist knew of, but the second with the lover, hanging and suicide were wishful thing on Hogarth's apart; also I think as in other upper class culture of Europe while the husband could be unfaithful, the wife usually had to have a couple of legitimate children before she started producing cuckoos. Hogarth's couple had not yet had children. That's my view. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 13:12, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, ALoan, I don't mean to go on about it, but if you're interested you can see a concrete example of what I consider the advantages of having both a "Footnotes" and a "References" section in <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897_30ad.html" title="S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897">this new article</a>. Note the consecutive footnotes throughout the article, and the alphabetical references list. See also how I keep down the number of footnotes by a "covering" note to the first sentence of a section whenever posssible. You like it?

<p>Is now in main space (complete with the amazing foot note system!) It's not been completed to the standard I would have liked, but there was not a lot more I could find out about him, in fact I think this is probably the most complete page anywhere - so it will have to do, perhaps someone somewhere out there can add more.

<p>I am of course indebted to you, and defer your superior knowledge on this most complex of subjects. However, learned as you are I fear you are taking an over simplified view or the matter, I will take little pleasure in seeing that so very publicly proven. In Wiki language on your own head be it!. Now I'm off to take my delightful family out for an exorbitantly priced Mothering Sunday lunch. It will be a painful experience for all, one is in the States, so it's mother is already sad. One is sullen because it's had to cancel a rugby match to attend. The other will be objectionable because skinless sausages (its staple diet) will not be on the menu, and the last will doubtless scream the entire time and embarrass us as the English don't really like children out in public.

<p>I've gone over some of the text now -- all piddly little things, really -- but I thought I'd express here what I don't want to express in an FAC vote. The report on the encyclical itself is quite full, with perhaps an overbalance toward excerpts from the text, but what's missing from my ("context! context! context!") point of view is reaction or effect of the encyclical. If a paragraph on reception, interplay, and effect of the enyclical were added, it would balance out somewhat the quotations and place the object in a wider context. I know that the vulgar were all abuzz over how the document wasn't what they'd expected (what they expected differed), but those folks are hardly worth crediting (the news reporters, I mean). In the months that have followed, though, have there been implications (the rulings on homosexual seminarians, for example) or reactions? Does it indicate a pendulum swing from the farthest anti-Liberation Theology position that Ratzinger took when he castigated Ramirez? Has there been more on social justice's divisibility from charity? Hasn't anyone asked <i>how</i> you can love the poor and not struggle to see those who wound them removed from power? That kind of thing.... Any of that would be a corrective to the quotations. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:32, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, thanks for looking. To be honest, I nominated it just as a toe in the water - if it swims, great; if not, never mind. I agree that the article is begging for some reaction / implications / support / criticism, but I am not sure if there has been much citable reaction yet. Give it another year or two and we shall see. I am also a little uncomfortable with the quotations (see the talk page) - the rest is mine, but the quote were added by someone else. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:03, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't the vaguest where it is. This is a problem, because I got the information from Howson and from (ick!) David Nokes. Gerald Howson isn't that interested in Sheppard, specifically, and a lot of prisons went by multiple names. If your source in the Sheppard article is solid, use it over anything gotten from Nokes, especially, as Nokes's skills as an editor are called into question a hundred different ways. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:48, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

There were plenty of "New Prisons" in London later (Newgate was rebuilt; Bridewell too; Holloway; Pentonville, etc...) but they are too late for Sheppard.

<p>References added. I <i>really</i> need (or someone really needs) to (re)-read <i>Albion's Fatal Tree.</i> It's fairly popular fare, but it's good, solid scholarship on how the condemned were treated. Also, before stumbling away from the Sheppard article altogether, here are sources the <i>DNB</i> authors used:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Daniel Defoe?) <i>The history of the remarkable life of Jack Sheppard</i> 1724</li>
<li>Two more anonymous pamphlet lifes.</li>
<li><i>Applebee's Original Weekly Journal</i> (certainly by Defoe), July-November 1724</li>
<li>1933 H. Bleackley and S. M. Ellis, <i>Jack Sheppard.</i></li>
<li>Gerald Howson on Wild (already cited).</li>
<li>P. Rawlings. <i>Drunks, whores and idle apprentices: criminal biography in the 18th century.</i> 1992.</li>

<p>Thanks for expanding this article. I see you changed some of the names of members back to how a previous editor had written them. Some things such as including the titles "Mr", "Ms", and whether or not to use commas between postnominals is a matter of personal preference, so I won't revert those. However, why should "Mr Justice" be linked when there is no article on that? Please only link it again if you intend to write an article. Instead, I've linked it to the High Court section of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judiciary_of_England_and_Wales_0c05.html" title="Judiciary of England and Wales">Judiciary of England and Wales</a> which explains it. The same goes for <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Law_Society_e873.html" title="President of the Law Society">President of the Law Society</a>. There are too many red links on that page anyway. As for "Baroness Usha Prashar", that's simply an incorrect form of address.

<li>Thanks for the FAC vote. I only noticed it this afternoon - the page is now firmly re-launched, I really hope for the original crew it succeeds, there is something very worthwhile about undertaking such a mammoth translation. Working on it has negated my guilt for never undertaking anything similar - but God it is such a boring laborious job - I admire anyone who can do it for more than half an hour. It sounds daft but I can't think in two languages at once, so no matter how fluent one is the task, for me, becomes no easier.

<dd>Hi - I could not see much point <b>bold</b>ing, for example, Lara's 400* - that record is not going to change. He may score another 400+, but that 400* is never going to get any bigger. Before I started, Lara was not emboldened in the "Most runs in an over" section (nor indeed was Shahid Afridi) and I thought that made sense - perhaps I have made a mistake, but I thought we should only put a person's records that could change in <b>bold</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 10:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Howdy, sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I wasn't watching your talk... Mmmm... now I get what you did. However, don't you think it would be better simply to bold all players who are currently active? Could possibly be confusing otherwise (someone might wonder why Lara is bolded in one place but not another). That said, this isn't too important so if you wanna keep it your way, feel free.

<dd>Well, do we use bold to draw attention to current players simply because they are current players and so may extend existing records or add new ones, or to draw attention to records that may change?

<dd>Sorry, I didn't think of the arrow being useful on the sub-pages. I made a change to the sub-template to show the arrow for various sub-pages, but there are always going to be sub-sub-sub pages which it won't take into account.

<p>Hi. I've been a quiet admirer of the good work you've been doing for quite a while now, but I'm not convinced that your change in this instance is an improvement, because to move a name from one column to another now takes two edits instead of one.

<p>Hi there. I noticed you've created <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Oaksey_7e04.html" title="Lord Oaksey">Lord Oaksey</a> as a redirect to the first Baron.

<dd>Hi - I am just populating some redirects for <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Lords_263d.html" title="Law Lords">Law Lords</a> from articles on legal cases. Chances are that a reference to Lord Oaskey will be to the first Baron, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Lawrence%2C_3rd_Baron_Trevethin_and_1st_Baron_Oaksey_3278.html" title="Geoffrey Lawrence, 3rd Baron Trevethin and 1st Baron Oaksey">Geoffrey Lawrence, 3rd Baron Trevethin and 1st Baron Oaksey</a>, who was a judge at the Nuremburg trials and later a Law Lord, rather than the rather less well-known John Geoffrey Tristram Lawrence, 4th Baron Trevethin and 2nd Baron Oaksey, who is a redlink.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most Law Lords are life barons, so it is not a problem, but I don't have a strong opinion on where the redirect should go for the hereditary ones.What about <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Buckmaster_d19c.html" title="Lord Buckmaster">Lord Buckmaster</a>? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 11:59, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In that situation, I'd probably have piped them to the appropriate person rather than redirecting, but I'll take your word for it that one Lord is much the most notable. --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 09:04, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, no doubt piping is the right thing to do (I know some people runs bots for that sort of thing) but I think it helps to create the redirects to pick up plain links in other articles or to help people find the article when they are searching.

<p>Thank you for your comments. I have consistently found the worst weak link in Wikipedia are inaccurate timelines which often either misstate or place opinions in the story. The timeline is a *****VERY***** effective to notice these mistakes at a glance (parituclarly in controversial areas). Once the timelines are accurately established folks can revert back to the conventional paragraph articles. Many of my corrections adopt this approach which involve some VERY controversial topics (e.g., Vietnam).</p>
<p>The timeline is very much in play in comparison to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_Memorial_7d70.html" title="World Trade Center Memorial">World Trade Center Memorial</a>. I believe that stories where I've gone to the trouble to contribute timelines (which take a suprising amount of time) greatly contribute to the accuracy.</p>
<p>As regards to the sandbox comments, welcome to the world of wiki! I focus on content. I thank the folks who contribute format corrections. If I see a bunch of corrections by a contributor I assume they are reviewing and then re-reviewing and then re-re-reviewing their comments. I wish I could get it right the first attempt. But my corrections sometimes occur over several hours (days).<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 03:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, I guess so—I'm going to reevaluate it and try to figure out what it's missing. Going for three and a half days without comment while the nomination right above it got half a dozen posts suggests that there's more to be done. If it would have succeeded, the votes likely would have been along the lines of "well, I guess it's ok", not "wow, what a great list", which is what I would want.

<p>Greeting ALoan, I came across the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> article recently and was shocked to realize we have only one huge article to describe the whole Movement. You and the other editors have done a great job, the article is terrific, but I think it should be split -- or maybe "create subsidiaries" is a better term.</p>
<p>We can certainly keep one unified article that discusses the braoder Movement and the relationship between all of its parts. But, we should also have subsidiary main articles as well. Users shouldn't have to comb through the huge Movement article to glean bits of information about, say, the ICRC. I think the <a href="../../../i/c/r/ICRC_e559.html" title="ICRC">ICRC</a> in particular screams for a separate article, plus probably the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_Federation_86c4.html" title="Red Cross Federation">Red Cross Federation</a> and even some national chapters if some industrious editors are willing to write it. I've only read Forsythe's two books about the ICRC, but I'd like to start the the subsidiary articles and hopefully get your help. If you know anyone else who's passionate about the subject, sign them up as well. Thanks - <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraeco_17e8.html" title="User:Draeco">Draeco</a> 01:19, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mrs Becket owes all the British farmers millions of pounds which she should have paid to them in Feb/March. now they are all overdrawn at the bank paying interest while Mrs Beckett has skipped off as Foreign secratatry. The money - where is it I ask. The NFU (<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Farmer%27s_Union_9119.html" title="National Farmer's Union">National Farmer's Union</a>) had put her on notice they were to call for her resignation. She, Lord Bach and Lord Titty and other high ranking people at DEFRA all have to appear before a special investigative committtee at Westminster to say why the farmers have not been paid. But now she is Foreign Secratary she cannot resign as DEFRA Secratary of State so another imminent scandal has been avoided - very neat you see.

<p>What sort of social rank would one have to bear in their family, in order to be a descendent of either?</p>
<p>How far up the totem pole, would you say?</p>
<p>This is intended to have broad answers and based on gradients of time and population, not going into specifics about exact descendents. About how common is their descent in the English or British genepool today?</p>
<p>I've noticed that American Presidents don't descend from either king, but the most common recent royal ancestor shared by many of us is Edward III. How common is it for anybody in the English or British genepool, to have a Protestant royal ancestor?</p>
<p>There is a general cutoff, isn't there?</p>
<p>Is it because of fratricide in the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors' "new men", or the Union of the Crowns, or the parliamentary union under Queen Anne (I can't think of any non-royal family descent from the Hanoverians within the UK)?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that there is a big difference between Plantagenet and Tudor descents, that the commons in all likelihood have the former and the latter is held by the lords. (just generally speaking) Then again, Tudor descent in the Welsh must be higher in general. I am further curious about pre-Royal Tudor blood in Anglo-British people today, since the status and/or concept of Welsh royalty/nobility is rather hazy in my mind. I found the Blevins aka Ap Bleddyn family of Powys in my ancestry, but have no real idea on what to make of it--or any other Welsh "native aristocracy". I might be able to find Stewart descent somewhere, from way back when. What percentage of Hanoverian background do you think that German colonists had in America?</p>
<p>On the British side, I have to go as far back as Welf himself...but any recent genetic relationship with the Hanoverians or the counts of Nassau are completely obscure. How does one research those other colonial people, such as the Hessians?</p>
<p>UK genealogy is relatively easy when focusing on English (and French) ancestries. What would a "national person" of Jerusalem (or Antioch, for example) in Crusader times be known as?</p>
<p>We say "American" for those Founders, but was there such a nationality-term for the Crusaders in their own domains?</p>
<p>I guess the term is supposed to be Levantine/Outremer, or "Crusader" as our national heritage says "Colonist"...</p>

<p>hi, i see that the "good article" spam has been put back in <a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">Template:featured</a> despite objections from several users. this seems to be the way the GA project works: boldly putting something into a page that doesnt want it, then claiming consensus is required to *remove* it again (consensus is never required to put it there in the first place).</p>
<p>this is exactly the same behaviour as witnessed on the attempt to create an article space "good article" star, which i &amp; raul654 finally managed to have deleted (a huge effort since they had already spammed a 1000 articles with it), and on the Community Portal where this non-policy wikiproject has pride of place - its apparently far more important than any of the other dozens of collaborations!</p>
<p>they even had the cheek to remove the "non-policy process" template from the top of their project pages claiming they now had "enough support to be policy" - this is despite clear consensus on the talk page that its NOT policy. an attempt to put it back was quickly removed.</p>
<p>i would appreciate any comments on the template's talk page. i'm really fed up with fighting these GA spam battles everywhere, its quite tiring. why do they have to constantly spread their GA spam everywhere? hope you can help! <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzzzz_e5d0.html" title="User:Zzzzz">Zzzzz</a> 09:45, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did the first scan of plate one just to illustrate Charteris, and to use as a joke various places, so I intentionally cropped it. I'll do a full high res scan a bit later and upload it, so pretty soon the image <i>will</i> show the clergyman, as well as the housewife doing her washing (who stands as a moral opposite to Moll, both in terms of profession and in plate 5's clothing metaphor). Moll can choose between her right (dull wifeliness) and her left (whoring), her dexter and sinister. I will also add some of the literary analogs, if necessary. (The plot is similar to Moll and Roxana's lives, from Defoe, but there were numberless whore fictions coming out of Curll's shop -- all of which for pornographic purposes.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:29, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I put back in everything except for the Stalin reference, that was just seeming to me stupid and inlammatory. There are already numerous references to the eroding of civil liberties and democracy, without bringing Stalin into it. Also I removed the Hitler reference for the same reasons.

<dd>Dick Rock looks good ("My new band is classic Dick Rock"), although I'll see if DNB has anything more to add, or different to add. No doubt someone wants to make the point that Hogarth didn't like foreigner doctors. I know you were reading a source that was trying to rehabilitate both of them, but they did both outrage the public. Otherwise, they couldn't have been satirized so consistently or effectively. The moderately innocent get by with only one whipping. Misaubin gets several. Anyway, I'm also going to see if Mother Needham and/or Mock Hackabout have entries. For that matter, I'm still looking for a "famous" whore Brewley or Bewley from the 1680's (for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gould_0115.html" title="Robert Gould">Robert Gould</a>'s satire on woman).

<dd>Ok, <i>DNB</i> struck out, big. There is no Gonson account, no Hackabout account, and no Richard Rock account in the 2004 DNB. Amazing, really. I need to find the old edition (it's in some colleague's office, and I want to TAKE it from there and use it.

<p>You know what would be good? A category for redlink lists, with subcats for types of list, so that all of us who keep lists could call others (or not, by not putting the cat tag).

<dd>Hmm, what you added in was <i>mostly</i> stuff that had been in the DNB that I didn't want to talk about without some knowledge of the importance to the area, but the fact that her house became an inn (and survives?) would make it relevant. The DNB just told how much the carpenter was paid and where he was from, etc. I was thinking, at the time, "That's nice. Now <i>why</i> would I tell people about this?" Knowing that the contract survives makes it more interesting. I gather that she's something of a local legend in Bristol for some time to come.

<p>The town can be "Shrewsbury" or "Shrowsbury" (the latter tends to be the posher pronunciation), but the title is correctly "Shrowsbury" (title and place name pronunciations often vary, anyway, like Londonderry and Leinster).
