These bodies are commonly referred to as appendant bodies. They generally use an initiatory system similar to Freemasonry, in that they use ritual, allegory and symbolism to communicate principles of a moral, ethical or philosophical nature.</p>
<p>Appendant bodies are administered separately from Freemasonry and within each there is a system of offices which confer rank within that order alone; some of these bodies style themselves as (or are considered to be) Masonic due to the membership requirement that one hold the Master Mason degree.</p>
<p>A number of phrasings are used to describe these appendant bodies, none offering an accurate description; <i>side</i>, <i>additional</i>, <i>advanced</i> or <i>higher</i> degrees. The latter two especially elicit protest from avid supporters of Craft Masonry, because not only does that designation contradicts the statement that there is no degree higher than that of Master Mason, but it also implies a more direct connection than actually exists.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Freemasonry_43e1.html" title="History of Freemasonry">history</a> of Craft Masonry, prior to the formation of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Grand_Lodge_of_England_85b4.html" title="United Grand Lodge of England">Grand Lodge of England</a> in 1717 is unclear, and the history of the various appendant bodies is even more opaque. The <i>Antients</i> Grand Lodge in England, formed in 1751, allowed a wide range of rituals to be worked, whilst the Grand Lodge of England, then known as the <i>Moderns</i> frowned on anything beyond the three Speculative degrees of Craft Masonry, <i>viz.</i> the Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason. Following the merger of the two Grand Lodges in 1813 it was agreed that Pure Antient Masonry consisted of these three degrees and no more.</p>
<p>The period from 1740 to 1813 saw a host of Masonic rites emerge, as there were brethren for whom the Grand Lodge system was insufficient. These new rituals enlarged the scope of Masonry and encompassed many elaborations, some of which included elements which had previously been practiced within the craft. Many rites proved to be transient and died out (some being no more than a written record without evidence of having been practiced), but some proved more resilient and survived through amalgamation.</p>

<p>Different Masonic jurisdictions vary in their relationships with appendant bodies, if at all. Some offer formal recognition, while others consider them wholly outside of Freemasonry. This leads to some such bodies not being universally considered as <i>appendant bodies</i>, but rather separate organizations that happen to require Masonic affiliation for membership.</p>

<p>Membership of the various appendant bodies of Freemasonry requires the candidate to be a Master Mason or have a familial relationship to a Master Mason. Some require the candidate to be a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarianism.html" title="Trinitarianism">Trinitarian</a> Christian, whereas Craft Masonry accepts candidates from any faith as long as they declare a belief in a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Being_b2f5.html" title="Supreme Being">Supreme Being</a>. Additional requirements may include prior membership of additional orders or having held specific office in a preceding order.</p>
<p>Membership of many of the appendant bodies is strictly invitational; in some cases one must merely express an interest to receive this invitation, others being more strict and seeing the invitation as an honour reserved for few.</p>

<p>The appendant bodies which have survived to the present have done so by containing ritual content perceived as being of value to the participants. The ritual of those orders which have not survived are collected and demonstrated by the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_College_of_Rites_c92e.html" title="Grand College of Rites">Grand College of Rites</a> which provides a mechanism to preserve the history and traditions associated with Freemasonry.</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>ALR</b> Can we try <i>The York Rite consolidates x,y,z into a single progressive structure in the US</i> I'm conscious that York Rite has its' own page, although the treatment of the orders outside the US is clumsy there too. I'm also sensitive to the fact that some of these already have articles, and some of the others possibly justify it, so would avoid adding too much to the straight list. Once there is a list we could perhaps add a few lines about each, spinning out a further article if required. The majority are invitational elsewhere, either in fact or practice. Finally most of them exist in a wide range of places so it wouldn't be appropriate to limit the statement to UK ONLY<i>.</i></dd>

<p>A number of youth organizations exist, mainly North American, which are associated with Freemasonry, but are not Masonic in their content <b>(Comment from MSJ:</b> That is very debatable. Having seen Rainbow and DeMolay ritual done in the lodge room of Lodge of Instruction (which works differently here than in the UK, IIRC, which is why it could be done), I'd say that it teaches a lot of the same principles, and has ritual which needs to be memorized. A Master Mason is required to be at meetings as an advisor, so while there is no S&amp;C, it's a pretty good approximation, so if you want to make a case for the statement, you're going to need to clarify the definition of "Masonic content".</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/m/DeMolay_International_046b.html" title="DeMolay International">DeMolay International</a>, for boys aged 12–21;</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/b/Job%27s_Daughters_International_e58f.html" title="Job's Daughters International">Job's Daughters International</a>, for girls aged 10-20 with a Masonic family relationship</li>

<p>There are some organisations which are commonly perceived as being related to Freemasonry; some of these benefiting from charitable support by Masonic or appendant bodies, and some merely borrowing the structure.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In addition a number of organizations and fraternities such as the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Order_4694.html" title="Orange Order">Orange Order</a> style themselves along Masonic lines, using similar regalia and ritual. However they are not part of Freemasonry and are not accorded recognition as such.</p>
