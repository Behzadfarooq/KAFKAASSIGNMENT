<p>From looking at the removed section and the wording, it might be copyvio from the book (although an 1894 dating puts it in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>, I think). In either case, it's likely a direct lift, and it's only one source. I can see why it was removed, but it probably should have been explained, and it probably could have been rewritten. It might also be too tangential, who knows? <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 16:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was interested to read about your masonic interests - I've never seen anyone openly put details about craft lodges and side-orders on their Wiki user page, for that you must be very proud.

<dd>Hi there - I saw your comments about my involvement with RC. I've decided to reply "off the article" page because it's has got a bit personal about me, and I don't want to discuss my interest in freemasonry too much. Yes I have been perfected into AAR - that was in April, my next mtg is in Nov, that was why my quest for information on Wiki began. As well as editing Wikipedia, I read quite a lot from it too, although I've learned to use a healthy pinch of salt. I can't see me becoming an active contributor to the masonry pages as a result of what I've read on Scottish Rite, York Rite and Freemasonry. Meantime, my JW's office is keeping me busy enough. Regards anyway. <a href="../../../e/s/c/User%7EEscaper7_36e2.html" title="User:Escaper7">Escaper7</a> 10:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey brother, just wondering if I could get an opinion from you in relation to an article a close friend of mine is attempting to get undeleted. The article in question is of an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_exploration.html" title="Urban exploration">urban exploration</a> group numbering 2,000+ members. It's been front page news numerous times and had a lot of media coverage as advocates of exploring what mankind has forgotten and is also known for having uncovered numerous WWII fortifications that were lost and / or buried. It's based in Australia and has chapters in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">User:Vegaswikian</a> listed it for speedy deletion as a non-notable group. The problem is to appeal for undeletion you need at least three votes in support, yet unfortunately no wikipedians seem to bother reviewing such sections of material. Thus, it's terribly easy to speedy delete anything, whether it meets the criteria or not; and almost impossible to have material undeleted.</p>
<p>Discussion with the random deleter appears <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Vegaswikian#The_Tunnel_Rats" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Vegaswikian#The_Tunnel_Rats" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the appeal for reinstate ment is located <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review#The_Tunnel_Rats" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review#The_Tunnel_Rats" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>Fact tagging Kindly cease removing fact tags without actually providing support to the associated statement. Note I'm also going to remove the padding you've added to the SAS intro, it can go in later in the article, the intro is not the place.ALR 18:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Fact tagging Did you put it in later in the article, or did you just remove it. It doesn't need a fact tag. Any book on special forces, or on the SAS specifically, will say the same.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I would call the differences between Duncan and current work "errors". All Masonic ritual has changed over time (as much as we like to say we do things the same way as they did in 1713, we don't) ... we have to remember that Duncan is over 150 years old... my guess is that he gives a fairly accurate version of US ritual of his time. While Duncan was published in NY, I am not sure if he was actually exposing the NY rituals, some other jurisdiction's rituals, or was promoting some amalgamation ritual in an attempt to develope a "National Standard". All we know is that Duncan says this was the ritual at the time. In any case, while you are certainly correct in pointing out that there are differences between Duncan's ritual and modern RA ritual, we can't <i>prove</i> it without a citation, and I don't think the modern ritual is printed in a reliable source. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 03:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do me a favor... I am running up against 3rrr (and to some extent POINT) at George Washington and religion... The issue is Washington's funeral. All the sources say that he had an Episcopal funeral service, but because it included a Masonic service there is a group are insisting that we can not simply leave it at "the Episcopal Order of Burial was read at his funeral." They insist on including an irrelevant mention of the Masonic part of the service, and implying that this made him a Deist. They are insisting that the Masonic service is a religious service. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 22:04, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was already looking at it. I'm not sure what point it makes about Washington, it's a reasonable point to make about the funeral but I don't think you can draw any conclusion from it since that would constitute OR. ALR 22:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think one of the issues might be the use of the term <i>Chaplain</i> in the ritual extract which has been identified. I can understand why someone might infer that it becomes a service, as such. Since the Chaplain frequently is not ordained then it cannot be a service.ALR 22:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The article claims he was made a Mason in 1877, then joined SRIA in 1882, and "joined their High Council within four years" (by 1886). However, an external article claims he quit Lodge in 1882, which was the same year he joined SRIA, which doesn't make any sense if you need to maintain membership in one to be part of the other. Now, I'm not saying that the external article is any good, it's just different, and gives info not in the WP article. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, ALR. I sometimes look in on the RS Talk page and am always impressed with your comments there and your insights regarding RS. I've posted an RfC related to reliable secondary sources. Don't know if you have time for something so mundane, but it would be great to get your feedback regarding what constitutes RS.

<p>Thanks for your reply. Looking forward to your feedback.

<p>Excellent. Really really appreciate your feedback. We've kind of been operating in a vacuum. It's so valuable to have someone with broad Wikipedia experience give his input. Thanks so much. All of your comments were apt and helpful.

<p>Thanks for your message, ALR. Your contribution was valuable. I was impressed with how you were able to maintain focus on relevant issues. I agree that further discussion may be pointless. I'm surprised that your points weren't taken more to heart. This was my first RfC, and I had thought that cogent arguments from editors actively contributing to shaping the guidelines would be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Again, I also valued your more general feedback. It helped to confirm what I had been thinking in regard to the overall weakeness of the criticism section. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimidGuy_f7a8.html" title="User:TimidGuy">TimidGuy</a> 16:18, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed both these articles are very short.

<p>It strikes me that there is little appetite within the editor community to actually find a solution to the issue, in particular with a group of independent voices expressing a position. Might there be another approach to resolution?ALR 20:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is rather the pattern. As soon as one side is willing to give in and achieve a solution from the other side an editor launches an attack that questions the whole process. In my opinion this is more of a problem to lose control. As long as one side feels not safe enough that it will win it is not sure whether to accept. Naturally the persons involved are all smart and diligent editors but the groups they form co-act in an unproductive dynamic. The result is that they can continue to accuse someone else and "try to find a solution". Another point is that for their goal they preferably jump between topics and get things into waters where no decision is possible or only one in their favor.</dd>
<dd>Possibly a bit similar to Northern Ireland, but without decreasing live conditions in an ongoing conflict. I don't know how to solve it. I fancy with a hijacking commando and a scorched earth fixation (and I don't count on many Greeks/Turks voting me for coordinator).
