<p>Hi Aldux, and welcome to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You've been doing a lot of good editing. I've noticed that you have been copying text from <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_Greek_and_Roman_Biography_and_Mythology_85cd.html" title="Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</a> by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Smith_%28lexicographer%29_fd41.html" title="William Smith (lexicographer)">William Smith</a>. This is fine from a copyright standpoint since it is in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. However there are some issues with doing this see for example: <a href="../../../1/9/1/Wikipedia%7E1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_18ad.html" title="Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>.</p>
<p>I've made a few changes to <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaeus_%28general%29.html" title="Achaeus (general)">Achaeus (general)</a> that you might want to look at, and which might be good to keep in mind. Some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date formats and linking see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a>. For example I changed "214 b.c." to "[[214 BC]]").</li>
<li>Scanned text will often include unwanted line-break hyphenation (Achaeus had a number of these).</li>
<li>It is usually only necessary to link the first mention of something. I've de-linked several things.</li>
<li>I inserted a template message: {{<a href="../../../s/m/i/Template%7ESmithDGRBM_10af.html" title="Template:SmithDGRBM">SmithDGRBM</a>}} (see <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a>) and <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Sources_of_articles_c696.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles">Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles</a>), which can be used to indicate that some text was copied from Smith's Dictionary. It should be placed at the bottom of the article.</li>
<li>I also reformatted the references, to conform more to house style (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once more welcome to Wikipedia. It is always great to welcome more classical editors (by the way I hope you will tell us something about yourself on your user page: <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> — gets rid of that red link&#160;;-) If you have any questions on the above (or anything else) don't hesitate to ask me on my <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">talk page</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 17:49, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux, Since you didn't respond to my answer to your question on my talk page, I've decided to copy your question and my response to here (just in case you didn't see it there — if you just didn't have anything to say that's ok&#160;;-) I also wanted to add to what I said below that another great advantage to the "<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" rel="nofollow">Perseus</a>" site is that you can search individual works. I've also converted the inline citations in <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaeus_%28general%29.html" title="Achaeus (general)">Achaeus (general)</a> to footnotes, and you can see how they work, and how the links to the specific passages work.

<p>(<i>Start of copied text'</i>)</p>
<p>Thanks for sending me your message and for your corrections to the article. I was asking myself: if you incorporate text from more than one source should I template both? You see, I incorporated text from 3 sources in an article i wrote before. A smaller question; why did you change the link for Polybius. Because my source was 1922-27, while your's is 1867, so public domain (even if I believe that also the other is). Thanks in advance for your response. You see, I'm a newbie and I still do a lot of errors. (<i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> at 18:27, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</i>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Aldux. The templates are only intended to be used if you copy text verbatim. If you copy from more than one source then you should mention all of them (using templates if they exist). In any case every work used should be listed in the "References" section, whether or not a "This article incorporates text from ..." template was used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As regards the Polybius reference change, it had nothing to do with dates or being in the public domain, which of course isn't an issue so long as you are not copying text. Either your Edward's Polybius, or my Shuckburgh's Polybius would be ok as a reference. However, it is good where possible to give an "on-paper" reference with complete bibliographic information (e.g. translator, publisher, year etc.), which yours didn't, and I had that info handy for mine. (One of the virtues of "on-paper", is that there will probably be a printed version of Wikipedia someday.) It is of course also very nice to have an online version of the reference, which both our references have. But I much prefer the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" rel="nofollow">Perseus</a> site&#160;;-) it is easier to use and it has a <i>lot more</i> linked information. And you can provide links to the exact passages cited. (For an example see <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demetrius_of_Pharos_9bd3.html#Notes" title="Demetrius of Pharos">Demetrius of Pharos#Notes</a>) In any case we can list both if you want. Or if you just want to provide an online link to that site, without listing it in the references section, you can add an "External links" section, and put it there.</dd>

<p>Hi Aldux, I noticed you are continuing to make excellent progress transferring material from Smith's Dictionary. Are you planning to do the whole thing? I bet you are learning a lot. I also saw you caught and reverted some vandalism at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_empire.html" title="Roman empire">Roman empire</a> good work. So I thought I would award you with a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnstar.html" title="Barnstar">Barnstar</a> on your user page, for all your great work. By the way, I just noticed it says on your user page that you live in Firenze. Lucky you! It is one of my favorite cities. My major professor (and his wife) will be teaching there for a semester in the fall. My wife and I will be visiting them in November. Perhaps we could share a beer? or a glass of vino? I'm afraid I don't speak any Italian, but your English seems pretty good&#160;;-) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 21:54, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really appreciated the award!&#160;:-) That said, I must in honesty reply that Smith's Dictionary (or better Dictionaries, since they're three: Biography, Antiques, Geography) is simply to big for a lazy one like me; and, also, I would like to work a bit on Wace's <i>Dictionary of Christian Biography</i>, a bit partisan but very detailed. For certain I can only say that I'll keep working with the history articles.</p>
<p>As for Firenze, alas!, I've just finished my post-university studies and I've returned home. Not that I've gone very far away: I'm just fifty miles upstream where the river <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arno.html" title="Arno">Arno</a> passes by Firenze, in a small town called Subbiano, near <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arezzo.html" title="Arezzo">Arezzo</a>. As for November, I must confess its to early to answer, since much depends on where the Public Education ministry decides to send me, which is for now a mistery. But if I can I'd be happy to meet you&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 15:51, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hai <b>Aldux</b>, there are intresting articles about <b>Ayyavazhi</b>, a new religion on both mythology and religiosity. Wikipedia is rich with this topic in English, but poor in other languages. Since french is a leading language in Wikipedia it is better to translate the contents on this <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">AYYAVAZHI</a> family to french. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj">Paul Raj</a></p>

<p>Hi, Matia&#160;:-) I've just controlled that edit on the Thebans &amp; Alexander: i believe your edit is correct, as proved by this:</p>
<p>"His rapid march into the south of Greece over­awed all opposition; Thebes, which had been most active against him, submitted when he ap­peared at its gates; and the assembled Greeks at the Isthmus of Corinth, with the sole exception of the Spartans, elected him to the command against Persia, which had previously been bestowed upon his father. Being now at liberty to reduce the barbarians of the north to obedience, he marched (early in 335 BC) across mount Haemus, defeated the Triballi, and advanced as far as the Danube, which he crossed, and received embassies from the Scythians and other nations. On his return, he marched westward, and subdued the Illyrians and Taulantii, who were obliged to sub­mit to the Macedonian supremacy. While engaged in these distant countries, a report of his death reached Greece, and the Thebans once more took up arms. But a terrible punishment awaited them. He advanced into Boeotia by rapid marches, and appeared before the gates of the city almost before the inhabitants had received intelligence of his approach. The city was taken by assault; all the buildings, with the exception of the house of Pindar, were levelled with the ground; most of the inhabitants butchered, and the rest sold as slaves. Athens feared a similar fate, and sent an embassy deprecating his wrath; but Alexander did not ad­vance further; the punishment of Thebes was a sufficient warning to Greece." <a href="http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0128.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0128.html" rel="nofollow">Smith's Dictionary</a></p>

<p>My only objection is to "Philip was content to deprive Thebes of her dominion over Boeotia." This isn't fully exact: it would also seem from the sources that a Macedonian garrison was imposed by Philip on the Cadmeia, Thebes' citadel.</p>

<p>Hello, I've seen the contributions you have made and I have seen you know what you are doing, so that's why I wanted to ask why you reverted my edit on the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucus_II_Callinicus_c6c4.html" title="Seleucus II Callinicus">Seleucus_II_Callinicus</a> page.

<p>Why are you reverting my changes? Also what kind of references do you need? For what claim? “Unlike the time before WWII, when Macedonia was hotbed for unrest and terror and about 60% of the entire royal Yugoslav police force was stationed there, “ – this is not disputed by anybody. See <a href="../../../v/m/r/VMRO_d0c1.html#The_interwar_years" title="VMRO">VMRO#The_interwar_years</a>. " Numerous assassinations (over 1,000 by one account) were carried out by IMRO agents in many countries, the majority in Yugoslavia. The most spectacular of these was the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou, in Marseille". Or "contemporary observers described the Yugoslav-Bulgarian frontier as the most fortified in Europe"</p>
<p>“after the war there were no signs of disturbances comparable with pre war times or” I don’t need references for event that never happen. It is the Bulgarians that need to put some kind of references of some kind of incident. Surely if 100 K+ was imprisoned we would have at least one bomb or assassination somewhere?</p>
<p>“post war times in other parts of former Yugoslavia, such as Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia.” Read for example <a href="../../../u/s/t/Ustasa.html#After_the_war" title="Ustasa">Ustasa#After_the_war</a>. “Ustaše were implicated in over two dozen terrorist acts following the post-war period.” --<a href="../../../c/i/g/User%7ECigor_f0eb.html" title="User:Cigor">Cigor</a> 17:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Cigor&#160;:-) You must understand that my objections do not come from disbelief, on the contrary between the two theories I think your seems the nearest to truth. But you have to understand that these statements may be contested may be others, all the one you mentioned. <b>When I mean sourcing I mean mentioning scholar xxxx and historian xxxx so to substain the points against possible future objections.</b> Second, context can help: like if you write "Macedonia was very peaceful after WWII, compared to the inter-wars years" and here putting a rapid allusion to the VMRO violence, and if you write "also compared to Croatia and Bosnia", and adding something like, "where ustasa violence was active in the first post-war decade". These are only examples, and I have no doubt you can find something better. If you still have some questions or objections, don't have problems asking. Bye&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In general I agree with you, but I don’t see the same policy applied for the Bulgarian claim. All we have there is statements of politicians. It’s really not that hard to make a decent research of the alleged repressions of Bulgarians in Macedonia. They have an institute in Sophia that deals exclusively about Macedonia. If there were indeed 100K+ (or even few thousands), I am sure some of their scholar would have abundantly documented this claim. But they didn’t and all they have is arbitrary statements from politicians.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, the entire claim makes no sense. Why would “Bulgarians” revolt if the Bulgarian government acknowledged the existence of Macedonian nation after WWII . This policy was reverted in the 1950s/1960s but by that time there was little doubt in Macedonia what kind of people they are.</dd>
<dd>There were 12,000 out of total 18,000 policemen in Macedonia before WWII. As for comparison with Croatia and Serbia, have in mind that there were still cetnicks and ustasa guerilla until the early 1950s. There were many terrorist acts in Croatia and Bosnia. Not to mention the big MASPOK in the early 1970s. None of that occurred in Macedonia. Conclusion: Is it possible that the people in Macedonia were happy with the existing solution?</dd>

<p>I accept your apology Aldux. I too apologize if I said anything that offended you. My purpose here is not to offend anyone or to make anyone think that they are not intelligent enough to contribute positively here on Wikipedia. I truly appreciate your courage in taking the time to apologize. For that, you have my unmitigated respect.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am not against the commonalities shared between Greeks and Romans. I may be so bold as to say that the Romans were offspring of the Greeks. Of course, I have met Italians who don't like that statement. The point I was trying to make in the discussion page is that the Greek social mentality is always oriented on distinguishing itself even if it has commonalities with other civilizations. For instance, Athenians and Spartans were Greeks and both groups knew they were brothers. However, they wanted to retain their distinct local identities.</p>
<p>Look, I never doubted that you were (and still are) adept in your understanding of the Byzantine Empire. Just so you know, I am not against Western European scholarship for their positive contributions to academia. I am against Western European scholarship to the extent that I am against actual academics with Ph.D's and Master's degrees who preach that modern Greeks are Turks or that the Byzantines were non-Greek. Also, there are some Greek scholars who do the same thing, and that I find to be very dishonorable on their part. If any of these statements were true, you would not see me arguing at all. My arguments have their reasons and are based on either sources or well-thought-out social analyses. If I make a mistake, then I accept it and move on (of course, I admit I have inherited the ancient Greek characteristic of extreme stubborness and cannot seem to move on after making a mistake; sometimes I just cannot help it).</p>
<p>Just so you know, I only mock people when I have to defend myself against those who needlessly deride my heritage. Please understand where I am coming from. I have spoken to Turks, Albanians, and F.Y.R.O.Mians (fake "Macedonians") who (for no reason at all) attack my heritage as if they have nothing else better to do. All of this needless pressure sort of forces me to defend my ancestors, their history and heritage. I do not like it when people lie to me about my heritage. Not so much because it bothers me, but also because it does a great injustice to future generations who may want to know the truth about the achievements of great civilizations.</p>
<p>Again, I am sorry if I said anything to offend you. I did keep my promise that I would provide sources to support the statements I have made on the article <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_the_Greeks_c009.html" title="Names of the Greeks">Names of the Greeks</a> (you can find them on the discussion page). I am sorry if I treated you like an alien. I admit, I assumed that you were supporting those Western European "scholars" who love ancient Greece and pretend to love Byzantine history when in fact they despise it. If you are a Roman, then chances are you have Greek blood. Moreover, your love for the Greco-Roman will not go unrewarded.</p>
<p>Your apology is honorably accepted and I hope that we never have to fight again. Take care Aldux. Over and out. - Deucalionite 12/15/05 12:56 P.M. EST</p>

<p>I have no problem with including R. Lane Fox's opinion, however, on omitting the "multiple doses" argument, I disagree. R. Lane Fox is correct that such long-acting poisons were probably not available then, but they weren't needed if you consider multiple doses. There would not need to be a "long acting poison." Multiple doses could've been used.</p>
<p>Also, I disagree with your omission of the fact that the warrior culture favored the sword -- direct killing -- over poison. I believe this is a critical argument against poisoning.</p>

<dd>Hi Primetime&#160;:-) The point is that if we really want to put a pronunciation aid, I have a feeling we should put it for the original Greek name, not for the Latin one.

<p>You edited my last insertion re deaths of Kapwepwe and Nkumbula. FYI, although nothing was even proven the fact remains that a cloud of suspition has always hung there about KK's role, if any. Knowing the man for many years, I doubt he had anything to do with it (nor Miller's death in fact) but the reality of the situation cannot be ignored or PC'd. Further, Kaunda never referred to <i>African</i> Humanisim but plain Humanisim on the basis that he wanted to show his position in a global perspective and not merely an African/regional one.--<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhodie_b611.html" title="User:Rhodie">Rhodie</a> 14:38, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, Aldux, I just noticed this discussion here. I think it would be better to hold it on the Talk page so that all interested editors can contribute. I am not sure why Miskin is opposed to using the word "Ottoman" in this article, as the thing they are most famous for -- the early films -- were made while Monastir was still Ottoman. They apparently stayed on in Yugoslav Bitola until the 20's at least, and at some point apparently left for Greece. It would be good to have more information about all that of course. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If you want me to search other links to add to this one, OK; and I don't see why you should abstain yourself by putting an ex. link, if it's a biog. that adds useful info and not a polemic piece.</dd>

<p>I created an article for <a href="../../../k/u/k/Kukawa.html" title="Kukawa">Kukawa</a>. Could you add when it first became capital? Also I have an old British book (1900) that refers to the independent "Sultanate of Bornu" (It was written after the Anglo-French agreements but just before the partition was actually implemented). I have also seen a reference to Nachtigal visiting the "Sultanate" in 1870. But the ruler seems to have been an Emir. What was the correct name of the country in the late 19th century? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJameswilson_10c0.html" title="User:Jameswilson">Jameswilson</a> 00:15, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your reply. If you put 'rabeh bornu' into google, the top pages listed seem to suggest that he seized power and made himself ruler of Bornu, rather than destroying it. My 1900 book (Geography of the World, George Philip and Son for the Civil Service Book Depot, London) doesnt name him, but certainly confirms that impression. It says that in 1900, Bornu and Wadai (and Wadai's tributary states of Kanem and Bagirmi} were all independent "Mohammedan Negroid States". The European powers had agreed partition but had not yet implemented it. The Kukawa population figure does not have a date (as I wrtongly thought) but certainly no mention is made of any destruction of the city itself.</p>
<p>On Bornu specifically, it says:- " Bornu, that is, Bar-noa, or the Land of Noah, is a lovely and fruitful country, to the west and south of Lake Chad. It has a population of perhaps 50,000 sq m and a population of about 5 million, chiefly Kanuri Negroes, The greater part of Bornu lies within the British sphere. The Kanuri (people of the light) Negroes are a mixed race of Negroes and Tibbus, and are regarded as "the most civiised people in Central Africa and their woven fabrics, pottery and metal ware are highly prized throughoutthe Sudan". Like the Maba Negores, or rather the Negroids of Wadai, the Kanuris hold the Arab immigrants and other races in subjection. Both these Mohammedan Sultanates are indeed remarkable examples of indigenous Negro civilisation, each possessing a well-organised admnistration, a Court and a Government, with all their dignities and offices, Unhappily, however, the whole policy of these States is based on slavery, and the traffic in human beings is still carried on (source: Keith Johnson. The London Geography). The Sultan has an army of 30,000 men partly armed with rifles, a strong force of cavalry, and even some artillery ....There are several towns with over 10,000 inhabitants in Bornu Proper and the larger tributary States, and Kuka or Kukawa, the capital of the Sultanate, has a population of 50,000 to 60,000, and is one of the great markets of the Central Sudan. (my note - old definition of Sudan = countries of the Sahel too). ....A comparatively short line of railway from Yola or from Ribago, to Kuka, would result in a great expansion of British trade in the Central Sudan."</p>

<p>The addition was much needed and it appears good. The only problem I have is the present tense.

<p>Actually I'm not retarded. The ancient Assyrians used Cuneiform and spoke a dialect of "Akkadian" just as the Babylonians did.

<p>Please read first the discussion page before intervening on articles. A <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a> unilaterally moved the existing Assyrian genocide article to Syriac genocide. The discussion page clearly shows that this was not sustained by anyone but Benne himself. He's trying to promote the use of the term "Syriacs" in place of "Assyrians", which is the usual scientifically-accepted ethnonym (even if it is also used by Assyrian nationalists). Please revert your modifications there: I couldn't move the article in another way since there was already an Assyrian genocide article, so I hade to use the paste function. Due to Benne's actions (and some other like-minded) a lot of articles have to be corrected now, on the base of scientific articles and books and not on the base of nationalist or religious biases. --Pylambert 15:26, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aldux. I'm a new user but I noticed your edits in the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> article and I want to thank you for your contribution and constructive attitude. That being said I don't doubt your neutrality and well intentions. But I must tell you that I dont agree with you on two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of the term "Slavophones" for the Macedonians of Slavic descend in Greece.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term is not percise and one consequence could be that they can be mistaken for Bulgarians. Also they dont see themselves as "Slavophones" but as Macedonians. In my view they should at least be reffered as Slavophone Macedonians in Greece. I belive this should be acceptable to the Greek users also, because they should at least accept it in the geographical sense - they are Macedonians, because they live in Macedonia</p>
<ul>
<li>The inclusion of: "It should be noted that Census data in European countries often does not take into account what ethnicity immigrates from the Republic of Macedonia, as is the case with Italy and Germany"</li>
</ul>
<p>I no longer dispute this being a fact, because I'm not aware how exactly this is done in Italy and Germany. However I think it is unnecesary to include it because it is already mentioned that numbers for Italy and Germany reffer to citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, when theese two countries are mentioned below. This way it's being mentioned twice. In similar articles such things are not mentioned at all. There is no mention even of such significant coumunities as the Turkish Kurds in Germany, the Serbian Roma in Germany and Italy and so on and so on. This way we make even more exeptions in the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> article wich then serve for negating the existance of the Macedonian people.</p>
<p>I'd be gratefull for your opinions on this matters. Regards --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealek_4962.html" title="User:Realek">Realek</a> 19:39, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello again. Well straight to busines this time&#160;:)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the use of "Slavic" can be more apropriate in the first sentance about greece: <i>Greece adopted strongly repressive policies towards the Slavic population in its northern regions</i>. But in the rest of the text we shoud talk specifically about the Macedonians not the Bulgarians. So there is no need to talk about the whole slavophone population in Greece. The issues of the Bulgarian portion of this population should be adressed in the Bulgarians article. I would agree that only in the case of Greece "slavophone" could be added in front of Macedonians to differentiate from Greeks living in the Macedonia region. Would you agree to this?</li>
<li>I agree with you that most of the people articles are ridden with nationalisms of the worst sort. I do not object to the inclusion of the paragraf per se. What bothers me is that the Macedonians article doesn't follow the standards used in the other "people articles". This gives "ammunition" to the negators of the very existance of Macedonians. But it's a more accurate article with the paragraph included so I wont object to it anymore.</li>
</ul>

Can you point me to where it says that a link, such as to Britanica, can not be used unless it's a free link, even though its available free as a cached on a google search?<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 01:16, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Aldux. For those that do not have an account with Britannica, the trick to seeing the full cached version free is simply to use Google and enter in its search: Eusebius Of Caesarea. Encyclopædia Britannica. It should pull up as the first entry, I believe, and it will be the full article. If I give you a link directly, you will get the partial view only. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 20:12, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aldux,with all respect to your POV and your knowledge in the matter and your good will,i would like to point that RoM had indeed irrendistic claims over greece,since they printed maps showing that their country should extend to Olympus and since they used symbols from the greek region of macedonia as official(not only the Vergina Sun,but also the White Tower in Thessaloniki).also,they had an article in their constitution talking about protection of 'Macedonians' in neighbouring countries,which could also be seen as interfering in other states' issues.furthermore,their official education system teaches them that they are descendants of the ancient macedonians who happen to be slavicized,that's why i am insisting so much in making this distinction clear in the article.what is obvious to u(that the ancient macedonians were a different people) is not to them.ciao--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 22:24, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not true Hectorian.
<ul>
<li>The maps are not printed by the Republic of Macedonia, but publishers I guess. I have one of theese maps and funny thing it was printed in Bulgaria. Would you accuse them of irredentistic claims over Greece? Anyway since Greek users tend to claim how powerfull Greece is and how week Macedonia is; and how Greece is going to impose its will on its neighbour using all this power, you can't be really serious about the territorial claims. Surely you can find loonies in any country, but note that Macedonia never claimed any neghbour's territory (unlike most of the countries in the region during the 90s). I would like to add that the maps are more like historic maps. Macedonia shown on them is Macedonia how the Macedonian revolutionaries (you would say Bulgarian revolutionaries, but that way you would accuse Bulgaria) thought the Country should be like. So - is a map of Austo-Hungary today a territorial claim threathening all the countries around?</li>
<li>Many countries have in their constitution an article like that. In the region Albania has it, Serbia has it (probably Bulgaria has it and the others also...). Only Macedonia was pressured to remove it. Now I personally think that it was pressured to remove it because of Greek attempts to negate the existance of a slavophone Macedonian minority in Greece, NOT because it was actually a claim over territory. But that is just my oppinion - the fact is that it was removed more than 10 years ago and it is irrelevant now.</li>
<li>Simply not true. But they should teach the mixing theory in my oppinion --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealek_4962.html" title="User:Realek">Realek</a> 02:18, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Realek:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the maps were historic,they wouldn't show Albania,cause the state of Albania was established in 1913.If a publisher printed such maps here or elsewhere in europe,he would be seen as(at least) a dreamer by state,media and people.on the contrary,u said yourself that u have such a map.and if this is not enough to convince u about the claims that u have,take a look at your fellow citizens' userpages and the maps and materials they have added there.Once more u reply to only what is convinient to u...no mention about the symbols again...:)</li>
<li>Greece doesn't have such an article,and i doubt if the others have either.The slavophone minority in greece prints its own magazines and has its own political party.do not forget that it was FYROM in a state of almost war some years ago cause of its 'respect' to the albanian minority.</li>
<li>Lastly and in brief,i have watched documentaries from your country's schools and also the books.so,don't tell me that u are not taught that u are descendants of the ancient macedonians.at least other users from your country have admitted that.--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 02:43, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I could write a book proving you wrong but Aldux page is not the place for it. It was my mistake to confront you here and I appologise. So I'll be as brief as possible:
<ul>
<li>Suppose you are right. Macedonia still wont be able to be any threat to the territorial integrity of Greece. So leave it alone.</li>
<li>Suppose you are right. It has been removed because of Greece's demand. So leave it alone.</li>
<li>Suppose you are right. Greeks have not any more right to teach that in their schools but you don't object to that. So leave it alone.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And I couldnt stay silent toy your dragging of the unrelated issue of albanian minority rights in all this. They had substantial minority rights before 2001, and now they have a lot more, making Macedonia a world pioneer in a lot of areas of minority rights (If you wish I'll explain this on your page). Greece on the other side allows the Macedonians to organize politicaly and to print a magazine... WOW! Anyway those things are not minority rights at all - but basic human rights. And they have been allowed to do this only recently. Yes - Greece is a shining example of Democracy! --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealek_4962.html" title="User:Realek">Realek</a> 18:40, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And you're a shining example of the power of propaganda in post-communist regimes. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:07, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have provided references on the term "Greek Macedonians", as well as its arithmetic superiority over the Slavs on the south-central parts of the region. So that you know that my edits are based on sourced information.</li>
<li>Secondly, why did you remove the disambig sentence in "History of Italy"? It's normal to disambiguate between history of the country and history of the region. Britannica for example has two different articles respectively. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:05, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>So you don't understand; I said that no Greek Macedonian ethnicity exists separated from Greek ethnicity; and we should list people, not regional identities.</li>
<li>This article is on all Italy not only the peninsula, which is only part of historical and present Italy; it excludes continental Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Also, Italy has been multi-ethnic only before 2000 years ago; after that non-latin minorities have always been demographically marginal. Also, Italy came to be perceived as more than a geographic expression already by the latin authors; and already in the late republic all inhabitants of Italy were roman citizens. So no, the history of Italy is not the history of united Italy and neither of a simple geographic area.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's definitely a POV Aldux. Italy remained multiethnic until at least 11th century AD (don't forget the Gothic, Lombard, Byzantine and Norman settlements). I know that Latin authors (I think Cicero) spoke of a unified Italy as back as 200BC, but that was not realistic. The proof is the Italian Greek and Celtic siding with Hannibal during the 2nd Punic war. In my opinion a culturally unified Italy is born with Dante, but I'm not gonna argue on this, it's none of my concerns. I insist and I will insist on keeping the term "Greek Macedonians", in the way that I'd keep "Cretan Greek" or "Asian Greek". I'm not aware of a wp policy which enforces the listing of nationalities over regional identities. I feel that it's important to prevent the Slavic crowd's attempt on a monopoly of the name, if for no good reason, because such monopoly would enforce implied land-claims (as described in User:Macedonia's personal page). Furthermore, I think that my theory is verified by the very Slavic editors' persistence on hiding such terms from public view. I know that what you want in to prevent edit-wars. I for once, am not willing to back up because of the chauvinist edit-wars the MacSlavs are capable of starting. They'll revert afew times and then it'll stop. After all, it's sourced. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 19:10, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ciao Niko, ho letto la tua risposta a Macedonians. Non credo che in sè un nome come Nuova Macedonia sarebbe offensivo per gli slavomacedoni, ma ha il difetto di essere completamente nuovo, cioè di non avere nessuna sanzione ufficiale da nessuna delle parti in causa. E comunque la Repubblica di Macedonia non ha nulla da guadagnare ad accettare, in quanto sanno che il tempo sta giocando a loro favore, in particolare da quando gli Americani hanno optato per RoM anziché su FYROM; e le azioni degli Americani tendono a determinare spesso e volentieri quelle degli altri. Inoltre, non fosse altro che per semplicità, i giornali, almeno italiani, usano sempre Macedonia o Republica di Macedonia, e mai FYROM (ti dico solo che io non so neanche come dire esattamente il nome ONU, FYROM, in italiano, da quanto è raro l'uso). Comunque non sono un profeta, e dunque puoi consolarti pensando che potrei sbagliarmi&#160;;-) Ciao--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 21:36, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What Miskin and Latinus are doing on the Ottoman Empire page is vandalism. I made my point to them for 2-3 hours and yet still they are doing the same redundant edit again and again.

<p>I see what you mean. I compiled the first paragraph according to some encyclopedic sources that I had available, in order to replace and not just remove their old racist section. The second paragraph was already there, and I changed it around in order to not completely remove their previous edits, but I'm sure nobody will miss it if we take it off. We'll edit around the first paragraph, what's important is we have removed the previous racist content.

<p>Don't take Kagan too seriously, he does this all the time. I hope you find an improvement after my latest edits in 'Italian people'. I tried to focus the section on settlements patterns rathern than pseudo-science. I also tried to point out that despite dialectic or linguistic variation, the bulk of the population (Latin or not) descended from the ancient settlers. Ethnic articles are being subjected to significant bias. The 'Spanish people' is also at a really bad condition, but I don't see how it can be saved without a total rewrite. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:33, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for interfering,Aldux.i saw the changes in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian people</a> and the comment on Miskin's talk page.i generally agree with what u said, but i want to note 2 things: the Byzantine Greeks used Latin for administration purposes, as they did in greece and anatolia, but they revived the greak-speaking communities(Griko)-perhaps the byzantines are the reason that this language has survived till today-.and secondly, about the Illyrians that u said.in southern italy,when the greeks arrived,were of course italian peoples,but not illyrians.maybe u are talking about the Messapian language(but it has not proven to be connected with the illyrian).Cheers! --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 18:28, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What I wanted to add is that Latin was at an intellectual level a dead language in the Eastern Empire and Constantinople from as early as the 5th century BC (Justinian was forced to write Novellae in Greek). It survived as the language of administration as late as the early 7th century where Heraclius replaced it with Greek. The Byzantine soldiers and officials in Southern Italy and Sicily probably didn't know a word in Latin. This doesn't imply that there was an influx of Greek population coming from Byzantium, but it explains the long-term survival of Greek speaking communities in Souther Italy (11th c.) and Sicily (9th c.). This is not something I'm making up, nor adding in order to emphasize greek presence in Italian history, it was actually mentioned in the sources that I used in order to compile that paragraph. If you think however that it is not too relevant to the section, we can always remove it. The second paragraph as I said earlier, is a re-write of an existing edit which I kept in order to reduce the chances of edit-wars. We can completely remove it as soon as things cool down. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:31, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's the term "Hellene" that Byzantinists and Byzantines would refuse, not the term 'greek'. If you look at any medieval european text you'll never find the Byzantines to be called anything other than Greeks. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:10, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the help. I agree with you, it appears that the dynasty itself began much later and previous rulers just carried the same name. <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_of_Chorene_971a.html" title="Moses of Chorene">Moses of Chorene</a> speaks of a certain Yervand Sakavakyats who is regarded as the first Orontes by nationalists but there is no historical proof. His name is interesting though, especially the Saka (Scythian?) part.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Artasyras, the King’s Eye, brought the news of Prince Cyrus' death to Artaxerxes II, and Artasyras's son Orontes who had been present (and perhaps distinguished himself) at the Battle of Kounaxa and was given Rhodogunde the daughter of Artaxerxes II and made Satrap of Armenia. In the late 380s after Persia had suffered serious reverses in Egypt, Orontes was recalled from Armenia to head the Persian army while Tiribazes commanded at sea. They quarreled and their case went before a court of four Persian nobles who found for Tiribazes with Orontes being disgraced and dismissed from his position as Satrap of Armenia.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the 360s BCE several of the Persian Satraps revolted and chose Orontes as their leader. However he betrayed them to the King and made peace with General Ochus. Orontes was then reappointed as Satrap of Armenia and became the founder of the autonomous Armenian Orontid dynasty. Direct descendants of the Orontid dynasty included the medieval Georgian dynasty, one of whom was the famous Queen Tamara, co-ruler from 1178 and sole ruler from 1184, and who has many present day descendants.</i></dd>

<p>I do not know what is the problem in that article, or if the etymology should or not should be included. the word is 'κατεφίλησεν' ('κατά + φιλώ'- the letter 'ε' if indicates the past tense in greek) and means 'kiss passionately'. i am just giving u the etymology, maybe search it like that in your dictionary:) Ciao! --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 20:14, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for the advice! Yes, u are right. i just saw that u removed the number from one. i guess i forgot that they used only a title and i added the greek number in...10-20 articles! lol...i have a work to do, and i will remove it now...And when i will add the greek name in other, i will not add the number too.

In <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html#Relationships" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo_da_Vinci#Relationships</a> I read "Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed il Salaino ("The Little Unclean One" i.e., the devil), ...". Later, after a total of seven uses of "il Salaino", the text suddenly shifts to "Salai", without any explanation. Articles in other languages that mention the character at all appear to only use "Salai", without mention that this is a nickname. The online Italian dictionaries that I consulted don't have an entry for "salai(no)". So here is my question: Why the two forms, what is their relationship, and is it justified to have both in the article? (OK, that's three questions.)

<p>U are right...as always! well, this was something i didn't know about the kings of Pontus:). but by saying <i>Hellenism made considerable inroads also in monarchies governed by kings of Persian or Thracian origin, as was the case with Bithynia, Cappadocia and Pontus</i>, doesn't this seem a bit odd? i mean, ok about Cappadokia at that time, but Pontus was inhabited by Greeks, so it was more than expected that its character would be Greek. It's like saying 'Hellenism made considerable inroads in Hellenic people'...

<dd>Hi Aldux! According to my knowledge, Pontus existed as a collective name for the greek colonies in the area since the Archaic period. it was not just some scattered greek colonies there (i can name quite many cities), without of course meaning that it was so heavily greek-populated as Magna Graecia or Ionia. The term <i>Cappadocia Pontica</i> is the latin term for the region, not the greek one. The fact that we know little things about Hellenistic Pontus (or generally Ancient Pontus) may be cause of the lack of excavations, since the turkish government does not give permissions for that. Honestly, i know little things 'bout Mithridates, so i will just trust u on that:). perhaps i confused in my mind the region of Pontus (in the way the greeks considered and consider it till now) with the Kingdom of Pontus (which included much larger areas).

<p>I notice that you do not include Greek in the list of your language skills so you are unlikely to have read or be able to read Alekos Angelides History of Macedonia. His book in the original language and A H Scullard's "A History of the Greek World" were the sources for the additions to the article on the Battle of Pydna.

<dd>Se ho capito bene, il problemo esiste perche credi che non si può dire con certezza che fosse simbolo dell'antico stato macedone. D'accordo, ma al momento, e con l' informazione che abbiamo, ci sono tanti che fanno questo associazione. Credo che se c'e qualchecosa da fare, questo sarrebe aggioungere la parola "...<b>believed</b> to be associated...". Invece tu, non hai fatto via il symbolo completamente, ma hai fatto via la frase che il symbolo e registrato. Capisco che la disputa moderna non serve nel'articolo, ma la frase che il symbolo e registrato dalla Grecia, serve per tanti ragioni:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Quando un symbolo esiste in WP (libera) che e registrato, gli utenti che lo vedono devono sapere.</li>
<li>Se qualcuno cerca il symbolo de la bandiera precedente di FYROM (che esiste dentro l'articolo di FYROM) deve sapere che oggi, questo symbolo e registrato dalla Grecia.</li>
<li>Anche, se c'era una disputa su questo symbolo antico entro Grecia e FYROM, gli utenti devono sapere il modo comme questa disputa e finita.</li>
<li>Nessuno ha fatto un' analyse de la disputa moderna in questo articolo e anch'io non voglio includere queste dispute pseudoscientifiche in un articolo per l'antiquita. Esiste solo una realta (che oggi questo symbolo e registrato). No dispute, no analyse, nient'altro.</li>

<p>Ciao Aldux! Please follow my reasoning, if you feel like it:</p>
<p>Ok, now we have this situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>People say that it is a nationalistic view to think that your genes (your DNA) are directly related to your ancestors 3000 years ago. Correct? Yes. So, <i>common genes</i> talk is <i>nationalistic</i> talk. Right?</li>
<li>Supporters of the theory that <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, his <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedon_e643.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">father</a> and his <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonians_5139.html" title="Ancient Macedonians">people</a> that lived in his <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">kingdom</a> were <i>not <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a></i>, say that their <i>genes</i> were not specially connected to the Greek genes.</li>
<li>On the other hand the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">guy</a> studied in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a>, spread the Hellenic idea to the depths of Asia, thought of himself being <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a> (or wanted to be one, at the very least) etc etc etc, ie did all those non-nationalistic things to display his Greekness.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the opposers to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greekness</a> of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonians_5139.html" title="Ancient Macedonians">Ancient Macedonians</a>, use an arguement that they themselves regard as <i>nationalistic</i> to support their position! I think the above rationale exposes blatant use of <i>double standards</i>. Don't you?</p>

<dd>Christos Anesti (Christ has risen), Aldux! Actually, no; I wasn't worried about user <i>"Makedonia"'s</i> crap. I was worried about everybody's reluctancy (including <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philhellen.html" title="Philhellen">philhellens</a>) to consider Ancient Macedonias as Greeks. As you said:

<p>Hello. I wanted to leave an irrelevant message to Hectorian and then saw your discussion. I expressed my opinion openly in hectorian's page only because the on-going dialogue was there, I didn't indend to get involved into it. I didn't see it as a significant subject so I didn't feel the need to bother you personally.

<p>Regarding your latest edit in 'Macedonian question', I'm under the impression that it gives an erroneous interpretation to Livy's record. The dialogue (if I remember correctly) takes place in the late 3rd century, during the second Punic war, where Macedon had allied itself to Carthage and <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aetolia.html" title="Aetolia">Aetolia</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The fact that Attic was adapted as the official-state language by Philip II is irrelevant to that time, and comes from a different source. Furthermore I'm of the opinion that the entire section on "who supports what" should be removed as it's treated in like 88 different articles already. Otherwise it can really get long and repetitive. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 21:11, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although it was 11 years ago and I do not now have the original letter from Mr Goryn, which claimed that Alexander the Great was a Slav and not a Greek, thus prompting my reply, the following letter I wrote was published on Tuesday, 5th January, 1995 in the Daily Telegraph:</p>
<p>Sir - Mr Goryn's letter (Dec 29th) does not reflect the true situtation in Skopje/Macedonia, and if his arguments were to be heeded they would not help. The Greeks do not have territorial ambitions over Skopje. No one in their right mind would wish to be involved with the political and economic disaster areas to the north of Greece. Nevertheless, the Greeks, a hard-working and prosperous people, would happily help their neighbours if the illegitimate claim on the name of Macedonia were to be dropped. If you travelled in this part of the world, you would soon apreciate that the true origins of Alexander the Great, the architecture and artefacts of the region are Greek, not Slav. The political shenanigans of Skopje would soon collapse if their outside abettors - probably Milosevich - were to be silenced.</p>

<p>Aldux, when the new flag was introduced in 1992 there was no indication from the parliament in Skopje or from the government that this was an adaptation of Vergina. There has never been official claims from the government (to my knowledge). Therefore to make such claims are POV. I hope you take my point and agree to keep my edit.

<p>I have to respectfully take issue with your removal of the "Fake Quote" section of the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petronius.html" title="Petronius">Petronius</a> article. You indicated it "hardly seems relevant." Well, some coworkers and I were discussing the quote today. None of us are particularly well versed in the Classics and all believed the quote was genuine (hey, we're programmers). I went to the article to grab and, when I found it wasn't there, went looking so I could add it as a legitimate quote. Thankfully, the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Petronius#False_quotation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Petronius#False_quotation" rel="nofollow">Wikiquote</a> still had a link back to the deleted section, which stopped me in my tracks and caused me to start looking at the history log.</p>
<p>Frankly, while I agree that dedicating an entire section for a false quote might seem unnecessary, the fact is that the quote is one of those delicious bits of wisdom that laymen like myself <i>want</i> to believe are correct (just look at all the false quotations attributed to Twain, Franklin, or even George Carlin floating around out on the Internet). I'm sure it is simply a matter of time before another layman like myself winds up adding the quote to the article as legitimate.</p>
<p>Would you consider restoring the section? I don't want to step on any toes. I understand if you'd want to reduce the size of it or restructure it, but there really should be <i>some</i> indication in the article that there's a false quote out there. If you think it the section should remain axed, please let me know why, either in either of our talk sections or in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Talk%7EPetronius_39e2.html" title="Talk:Petronius">Talk:Petronius</a>.</p>

Forgive me for not asuming good faith anymore when speaking to you Telex, but I can't endlessly tolerate the insults about my people from you and similar types. Like I said - your words and theories will not bring any good (even to what you think is your cause) , but will continue to spread balkan nationalistic poison. And the price is being paid and will continue to be paid by everybody in the region.

<p>Aldux I still havent got any comment from you - are you OK with the version that among other things implies that:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, <b>and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed</b>.</i></li>
<li>Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group</li>
<li><i>Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia</i></li>
<li>There was no resentment towards <i>the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region</i>, by removing that sentance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The text was far from perfect anyway, but this version is even closer to Macedonian negators positions. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealek_4962.html" title="User:Realek">Realek</a> 13:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to break-in but I need to make a remark. Nobody ever claimed that "Greek Macedonians" is a distinct ethnic group. However, I'm not aware of any wikipedia policy which strictly enforces the usage of an ethnic group's name in similar scenarios. Therefore I don't see any valid, non-biased arguments against the use of this term. As far as I'm concerned the name is in wide use by Balkan historians and has a separate entry in the Australian encyclopedia of ethnic origins (as Greek Macedonians arrived in Australia before Macedonia was unified with Greece). Today's Greek population is the amalgam of an ethnically similar, yet culturally diverse people which stressed from the Ionian sea to western Asia Minor. There was a huge cultural difference between the Greeks of the Venetian-held Ionian island and those of Pontus, and a disambiguation must be made where required. Having said that, I see no rational reason to ignore such important cultural elements due to a single editor's ignorance and chauvinist bias. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 20:06, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The evidence is quite clear that Albania as a nation did not exist prior to the 20th century. Giorgios Kastriotis was of Epirotian origin. That is already an established fact. The Epirotians are (as any high school child would know)a very ancient Greek tribe. How on earth did Albania suddenly start claiming the Epirotians is surprising me (Being half Epirotian myself I can trace my anscestors to late Byzantium-something very few people can do). In the 2oth century the western powers gave them North Epirus disregarding the fact that 90% of the population in that region were Greek (Ironically they claim the same in Kosovo today?!). They gave them the Byzantine Eagle as their new national symbol (basically stealing it from the legendary Kastriotis who used that regional Byzantine symbol as his emblem). Kastriotis was a devout Greek Orthodox Christian who fought the Ottomans very bravely. He corresponded with the Paleologi in order to combat the Ottoman onslaught till the very end. I challenge you (or anyone) to show me evidence where Scanderbeg considered himself to be Albanian and more so where the word Albanian exists during his time?! And let us not forget the last fact- that Giorgios Kastriotis' (scanderbeg) native language was Greek (there was no established Albanian language at the time.</p>

<dd>Well at least we can all agree that he was not a pure Albanian. But I urge for anyone to take a look at the fact that he was a prince in Epirus. And Epirus was a classical Greek Kingdom. I will say it should be looked into more (but his bio on Wikipedia should be presented as a a hero of Albania as well as Greece- to be fair).I can tell you Miskin one thing, Constantine Paleologos Dragas (The last Byzantine Emperor was surely Half Serbian and Half Greek).And guess who corresponded with the Byzantine Emperor?!</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also one other famous man Basil the Second also known as the Bulgar-slayer who was of the Macedonian dynasty fought a very famous Bulgar at the time- Samuel who by the way had a very questionable last name -Kometopoulos!? Go figure. What do I mean by all this? Its the fact that many Emperors were already of mixed descent-that is the point.That is why Scanderbeg cannot be portrayed as just Albanian!</p>

<p>You stated that I am in danger of violating 3RR for the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thracians.html" title="Thracians">Thracians</a> article. Well Aldux, you do emphasize the importance of placing sources whenever something new appears in an article. Case in point, you stated that you would allow the section "Illyrians as Dorians" to appear on the Illyrians article if I provided non-Greek sources. Fair enough. I would love to go an do some research to help further validate (or even dismiss) the content that I placed in the overall section.</p>
<p>Now here is the ironic part. You expect people to provide sources in order for them to validate their statements. A sound policy. For example, in the Illyrians article I completely understood where you were coming from and already decided to conduct some research (instead of engaging in a useless revert war). However, in the Thracians article the section I placed is supported by a source. To, in a sense, "warn" me for violating 3RR because the section I placed in the Thracians article is supported by a valid source is kind of rash. Of course, I don't expect you to agree with me (don't feel bad, a lot of people tend to disagree with me even when I tell them the truth).</p>
<p>Let's be realistic Aldux. Do you really think that banning me will accomplish anything? I am just asking out of curiousity. You know what, don't answer that question. I pretty much have a feeling that your answer will entail the following: "If it stops you from reverting articles, then yes!" Anyway, my job as a sociologist is to conduct research even if the results I get make members of mainstream academia want to commit acts of self-defenistration. Sure, I am what you call an "imperfect sociologist". Yet, I tend to like being unconventional from time to time since it makes life a little bit more interesting. However, you have to ask yourself every time I alter an article, "Why is Deucalionite doing this?" More often than not, I will give you an honest answer if you just ask instead of assume that I am changing articles just to upset you or anyone else for that matter.</p>
<p>Just so you know, I fixed the references in the Thracians article and there is still a reference that supports the section "Thracians and Myceneans". If you want to ban me and receive a barnstar just because I think people deserve the right to know about the Fourth International Congress of Thracology, then have fun. However, please do not follow a certain path that leads you to a place where words and actions don't coincide. Take care and remember that wooden nickels are not legal tender in 48 states. Over and out. - Deucalionite May 5, 2006 6:34 P.M.</p>

<p>Independently of the origins of ancient Macedonians, I think you would agree that everyone in both antiquity and modern times would accept that the Macedonian ruling class descended of the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argos.html" title="Argos">Argives</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heracles.html" title="Heracles">Heraclids</a>, and most definitely participated in the Olympic Games. It is blatant from ancient citations (e.g. Callisthenes, Demosthenes) that Philip II and Alexander III did claim Greek origin at least for themselves (and in several occasions for all Macedonians). Not long ago you said that Pontus was not a fully Hellenic Kingdom because the royal family claimed Persian origin. Aren't you using double standards in the case of Macedon? Why are many Roman Emperors labeled by an ethnic origin and Macedonians aren't? It's almost as if it's been done on purpose. Macedon was 100% Hellenised by the 4th century BC, and it's very probable and well supported that it's been Hellenic since the beginning. Yet the articles deal with it as if it was a barbarian Kingdom similar to Illyria. Do you honestly find the Macedon-related articles completely unbiased? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 11:29, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I wasn't very clear. I don't wish to change the status of the Macedonian language nor try to refer to Macedon as another Greek Kingdom. It was different in several cultural aspects and it has to be differentiated, at least during the Classic period (in Hellenistic time there was a clear assimilation). My objections are on the articles of the Macedonian Kings who felt themselves to be Greek (relates to our older discussion on the criteria of an ethnic group). Alexander III's and Philip II's article nowhere mentions how that at least the Argead dynasty was of Greek origin. In my opinion this is not mentioned due to the general chaos which evolves the word "macedonia", and not because it was simply forgotten. I don't think this is NPOV. The Macedonian royalty has always participated in the Olympics, meaning that they viewed themselves and were viewed by others as Greek. If they were really the descendants of Indo-european Greek-speakers is something irrelevant, let alone impossible to prove. I'm telling you this because I'm plannig to make some edits that will be based on ancient quotations, and I don't want it to be viewed as POV-pushing. I'll cite sources accordingly. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to know why you have the south slavic name of Kastoria on the Kastoria article. Who cares what its called in another language, its a Greek city.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I read what you wrote on <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/Talk%7EW%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_f1c8.html" title="Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło">Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło</a> about the attempt to rename the page into <b>Wladyslaw II/V of Poland, Jogaila of Lithuania</b>, and I agree totally with you. I think as rule there can't be more than <b>one</b> variant of a name in the title of an article. If more than one variant is possible, the title must chose only one and the others must be explained in the text itself and redirects must be used from alternative titles. If such alternative titles were admitted in the article's title itself, then we'd have to rename, for examples, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepanakert.html" title="Stepanakert">Stepanakert</a> into <b>Stepanakert/Xankəndi</b>, <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tighina.html" title="Tighina">Tighina</a> into <b>Tighina/Bender/Bendery</b> or <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> into <b>2003 invasion/liberation of Iraq</b>...</p>
<p>I am myself implicated in a very long and endless debate which is, I think, similar to this one. It's about the need to rename the article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_X_bf45.html" title="Pope Stephen X">Pope Stephen X</a> into <b>Pope Stephen IX</b>, and so on until <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_III_26f2.html" title="Pope Stephen III">Pope Stephen III</a> into <b>Pope Stephen II</b>. The historical reasons of this naming problem are detailed in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope-elect_Stephen_4cfd.html" title="Pope-elect Stephen">Pope-elect Stephen</a>. Those historical facts are not the matter of the debate. Everybody agrees on those facts. The problem is some users want to rename <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_X_bf45.html" title="Pope Stephen X">Pope Stephen X</a> into <b>Pope Stephen IX (or X)</b>, which is an absurdity because of the same reasons as above.</p>
<p>I've launched this debate on 19 February and it is endless because it seems to interest very few people and it's impossible to reach a majority. I'm now prospecting for other people who would share my opinion on the matter. If you think you have something to say about this, I would be very glad if you did on <a href="../../../p/o/p/Talk%7EPope_Stephen_X_f464.html" title="Talk:Pope Stephen X">Talk:Pope_Stephen_X</a>.

I also agree with 'former' rather than 'Former' because that is how it was mentioned in UN resolution 817 [<a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N93/203/74/IMG/N9320374.pdf?OpenElement" class="external autonumber" title="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N93/203/74/IMG/N9320374.pdf?OpenElement" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>]. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 14:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry it took me so long to respond. Im avoiding Wikipedia lately because it's really frustrating for me to see what's on the "macedonian" pages. For a Macedonian it is a higly offensive enviroment. I wasn't angry with you Aldux, I was just dissapointed because without neutral people balancing the Greek majority over Macedonians those pages will slide to nasty greek propaganda. As for Telex, considering his knowledge in wikipedia, style and behaviour - I doubt he's a newbie. I know it's not a nice thing to say, but at least I'm honest and I dont hide my thoughts behind nice words like so many hipocrites here do, but their actions make them transparent anyway. But on to the sticky points:</p>
<ol>
<li>I dont know what was your intention but a sentance like: <i>The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed</i> clearly suggests that a distinct identity was absent prior to 1945. I'm confused... Do you support that view?????</li>
<li>I know what you feel about Macedonian Greeks as an ethnic group, that's why I was even more surprised. In your answer to me you say that it's not implying that they are actualy an ethnic group, but the sentance clearly states them as an ethnic group. And you say that compromises are necesary, but how can you make a compromise with a clearly false statemant? And how many compromises should be made under pressure from all kinds of nationalists. To be honest the version that I red before writing this was acceptable to me but again makes me wonder how many Greek explanations, notes, footnotes and so on should theese pages have? Are these pages here for Greek nationalist to express every thought they have and to put pro-greek nationalist POVs in every corner of the articles???</li>
<li>You are wrong about this one. Macedonia wasn't part of "Serbia" in the kingdom of Yugoslavia. Serbia simply didn't exist as an separate entity in the kingdom - Yugoslavia consisted of "banovini". So it wasn't separated from Serbia, but was granted a republic status. And the belif that Tito did whatewer he wanted with Macedonia and the Macedonians is really hard to belive. Altough some of the points mentioned about his "pro-Macedonian" motives are valid, a crucial one is left out: the Macedonian comunist party and liberation army were much more loosely conected to the Yugoslav ones than others in Yugoslavia. There were significant pro-independance forces in Macedonia and this couldn't have been ignored by Tito and KPJ, so concessions to the Macedonians were necesary to keep Macedonia in the new federation peacefuly.</li>
<li>I realy dont understand why I should provide sources for such well known things, especially since it will be reverted anyway (with or without dismissing the sources). All this while some are slipping all kinds of stuff into articles and keeping them there by majorisation in rewert wars.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finaly, you advise me: <i>the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources</i>. I don't think that we should get into sourcing that kind of stuff. I think that those editors are clearly not-well intentioned and I won't accept playing their game by trying to proove such things as my grandfathers national feelings. And even if I do it, it wont make any impression on them. They'll stick to their theories. Altough I'm not a wikipedia member for a long time, I have learned that some people here will negate even pure mathematics.</p>

<dd>This just makes me laugh - the article currently says:
<dl>
<dd><i>The majority of Macedonians today inhabit parts of the geographical region of Macedonia along with other ethnic groups, mainly Greeks (known as Greek Macedonians or simply Macedonians in this region), Albanians and Bulgarians.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It does not imply that they are a seperate ethnic group. On a second tone, it's not the evil Graeco-Bulgarian requiring the sources, it's Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">policy</a>, so if you want to work without citing sources, I suggest you start a wiki of your own (call it Realekpedia). BTW, yes, even in Macedonian nationalism, there was some confusion over over the alleged ethnicity of the Macedonians at that time. According to Macedonian nationalists, the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miladinov_Brothers_90f0.html" title="Miladinov Brothers">Miladinov Brothers</a>, who wrote what they called <i>Bulgarian</i> folk songs, in what they described as the <i>Bulgarian</i> languages, really meant <i>Macedonian</i>, just there was some ethnic confusion at that time. As for your claim that we should believe your assertions about the self identification of your gradparents, I'll respond with your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Macedonian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50793912" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Macedonian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50793912" rel="nofollow">words</a>: <i>Why should anybody belive you???

<p>Thank you for the warm welcome, Aldux. I am not quite sure how to get in touch with you, but I hope this is the correct way. If you have visited my User Page(?), you will have seen my brief biography. I am a Zambian and am interested in the history of the whole of the southern African region.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I use the computers of Manchester City Council Libraries, in England. As a member of the libraries, I have access to a whole lot of online resources, such as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and the Encyclopedia Britannica Online Academic Edition. I have been using these to get the gist of the material, then I edit them to avoid plagiarism. Some of the stuff is what I already know from my education in Zambia and my personal reading around the subject of Zambian history. Even if I don't have the books at hand, I have read them and I know that the people who used them as references in Oxford Dictionary or Encyclopedia Britannica have the correct details.</p>
<p>I hope to make good contributions to the Wikipedia, although I am worried that there is so much to read!</p>
<p>Thanks, again.</p>

<p>Why did you remove the section "Illyrians as Dorians" in the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrians.html" title="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> article again? Did you actually read the section or did you just assume that it would be the same thing as last time? Did you check the footnotes? The least you could have done was inform me as to why you removed the section this time. I guess you failed in that department. Your job pretty much is to revert article content and ask questions later, right?</p>
<p>I don't know. Perhaps you perceive me as an amateur propagandist and nothing else. Nice assumption, but wrong person. Well, since you cannot give me decent reasons why you reverted the section this time, allow me to help list them for you:</p>
<p>1) Carleton S. Coon is evil and should not be placed in the section.</p>
<p>2) Etienne Balibar and Alexander Fol are not worthy scholars.</p>
<p>3) Roman sources from the 2nd century BC that discussed Queen Teuta's "half-Hellenic" country never existed.</p>
<p>4) Polybius is a fictional character from a science-fiction movie.</p>
<p>5) Greek mythology is not a metaphorical record of oral stories about actual people, but a mere collection of lies.</p>
<p>6) The concept of "barbarian" is simple only meaning "non-Greek" and never meaning "unsophisticated Greek".</p>
<p>7) Sociological analyses of the ancient Greek political climate have no relevance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Of course, the first answer I expect from you when you read this is as follows: "I removed the section because it is 'original research' and there is no one who supports that the Illyrians spoke Greek." Or something along those lines. Yet, you fail to take into consideration the <b>possibility</b> of a connection between Illyrian tribes and Doric tribes. I do not expect you or anyone else to accept the section's content as gospel (though I would be flattered if you did). Besides, if such a connection between Illyrians and Dorians did exist in the past, then why not explain it? I placed sources that validate whatever aspects of "original research" you might find in the section. I guess there is nothing that satisfies your demands.</p>
<p>Here is what you can do. Why don't you actually read the section and make constructive suggestions? No wait. Here is an even better idea. Why don't you actually help me conduct research to validate (or denounce) what was written in the article section? The only way your going to see an expanded Illyrians article is to actually help people who are trying to do such a thing. Being an editor does not only entail hacking, slashing, and decimating content. There are also procedures for refining content and constructively enhancing information that may actually prove to be valuable for readers. Of course, you probably know this already. Or not. I really don't care up to this point.</p>
<p>I am going to put the section back and I expect from you to "warn" me about my violating 3RR (without of course explaining why you removed the section for the second time).

<p>It's a pleasure; hadn't done any reading on Greece since high school, &amp; that was a few years ago. Very pleasant break from mundane life ot be poking around the ancient writers again. Personally, I prefer BCE, but really not fussed either way. Consistency is important - I will go &amp; change them myself right now as its a dumb format mistake to make. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 16:14, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I've noticed you're working on a major rewrite of <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomaks.html" title="Pomaks">Pomaks</a>. It seems like the article corresponds to the article <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Bulgarians_a3cd.html" title="Muslim Bulgarians">Muslim Bulgarians</a> (<i>Pomaks</i> is just a local/informal/derogatory name) and I believe we should merge them, but would like to know what you think first. I'm interested in this quite vague and sometimes controversial topic and would like to help create a good, neutral and unbiased article. Also, we should settle on some transliteration — whether the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanization_of_Bulgarian_da1c.html" title="Romanization of Bulgarian">official one</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_transliteration.html" title="Scientific transliteration">scientific transliteration</a>. The second is more accurate while the first one is... official&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">→ Тодор Божинов / Todor Bozhinov</a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a> 21:16, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's all right, I only meant making them one article and didn't intend to imply <i>Muslim Bulgarians</i> is a better name — as you said, it isn't. The article(s) and the topic really need major work and good referencing, so what you've assigned to yourself is an important task. Count on me for any help I could offer. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">→ Тодор Божинов / Todor Bozhinov</a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a> 21:40, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hectorian, that's a nice "Latin" nick-name you've got yourself. It's crystal clear to me that, should you really be a Vlach, you belong to the sad faction of the Grecomani Vlachs. A sort of reversed <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janissary.html" title="Janissary">Janissary</a>, exposed from early childhood to Greek only culture, language, school, propaganda, so much in fact that he came to believe he's a Greek, am I correct? But it's your choice, your life. In fact it's too late you became something else by now, so well done, here's another assimilated Vlach, what's the big deal? We are in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, I hope time will come when the Greeks will allow you to have your first Vlach language newspaper or your first Vlach language FM radio station. Even the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baluba.html" title="Baluba">Baluba</a> tribes in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo.html" title="Congo">Congo</a> have probably got their own media by now. You're not asking too much inn'it? What? You don't want this? You don't want to offend the Greeks by asking for rights for Vlach language? Listen, the Greeks are well-known for their generosity and tolerance. So here is yet another reason for wanting to remain a Greek wanabee. Better on the side of the bosses than being the underdog, inn'it?

<dd>Tired, but i will respond to these 'comments': my nick name is not Latin (apart from the -ian, of course). my real name is more greek than u can imagine... apropos, your nick is vlach, isn't it?:p. i am an aromanian (in fact half-aromanian), proud to say it, and i belong to the vast majority of aromanians who have always considered themselves Greeks (cause this is simply what we are). a Janissary? Huh? no need to comment on that (it was deliberately said to bring tension in the discussion). i was indeed exposed to greek culture since i was born...u know, greeks are usually exposed to greek culture, italians to italian and so on... and my ancestors, as further back to the history of my family i can go, they were also exposed to greek culture. vlach language newspaper? hmmm in which alphabet, with which grammar and syntax? u seem to forget that aromanian evolved as an idiom from vulgar latin and never had a written form. not to mentioned that it has always been used along with greek from its speakers. perhaps u are dreaming of someone who will invent all things necessary to create a new ethnic identity? u know, more things are needed for a nation to be born... not to forget that their is no historian from those early times talking about a migration of the romanians to the south (speaking about greek propaganda? why don't u look at the romanian one?)of course, there will always be <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkiviadis_Diamanti_di_Samarina_09d7.html" title="Alkiviadis Diamanti di Samarina">Alkiviades s</a>, trying to create something that never existed for their own purposes (i know that u have been editting articles related to him... always remember that he was a facist <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawn_%28chess%29.html" title="Pawn (chess)">pawn</a>, with no supporters (perhaps the name he should have would be <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephialtes.html" title="Ephialtes">Ephialtes</a>). and for me, all those (a couple of people, i mean) who desperately try to split the aromanians from the rest of the Greeks, are just wannabe princes or dictators. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 00:54, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everything has started with Greeks like Miskin etc. and Italians (if he really is one) who became Greek bootliskers the likes of Aldux deleting and vandalizing my editing. Don't get me wrong. I was just insinuating in a very elegant and gentle manner that according to some scholars <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Cyril_166e.html" title="Saint Cyril">Saint Cyril</a> might have had Slavic roots but that was enough to cause an immense outrage among the Greeks folowed by a violent and co-ordinated strike.

Ceea ce-mi displace e faptul ca se ascund, se deghizeaza. Ia-l de exemplu pe acest Aldux. El pretinde ca e italian pe cand, in realitate e grec. Ei vor sa creeze confuzie sa dea impresia ca punctul lor de vedere e sustinut si de non-greci. In acest context, oare nu e logic ca si noi sa ne organizam efectiv si sa ne ajutam reciproc? <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostolos_Margaritis_aa4f.html" title="User:Apostolos Margaritis">Apostolos Margaritis</a> 11:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think Italians really look towards their Eastern European neighbour Greece today with too much <a href="../../../a/w/e/Awe.html" title="Awe">awe</a> in particular or looking for any kind of inspiration. It's the Greeks who buy italiki kouzines, design, cars, food, gellata, clothes, fashion, you name them and NOT the other way round. In fact I've never seen any Greek product being sold or offered for purchase or advertized in Italy. Since you claim you're from Florence Aldux, I remember being in a cafe in Firenze and a group of noisy Greek tourists entering in haste and sitting near our table. The Italian waiter (dressed in starched white shirt and <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">bow tie</a> and extremely courteously and the Greeks putting the order quite rudely and then (almoust tapping the waiter) on his shoulder (a la greque) told him not to worry because Italians and Greeks are allegedly 'una faccia una razza'. The waiter pulled up a wry face and cleared his throat not bothering to hide his disgust towards his customers. Poor Greeks believed that the Italian would feel flatered but he was clearly looking down at his Eastern (and rather bumpkin) so-called relations. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostolos_Margaritis_aa4f.html" title="User:Apostolos Margaritis">Apostolos Margaritis</a> 16:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Response to unsighned contribution, above. Italian olive oil can be up to 50 per cent Greek, but due to import export regulations it is not declared as such. As for 'una faca una raca', the joy of Italy is its variety, hence Italians will say that this Greek moto applies to the Italians <b>south</b> of Rome. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 16:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haha, that's a true story! My uncle produces olive oil in Peloponnese and sells most of it to Italian companies who pay him much better than the Greek ones. Italian and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Cretan</a> mafias control most of the oil production in the area.

<dd>Unfortanately for Greece, this is far from true; Peloponnesian oil is really quite bad, and I know because I've tasted it quite often. And I know what I'm speaking about; I'm an olivicultore myself, and I'm afraid that their simply isn't competition for Greece. But it's true that Greek oil (and Tunisian, Spaniard, Portoguese) are mixed with sothern Italian oil, which anyway, telling the truth, is also quite mediocre.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 21:53, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's like saying that French wine is bad. Where's the good oil then in your opinion? Don't tell me that you find Tuscan oil better than Greek and Sicilian. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, I never even thought the question was disputed; in Italy at least, this is given for granted, and Tuscan oil is sold at a much higher price than Sicilian oil. An important element is the oil acidity, which is 0.4% as a rule in Tuscany, but can go down to 0.1% in the best places. Also, there's the difference between collecting them from the trees or waiting them to fall; the last solution generally gives a worst oil. On the good side, southern Italian oil have a much higher productivity for tree, if lesser quality.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 10:51, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know quite afew Tuscans who would swear that Tuscan oil is the best in the world, but I've met few people who would share this thought. Although not an expert myself, I've worked in a high-class Italian restaurant owned by Sicilians and run by Neopolitans and they imported Greek oil because they claimed it was of better quality. Only 5% of the exported Greek oil is sold under Greek brands, and chances are that you it's not top quality. What I'm saying is that I don't think you've tasted the real thing. You probably know that there's a quality standard for every product, and in the case of the olive oil, quality essentially depends on the olive. Similarly the quality of wine depends on the quality of the grape. If there are better quality of grapes growing in France and better quality of olives growing in Sicily, there's not much you can do in order to compete their potential success in wine or olive oil production. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dorks exist everywhere. I would give you dozens of counter-examples from Italian (or British, or French, or German...) tourists, but I think that it is wrong to generalise this behavior to the whole of the Italian population. Same with the Greeks, but you fail ofcourse to understand that. As for the Greek <i>products</i>, well, you have selective retention or categorization there too: Try <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frappe.html" title="Frappe">frappe</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/t/Feta.html" title="Feta">feta</a>, tourism, hotels, fabrics (I know quite a few internationally famous Greek brands -since I happen to be in the business) and shipping just out of the top of my head. Ofcourse, Greeks don't have that extra fashionable background of the "Made in Italy" tag, but then again, so do the Germans or the Brits. Nobody accuses them of being inferior in <i>inspiration</i> because of that though, the same way as nobody accuses the Italians of being unworthy ship-owners.

<dd>Also, I find it most suspicious that R. Macedonia is willing to accept Bosniak, Aromanian, Turkish minorities, is being highly criticised over its treatment of its Albanians and Serbs (Albania and Serbia border them), and Bulgarians and Greeks officially don't exist, but they are willing to speculate on hundreds of thousands of Macedonians in Bulgaria and Greece. I hope no one denies that there are self-identifying Bulgarians over there... recognition of minorities is obviously selective (just like in Greece). --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 22:46, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Aldux!(for your nice words in Nikola's talk-page):). Italian infuence is still seen in the Dodecanese (they were italian 49 years ago), but mostly in the Ionian islands (u know... had been venetian for a long time, many italian tourists go there every summer, italy is very close, they never were under turkish oppression...). about what u asked, Telex gave u indeed a good answer: the Uniates are not 'respected' in Greece (perhaps we prefer to see things clear, and not dressed up:p). most of the catholics in greece live in Paros, Tinos-half of the population- (the last island to fall under turkish rule in 1714, if i am not wrong), in Patra (i don't know why...) and of course in the Ionian islands (for the reasons i said). In the Ionian islands the dialect spoken has many Italian loanwords and sounds <b>really</b> like italian in accent (that's why i called it graeco-italian pidgin). and yes, i know the special sacred position Zakynthus has in italian poetry and literature... Foscolo was from there, afterall! also (perhaps u didn't know that) the greek national poet, Solomos, was half of Italian(venetian) origins.

<dd>Ciao! My dad is from <a href="../../../p/a/x/Paxos.html" title="Paxos">Paxos</a>. My grandma used to have an Italian accent. I wish I could reproduce it in writing quoting her say: "Ma ton Ái Spyrídhona" or "O-po-po symforá sou, syntelía sou mávri..." When I was young, she used to cook her specialty "pastitsádha" (spaghetti with meat and tomato sauce [slurp!]), and she used to unlock the little "portéli" in her garden to let us in. Even her name sounded Italian, or at least it had an Italian ending: "Mavretta". If you ever go to Paxos, do visit the traditional cafe of Kyr'Theófrastos in Lakka main square, and drink "tsitsibirra", a local special spicy ginger-ale that can't be exported coz the bottles blow up in the transport! There are thousands of Italian tourists in feragosto. So many, that when you bump on someone in the street, you choose subconciously to say "scusi", rather than "syghnómi".

<dd>I know how you call them. We call them simply "Makarónia me kokkinistó" (Spaghetti with red-ed [meat]). In Paxos, however, they are named after <a href="../../../../it/p/a/s/pasticcio_c124.html" class="extiw" title="it:pasticcio">it:pasticcio</a>. The "porta" feminine diminutive would be "portítsa" or "portoúla", not neuter "portéli" and my grandma would be called "Mavra" not "Mavretta"... I wish I could remember more of her strange words, coz I really did love her a lot. At one point I was given a lexicon of Paxos words. I remember only one (not Italian) that I liked: "anapapsólia". It refers to some strange rings hanging from the ceiling above the wedding bed, to help the groom immobilise his virgin wife. The etymology is from "anápafsi" (rest) and "psolí" (ah-hem, quello che questi dello Sud hanno piu grande). BTW nice work on the <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomaks.html" title="Pomaks">Pomaks</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the input. Regarding "related ethnic groups", actually I wasn't even thinking of the Macs.; after all, I'm not <i>that</i> afraid of our Macedonian friends...;-) I simply made the choice on the ground that the key elements of the Pomaks are language (Bulgarian) and religion; so for this I inserted the Torbesh and Gorani, who are both Slavophones and Muslims; the key aspects of Pomak identity; after all, if they were simply Christian they would simply be common Bulgarians; while if they weren't Slavophones they would simply be Turks. Probably I should add Bosnians to the list to make this point clearer. As for the number of Pomaks in Greece, I'll probably put a range of number in its place; there isn't a linguistic census that can be used with certainity, and I don't think it's up to me to chose the right number, so I'll simply give the highest and lowest number proposed by scholars, and discuss the question better in the section on the Pomaks in Greece, that'll be the next section I'll do.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 11:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure there is, but I find the etymology quite descriptive of the particular guy's character. It's just one little summarising phrase, which deserves being there.

Too much wikiwork, I need a rest. As for not awnsering on the talk, I agreed with Ultramarine's points, so didn't see any need to add my point, as it was the same of his.

<p>I think you should write the things referring to the commune itself in the titular entry (infobox - which, remember, has the title <b>Comune di ...</b>, geography, area, population, footer, etc.). If a city within the commune has more importance, you can write a separate article for it (i.e., with the relative <b>History</b> and <b>Main sights</b>) and insert links between the twos (i.e. <b>See also</b>).

<p>Hi Aldux, I've given some thought to our last exchange on my talk and wonder if you would accept a nomination for adminship. I glanced over your recent edits and think you would find the privileges useful. A word of caution: I've never seen a nominator who had voluntary desysopped previously. There's an outside chance this may affect some voters, so you may want to seek another nominator. If you're still interested, please glance over <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_requests_for_adminship_d0e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship">the guide</a> and get back to me. There's no rush, so feel free to give it some thought. If you say yes, I'll dig into your edits some more and come up with a nomination in a couple days.

<li>You have relatively low usage of edit summaries. I would suggest forcing edit summary prompts through your editing preferences tab and making a note of it in the RFA</li>
<li>Use of vulgarity in edit summaries, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61831572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61831572" rel="nofollow">this</a>, even if it is mild vulgarity to exasperating editing, is frowned upon and may earn some opposes.

<p>Hi Aldux, would you be interested in commenting on a matter of (as usual, slightly ideological POV-pushing) dispute about Greek history? It's about the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souliotes.html" title="Souliotes">Souliotes</a>, and we are having the usual ethnic disputes, about the weight of the contribution of the Albanian population element in pre-modern Epirus this time.

<p>Yeah, when I looked at the two articles, I knew that the cross-wiki was a bit off, but it was off for "Hellenisitc civilization" as well. I'm thinking that a completely new page is in order. A google search shows "Hellenistic period" as more often used (433k vs. 190k), but you being an expert on the time period would be better informed as to what the appropriate title will be. Do you think I should create the new article and keep adding translated sections, or should I simply continue work at the talk page and upload the new article when complete, by the way? Also, a minor note, but in English you would say you're "enthusiastic" (or "enthused" if you want to say you've "become enthusiastic," but no one really uses this word and its a bit pedantic) rather than "enthusiast." A better term altogether to use would be "overjoyed" or "excited," though. Don't take it as nitpicking, but as constructive criticism, though. :) — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="green">(Yom)</font></a> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">contribs</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethiopia_7101.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethiopia"><font color="red">E</font></a></small> 02:18, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not at all sure, but then what's new, where Chad's concerned!<br />
My edit was based on this [<a href="http://www.izf.net/izf/ee/pro/index_frameset.asp?url=http://www.izf.net/IZF/EE/pro/tchad/2034.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.izf.net/izf/ee/pro/index_frameset.asp?url=http://www.izf.net/IZF/EE/pro/tchad/2034.asp" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>], which quotes a presidential decree of 15 February 2006, nominating ministers, and showing the GNNT under the responsibility of the Minister for Territorial Administration. (Incidentally it also shows the Ministry of Defence as being attached to the Presidency.)<br />
On the other hand, I also found this <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mgnYqpH4-I4J:www.primature-tchad.com/%3F2006/05/10/170-nomminations-au-sein-de-l-armee-nationale-tchadienne+Tchad+ministere+garde+nationale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mgnYqpH4-I4J:www.primature-tchad.com/%3F2006/05/10/170-nomminations-au-sein-de-l-armee-nationale-tchadienne+Tchad+ministere+garde+nationale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, dated 10 May 2006, which says the President, through the Ministry of Defence, nominated two military officers to senior posts in the GNNT. (But this may mean that these are two Army officers being posted to jobs in the GNNT, not that the GNNT is under the Ministry of Defence.)<br />
However, going back to 2004, there are draft minutes of proceedings in the National Assembly <a href="http://www.tchad-gpmps.org/compterendu02du22oct04.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tchad-gpmps.org/compterendu02du22oct04.doc" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> that say the Minister of Defence is responsible the Army, Air Force, GNNT and Gendarmerie.<br />
But finally, legislation dating from 1994, that appears still to be in force <a href="http://droit.francophonie.org/doc/html/td/loi/fr/1994/1994dftdlgfr8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://droit.francophonie.org/doc/html/td/loi/fr/1994/1994dftdlgfr8.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, does show the GNNT as part of the Ministry of the Interior.<br />
So, you can take your pick. My guess is that responsibility is shared and has moved back and forth. Lots of the GNNT are presumably still tied up guarding people, buildings and prisoners in every prefecture and sous-prefecture across the country and therefore take their orders from the local civil administrator, which makes it sensible for them to be part of the territorial administration ministry. On the other hand, when there is rebel activity, some of them presumably get mobilised to fight alongside the Army, so there would be more sense for them to be under the defence ministry. Don't know if this helps!<br />

<p>Congratulations on your recent granting of admin powers. I would like to draw your attention to a worthy use of those powers - the closing of copyvio reports listed on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>. As you'll see there are many tens of such reports that need dealing with each day, and the backlog is barely being kept under control despite a couple of us spending lots of time working on them. The process is pretty easy and sorting a few only takes a little time and with a group of people helping, we can keep the backlog under control easily - just review the article &amp; the source to ensure it is a copy, and then delete. Any help would certainly be appreciated - any questions, ask away. <a href="../../../k/c/o/User%7EKcordina_3fec.html" title="User:Kcordina">Kcordina</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/c/o/User_talk%7EKcordina_5ecd.html" title="User talk:Kcordina">Talk</a></sup> 09:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks.

<dd>That was nothing, I only saw that the dispute went on and on without a consensus being found, and much worse, Pierre risked making the talk so inflamatory to make the talks of Balkans-related articles masterpieces of good manners.

<dd>Regarding what's happening to your talk page maybe you should consider doing what an editor said wrote on his user talk: "Hello. Thanks for visiting my talk page. I really enjoy hearing from people, but if you decide to post here you should know that I reserve the right to delete, without response, comments that I determine -- in my sole, exclusive, and quite probably biased judgment -- to be abusive, irrelevant, or simply annoying."</dd>

<p>To make it clear, you are free to delete anything Pierre wrote on your talk page, as this is <b>your</b> talk page. If he insists, I'll you, so don't worry for that. But be careful to keep calm, and especially read what he wrote at <a href="../../../j/k/e/User_talk%7EJkelly_f93a.html" title="User talk:Jkelly">User talk:Jkelly</a>, as he's pushing there against you, trying to get you blocked. It's a pity I have so little knowledge of the argument, cause I can't help you much; I only hope Jkelly will be able to do something. I must admit also I'm partly trying to avoid direct confrontation, as he terribly remembers me the Balcanic ultranationalists I've met so many time in wikipedia, and God knows I already have had too many disputes with that sort of guys. But please remember, keep calm; at the end Pierre's rudeness and personal attacks will only damage him, not you.

<p>Bad English?? Come on, this is a cheapshot :) ... Not the case i am afraid.</p>
<p>'"there are minority communities in Greek Macedonia with their own dialect and history but where the overwhelming majority consists of Greeks (who are also known as Macedonians in the region), as well as in Albania and Bulgaria"</p>
<p>Talking of bad english... This phrase does seem to make sense. Am i not entitle to change it? Seems not.</p>
<p>(In any case between you and me there is no seperate history and if you beleive so please make some reffereces to you sources).</p>
<p>The lack of refferences is quite evident in the whole of the text. I do not see why i should provide bibliography for altering (in good faith) passages that state important but in a way unaccurate facts and do not have any reffences to back them up. In any case, i will do so if anyone asks me for it but i wont lose my time when it seems that certain people are quite satisfied with their wotk and do not accept comments and corrections.(but if this is the case they should not write here, really)</p>
<p>As for the ancient period paragraph. It is quite misleading since it does not refer to ancient times at all. Propably should exclude all the passage from text. It is indeed a controversial article and a very amusing one to follow up, from its creation to the seemingly result. Is like drafting a treaty between hostal tribes. The fact that large parts of the outcome derive from original contributions with very clear, highly nationalistic positions for the one (mostly) and the other side is absolutely charming.</p>
<p>Considering all that, i think that i propably could lower my expectations but of course not abandon them. This article has flaws and can be improved. The fact that is controversial should not be considered a problem. There is no thing like status quo ante in wiki as far as i know. In any case my alterations reffer to comonly accepted facts undisputed by all sides. I will sincerely continue keeping you company in your efforts. Thanks in advance Haas</p>

<dd>So have you read the article and decided for yourself, or are you mearly going on this 'reputation', which im sure a person like PHG neither desires or requires, as they obiously consider scholarship paramount to dogma. I shouldnt have to remind you that wikipedia is open to anyone - you are engaging in vandalism of someone's legitimate edit, which has not yet been disproven in any argument. Indeed, I am still awaiting PHG's reply - I am unsure whether he/she plans to reply at all, as they are usually punctual - until then, your reversion amounts to vandalism. I am beggining to suspect ulterior motives here, i.e. Hellenic bias, else why did you revert the image, and not allow PHG to decide? <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVastu_ae82.html" title="User:Vastu">Vastu</a> 18:01, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thank you for taking the time to express an opinion in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Eluchil404_9c2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Eluchil404">my recent request for adminship</a>. I have withdrawn my self-nomination because there seemed little prospect for further productive discussion or the formation of a consensus to promote. Many commentators offered constructive critisism that I will use to improve myself as a user. Others suggested that the nomination was premature and that a re-nom in a few months would be more likely to gain consensus. You suggested that I did not yet have enough experience for adminship. If you have the time, I would be curious as to what level of edits or time on wikipedia you consider sufficient. As there is a wide range of opinion on these matters I want to do my best to gauge the rough consensus on these issues.

<dd>N'Djamena Accord sounds good - as a title, not in practical terms. From what I've read the accord does not differ at all from the last one so its significance is highly questionable. Regarding Janjaweed, it seems as though the Sudanese government provides money and arms to the Janjaweed, but their actual control and oversight over Janjaweed incursions is unknown and debatable. Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government have similar goals but have fought against each other, according to HRW's report, during this conflict. <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">Tchadienne</a> 22:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Iasson is a banned user, then the thing to do is to rollback every edit from a sockpuppet (even any good edits). It is annoying, especially when other editors who don't know the situation get worked up about it (this happens especially when rolling back messages to user talkpages). But it is the only way to enforce a ban, and it is also the only way to make sure that attempting to create new accounts and continue disrupting Wikipedia is not rewarding. I don't know who Iasson is, which suggests that it might make sense to make sure that you have a summary of the situation handy to link to and to ask more admins to help out.

<dd>With checkuser-confirmed socks of banned users, one should delete any articles that they created and are the only real contributor to. Just make sure that the deletion summary gives the reason.

<p>Sure, if there are two sides which are just blindly reverting without any discussion on the talk page, even if they haven't violated the 3RR it would be fine to block them both for a few hours to calm down. At least get them to stop reverting while you try and calm the situation down. Of course, remember blocking is preventative rather than punative, so if you do block them, watch their talk pages, and point out that you will happily unblock them if they agree to stop reverting each other and start discussing things on the talk page. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 22:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is it that you are one of those that support that rediculous myth that there was homosexuality in ancient Greece and Rome. Homosexuality was not commonplace back then and there is no credible evidence to suggest that it was.

<p>Hi, I saw that you protected the page because of Bonaparte's actions. The only problem is that with your move exactly that version was protected what Criztu and Bonaparte like to see - the one without the Hungarian name. I don't know whether you noticed that Criztu launched a campaign against Hungarian geographical names in Transylvania, and this debate was part of that campaign. I would like to kindly ask you to restore the name "Szatmár megye" in the lead. <a href="../../../z/e/l/User%7EZello_a94f.html" title="User:Zello">Zello</a> 21:11, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 72-hour block is a result of repeated use of anonymous and new (i.e. sockpuppet) accounts to evade the original 24-hour block; the bloc was reset twice before it was extended to 72h. The block evasion includes repeating the tendentious edit which got him blocked in the first place, as well as some pretty blatant trolling. I don't think there is likely to be much support for reducing the block. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:03, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand Tchadienne's many good edits, and have no issue with those. However, sockpuppeting to evade the block is specifically against policy, and we shouldn't just ignore it by letting the block lapse. When Tchadienne actually stops evading the block (without us having to range block his/her entire ISP), I'll be happy to consider undoing the block. Until then, I think a cooldown is necessary. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 02:12, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me put it this way: I have no problem with having Tchadienne's block removed (or reduced). However, since I didn't place the range block personally, I'd prefer you go to JzG and advocate for the removal of the range block as well as the block on Tchadienne.

<dd>(edit conflict)The reason is very simple: it's extremely simple to detect Mywayyy, as all his IP's use 88.218.xxxx. Don't think that I revert and semiprotect out a love for Turkish names; if it was for me, Turkish mame should be in the lead only in Western Thrace, Rhodes and Kos, as only there can you find Turks, and I have difficulties understanding why we put all these Turkish mames, except for some sort of diplomatic reciprocity. You say they are socks of banned users; but I can't use my admin powers on simple suspects, and I have very little knowledge of editors active in Turkey related articles, so I can't use the tags I use for Mywayyy, i.e.socks of banned users. If you can identify a sock and the sockpuppetter with certainty, that's another story, I'll be happy to act. I'm read to help you as a simple editor, as I said, especially for keeping Greek names; for this you can always ask my help. As for being offline, if I had been online it wouldn't have changed much, because I'll tell you a secret ;-), I don't have any Turkey-related articles on my watchlist, only ancient anatolian ones.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That IP is based in Ankara (this is no insinuation against our learned Turkish contributors, we all have our share of unhelpfull editors).

<dd>Oh, that's an easy one; Mywayyy's has often said, while entering with 88.218.xxxxx accounts, that he was Mywayyy, as is the case with 88.218.47.184 (<a href="../../../8/8/2E/User_talk%7E88.218.47.184.html" title="User talk:88.218.47.184">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.218.47.184_4106.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.218.47.184">contribs</a>); and obviously there's the contribution pattern, with his obsession against Turkish names. I also believe that the link between Mywayyy and 88.218.xxxx has been certified by checkuser. More important, until now, he has ALWAYS used for his IP's only 88.218.xxxx.

<p>Aldux, this is the message that I wrote about the city names to admin Bastique - "if Khoikhoi wants to display the former names of the cities, he should do it in the history section. When he places it in the introduction section, it makes a messy look. In addition, he displays the modern day Greek name in the introduction section which would not be appropriate. Because, if we display all of the foreign names (French, Italian, Korean, etc.), can you imagine how the introduction will look like :D So, in case of displaying foreign names of the cities, it would be more appropriate to create new pages. And, put the link to it in the 'See also' section." - Aldux, the users Khoikhoi, Hectorian and their gang are Anti-Turkish. They have updated the Turkish pages with misleading, pseudo information (This is not related with the city names issue, but wanted to give heads-up). And, when another user comes to the page, corrects the information with NPOV or asks for reference, the edit war breaks up. And, they find an admin to protect the page and blame the other with vandalization. As Jimmy Wales stated in one of his emails, if a reference is not provided for the displayed information on a request, it should be removed aggressively. <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" rel="nofollow">Jimmy's email</a> So..let's get back to the city names issue. I am sorry, but you are the fooled one in this case. They played you a little game. Before you, they asked Bastique to get it protected. It is not protected and they came to you. Ding Ding Ding, you are the winner! ;) Btw, do not ask me to discuss with these Anti-Turkish people. There is no way to reach a common point with haters. The best solution for this issue will be to provide the above solution that I wrote to Bastique. Thanks. --Zeytin 02:03, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree I wont revert again unless a dispute resolution procedure starts. From my stance, I ll stick to whatever solution is finally presented. That is democracy after all. This should start immediately, let me know please.

<p>Aldux, the stuff you say about me, prove (apart from other things) that your judgement is not fair (the best word I can use). After the phrase <i>Mywayyy should remain blocked because he hasnt contributed anything worthy in his entire wikipedian life' now you add a new shameful phase: ' considering his hate of anything related to Turkey'. Aldux, I dont know you and you certainly dont know me, but i can assure you I absolutely dont hate Turkey or any other country. If you find something bad I ve writen about Turkey show it to all of us. In the meantime maybe you should ask yourself why you hate ME so much and why you say things that are not correct and more important things you cant prove.Mywayyy88.218.41.233 15:43, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>I don't hate you; I'm only considerably annoyed by all the time I have to lose keeping an eye on socks of banned users. As fo "anything worthy in his entire wikipedian life" that was too strong I recognize it, but I've been keeping an eye on you since you've been banned, and since then I haven't seen all these fantastic edits, that, I confirm, will be reverted mercilessly, because, as a veteran admin told me, the only way sockpuppetters cease vandalising is when they see all their edits reverted. The word "hate" was deliberately strong; but certainly you are biased on the issue of Greek-Turkey relations, and seem to see Turkey like Reagan saw USSR in the 1980s, i.e. "the Great Satan". But the point is you can make the most fantastic edits in the world, this doesn't count, because you cannot edit, and till know have shown no intention of respection the rules; even when you just said that, you violated them by removing Turkish names by Greek islands and editing other articles.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just, Aldux, have in mind that in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandroupoli.html" title="Alexandroupoli">Alexandroupoli</a> there is no muslim minority (not to mention no turkish) at all. the minority is concentrated in Komotini and Xanthi. the only reasons to have the turkish name in the first line are historical and the proximity to turkey.

<dd>U are right, muslims form about 7% of Evros Prefecture, and although i know that they live in villages northern of Alexandroupoli, i won't revert the article about the capital. the only valid reasons i see for the inclusion of the turkish name of the city are the 2 that i mentioned above. we'll see what the outcome of the discussion about it will be. for the moment, under Francis permission <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHectorian&amp;diff=68411054&amp;oldid=68409789" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHectorian&amp;diff=68411054&amp;oldid=68409789" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, i will rename and expand this:Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Islands in the Eastern Aegean). --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 15:07, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, actually I concur with Macrakis here. No need to expose yourself to any later complaints about admin abuse.

<dd>Re. your question to Macrakis, apparently the blocking policy says that "sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute". Whether that counts for cases where you've only previously reverted in order to stop disruption seems a bit unclear, I've seen it interpreted that way, but I've also seen some of the rouger admins get away with blocking nevertheless. Anyway, I've now done a regular 3RR report - actually he had broken the rule already. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:25, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aldux. In a response to your message:<br />
QUOTE: <i>Comments like yours violate two fundamental principles of WP, that is WP:CIV and WP:NPA. You must understand this isn't a forum, and strict rules of civility must govern discussions</i></p>
<p>RE: I'm aware of that and I do apologize, but I really wonder why you don't point that out to these guys for example: <a href="../../../r/e/p/Talk%7ERepublic_of_Macedonia_Related_disputes_305e.html" title="Talk:Republic of Macedonia/Related disputes">Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia/Related_disputes</a>. doesn't look much as an 'academic debate' to me, but rather as a drunk party (most of it). So don't blame me, as a naive rookie I 'learn' from what I see.... I thought that first of all those 'veteran' members are supposed to obey the rules and to be sort of role-model for the newcomers such as myself, right?!</p>
<p>QUOTE: <i>Find good, reliable sources, possibly in English or French, if you wan't to be considered. As for giving importance to the positions of the Macedonians, do it; I've read that Hristo Tatarchev also wrote memoirs, it could be a useful source. And it's only an example.</i></p>
<p>RE:</p>
<p>1. I do agree with this, but first of all I suppose you have to 'practise what you preach'. Judging by some of your recent changes to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Struggle_for_Macedonia_0d40.html" title="Greek Struggle for Macedonia">Greek Struggle for Macedonia</a> by putting back some of the stuff that I removed as unveryfied, you haven't provided sources to justify your changes neither (for example: you still stick to the unveryfied claims that those greek armed groups 'fought the Turkish army', which the ideological 'father' of that greek struggle for macedonia germanos Karavangelis himself denies in his own book telling openly how well they've collaborated :)ok there were two accidental irrelevant skirmishes between them with 1-2 dead but the struggle itself was as i wrote primarily against VMRO, which was the only force completely dedicated to fight the ottoman authorities at that time (I mean Ilinden Uprising, The Krushevo republic, the bomb attacks in Thessaloniki and so on and so on,what more would one want? Even Karavangelis himself admits that VMRO were 'masters on the terrain' in his beginnings in Macedonia). You don't provide any record of any significant battle, operation, diversion etc. of the greek forces against the ottoman authorities in THAT particular conflict (except when Turks shot Pavlos melas by mistake being intentionally misinformed that he is Mitre the Vlah from Konomladi..well, if that can be called "struggle against the Ottomans")</p>
<p>2. Now this is quite questionable: First, what is actually a "good" and "reliable" source? In problematic case with topics such as Macedonia, where there is a pro-greek and pro-macedonian (fyrom) POV, do you really think that quoting lets say a british source will neceserily keep the article unbiased, because a third-party "neutral observer" was cited?</p>
<p>Also should all non-english or non-french sources be disregarded? Wikipedia says: QUOTE: <i>However, do give references in other languages where appropriate. If quoting from a different language source, an English translation should be given with the original-language quote beside it.</i>. BTW, <b>in accordance to these rules</b>, I have suggested some books and stuff as a veryfible source on the subject: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Slavic_toponyms_for_Greek_places#Verification.2C_sources.2C_corrections.2C_explanations.2C_recommended_reading_etc." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Slavic_toponyms_for_Greek_places#Verification.2C_sources.2C_corrections.2C_explanations.2C_recommended_reading_etc." rel="nofollow">HERE</a><br />
But now another problem, some members have doubts whether it is reliable obviously because among other things the books are published in Skopje and thus there's a concern that the book may be biased. You can see the posted quote from a review of that book published on a Greek website. Why should sources published in Skopje always be dubious and questioned just because they r not in accordance with the greek pov and why should a review on some greek website be a good enough reason for suspicion? However, I also received questions concerning the academic credibility of the author, the sources used in the book which is of course OK, but scepticism towards the reliability of the book based on nationalistic prejudice and probably biased reviews? At the same time, the tourist map that i suggested as a source and which is <b>published in Greece</b> was not questioned :) Double standards?<br />
Also,related to this subject, you mentioned Tatarchev from VMRO for example, actually I have the Memoirs of many of the VMRO leaders incl. him and I would gladly cite them, but all of them are published in Republic of Macedonia and not in english and thus their reliability may be again automatically questioned by the pro-greek and pro-bulgarian members.<br />
For all these reasons in the particular case of my additions in the article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Struggle_for_Macedonia_0d40.html" title="Greek Struggle for Macedonia">Greek Struggle for Macedonia</a> I've intentionally referenced a greek source with it's original greek title so I wouldn't be attacked by the pro-greek biased members for 'spreading <a href="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/A4.4.2.2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/A4.4.2.2.html" rel="nofollow">"Skopjan propagandha"</a>.

<p>It seems you removed too much information from the lead section of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> — you should have left the year 681. My <code>{{fact}}</code> was about whether it is the oldest in Europe. Any arguments against putting 681 there? As far as I know, that year is supported by most historians. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameltrader_24a7.html" title="User:Cameltrader">Cameltrader</a> 14:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, at first I didn't notice that 681 was in the "History" section below (better worded there), so no information was lost. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameltrader_24a7.html" title="User:Cameltrader">Cameltrader</a> 15:00, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I hope you are happy now :) But please don't use the sourcing requirements to object against anything you don't like. Sources are not required for widely accepted general facts. Asking for sources for every statement shows really bad discussion culture.</p>

<p>Hello, I see that you've made some edits on Italian history articles, and I'm currently starting an Italian History task force (no page yet) at the Military History WikiProject. We need five or so editors to pledge support before we can actually begin, and I was hoping you could join. The project may or may not include Roman history, post your opinion on this topic at the military history talk page, (link straight to it below), and won't necessarily focus on "military" history specifically, but will likely have to pick articles that have some relation to some war, for instance we could edit <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Garibaldi_49eb.html" title="Giuseppe Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> but it'd be a little harder to really collaborate on one like <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Mazzini_d774.html" title="Giuseppe Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>. Anyways, if you have any questions post them on my talk page, or if you're ready to sign your support of the upcoming project, do so at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_4800.html#Italian_Military_History_Task_Force" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history">the military history talk page</a>.

<p>Thanks for the heads-up about Cretanpride and his socks, Aldux. I feel pretty abashed that I was fooled, but I suppose you're right that the article benefited. Do you think that 48 hours is a sufficient block for Cretanpride? I'd be inclined to block him for longer, but maybe that's just my bruised ego talking. I don't want to do it myself, since I've now become involved in editing the article. What do you think would be the best forum to get a broader discussion of this — AN/I or some page dealing specifically with sockpuppeteers?

<p>Hello :)</p>
<p>You may remember me, I'm the guy that asked you about the milestones template. I have another question. I'm sure this is all explained on some page on Wikipedia, but I can't seem to find it. What's the difference between a user and an administrator? Can anyone become an administrator? If so, what is the criteria for becoming an administrator, and who makes the decision? If you could provide me a link to where all of this is explained, or just give me a short explination yourself, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance,</p>

Ah yes, I do a search under Google and I find Getica Software, Getica Tour Guides, and who knows what I else there is to find. So, maybe Getica (Jordanes) would be the best.

<dd>Sorry Asterion for awnsering so late. Personally I'd oppose putting the FEDOM number in the box, because it is a partisan source (in the most obvious sense of the world). Also, when we have official data, the rule observed in the boxs is to almost always put only that; while the sourced claims should be elsewhere in the article, probably in a Romanian diaspora section. To repeat myself in the box census and other official data, but partisan sources can be mentioned as pov's. When there are no census obviously, the box has to be filled with what can found; possibly independent esteems.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 21:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problem. I understand. I added the FEDOM figures as a footnote as for the USA entry, leaving only the 2006 <i>padrón</i> (local municipality census) numbers in the infobox.

<p>Hey man, I'm keeping an eye on that page, certainly there is some stuff that is clearly nonsense, but I'm at least impressed that it has "Citation needed!" next to it. It says it is a work in progress (isn't everything!) so I'll leave it for a couple of days then take another look. The principle problem is that he seems to be swaying over to representing the "Bulgarian view" as fact in some cases. Of course this can be fixed.

<p>If Cretanpride is still using sockpuppets, I'd say a block of a week or even longer would be entirely appropriate.

<dd>Do not attempt to intimidate me. I am fully aware of wikipedia's policies and so should you: the 3RR rule does not apply to simple vandalism, i.e. sneaky vandalism. Something you are now guilty of and have participated in on account of your friend PHG. I suggest that you desist on account of you being guilty of such violations; otherwise, perhaps you should "prepare to pay the consequences (that is getting blocked)". If there is a discussion to be had, then let us discuss. I am more than willing to continue the discussion. Apparently, you are not.</dd>
<dd>As for PHG's additions, they are not to be considered on the main page of an history article for the same reasons that a eugenics theorist should not be included in a modern discussion of sociology: Accepted at one time and no longer accepted. If you accept eugenics as a legitimate theory worthy of being placed on a wikipedia sociology page, well then, we understand your motivations now.</dd>
<dd>Also, I suggest that if you want to continue to be a responsible wikipedia user and contributor, that you check your tone. Your attempts to antagonize me and other users (something you have a track record of) are uncivil, irresponsible, and are not in line with the values of wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevanampriya_2a4e.html" title="User:Devanampriya">User:Devanampriya</a></dd>

<p>Hello Aldux. I don't think for one moment that your conduct towards other users has been of ill-will. I don't support the excising of the information, but can we get more info from Buddhist oriented sources or Jain sources to make it bigger. Because it does seem as though there is not much detail about Ashoka and Buddhism and Ashoka the conqueror, and the same in the Maurya Empire - at the moment there is lots of information about the Greek connection, which inherently there is nothing wrong, but it may give the impression that Ashoka was a Greek reprentative or something - it just feels a bit too oriented on his bloodline and not what he nor the Mauryans achieved. In any case it was interesting that I got <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda.html" title="Mahinda">Mahinda</a> (his son, who brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka) and <a href="../../../m/o/g/Moggaliputta-Tissa_2eea.html" title="Moggaliputta-Tissa">Moggaliputta-Tissa</a> (his spiritual adviser) to DYK in the week leading up to the locking - could we put more stuff about Buddhism into the articles to balance it out as well as his stuff about the Kalinga conquest etc. The Greek stuff is still interesting of course and I don't see a reason to cull it unless there is POV or weaselly stuff compromising it. Anything this old, of course cannot be certain, so as long as we give both a fair hearing then it should work out OK. This could be an interesting case as I am interested in learning more about Asoka. Perhaps I can find more about his Indian activity (religion and miltary) to balance it out. Tell me what you think.

<dd>Hi Aldux. Personally I think it should be removed, I can't see how it is useful in any way as at that stage China and India had no contact with each other and it could have comparisions with any other random empire. Apart from that it seems like original analysis and seems vague and wobbly. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 04:32, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oops, my sock has promptly corrected me ;-) Since Italy in the <a href="../../../c/e/i/CEI_8000.html" title="CEI">CEI</a> uses "Macedonia" instead of Former Republic ecc., I thought this was the norm, since I'd never heard an Italian politician use FYROM, nor is it ever used by Italian, French and British media (can't read German). Anyway, awnsering AIUI, FYROM, or more exactly the long form, is only used in EU-RoM relations; but in bilateral relations everybody is free to use the name they prefer; as the name used in the ONU isn't binding for the single members, so is the case of the EU. Also (but not very important), I doubt there was a vote of the Europarliament on the issue; this was probably decided by the commission, with an accord between Greece and RoM.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 20:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Aldux, but the EU exclussively uses the name 'FYROM' in every paper, and no EU member state (apart from Poland, which entered just 2 years ago) has formaly recognised that country as 'Macedonia'. also, have in mind that the media (Greek, Italian, French, English, German-i cannot read all those languages, but i can understand some words) usually call the USA simply as 'America', the US president simply as the 'American President', US Senate simply as the 'American Senate', a US aircraft-carrier simply as 'an american aircraft-carrier', not to mention that the people of the USA self-identify simply as 'Americans'...! However, i doubt if anyone would like to mess here in Wikipedia with all the Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican et cetera editors, by changing every reference to 'USA' into the term 'America'. In the case of FYROM, however, there has been a monopolisation of the name!... even in the cases were this state is not recognised by this term (international organizations, bileteral relations with countries who still recognise it as FYROM, etc)... <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 20:34, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. I agree that there's more unpleasantness around in general these days. I'm afraid that my own response to the current level of vitriol is to tune out of "Wikipolitics" and try to focus on the articles I care about. Unfortunately, this means that I pay less attention than I should to important pages like AN/I, just because I don't want to get sucked in to these debates. It's probably rather irresponsible of me as an administrator, but I'd rather tend my own garden than slog through an overgrown field and risk poison ivy.

<p>I was surprised that oil was not mentioned in the Darfur article, yet there does seem to be some market in the oil-search rights .... How can that be?</p>

<p>Hey, Aldux.

Cretanpride, of course, had previously used the sock <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegasAllexandros_0330.html" title="User:MegasAllexandros">MegasAllexandros</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegasAllexandros_20b0.html" title="User talk:MegasAllexandros">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MegasAllexandros_1739.html" title="Special:Contributions/MegasAllexandros">contribs</a>). The GreekEconomist account hasn't edited much in Cretanpride's usual haunts — most of its edits were about Greek musicians — except for a few comments at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_2250.html" title="Talk:Alexander the Great">Talk:Alexander the Great</a>, which didn't touch on Cretanpride's homophobic obsessions. The question is how likely it is that two different Greeks from California, with the same ISP, would choose a username based on "Alexander the Great". It doesn't seem impossible to me, but Mackensen thinks it's "blazingly obvious". I've been fooled by Cretanpride before, so I don't really trust my judgement on this one.

<dd>That makes sense, especially with the explanation of the range.

<dd>Hey -- I've looked into this, and I actually find the evidence very unconvincing, so I unblocked GreekEconomist (see my remark on the user talk page for a thorough explanation). The Greek community (I'm not greek, but I know many of them) is very tight-knit, and I wouldn't be surprised if they settle in specific locations in large concentrations. In other words, I think all of this is explained by one coincidence: that there is another greek user in the same local area; the rest makes a lot of sense. Alexander the Great has got to be a very common choice for a handle. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:31, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the message Aldux. I hadn't, in fact, been aware of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Greek%29_44c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Greek)">Naming conventions (Greek)</a> conventions, even though I've been editing occasionally on and off for a fair while. I can't say I'm happy about them, but these things have a tendency towards immobility so there's not much point complaining; I'll follow the conventions where not using a phonetic transliteration, and alter the proposed titles.</p>
<p>Having said that, what do you feel about the renaming in other respects? I personally feel it's a bit silly to have, for example, a <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicanor_of_Macedon_4f87.html" title="Nicanor of Macedon">Nicanor of Macedon</a> alongside a separate <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicanor_of_Macedonia_00fe.html" title="Nicanor of Macedonia">Nicanor of Macedonia</a>, especially when there are multiple other Macedonian Nicanors as well.</p>
<p>Thanks also for pointing out <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicanor_%28Syrian_general%29_a981.html" title="Nicanor (Syrian general)">Nicanor (Syrian general)</a>, I missed that since he wasn't on the disambig page. He corresponds to what I had marked as "Nicanor (son of Patroclus)" (= Smith i.12); I think I prefer my title because, just judging from Smith, it doesn't look like there are strong grounds for saying he was Syrian (he was sent to Judaea by Lysias of Syria, but that's not quite the same thing). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrouchka_a86b.html" title="User:Petrouchka">Petrouchka</a> 12:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks again, for the extremely useful and informative feedback. I'll adopt all your suggestions (while reserving the possibility of further changes if they seem wise!); I agree that putting the stubs in the disambiguation page is the correct solution (also for ii.1). I'll correct the remaining slips in transliteration in due course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm especially grateful for your pointing out that Smith's i.12 and 1.13 are better treated as the same individual; that's something I probably wouldn't have picked up on until going into his article in detail.

<dd>Another note (unrelated to Nicanor this time; he's mostly taken care of, apart from stuff like templates and other conventions that I am continuing to discover haphazardly). I've just gone back and seen the reply you posted to my excessively hot-tempered moan at <a href="../../../e/u/s/Talk%7EEustathius_of_Thessalonica_7ff6.html" title="Talk:Eustathius of Thessalonica">Talk:Eustathius of Thessalonica</a>. For my part I'd like to apologise completely for losing my cool -- I must have been under stress at the time or something. My best side doesn't come out on Wikipedia as much as I'd like, as I often edit when I'm insomniac. Anyway, I have enormous respect for the quite breath-taking breadth and depth of work you do here and want to apologise for making your life just that little bit harder that day. I hope there aren't excessively hard feelings. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrouchka_a86b.html" title="User:Petrouchka">Petrouchka</a> 08:39, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Aldux, thanks for your generous comments. I'm perplexed over the mediation case you pointed me to! and surprised that the issue is between Latin and Erasmian phonology, rather than Latin and modern, which would make more sense to me. I think ... no, I think I'd rather not go there. I mostly inhabit the Classical and pre-Classical world, anyway, so ... hmm, yep. I'm a bit of a shyster when it comes to heavily disputed articles and issues, I'm afraid. Anyway, now that you've alerted me to the naming conventions policy I'll go along with that. Maybe Latin is the way to resolve all the world's issues after all, I dunno.

<p>I'd love to make maps of Chad, it's been on my list for some time - but there's a lack of information about the regions.

<dd>I can handle the northern 2/3 of the country just fine, but the south is way too small for me to make sense of.

<p>Merry Christmas. ;) I amazed even myself on figuring this out, but I'm about 90% sure that this map is correct and accurate. Maps of the departments, and a fully labelled/colored map, etc. will be coming later. (The departments may take longer though) --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 08:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Koumra, hm... well let's figure out my process here. Mandoul has three departments, Occidental, Oriental, and Barh Sara. Barh Sara and Oriental are clear on the map, and Occidental must be west of Oriental. Moyen-Chari has three as well, Barh Koh, Grande Sido, and Lac Iro. Barh Koh and Lac Iro are clear on the map, and we know Guera and Haraze Mangueigne aren't part of it, so that establishes the eastern and northern border.</p>
<p>So the goal is to find the third department (Grande Sido) which must lie to the west (or south), and also find Mandoul Occidental, which must lie to the westish of Mandoul Oriental, and this seemed to be the only configuration that made sense - IF I'm reading the map correctly. It's possible one of those lines I drew followed a river, rather than a department boundary. Mandoul and Moyen-Chari correspond exactly to the old prefecture of Moyen-Chari, so we just have to figure out where the new border between the two is. I agree, it seems to be saying Koumra is in Moyen-Chari, which it's not, so ... any thoughts? Perhaps a new set of eyes will tell me if I missed a department boundary. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 11:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Aldux,<br />
I understand what you meant by deleting my stuff in the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vergina_Star_a94b.html" title="Vergina Star">Vergina Star</a> article, but let me remind you of the following:</p>
<p>1. I didn't do anything unilaterally, before adding the stuff I presented <b>everything</b> on the talk page (you can check it) and normally I expected to see the reactions of the other people first before adding anything. There were long discussions with user Politis, at last I think we've agreed that The Ohrid story deserves to be mentioned with a couple of sentences and 2-3 thumbnails without any nationalistic B.S. Just facts.</p>
<p>2. The Ohrid findings ARE related to the Vergina star. No matter if one's a "macedonian nationalist" or "greek nationalist" or <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvalu.html" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a> nationalist, they all agree on one thing: <a href="../../../o/h/r/Ohrid.html" title="Ohrid">Ohrid</a> (a.k.a. Lihnidos in the antiquity) was INDEED a part of the Ancient Macedonian Empire regardless if the ancient macedonians were greeks or something else. Ohrid was Ancient Macedonian city, you will see on the talk page that even Politis who is pro-greek biased agrees with that. Finding such stuff there is not at all unussuall, there is plenty of such stuff, unfortunatelly we are a small and financially weak country so of course we cannot "sell" those things to the world so succesfully as the tourist force Greece can.</p>
<p>3. <b>A 12-rayed star found in Olympias</b> is also mentioned in the article in the very beginning of the text without any explanations. Why don't you delete it? JUSTICE FOR ALL. Its not EXACTLY the same as the well known star of Vergina (its 12 rayed).Also some <b>Bronze Age "star" with 8 rays</b> is mentioned in the article without any further explanations or pics or anything (?!) saying that it was found in the small town of Kratovo for which greek nationalists say it was not in the ancient macedonian kingdom, its "too north" for them. Now what? But again this "bronze age star" is left untouched in the article and it has been "sitting" there for who knows how long and curious surfers are reading about it</p>
<p>4. Maybe my arguments are poorly sourced, but still there is an institution behind it (after all no one mentioned that I must provide lets say an american or norwegian point of view about these findings, although that would be useful indeed). I have provided info about the institute and even contact. Ohrid is a "city of <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>" so it is known for archaelogy and all that, it was a part of the Ancient Macedonian knigdom so summa-summarum I dont see what is so shocking and for some even <b>irritating</b> that those "stars" have been found here in this country too? Its quite funny cause you see, greek nationalists say "Ohrid is ours! It was ancient macedonian, but u slavs took it!" then they say "Bitola (Monastiri) is ours! It was Heraklea Linkestis!", but when you show them the "stars" found in present day <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> they are suddenly "errrm..errm..well doesnt look much like the vergina star u know, the rays are hmm not long enough u know".. Well, excuse me, you said those cities were part of the kingdom so thats it. If the stars can be found in Vergina or Pella, they can be found in Ohrid too. Who knows what is hidden beneath this land, if we were a better organized country who knows how many "suns" we would find.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still think that the Ohrid story deserves attention. --<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 16:49, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>hah, I know what is <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia.html" title="Olympia">Olympia</a> in Peloponissos and who is <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympias.html" title="Olympias">Olympias</a> (its of course...<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_%28film%29.html" title="Alexander (film)">Angelina Jolie</a>). I was typoing so fast and I confused those two "suns" (the 12-rayed and the Bronze age Kratovo one) thats why I said "how they are related" or "it has been found so far away". After I saw the mess, I edited the message afterwards maybe you noticed (message history). Anyway, forget it, I applogize. I'll try to do as u suggest.</p>
<p>Btw you suggest me to I talk to people who are much better in these things, thats good, but then again I just wonder why no one of them except Politis reacted when I presented all my intentions beforehand on the vergina star talkpage? They could give me explanations what to do and what not to do beforehand. well nevermind now.--<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 18:08, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please ragazzo don't let Dahn again change sourced content or "rephrase" information without consensus. 20% of his edits are POV-injections in direct citations. He doesn't let a single edit go "unrephrased" and he doesn't accept anyone to touch his own edits - in fact he will edit-war until he's about to break 3RR and only then he'll consider discussing. If you noticed he reverted my edits as unsourced just because I hadn't added ref tags, ignoring the fact that he had none either. Now I've added tags on every single phrase so that he won't have an excuse on "rephrasing" their meaning. Notice his arguments in discussion, they're pure original research and personal views. Just help protect this article from rv-warring, he's the most stubborn editor I've ever had to face.

<p>There were plenty of disputes between me and user Funkyfly on the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiro_Gligorov_1edf.html" title="Kiro Gligorov">Kiro Gligorov</a> article (plz check version history and the discussion) but no one ever came to help us to solve them. The dispute turned into reverting of the article over and over which of course is going nowhere. Knowing that you are sort of <b>veteran here</b>, i hope you can check this problem out, please. If you could intervene on the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vergina_Star_a94b.html" title="Vergina Star">Vergina Star</a> article, Im sure you can intervene here as well (in the name of objectivity right?).</p>
<p>Funkyfly's side:<br />
He/She (sorry I dont know) claims that Kiro Gligorov declared Bulgarian ethnicity in Sofia in 1942. And not only that but it seems to me personally (correct me if Im wrong) that this wikipedia user is trying to turn the whole point of this living person biographical article into <b>"KIRO GLIGOROV IS BULGARIAN?"</b>, like it is the most important subject in the whole story. All the time he/she insists on those statements of his/hers.<br />
To supoort such claims, that user provides links to some document scans without offering much explanations about them. And I must note, unfortunatelly user Funkyfly behaves in a quite arrogant way.</p>
<p>My side: I noticed those scans are published on the official website of the bulgarian nationalist political party VMRO-BND, section for the city of Plovdiv (note: this political party is quite "anti-Gligorov"). Im not saying that such documents should be always ignored! if they are published by some political party, that doesn't mean they are fake by default. Or maybe they ARE fake? We simply dont know. Seeing that the discussion goes nowhere I insisted that at least a detailed explanation of those links should be added cause the readers deserve to know what they're clicking (and they are clicking a link to a website of a political party). Contrary to him/her, for those ceratin links that I added, I also added all the possible details to help the readers (according to Wikipedia rules: detailed explanation of external links is required) so they would know what they're clicking.<br />
Also, user Funkyfly insists that the following sentence should remain untouched, quote: <i>During his studies in the University of Sofia in 1941, and when applying for a position as a lawyer in 1942, Kiro Gligorov declared Bulgarian ethnicity.</i>(end of quote). No source, no citation, no footnote, absolutely nothing is provided, except those questinable scans which are actually not connected to this sentence in any way (footnote, reference or something). The sentence just stays "naked" like it is a 100% absolute truth :)<br />
When I asked for a citation for this problematic statement, user Funkyfly removed the "citation needed" note that i left, without even trying to explain anything. If you can check at the history of the article, he/she never bothers to explain his/her changes in a normal manner.</p>
<p>Also I have pointed out that Gligorov was a member of the <i>Antifascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia</i> (<a href="../../../a/s/n/ASNOM_17e7.html" title="ASNOM">ASNOM</a>) in 1944 (so just two years after he "declares as Bulgarian" he suddenly fights those same Bulgarians to form a Macedonian state?!) and he was also a high ranking official during Tito's Yugoslavia (Yugoslavia recognized a separate Macedonian nation), so Gligorov is what the bulgarian nationalist can clearly label as an <b>adherent of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonism.html" title="Macedonism">macedonism</a></b> which is completely contrary to the pro-Bulgarian views! Also I have pointed out that Bulgaria as Hitler's ally was not a democratic country with full respect of national rights, so logically, when Gligorov was filling those forms (the scanned documents) he certainly couldnt state any other nationality except Bulgarian of course :) Many fascist regimes during WWII imposed various measures for ethnic homogenization, assimilation etc. on the freshly occupied territories. I dont see why Bulgaria should be treated as an exception. Before the WWII Gligorov also use to have a serbian name like everybody else in what is today Republic of Macedonia, which was then a part of the serbian dominated <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_cd57.html" title="Kingdom of Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslaviauntil</a> 1941. But that certainly doesnt mean he was Serbian too, of course.</p>

Those same statements that you removed like "Kiro Gligorov declared Bulgarian etnhnicity" and so on, are just copied and pasted in the article about <a href="../../../a/s/n/ASNOM_17e7.html" title="ASNOM">ASNOM</a> too. And again, there are no sources, no footnotes and quite poor explanations.(check the history page also plz).

<p><b>Funkfly</b>, as you see Im trying to avoid further quarells and hostilities. Reverting the article over and over, "war of ego's" or insulting each other's nation is definetly not a solution. Im just asking for a sort of <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">arbitration</a> by a respected and experienced user from a "neutral country"(in this case it's Italy). As you can see I also presented the POV of the both sides in this dispute. As I said, those documents MAY be 100% true, but we are simply far from being 100% sure yet, so right now that's highly questionable. And speaking of your behaviour, its quite obvious.<br />

<dd>Ciao, Aldux. I would appreciate your opinion on this kerfuffle. As far as I am concerned, je m'en fous whether AtG is considered this or that. The issue is whether a "masticabibbia" contingent is steering the the article to its own ends. I found particularly revealing an edit comment by one of the group, "The Discussion Does not Warrant This Category given the evidence is not there; if that's the case we might as well place sexual oriented categories in every ancient Greek biography" not only because it is patently false, as have been most of their arguments, but because it offers a glimpse of where this is headed - the removal or blocking of sexual categories from a culture renowned for its homophile interests. It seems to me both dangerous and unwise to cave in to this pressure, since history has shown all too well that appeasement does not work. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 16:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I listed historical people whose name has been used and are used as synonymous with betrayal and collaboration with the enemy. Ephialtes seems to be one in Greece, more internationally Brytys and Judas and Quisling. In United States everyone knows what is ment by calling someone Benedict Arnold as is the casse with Kuusinen in my home country. Brutus and Judas lived 500 years later than Ephialtes. There is no periodical connection there and it is not even needed since each time period and culture has it's own historical example of the basic character of a traitor. Ephialtes is the mythical traitor of the anticent Greek history and Brutus is the one for Imperial Rome, Judas for Christianity, Quisling for Norway and much of Western Europe under Nazis adn Kuusinen for Finns who fought the Soviets. In fact there should be a category for achtypes like traitors in history.

<p>The Mysterious Death of Cleopatra tackles a cold case of regal proportions. Cleopatra inherited the throne of Egypt at age 17, before dodging assassination to rule for more than 20 years. Her life is filled with the enigmatic and the unexplained… as is her untimely death. For two millennia, only one cause has been recorded – suicide by snakebite. Now, cold case criminal profiler Pat Brown and a team of experts that includes an underwater archaeologist and a toxicologist, are re-examining the circumstances of her alleged suicide. Using techniques of 21st century criminal investigations, they reconstruct the 2,000-year-old death scene (which is now submerged beneath Alexandria harbor) and reveal the sinister power games that led to her death.</p>

<p>Hi. I'm Ronline, another administrator at en.wiki. I've picked your name at random from the administrators list and I would like to ask for your input regarding a 3RR violation case. I've been asked by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariusM_97ae.html" title="User:MariusM">User:MariusM</a> to block <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">User:William Mauco</a> over a 3RR violation.

It's just that this was the previous version (before the anon edit), and it seems logical to me, regardless the circumstances.

<p>Hi aldux, I was wondering why the article <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carapelli.html" title="Carapelli">Carapelli</a> links to an american food company. As for the discussions in 'Italian people', you should propose to remove all references about X people being similar to Y in order to avoid POVs. That's how it was decided in 'Greeks' and the article has been peaceful ever since. I'm suggesting it for Italians too but nobody listens, they keep fixed to their POVs. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:17, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that in the USA Carapelli is a subsidiary of this Hormel food company; a company I have honestly never have heard of, while the name Carapelli is quite known in Italy, and they do a lot of publicity. As for <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian people</a>, it's a lot of time I've not given a look at the article; I'll do tomorrow, as now I really have to go to sleep.

</dl>
<p>Ok this is why I thought that Carapelli might be worthy of an article of its own. There's no new content in 'Italian people', just some edit-warring on minor edits concerning the "related ethnic groups" field on the infobox. I haven't been following closely nor participating either, except backing up some of my old edits in Talk. I suggest that in order to stop POV-pushing and disputees, this field should be completely removed. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 11:51, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aldux, sorry to bug you, but I saw your comment on WP:ANI and wanted to follow up.

<p>Hello Aldux, you moved the article Thebes (Greece) to 'Thebes, Greece', as if it were a city of US state. What was the problem with how it was before? Secondly, the Egyptian Thebes is an ancient city of a lost people, neither the city itself nor its people exist today - it's undue weight to equate it with the existing, Greek city. I'm not sure whether the Greek Thebes should be disambiguated in the first place, it should keep the name <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes.html" title="Thebes">Thebes</a> and then use a Thebes (Egypt) or Thebes (disambiguation). Finally why did you remove the Turkish and Greek names from <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a>? Those names were in official use for over 1000 years, and Greeks and Turks were a majority population in that city. But besides all that, just take a look at the countless Greek articles which mention Turkish and Venetian names in their heads, and NOT in a separate section (<a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corfu.html" title="Corfu">Corfu</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakynthos.html" title="Zakynthos">Zakynthos</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki.html" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chios.html" title="Chios">Chios</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbos.html" title="Lesbos">Lesbos</a> and the list goes on and on and on and on and on.....!). I don't see how <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a> is an exception to the rule, is it because Macedonian Slavs are bitching more than the other editors? Because for me that's not enough of an excuse. 15:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a note to both of you: I agree with Aldux and Khoikhoi about the Bitola case. About Thebes, please take note that we currently have double redirects and countless wrong links (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Thebes_ae1d.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Thebes">Special:Whatlinkshere/Thebes</a> shows lots of Egypt-related pages). So whatever we do with those articles, there'll be a need of cleanup. I'm for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes.html" title="Thebes">Thebes</a>=dab, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_%28Egypt%29_1768.html" title="Thebes (Egypt)">Thebes (Egypt)</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_%28Greece%29_0c1f.html" title="Thebes (Greece)">Thebes (Greece)</a>. Brackets for disambiguation are good for using the pipe trick, if nothing else. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So why do you agree on the Bitola case, care to explain it to me? Each time I tried to remove Ottoman and Venetian names from an article's head and put it them in the body, I was reverted by Khoikhoi. What is it that makes Bitola an exception? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a question of symbolically promoting or demoting the significance of a name, it's a matter of text organisation. The <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a> article has a well-written, well structured, pretty large section devoted to the various names. If there's that much material, a section in the body text is the best solution. If you can write a section of that size and quality about the history of the various names of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chios.html" title="Chios">Chios</a> or whatever, be my guest. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For ancient towns I've noted that the model I reverted to is the most used; and de facto Thebes case can't be compared with that of Athens, as modern Thebes is just a small town of 20,000 inhabitants, and people were search for info on old Thebes, not modern Thebes. Anyways make a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>; I won't shoot myself anyway it ends. As for the second point, Bitola, I also removed the Slavic name. We had agreed (at least I think) in a vast discussion, that when Names section were created, there was no need to duplicate info in the lead.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that you had simply not agreed, the way I see it everyone has his view and follows his own policies. As a proof of this, someone just reverted my edits and restored the Slavic and Aromanian names in the head of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki.html" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thebes might be a small town but it has a continuous history, and it has been important as a Byzantine city and as the capital of the Latin principalities, so it's not true that after antiquity it's been as good as dead (as you imply). If for no good reason, someone might be interested to visit the ruins of the ancient city. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Btw in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki.html" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> the alt. names were also mentioned in the article, yet no-one claimed "duplication of information" so I'm not falling for that excuse. I tried to explain this to <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> but I got sarcasms in reply. I'm expecting more seriousness from your part Aldux, if you remove the alt. names from Bitola again, then I'll justly remove them from Thessaloniki and Crete and then new problems will arise. I really couldn't care less whether the Greek and Turkish name appear in the head of <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a>, I just can't stand the double-standard logic go unnoticed. If you decide to remove alternative names, then go ahead and do it <i>from all articles</i>, if you want to keep them then do it as well, <i>from all articles</i>, I just don't see the reason for making exceptions. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 19:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Aldux. I though you might like to know that I'm starting to work on the Hellenistic Art article you asked to have translated from French. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 17:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Translation complete! <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> and others also helped. Can you advise re how to move it to the English Wikipedia page: do we worry about retaining the page history? thanks. (I also asked EdJohnston the same question.) --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:04, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply! Actually, I do have a few questions. I've been wikifying for about a week or so and really getting into it.</p>
<p>One question is: I've been keeping a list in my sandbox, for my own convenience, of users I might want to contact. Do you think this is OK or would it violate some policy, i.e. would the users mind do you think?</p>
<p>Another question: I'm wondering whether anybody is looking after the translation page. For example, is the tranlation of the month changed each month. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> and also the page <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_e83f.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English">Wikipedia:Translation into English</a>. I'm thinking of adding some instructions for other new translators and perhaps suggesting that the page <a href="../../../f/r/e/Wikipedia%7EFrench_Collaboration_Project_4d9c.html" title="Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project">Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project</a> be merged with the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> page. Oho -- I just found the page <a href="../../../f/r/e/Wikipedia%7EFrench_Collaboration_Project_History_95fe.html" title="Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project/History">Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project/History</a> which seems to imply that no, nobody is looking after updating the translation of the month. I would suggest deleting the stuff about translation of the month, if it's not really being looked after. Just an ordinary list of things to be translated, on ONE page, should be good enough. What do you think?</p>
<p>By the way, about the page history: it seems more important to retain the page history which is attached to the sandbox (i.e. history of translating the page) than the page history of the current English page. However, I suppose if I mention on the talk page that I cut-and-pasted from the sandbox then people can follow the links back if they really want to. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:02, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pretty well finished Derveni krater. See notes on its talk page. I won't always be that fast!! --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 21:24, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see you made the title of "Hellenistic art" conform to capitalization and put a redirect from the orphan tranlation sandbox.</p>
<p>Question: I put instructions for proofreaders on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> (just before the Recently Translated section). I suggested going onto the French wikipedia and putting an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlanguage_link.html" title="Interlanguage link">interlanguage link</a> to the translated article. Is that necessary or does a bot do that based on the link from the English article to the French one? --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 12:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I had put links to "Hellenistic Art" on several other pages; I just went and changed them to lowercase a in art. I think I got them all. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 10:02, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_frappe.html" title="Greek frappe">Greek frappe</a>, and came to the quote where it talks about "espresso freddo", "capuccino freddo" (aka freddoccino). I've repeatedly tried to drink (whatever) cold coffee in Italy, and I always end up ...explaining the recipe to the startled waiter (not to mention that the end result always sucks). On the other hand, I've been drinking these in Greece since maybe 10 years now. Is it that frequent in Italy?

<dd>I've always wanted to know something more about that:). i know well that drinking coffee is by no means a greek invention, but, is frappe only a "greek thing"? or maybe is it included in the various kinds of coffee served in Italy (primarily, since we have many italian kinds of coffee) or elsewhere? <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 04:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frappe is documented to be Greek. I was asking about capuccino/espresso freddo. Last time in Firenze I was served footwash! So the question is simple: Do you have it?

<dd>Sorry Niko, I hadn't immediately noticed your post. The awnser to your question is very simple: absolutely no, simply the idea of drinking cold coffee seems weird to me, I've never drunk personally a cold coffee in all my life, neither has anybody in my family; except, obviously, the originally boiling espresso is served cold because of the bar's sloppiness, and then it's really disgusting.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:18, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ummm, I had no idea about the autochthonous/immigrants thing. In that case, would it be irrational to say that in order to qualify as an immigrant of some ethnicity, that ethnicity has to exist prior to your migration? Hah! Anyway, I wish Greece performs an ethnicity census next time, so that we get done with this. I wonder if Helsinki et al state the method of arriving at those estimates. OTOH, those 2,955 votes are a pretty rational method, dont you think? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">Niko</a><a href="../../../n/%21/_/User_talk%7EN%21_85c3.html" title="User talk:N!">Silver</a> 00:08, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hectorian, are you sure you don't mean euromosaic? I've read the all the Helsinki Monitor reports online on the Pomaks and it was never stated that they were Macedonians. As for the votes of a party, I disagree they are a good criterion to understand the strength of a minority; there was once a Pomak political party in Bulgaria, and it made even worse than the Rainbow party; but nobody serious thought that this meant that the Pomaks didn't exist, or identified all as ethnic Bulgarians.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:26, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know about euromosaic, but i have the impression that Helsinki monitor also links the Pomaks with the "Macedonians"... well, if not the Pomaks (muslims) in western Thrace, surely the Slavic-speaking population (christians) in Eastern Greek Macedonia (Drama and Serres prefectures). seems they are identifing ethnic groups according to the old ottoman tradition, id est according to religion. IMO, the votes of minority and ethnic parties are quite a good criterion for the numerical strength of a specific minority: u can compare the parties of the Basques and the Catalans in Spain, and of the Scots in the UK-maybe not all of them vote for the specific parties, but at least there is not a gap 1 to 300 (as some nationalists in FYROM say: 3,000 votes but 1 million Slavomacedonians...!). and, not only looking at the number of votes, but also in the ethnic or religious affiliation of the MP... e.g., in Greece there are 2 muslim MP from Thrace (something that roughly corresponds to the strength of the muslim minority there. but, "surprisingly", no MP from any other imagined minority... as for the Pomaks, i do not know if they all self-identify as ethnic Bulgarians, but for sure they are neither Turks nor "Macedonians".

<p>I have created the category 'ethnic groups in FYROM', where i included the ethnic groups found only there, and not in the rest of the region of Macedonia. u know well the definitions for both... U are free to rename it into 'category:...<b>Republic of</b> Macedonia' (since Wikipedia has come to a state to have a country under this name...), but not simply as 'Macedonia'. there are categories about ethnic groups in various countries, thus, only under this name (the name of the respective article) such a category can exist.

<dd>I have a question, why did Tsar Simeon call himself "Tsar of Bulgarians and Greeks" if the Byzantine Empire was not Greek?--<a href="../../../e/u/t/User%7EEuthymios_18b7.html" title="User:Euthymios">Euthymios</a> 22:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Things are very complex here. I do not deny the fact that many contemporaries called the Byzantines "Greeks"; but I think that the major reasons for that are two: 1) Especially for the westerners, who thought that the true Roman Empire was the Holy Roman Empire of the German People it would be confusing and even humiliating to consider the Byzantines as Romans; after all the Pope used to be the face of the Empire for them. 2) People did not have such knowledge in history as today; as the official languaga was Greek, they thought that the population of Byzantium was Greek too. There is also one more reason: the Byzantine historians often called the Bulgarians "Moesians", which has nothing to do with them, but thus they wanted to emphasize that they were insignificant; for the same reason the Bulgarians called the Byzantines Greeks.</p>
<p>If Greece was truely Byzantium, why it did not keep this name? Byzantium I should say sounds glorius and although it was a great enemy of my country, I should admit that this was the most successful, infuential and culturally developped state in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, so if the greeks were Byzantines, I think that they should have kept the name. After all the name "Greece" as a country dates back from 1829; in the Antiquity there was not such state, but such region as is the Middle East for instance today, consisting of numerous independent polisi. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 09:25, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux,</p>
<p>Browsing the list of administrators, and being completely new on the Wikipedia, I decided to ask you for help.</p>
<p>Here is the user signed as <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> which publicly claims that I used so-called sock-puppets in reverting something re-written by him, which he hails as superior to the previous version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism#Croatia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism#Croatia" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Sock_puppetry" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Sock_puppetry" rel="nofollow">[62]</a></p>
<p>Even worse, on the talk pages of the anonymous users who reverted his version of the Croatia subsection he put the {sockpuppet|NovaNova}<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> tag. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.57.101.133&amp;action=edit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.57.101.133&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:71.252.81.35" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:71.252.81.35" rel="nofollow">[64]</a></p>
<p>I do not think that I should defend myself against baseless accusations and that there must be a way to stop this public slander - which is something I would ask you to do.</p>
<p>Of course, you are more than welcome to check his accusations about the sock-pupperty - and make your findings public. I would appreciate it greatly.</p>
<p>Also, his agressive behavior comes always when he breaks 3RR rule as it can be seen here - twice<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Observations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Observations" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> and again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92446859" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92446859" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92385857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92385857" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92351258" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92351258" rel="nofollow">[68]</a></p>

<li>User:NovaNova has constantly reverted a section of the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazism</a> article to an inferior state that did not focus on the actual topic of the article. I comprimised by combining the old and new version of the section, but NovaNova continued the destructive reverts instead of making productive edits. This led to the article being locked. NovaNova has done similar things to the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_in_Croatia_83f9.html" title="Neo-Nazism in Croatia">Neo-Nazism in Croatia</a> article, but to a lesser extent (so far). The two anonymous IPs who reverted the neo-Nazism article were obviously NovaNova. They did the exact same revert that NovaNova kept doing, and used the same kind of unique language style in the edit note that NovaNova is known for. I find it amusing that NovaNova would write here that I broke 3RR, since NovaNova has been guilty of the same offence.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 12:53, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello Aldux! Since you helped User:Coppertwig and me with a move some time ago regarding Hellenistic Art, where an original article and a new version had to be somehow combined, can you give me some advice? I created a draft at User_talk:EdJohnston/Tifft_draft whose contents have now been copy-pasted into the main article, by agreement of the editors. This draft is no longer needed. Is it better to leave it around, or delete it? I thought I'd move it, so it is now in <a href="../../../e/d/j/User_talk%7EEdJohnston_Archive4_5568.html" title="User talk:EdJohnston/Archive4">User_talk:EdJohnston/Archive4</a> but now I'm concerned that it's wasting resources. What do you think? There is very little edit history in the draft, and I don't mind at all if it's deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:36, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux. Happy holidays, I hope you are well. I have a question about the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> article. I believe you added the original text, describing Alexander's demands regarding Demosthenes in 335 BC. Based solely on the Plutarch's <i>Phocion</i>, I've recently modified that text and changed the sense of what you wrote, please see <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_2250.html#Alexander.27s_demands_regarding_Demosthenes_in_335_BC" title="Talk:Alexander the Great">Talk:Alexander the Great#Alexander's demands regarding Demosthenes in 335 BC</a>, for details. I would like your opinion on the changes I made. Are there other sources for this incident than Plutarch?

<p>I just saw your post because of edit conflicts. I am aware of those. But can I simply create articles for Point and email twenty friends to take part in its AfD? This is extremely frustrating and unhelpful, and detrimental to Wikipedia. Have any of those users been warned? Please read the whole AfD again, there are some worrying patterns. None of those users have disclosed how they came across this article. I am finished with that AfD in any case. So, don't worry. What do you think about what happened in the AfD?

<dd>Barristarim, I'm happy you've calmed down now. I have no reasons for believing that many of them knew of it through the link to FPS, as I did, as FPS is strongly connected with Greek topics, so it's not so strange many of them came to knew of it. You're entitled to have your suspects, but unless you can substantiate them, and bring serious elements before the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, it's better to keep them for yourself.

<p>Edit conflict with user <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacedonian_Empire_1539.html" title="User:Macedonian Empire">Macedonian Empire</a> over positioning of the RoM section of the article. I've tried telling him that it's convention to use RoM for the name through edit comments and on his talk page (which he likes to blank every time someone edits it), but to no avail. I can't find the actual vote that resulted in the RoM convention, or else I'd try shoving that in his face, but I doubt he'd pay heed to it.

<p>Hello i think if we keep the articles separate it would be better because the mitanni article describes the location and some information on there kings while the Armenian kingdom of mitanni contains different info we can add it to the see also section.

<p>Aldux, you did your part by pointing out unreferenced sections that I had missed and that long quote that really bothered me too. I didn't want to get rid of it as I thought it's important to understand the speech at the rostra, all is well now. Btw your early tips from last spring regarding the Orontids did have a lasting impact on my future edits.

<p>Thx for leaving me a message. I am sorry if you got the wrong impression that I was trying to say something bad about u, or making any assumptions that you were doing something wrong.It's just that it seems to me that the Pusyamitra hoax is being given undue importance on wikipedia, thanks to partisan ideologies and political interests. This observation is based on my reading many wiki articles where allegations of his "persecution of Buddhists" (based entirely upon Buddhist religious scripture) is prominently featured. The thing is that Sungas are a very unimportant footnote in Indian history in the face of greats like the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauryan_Empire_d897.html" title="Mauryan Empire">Mauryan</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/p/Gupta_Empire_ef36.html" title="Gupta Empire">Guptas</a>, and it is not important enough to be featured so prominently across wikipedia. I think it only deserves brief mentioning on account of it's verifiability. In recent years, political parties and certain "academics" with partisan biases are harping on exaggerations relating to their attitudes towards Buddhism for political purposes (in an ancient country like India, history is often used to rake up political controversy). We in India know this problem well.My feeling is that wikipedia should not be used for political propaganda, and my attempt to put the academic truth (preferentially over Buddhist religious parables) was an attempt to depoliticize the article.I did not assume that you belonged to any such partisan group, and, if you thought I did, then I apologize.However, perhaps you should have opened a dialogue with me in the talk page to discuss my additions and I would have pointed you to the relevant subject matter. It would have avoided needless unpleasantness. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 17:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux. I just came across the article <a href="../../../f/a/y/Faya-Largeau_1518.html" title="Faya-Largeau">Faya-Largeau</a>, which you moved to that title from <a href="../../../f/a/y/Faya.html" title="Faya">Faya</a> a little <s>over</s> (under, it seems) a year ago. <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033859/Faya" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033859/Faya" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> and the <a href="http://www.primature-tchad.org/CIRCONSCRIPTIONS.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.primature-tchad.org/CIRCONSCRIPTIONS.pdf" rel="nofollow">Chadian government</a> both say that the current name is actually Faya, <s>so I'll shortly tag Faya (which has been converted into a dab page) with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-g6_202b.html" title="Template:Db-g6">Db-g6</a>}}, wait for it to be deleted, and then move <a href="../../../f/a/y/Faya-Largeau_1518.html" title="Faya-Largeau">Faya-Largeau</a> there.</s> Do you have any objections to this reversal of your move? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 02:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well first of all, I didn't write the Bodele article - my single edit to it was a copyedit. I agree that it is very well written - probably even a bit above what I'm capable of, in fact. (My closest DYK to Chad is <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayajidda.html" title="Bayajidda">Bayajidda</a>, from northern Nigeria - he crossed Chad, but didn't stay. If I've written any Chad articles, they're just geo-stubs or bio-stubs that are so poor I've forgotten them already.) Anyways, because of what you showed me about the naming confusion, I'll withdraw the RM request and leave Faya as a redirect to Faya-Largeau (all incoming links seem to Faya seem to be for the town, not the plant.) Does this sound good? I'm not sure the current dab page, <a href="../../../f/a/y/Faya_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Faya (disambiguation)">Faya (disambiguation)</a>, is needed at all now, because "X (disambiguation)" pages with two entries tend to be pretty useless. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 17:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, first of all, the geo coordinates (17°55′00″N, 19°7′00″E) in the article are wrong. They're off by a little bit, maybe because no one with accurate equipment has ever been to northern Chad, maybe because the French didn't measure it right - I'm not sure why, but I know they aren't quite accurate. The 00s should probably be numbers.</dd>
<dd>Anyways, the locator dot was created so we wouldn't have to upload a picture with a big red dot on it for every town and city - with this, we can upload a national map and place the locator dot <i>over</i> the map. The x and y are coordinates (see also <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinate_system.html" title="Coordinate system">coordinate system</a> for more on them and how to fiddle with them) help move the dot to the correct place. The coordinates in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faya-Largeau&amp;oldid=87622533" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faya-Largeau&amp;oldid=87622533" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the map had the red dot a little to the left of where the small black, so I adjusted it using the preview button until the dots were directly on top of eachother. I assume they weren't on top of eachother like they should've been because of the aforementioned inaccurate coordinates of Faya-Largeau. For me, at least, it was just guess&amp;check work to get the x and y coordinates right. There might be a better way than what I did, but I'm not aware of it.</dd>

I anticipated that I would be trying to convince Sze Cavalry of WP policies on my own, so I was pleasantly surprised when when you showed up. However, I must confess curiousity as to how you came across this (RC patrol? Sysop magic?). Also, please let me know if you think I could have handled this differently or better.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 22:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Kubigula. The reson I noted it is simply that I have a very vast watchlist, covering almost all Greece-related articles, among other things, only, these are really a lot of articles. As for the way you've handled the matter, I don't have any objections: you noted serious POV and OR problems, and you intervened with civility.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 20:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, the long watchlist - I might have guessed. My watchlist seems to grow by a few articles every day. Sze Cavalary seems to be waiting for your input on Cleophis. May I ask if you intend to edit the article more substantially? No pressure - if you have other areas you would prefer to spend your energy on, I will take a stab at reducing the POV and OR.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 04:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Aldux! And a happy new year! It is the first time we "speak" since the intrusion of 2007! Do you remember explaining me the virtues of being an administrator?! I think I'll go for it, although I still want my time for my articles, and I hope the new duties and responsibilities (if, of course, the RfA is successful, which is something unpredictable) will not jeopardize my editing work. What made me re-think the whole thing was <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcibiades.html" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>'s appearance in the main page tomorrow. I had told you that I will think about it, and I will decide about January 10. Now that I was thinking and re-thinking the whole thing, the announcement of this important event for me in Wikipedia happened. I thought it might be a sign (well, I'm a bit superstitious; but don't worry, I try not to overdo it!), and I was "pushed" by this coincidence towards accepting the prospect of a RfA.</p>
<p>I don't know how should I organize the whole thing. Make a draft page somewhere with the nominations, the questions, the answers etc, and when I'am ready submit it officially? How does this thing work? In any case, I'd be happy if you, Nicos and Rob, namely you who made the proposal and the two other users who commented on it (and with whom I have shared some of the most vivid and creative moments in Wikipedia), could co-nominate me. I would be really honored. Maybe we can prepare the nominatios, then work the (obligatory - if understand how RfA works) questions-answers, and Monday-Tuesday - if I feel everything is ready - submit it. I do not want to hurry; what matters to me is to make the things properly and try to be accurate and well-prepared for the whole proceedure. I wait for your comments.

<dd>Hey, good! Go for it! That way you will be able block me next time I remove Greek poems from my userpage... :-) As for the process, what I did myself was to prepare most of my answers offline. But of course you can also create a page. If you like you can create it right away in the WP:RFA/... namespace; other people will be supposed to leave it alone until you actually list it at the main WP:RFA page. - Just one thing, about co-nominators, I remember some discussion on RFA talk some time ago where it turned out some people find multiple co-noms annoying. So maybe it's better to get a single person to do the nomination but prepare it well. Of course, Aldux is quite good at these things... :-) <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aldux. Thank you very much for your message and your intervention. You are totally right, although no incivility was intended. I guess I reacted quite straightforwardly to some obvious patterns of deception. Best regards. <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 18:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aldux,</p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts in this matter as we can now focus back on furthering the accuracy of articles. However, I do petition for even-handedness here, and am concerned as to why I was the recipient of a final warning, when I have not made unprovoked ad hominem attacks at any time in the past.</p>
<p>You will find that I do not react uncivilly unless provoked in any exchange and that I begin all initial posts as pleasantly as possible, which is undeniably displayed by my record. If any user degrades the exchange with attacks, as was done here, then only do I change the tone of my dialogue.</p>
<p>Regarding the sockpuppet allegation, while I do appreciate your tip, I should note that I'm concerned enough to discuss that map and the mauryan empire article to discuss it with friends, who often assist. While I know there are those who prefer to accuse rather than discuss and prevaricate rather than cooperate, I am not one of them. If you do not believe me, which is understandable given that it cannot be proven either way, that is your prerogative. But I have far more integrity than to set up multiple accounts and to travel all over to make the same changes from different or the same IP addresses. I can assure you that sockpuppetry is neither my style nor aim and neither is violating past agreements.</p>
<p>I trust that you will take these points into consideration. Thanks.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Devanampriya</p>

<dd>Hi. I explained the reasons for the move of the <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs_of_Serbia_15b2.html" title="Vlachs of Serbia">Vlachs of Serbia</a> article to that of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timok_Vlachs_5e4d.html" title="Timok Vlachs">Timok Vlachs</a>. The article currently, deals with the vlachs of the Timok valley in both Bulgaria and Serbia.<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConstantzeanu_48f0.html" title="User:Constantzeanu">Dapiks</a> 21:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ciao Dapiks. I'm not objecting to the idea behing the move (that I personally find quite reasonable) but to the modalities; by using copy-and-paste you completely destroy the history of the article, and I can't consent to this. As I said in the edit summary, use <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>; this way, if the request passes, an admin will proceed to make the move correctly. I hope you haven't moved other articles in this way before; if you have please tell me which, so that I can restore the articles' histories.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 21:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The title 'Timok Vlachs' is inappropriate. Contrary to what user Constantzeanu / Dapiks wrote above, the article does not deal with the Vlachs of Bulgaria. It only mentions them briefly. The title 'Vlachs of Serbia' or even better 'Vlachs of North-Eastern Serbia' is correct, because that is where they live. It is true that in Romania 'Timok Vlachs' or even more frequently 'Timok Romanians' is the preferred term for these people. But the Vlachs themselves disapprove of this term, regarding it as geographically too narrow. C0gnate 02:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And Italian moderator supporting Italian nationalist revising articles of Croatian historical figures. Who is next on your list for revision? Palmostić? Gundulić? Vrančić? How about Jelačić even or maybe Tudjman? -AF</p>
<dl>
<dd>For once, I'll awnser to a banned user, instead of rollbacking his edit as I should. Actually, if you wrote that Tudjman it would make no difference, because I will revert, as you are a banned user, and you have lost at present your right to edit wikipedia. It makes no difference what you write, or if you occupy yourself of French literature or obscure Italian/Croatian/God-Knows-What guys lived in Dalmatia in some time and in some place. I'm not here to mediate between Italian nationalists and you, but simply to make sure banned or blocked editors (yes, I mean YOU) don't try to break the rules by continuing to edit. I don't really care much if you believe me or not, but my wikiinterest for Dalmatia reaches very close to zero.

<dd>Isn't that convenient? You don't say? How about doing your job at preventing trolls and racists like Giovanni Giove revising anything that doesn't suit them? If you actually cared about the rules and preventing Wikipedia a clean place you would actually preserve the original aricles (because that what I am reverting to for the whole time) and stop Giove and others for bringing bad name to you and all Italians. I lost my right? Yeah me being stuborn over reverting what trolls ruin is an old habbit of mine where even 3rr blocks can't prevent me, thats why I "lost my right"....what a joke. --AF</dd>

For this I will revert, because "this is insulting" is not the sort of arguments I care much of.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 17:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not want to repeat myself but as I told you I have Karavaggelis book in front of me and I am wondering were are those claims? Just because someone linked a source does this means that it is actually written? This is a sort of argument I <b>do</b> care much of. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKapnisma_4fce.html" title="User:Kapnisma">Kapnisma</a> 17:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In his book he writes that sometimes Greeks collaborated with the Ottomans and that this was something usual not only for them but also for VMRO. Taking only a phrase, the one that sais <b>we collaborated with the Ottomans</b> , is according to you a correct way of providing informations? He also clearly states the participation of Macedonians (Greek) during the fight but I don't see this mentioned by our dear vbb. Again, both Karavaggelis and Delta decribe the struggle as a fight against the Bulgarians who controlled the VMRO <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKapnisma_4fce.html" title="User:Kapnisma">Kapnisma</a> 17:37, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh! and something else in the so called <i>genuine</i> references our dear vbb provides, the <i>ΕΤΑΙΡΕΙΑ ΜΑΚΕΔΟΝΙΚΟΝ ΣΠΟΥΔΩΟΝ</i> that he wrote is wrong. It is spelled <i>ΕΤΑΙΡΕΙΑ ΜΑΚΕΔΟΝΙΚΩΝ ΣΠΟΥΔΩΝ</i>, the <i>ΑΡΧΕΙΟΝ ΜΑΚΕΔΟΝΙΚΟΥ ΑΓΟΝΟΣ</i> is wrong too, it is spelled <i>ΑΡΧΕΙΟΝ ΜΑΚΕΔΟΝΙΚΟΥ ΑΓΩΝΟΣ</i> <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKapnisma_4fce.html" title="User:Kapnisma">Kapnisma</a> 17:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict)I only know that Vbb wrote this: "As I explained before, quoting Karavangelis'es own autobiographic book, his men were mostly newcomers from Greece (especially officers from the greek regular army, volunteers from Crete, various criminals that he picked somewhere and an insignificant number of locals of which one can mention only Vangelis Natsas and Kotas Hristos (so much about the "numerous locals" that joined the struggle, history recorded only a few). Dont blame me, he wrote the book." If you've got the book, and feel he gave a misleading image of Karavengelis collaboration with the Turks, then rewrite it in accordance to the text. Also remember to adress the question of the number of Greek Macedonians in the the force; if its true that it was a minority, but if you find the wording povish, you can work on that to make it more npov. As for "criminials", I suspect Karavengelis was speaking of local outlaws, that were often recruited in guerilla formations. I don't think you can accuse me of partiality towards Vbb: if you give a look at the talk, he passed half the time yelling at me, and left me a very nice salutiation before leaving ;-)--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 17:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I am sorry if you felt that I also yelled at you. It was not my intention. I started this article just to provide some info about how Greeks see this struggle and I get very disappointed when editors with your quality, and your ability, easily adopt dubious, unsourced claims.

<p>Skopje is city in Macedonia (capital city) not in Albania, so there is no reason for this; let’s imagine the situation with Tirana (capital of Albania) or any other city.</p>
<p>Albanian language is not official language in the Skopje city. Albanian language probably will be official language but in the future, according to Ohrid framework agreement. By the Macedonian Constitution law, ethnic minorities in the state or in the municipalities, can use their language if it is spoken by the local ethnic group, and if that local ethnic group represent more then 20% of the local population (which is case with Skopje), then that ethnic group can use their own language in communication between local government officials or state officials. But, the topological names (like towns, rivers, mountains ...) should be used as spelled in Macedonian language, which is official language throughout all the country.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no low for using other languages then Macedonian. But by the Constitution if for some language, different then Macedonian, there is conditions for practical use (more then 20% of local population should speak that language); Macedonian parliament should adopt special law for using that language. So we have situation: Albanian language has minimum requirements to be official but there is no low for practical use. So we must wait a little.</p>
<p>Sorry my friend, but I think that you are not competent to judge this question. Or may be you take a side.</p>

<dd>Hey guys, I can make those maps... but only if you can get me reassurance that it isn't a copyright violation. I was asking some people before on commons, but was told that even tracing round an existing map would be copyvio (I had intended to do it for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_Tajikistan_6bb6.html" title="Districts of Tajikistan">districts of Tajikistan</a>). <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 08:50, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those maps should be easy enough to recreate. You can get free contour outlines of the national boundaries on the web (if we haven't got them already), and the rest can be done easily in an SVG editor like Inkscape. Tell me if you need help; I've tried my hand at some map-making myself lately. The placement of the colored areas inside the maps doesn't qualify for copyright as such, so there's no legal problem if we re-create those. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks a lot for your awnsers Fran and FPS. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea of copyright status when it comes to things other than books, which is the reason I've never uploaded a single image myself, so I can't guarantee anything regards copyvio. As for the maps, I don't need them all obviously, as they're 15, and some of these are historically innacurate. Again, thanks for anything you can do. And Fran, what do you think of <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_War_61d0.html" title="Toyota War">Toyota War</a> now, with the new lead?

<dd>Hi Aldux. Thanks and yes, you are somehow right :) Well, my main work as a coordinator will be focusing on everything related to Africa military history and obviously the Chadian-Libyan conflict would be part of it. I'll read them carefully and give you a summary. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">FayssalF</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 16:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Chadian-Libyan conflict</i> - The lead is very short. I am thinking of adding some background info to it. The section titles (i.e. <i>The insurgency expands</i>, <i>Libyan difficulties</i>) seem a bit more journalistic than encyclopaedic. Excellent notes and references. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">FayssalF</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 17:28, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>I haven't written the lead, telling the truth; I probably should also add an "aftermath" section. As for the titles of the sections you're right; I've never been any good at writing them.

<p>Hi Aldux. First of all, I've replied to you on the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Wikipedia%7EAfrica-related_regional_notice_board_Peer_review_Bayajidda_978c.html" title="Wikipedia:Africa-related regional notice board/Peer review/Bayajidda">Bayajidda Peer Review</a>; as you can probably tell, I haven't used Google Books before. The second thing regards <a href="../../../o/p/%C3%A9/Op%C3%A9ration_Manta_1c47.html" title="Opération Manta">Opération Manta</a>, which I recently copyedited. In that article, in the <a href="../../../o/p/%C3%A9/Op%C3%A9ration_Manta_1c47.html#Renewed_fighting" title="Opération Manta">#Renewed fighting</a> section, there is a sentence that reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This attack forced the French to counter-attack, although not in the measure desired by Habré, who felt the French ought to retaliate by striking the GUNT at Faya-Largeau, an act that would have been a declaration of war on Libya, risking an escalation of the conflict</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the last bit, "risking escaltion of the conflict," refer to the French counterattack, or the method that Habré desired the French to have used? Or, to phrase my question differently, which of those two things is the one which risked escalation? Right now, the sentence is ambiguous in that regard, but I can't split it in two because I'm not sure what all of it means. Could you clarify that bit? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 03:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings. What happened in AnI is just an embarrassment to wikipedia and to the selfish. Only one side of the story was told, only half of the participants were present, and Yannismarou was bullied while Nev, despite his semi-vandal behaviour, he was victimised. I'm the only person who's been a regular editor to the article and present during Nev's activity since the beginning. I've got all the diffs and I'm willing to shed some light to the case.

<dd>This is the second time that you are removing a public warning from your talk page. As an administrator - you shall know that it is an act of vandalism--<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">Giorgio Orsini</a> 00:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say his calling your revert warring "boring" is a minor injustice compared to the fact that you're harassing him by reposting things he's already removed from his talk page and generally getting on his nerves. With regards to your claim of "vandalism," Aldux didn't commit any vandalism - you, however, are over the line when it comes to disruption. Don't post here again unless he asks you to, and I'm sure he'll be happy to extend you the same courtesy. Bye now. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 01:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All accounts were created since Maleabroad was indef-blocked (most on 1st March), all are editing on the same topics with similar edit summaries, and the last two (along with WikiUser84 who you just blocked) blanked their user pages within a few minutes of each other. It looked like "log in, blank, log out, repeat with next puppet".</p>

<dd>Randomatom001, especially is active on numerous pages and has uploaded various images which are copyright violations (with the incorrect declaration that they are either posters of events or <s>PD</s> false Fair Use justification). Several editors have been busy cleaning up after him. Some of the discussion about him is at <a href="../../../a/b/e/User_talk%7EAbecedare_bd11.html#Socks" title="User talk:Abecedare">User_talk:Abecedare#Socks</a>. Can you take a look ? <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbecedare_f43c.html" title="User:Abecedare">Abecedare</a> 22:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I realized that you were busy with "real life". Initially even I wasn't sure if Randomatom001 was a sock of Maleabroad, but his more recent edit summmaries and POV pushing on "Buddha being an avatar of ..." convinced me eventually. However, as you say, it is best for a checkuser to confirm the suspicion. A range block, if feasible, is direly needed - currently a new sock <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgorithm1_6c58.html" title="User:Algorithm1">User:Algorithm1</a> is on a rampage recreating deleted articles, blanking other socks' pages etc, and even with 3-4 editors cleaning up after him, it gets tiresome after a while. If you have the time can you please delete these copyvio and wrongly tagged images: Image:Holyland.jpg, Image:Punyabhumi.jpg and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Randomatom001" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Randomatom001" rel="nofollow">these</a>.

<dd>Checkuser confirmed the socks (all except <a href="../../../o/m/k/User%7EOmkar_y_fc9d.html" title="User:Omkar y">User:Omkar y</a>; mea culpa since I don't recall why I added him to the list - his contribs. look unrelated). Maleabroad apparently edits from U. Calgary, Canada ("pc127.geog.lab.acs.ucalgary.ca" in one case), so IP range block is perhaps infeasible. Is there any other solution besides dealing with each sock individually ? Anyway, could you please block the known socks and delete the uploaded images (I think <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G5" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G5</a> would now apply) ? I hope its OK to lay all this work at your doorstep - I would be happy to place these requests at the admin noticeboards otherwise.

<p>I have created a new subpage to track the known and suspected socks of <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">User:Maleabroad</a>, so that all interested editors can consolidate information in one place instead of spamming each-others user pages (including yours) on a regular basis.

Can you please let me know if in your opinion this endeavor violates any wikipedia policies, guidelines or even spirit. If it does, I'll be happy to junk it.

<dd>While you are at it, look at his contribs on Turkish Coffee, Doner, Şebinkarahisar, and others. He has deleted sourced info on some instances and replace it with biased and POV content on others (commercial websites, etc). Also, I would like to point out that most of the versions that he reverts to were orginally made by anon (the above mentioned pages). If you look at my reverts or edits, I have never made any contribution that is infammatory or POV. I have simply removed them for not having a credible source (such as on Şebinkarahisar) and commented as such. It may look like I am following him from this post, but I do have a right to express my side of the story. --<a href="../../../o/g/u/User%7EOguz1_ed78.html" title="User:Oguz1">Oguz1</a> 17:22, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly Oguz, I know aabsolutely nothing of your dispute with Domitius, but to say that some of your edits smell of a revenge for previous edits by Domitius is an understatement, especially when one makes an edit summary like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transnistria&amp;diff=116294672&amp;oldid=116073251" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transnistria&amp;diff=116294672&amp;oldid=116073251" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>; and this one is utterly inexplicable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minorities_in_Greece&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116293430" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minorities_in_Greece&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116293430" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>, and does make wonder if this isn't a clear case of <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>.

<p>Aldux,</p>
<p>Please feel free to take a look at my edits, for I fear that they are being misrepresented again. I know you favor PHG in, well, all debates, but I am speaking to you as a contributor to an admin.</p>
<p>As for the Yamuna article, my speech was moderated in spite of the defamation campaign to various other admins that PHG and Giani G engaged in, and the inordinate number of protection requests. You will note that I have repeatedly requested dialogue and understanding. But if PHG supplements his "referenced material" with original research and weasel words "i.e rampaging Satavahanas", "Powerful Foreign armies", and "the earliest Indian astrological work", what am I supposed to do? I am compelled to clean them up because I care about the accuracy of wikipedia. If all these articles are crafted with one-sided narratives, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>In spite of his less than civil post on my page, I have again beseeched PHG to engage in dialogue and to recognize the nature (whether intentional or not) of some of his contributions. It is great that he has the time to develop many of these articles. My concern is when the narrative is reoriented towards things that interest him on pages where they are irrelevant, i.e. the Yamuna.</p>
<p>If you believe there may be a better way to approach PHG to correct some of this, I am more than willing to implement your advice.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<dd>Unfounded accusations by Devanampriya again, who apparently looks for excuses to erase "Greeks in India"-related information at all cost. I am not the author of the expressions "rampaging Satavahanas" or "Powerful Foreign armies". And the "the earliest Indian astrological work" for the <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavanajataka.html" title="Yavanajataka">Yavanajataka</a> is derived from a reference from Mc Evilley "The shape of ancient thought", p385 ("The Yavanajataka is the earliest surviving Sanskrit text in horoscopy, and constitute the basis of all later Indian developments in horoscopy", himself quoting David Pingree "The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja" p5)... although we can also take Mc Evilley's phrase as it is. As a reminder, the Gargi-Samhita also says: "The Yavanas are barbarians, yet the science of astronomy originated with them and for this they must be reverenced like gods". As an other example, Devanampriya systematically deletes mention of the corrupted Greek legends of the <a href="../../../g/u/p/Gupta.html" title="Gupta">Gupta</a> coins (referenced from Rapson "Indian coins in the British Museum"). Deleting referenced material to support partisan views is nothing other than vandalism. <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 20:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello PHG. I'm searching for a mediator, that may hopefully deffuse this unhappy polarization. Having been involved already in the dispute, I would prefer not to be the mediator myself, as I could hardly be considered an objective mediator in this conflict.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 20:53, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I'm not sure if I can invest an awful lot of time into this, but I might give it a try. If PHG and Devanampriya are willing to accept me as an informal mediator, we could try something. I should state from the outset that I know very little or nothing about India though, and my own perspective would naturally tend to be somewhat on the Graecocentric side. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:29, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. These are rather simple cases of repeated deletion of referenced material pertaining to the presence or influence of the ancient Greeks in India, deletions which have been going on for months now:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamuna.html" title="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> page: repeated deletion of the mention of Greek knowledge of the river following the campaigns of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucus_I_79b2.html" title="Seleucus I">Seleucus I</a>, with deletion of the quote by <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>.</li>
<li>Repeated deletion of the mention of coin legends with corrupted Greek script on the coins of the <a href="../../../g/u/p/Gupta_Empire_ef36.html" title="Gupta Empire">Gupta</a> kings <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandragupta_II_c5d6.html" title="Chandragupta II">Chandragupta II</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumara_Gupta_I_b2ab.html" title="Kumara Gupta I">Kumara Gupta I</a>, with references from Rapson "Indian coins of the British Museum".</li>
<li>Repeated deletion of the mention of Greek and Aramaic languages in the northwestern territories of the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurya_Empire_d691.html" title="Maurya Empire">Mauryas</a> in the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Template%7EMaurya_Empire_infobox_a996.html" title="Template:Maurya Empire infobox">Template:Maurya Empire infobox</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/t/Satavahana.html" title="Satavahana">Satavahana</a> page: repeated deletion of a quote of the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puranas.html" title="Puranas">Puranas</a> that mentions <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavana.html" title="Yavana">Yavana</a> rule after the Satavahanas, with reference from Rapson "Indian coins of the British Museum".</li>
