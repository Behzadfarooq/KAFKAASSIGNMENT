<p>This article has been de-tagged as requiring cleanup, but as far as I can see it is still very badly written and ungrammatical.

<dd>Whether or not you believe your comments to be "accurate", they were unencyclopaedic and inappropriate for Wikipedia. WP strives to achieve a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and your comments were clearly unbalanced and lacked justification. For example, phrases such as, "At night Aldershot town centre becomes a war zone, a no-go area for decent people" and "the Rotten Borough of Rushmoor" are clearly statements of opinion and not fact. Rushmoor is not a <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten_borough.html" title="Rotten borough">rotten borough</a> in the formal sense, and the remark is potentially confusing to other readers, never mind the obvious negative bias in the term. Who are your "decent people", and how have you asserted the relevance of their opinions on this page encyclopaedia? I also note from your talk page that you have previously been blocked from editing WP due to vandalism.</dd>
<dd>On a more constructive note, perhaps you would care to rewrite your comments, giving an even-handed treatment to all viewpoints and providing appropriate sources to support your comments?

<p>Dear Mr Watson. While your efforts to 'contribute' are noble and generous, they have become ignorant, disruptive and unhelpful. The 'Aldershot' page has only recently been taken upon to create. While the page is quite new and obviously lacking in certain areas and detail etc. those comments pictures and opinions (so far) are factual and represent many views of many people who actually know and / or live in the town. While the description of the town for example, may not immediately be seen as a positive contribution and a negative pov it is in fact VERY topical to anyone who has ever known the way the town was and the way it is now. Of course the reasons for this are subjective, but still they are fact and DO represent a very real aspect of the history of the town. If you don’t like it say so but please don’t go chopping and changing and deleting large chunks and even pictures because YOU don’t like them, because it does not confirm to your opinion alone. I'm sure as an 'expert' Wikipedia moderator you will find many areas of content, punctuation and even grammar does not meet your exacting standards but I would ask you unless you really KNOW, please lay off. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 131.227.76.238 (<a href="../../../1/3/1/User_talk%7E131.227.76.238.html" title="User talk:131.227.76.238">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.227.76.238_9fa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.227.76.238">contribs</a>) 13:57, 12 May 2006.</small></p>

<p>My apologies for spelling your name wrong.</p>
<p>Well all I can see it a lot of abuse rather than edit. You refer to opinion but actually its fact and as it happens the decline of the town is a relevant part of its stature. I did say more will be added. And then why the deletion of the memorial site information and photograph/s? If you were that conscientious and perfect for wiki you would have used it and added an independent page, as this was information that very few people have seen. Be my guest but I guess your not. In principle no one could disagree an edit is an edit which you clearly exploit to the max. However despite your own schoolboy grammer, the text your link refers to says "Wikipedia not only allows you to add, revise, and edit the article — it wants you to do it. It does require some amount of politeness, but it works. You'll see. If someone writes an inferior article, a merely humorous article, an article stub, or outright patent nonsense, don't worry that editing it might hurt their feelings. Correct it, add to it, and, if it's total nonsense, replace it. That's the nature of a Wiki. And, of course, others here will boldly and mercilessly edit what you write. Don't take it personally. They, like all of us, just want to make Wikipedia as good as it can possibly be.</p>
<p>…but don't be reckless!</p>
<p>And I think that says enough</p>
<p>Me too appallled by the actions of Watson, big bother has a big stick.</p>
<p>There was a perfectly good decription of Aldershot as it is, with pictures, with references, but he did not like it.</p>
<p>Tough!</p>
<p>If the content had been false, it would have been grounds to change it, but it wasn't.</p>
<p>There were pictures, there were references, did Big Bother bother to check?</p>
<p>Watson, or another of his big brother clones, are referring to other changes to other changes. Changes made from an ISP that is in a Public Library.</p>
<p>Obviously ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>This tiny little episode seriously compromises the credibility of Wikipedia!</p>
<p><br />
Would some idiot called Watson, Watkins or whoever he is, please stop abusing his position and vandalising the Aldershot page.</p>
<p>He does not like its contents, throws a childish tantrum, and vandalises the page.</p>
<p>What was there, and then restored, was a fair and accurate description of Aldershot.</p>
<p>He may not like it, but that is what Aldershot is like.</p>
<p>Interesting that he lives nowhere near Aldershot.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss as they say.</p>
<p>Highly amusing is the comment by Watson</p>
<p>'As you should be aware, all editors are free to be bold in making changes to articles. Specialist knowledge of a subject is not essential, though obviously beneficial'</p>
<p>One would hope that all those contributing to a page have expert knowldge, otherwise the page content is worthless, but to Watkisn, this is not important!</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss!!!!</p>
<p>Latest issue of Surrey Hants Star (Thurs 11 May 2006), the local newspaper for Aldershot, has a letter describing how bad Aldershot is, people fear to go out on the streets, abusive yobs etc etc.</p>
<p>What eveyone who either knows or lives in Aldershot knows to be the truth.</p>
<p>What was here was a fair and accurate description of Aldershot, that is until the page was vandalised by Waterspoon who decided to strip out everything he did not like.</p>
<p>It is people like Wankerspoon who are giving Wikipedia a bad name.</p>
<p>He should be blocked from changing pages on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I have to agree with <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> here. It should be noted that Wikipedia is not interested in <b>truth</b>, Wikipedia is interested in <b>verifiability</b>. Thus, you cannot say things like, "the Rotten Borough of Rushmoor" or "At night Aldershot town centre becomes a war zone" unless a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <i>and</i> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> source has already made those statements. Without specific citations from the aforementioned reliable sources, the information should be removed immediately.

<p>The version of "Shopping in Aldershot" by 131.227.76.238 is intersting and well-written, but is unbalanced and not supported by citation to reliable sources. For example, "All the local councillors seem capable of, is wringing their hands and shedding crocodile tears, (while collecting their expences)." This should appear in an encyclopedia only as an attributed quote, and should be balanced by a countervailing opinion. The version by DWaterson, while rather spare, is more nearly what an encyclopedia article should be. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 19:25, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just to note, I didn't write the current version; I just reverted to the last version I considered acceptably encyclopaedic. I agree that some of the anonymous editor's comments were interesting, but, as you say, are not supported adequately. That was why, in my comment of 13:25, 12 May 2006, I suggested a thorough rewrite could bring the text into a more acceptable format.

<p>In an attempt to resolve this dispute, I have substantially rewritten several sections and done a general tidy up. I have tried to incorporate several parts of the disputed text, although there wasn't a lot that was usable. This was because unfortunately, after some quick research, it appeared that a substantial proportion of the text was a potential copyvio (or at least a dubious rehash) of ((link to Parkins blacklisted site removed can be found at wwwdotheurekadotclaradotnet/surrey-hants/ald-shot.htm]. That website appears to contain mainly a highly POV rant about the supposed evils of Rushmoor borough council, so I do not see that we can use it reliably even as a source. However, if someone could flesh out the 'history' section and provide some reliable citations for the 'shopping' section, that would much improve the article. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 19:24, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have many credible News paper articles, in addition to photos, even video I could/would like to add. Some aspects of this place are not all bad I must say. Some bits were to be very good. But some nasty aspects of this town though are worthy of description to be said about it, that IS the way it is. Fact and Verifiable. and if any discussion takes place about it they must also be said for an honest and balanced view.</p>
<p>Of course behind the negative stuff and which IS NOT just pov are those that have and do administer it. This town HAS changed RADICALLY in one hundred years. Even there own verifiable publications acknowledge it.</p>
<p>So which bits should Wiki portray. Which year has the bits in YOU feel should be there? Otherwise YOU are doing Wiki the disservice by not allowing the good and the bad to be shown. Or giving anyone the chance to add content if you don’t like it. Does that mean it not there for Christ's sake! Or only allowing crap like "it was built on heath land to serve the British army" which isn’t realy going to fob off anyone that reads it, is it??? Are comments like these verifiable, or your guess from reading it somewhere. Or is it the way it is now, with many of its buildings derelict or demolished, empty run down shops, drunken drug laden louts rampaging through the streets, urban warriors that torment and intimidate. This IS all verifiable. This IS Aldershot NOW But then how do you pretend this is not so? By deleting one photo showing a street scene. By deleting the mention of its most recent memorial, AND a picture. By adding pointless references that you think ARE verifiable facts.</p>
<p>I'm afraid if the panic deletions of content of this one page before anyone gets a chance to complete it, are an example of Wikipedia then it has failed. Either they (waterson) were put up to it or are just over opinionated pricks that know no better (sorry no other term fits) . And as far as I'm concerned, unless I see a BALANCED view of the town, the way it REALY is, warts an all, then I and others will make sure that is made clear to all your pages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Clever dicky (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clever_dicky_d527.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clever dicky">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I agree - we should show the good and the bad. I've come to this fairly late so I don't know about the images that have been removed. If you have sources - does the local newspaper have a webpage you can link to? If not, you could put in additions. The memorials section hasn't been deleted - if you read above, I've put it on a subpage for development till its ready. That way it can be worked on till its complete.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that the entire article is unsourced and needs verification, including the heathland romanticization. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 07:55, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm new to this. I arrived on this page by chance only a few weeks ago, and found a few new entries to a fledgling page, and happened to agree with most of what was written and so added the pics I happened to have. The page certainly needed tidying. The pics taken were mine to upload as public domain that happened to support what was written. I vouch for their authenticity and content. And I have plenty more. Of course more needed adding to this article and not just bad stuff. A lot more can be added thats good in fact VERY good, like pics of an original Victorian arcade, &amp; market in the town. Pics of Visits by Royalty, pics of Rushmoor military tattoo. and much, much more. But this is the past. None of its there anymore, and that’s the point. Isn’t an encyclopaedia meant to portray what is - not just what was. I can cite a dozen stories easily of people who once new Aldershot back in the day, and who are SHOCKED to see it as it is now. After travelling perhaps a couple of thousand miles. Can you imagine them saying "But I saw it on Wiki and it looked lovely, just like I knew it when I was stationed there fifty years ago"</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is difficult to see how can have a fair and balanced page on Aldershot when some idiot, who does not know the town, and lives nowhere near it is hell bent on vandalsing the page when he does not like the content.</dd>

<p>So how can anyone even make a start to contribute building up a good reference for others to see it as it is, if others are hell bent on deleting it all, all the time. Its such a good thing that the history of a page is kept. I appreciate (moving for the time being)the memorial section. Of course they mean a lot to many. So it will be good to include all those in the town. They include two national memorials from each world war. The second ww memorial actualy has a rockery made up from a piece of rubble from every town in Britain that was bombed. Nowadays given peoples attitude you could easily wonder why they bothered.</p>
<p>So as I and others who still might be tempted to upload stuff and think about what to write I wonder if anyone should bother, if others plan to delete what ever they happen to disagree with. And so how do you make a picture of something 'verifiable'&#160;? Isnt it enough that its there or does verifiable only include the plagiarised? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Clever dicky (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clever_dicky_d527.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clever dicky">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a>. When you upload a photo, you have to chose copyright licences and leave a description of the photo. If its you're own, you could chose to release it under a free licence and note in the box that it is 'self made' or something along those lines. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 12:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For example, this picture (fromerly in the article) is uploaded correctly:</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="../../../s/i/m/Image%7ESIMG0014.JPG_7cff.html" class="internal" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/96/SIMG0014.JPG/180px-SIMG0014.JPG" alt="" width="180" height="135" longdesc="../../../s/i/m/Image%7ESIMG0014.JPG_7cff.html" class="thumbimage" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, the caption that went with it - Police kept busy by binge drinkers on a typical evening - was a bit misleading and polarizing. Something along the lines of 'Town centre drinking has lead to a high police presence in Aldershot in the evenings' approaches it from a more neutral point of view. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 12:55, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems wankerspoon is only interested in promoting his own pov and deleting anything he dislikes.</p>
<p>The impomtant bit, is it correct, seems to have been lost.</p>
<p>There was a fair and accurate description of Aldershot by people who live in or know the town, but wankerspoon who seems to be totally ignorant of Aldershot thought he knew best anbd vandilised the page.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I've reverted the changes for now. I do think that the things you are saying could be included in the article but at the moment your edits are not neutral. They are romanticizing a none existent past and represent one view of how the town has changed. This is a view worth representing, but in a paragraphy or two.

<p>Tell us what more you need. Pictures, news articles, links witness statements. Copies of letters to councillors/MP. Retail figures, consultant reports its all there. Just say what you want.</p>
<dl>
<dd>well I've merged the two but statements such as:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"But unlike many towns, part of Aldershot’s inheritance has been based upon the evening economy of bars, pubs, and the entertainment of soldiers for many years. However, looking back at the effects of lost retail that reputation bought, and during the low times of the eighties when consumers began to choose where to shop. Is it any wonder? But like many towns now with local and national government supported all night 24hr drinking, what contribution has the reputation of the evening trade really cost this once great Victorian town?"</p>
<p>are just unacceptable. It is not Wikipedia's place to judge. Factors such as 24hr drinking etc. are seen as good things by some people. This is just opinion. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:08, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yet another wildly unencyclopaedic POV rant has been inserted into this article. This time it is backed up with unconvincing sources and quotations, such as the rambing thoughts of letter-writers to the local newspaper.

<p>" This time it is backed up with unconvincing sources and quotations, such as the rambling thoughts of letter-writers to the local newspaper." This time....! WHO are you and David D. who felt that the quality of the article was bought down, to make such enlightened comments about what someone else, who seems to know far more about the place than either of you has written? Where are your own genuine 'positive' contributions? Not that anyone realy cares, but all I ever see are your edits LORDing over what others write. Who is realy going to give a shit if its peoples pov. What about George Bush's pov? Or where is your own original verifiable content that you havent read or copied from some far flung website. Do you even Know what a Pikey is?

If you take a look at the specific edits by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aldershot&amp;diff=61405297&amp;oldid=60319459" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aldershot&amp;diff=61405297&amp;oldid=60319459" rel="nofollow">213.166.17.22</a>, it should be clear to you why anyone would consider reverting rather than improving the content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First the editor deleted a perfectly good section on the galleries and Wellington centre that actually addressed many of the issues that were then reintroduced. Except the deleted material was more concise, coherent and had better sources. This is one of the hallmark of a vandalism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly there are phrases in the new content that send up big warning flags that the new material is a rant rather than objective content.</dd>
<dd>For example:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>"<i>building a shopping mall which ripped out the heart of the town</i>"
<dl>
<dd>this is overly melodramatic</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"<i>crass planning decisions"</i>
<dl>
<dd>this is inappropriate use of slang</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"<i>a local lass who now lives in Somerset"</i>
<dl>
<dd>again inappropriate use of slang</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"<i>an out-of-town Tesco was a death knell"</i>
<dl>
<dd>melodramatic as well as being completely redundant with an earlier sentence "<i>an edge-of-town Tesco superstore which drained business from the town</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"<i>The weekly Thursday market is a remnant of its former glory".</i>
<dl>
<dd>Pretty strong POV here.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"<i>Somewhat belatedly and rather late in the day, local councillors have recognised that something is wrong."</i>
<dl>
<dd>This is political commentary that is not appropriate for an encyclopedic article,</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The use of all the testimonials is also original research that is not aceptable for an encyclopedia.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In summary, good content was removed from the article and replaced with more voluminous content of a lower quality. I did not delete your contribution due the hegative perspective. i deleted it since it was not written in a style suitable for an encyclopedia. I hope this is helpful for you if you as a guide to how to write acceptable content for this article.</dd>
<dd>With regard to you comment, "WHO are you and David D. who felt that the quality of the article was bought down". Did you consider that it is unlikely for some random person to edit this article? There is a pretty good chance people don't edit such a page without some knowledge on the topic.

<p>New sections are very welcome. You are most generous. I've an idea. How about YOU both writing a piece on Aldershot today, the way it really is today, in comparison to the way it really was... You might also like to add why this has come about (without pov)and what did actually lead to its demise, socio- economic decline and loss of its better buildings / businesses / and parts of the town that provided its character and distinction, say in comparison to the way it is, to the way it was (and continues to be portrayed) with other market towns. Then I and Im sure others wouldnt need to hesitate before adding content or other support. Now wouldnt that would make a good encyclopedic article. Clever Dicky.</p>

<p>It would seem WP standards are an excuse for jumped up little turds that know, and most likely DO, sod all with their sad pathetic little lives. Hope your not offended if this includes YOU. Trouble is content might be factual and reproducible if only you could be bothered to ask or LOOK. But then that might mean sliding your fat ass off the floor and finding things out for yourself. Clearly others coments and from whats written and been deleted your like many a freak that gets off jacking others.

<dd>Let's see, you say: " <i>if only you could be bothered to ask or LOOK. But then that might mean sliding your fat ass off the floor and finding things out for yourself.</i> ". Clearly you need to read up on the wikipedia policy of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">no original research</a>. It is why little of your content is acceptable for this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 16:20, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
