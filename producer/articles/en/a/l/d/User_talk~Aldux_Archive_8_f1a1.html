<dd>I have a question, why did Tsar Simeon call himself "Tsar of Bulgarians and Greeks" if the Byzantine Empire was not Greek?--<a href="../../../e/u/t/User%7EEuthymios_18b7.html" title="User:Euthymios">Euthymios</a> 22:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Things are very complex here. I do not deny the fact that many contemporaries called the Byzantines "Greeks"; but I think that the major reasons for that are two: 1) Especially for the westerners, who thought that the true Roman Empire was the Holy Roman Empire of the German People it would be confusing and even humiliating to consider the Byzantines as Romans; after all the Pope used to be the face of the Empire for them. 2) People did not have such knowledge in history as today; as the official languaga was Greek, they thought that the population of Byzantium was Greek too. There is also one more reason: the Byzantine historians often called the Bulgarians "Moesians", which has nothing to do with them, but thus they wanted to emphasize that they were insignificant; for the same reason the Bulgarians called the Byzantines Greeks.</p>
<p>If Greece was truely Byzantium, why it did not keep this name? Byzantium I should say sounds glorius and although it was a great enemy of my country, I should admit that this was the most successful, infuential and culturally developped state in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, so if the greeks were Byzantines, I think that they should have kept the name. After all the name "Greece" as a country dates back from 1829; in the Antiquity there was not such state, but such region as is the Middle East for instance today, consisting of numerous independent polisi. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 09:25, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux,</p>
<p>Browsing the list of administrators, and being completely new on the Wikipedia, I decided to ask you for help.</p>
<p>Here is the user signed as <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> which publicly claims that I used so-called sock-puppets in reverting something re-written by him, which he hails as superior to the previous version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism#Croatia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism#Croatia" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Sock_puppetry" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Sock_puppetry" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Even worse, on the talk pages of the anonymous users who reverted his version of the Croatia subsection he put the {sockpuppet|NovaNova}<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> tag. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.57.101.133&amp;action=edit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.57.101.133&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:71.252.81.35" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:71.252.81.35" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>I do not think that I should defend myself against baseless accusations and that there must be a way to stop this public slander - which is something I would ask you to do.</p>
<p>Of course, you are more than welcome to check his accusations about the sock-pupperty - and make your findings public. I would appreciate it greatly.</p>
<p>Also, his agressive behavior comes always when he breaks 3RR rule as it can be seen here - twice<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Observations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Observations" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92446859" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92446859" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92385857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92385857" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92351258" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Nazism&amp;oldid=92351258" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>--NovaNova 23:43, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>User:NovaNova has constantly reverted a section of the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazism</a> article to an inferior state that did not focus on the actual topic of the article. I comprimised by combining the old and new version of the section, but NovaNova continued the destructive reverts instead of making productive edits. This led to the article being locked. NovaNova has done similar things to the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_in_Croatia_83f9.html" title="Neo-Nazism in Croatia">Neo-Nazism in Croatia</a> article, but to a lesser extent (so far). The two anonymous IPs who reverted the neo-Nazism article were obviously NovaNova. They did the exact same revert that NovaNova kept doing, and used the same kind of unique language style in the edit note that NovaNova is known for. I find it amusing that NovaNova would write here that I broke 3RR, since NovaNova has been guilty of the same offence.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 12:53, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello Aldux! Since you helped User:Coppertwig and me with a move some time ago regarding Hellenistic Art, where an original article and a new version had to be somehow combined, can you give me some advice? I created a draft at User_talk:EdJohnston/Tifft_draft whose contents have now been copy-pasted into the main article, by agreement of the editors. This draft is no longer needed. Is it better to leave it around, or delete it? I thought I'd move it, so it is now in <a href="../../../e/d/j/User_talk%7EEdJohnston_Archive4_5568.html" title="User talk:EdJohnston/Archive4">User_talk:EdJohnston/Archive4</a> but now I'm concerned that it's wasting resources. What do you think? There is very little edit history in the draft, and I don't mind at all if it's deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:36, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux. Happy holidays, I hope you are well. I have a question about the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> article. I believe you added the original text, describing Alexander's demands regarding Demosthenes in 335 BC. Based solely on the Plutarch's <i>Phocion</i>, I've recently modified that text and changed the sense of what you wrote, please see <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_2250.html#Alexander.27s_demands_regarding_Demosthenes_in_335_BC" title="Talk:Alexander the Great">Talk:Alexander the Great#Alexander's demands regarding Demosthenes in 335 BC</a>, for details. I would like your opinion on the changes I made. Are there other sources for this incident than Plutarch?

<p>I just saw your post because of edit conflicts. I am aware of those. But can I simply create articles for Point and email twenty friends to take part in its AfD? This is extremely frustrating and unhelpful, and detrimental to Wikipedia. Have any of those users been warned? Please read the whole AfD again, there are some worrying patterns. None of those users have disclosed how they came across this article. I am finished with that AfD in any case. So, don't worry. What do you think about what happened in the AfD?

<dd>Barristarim, I'm happy you've calmed down now. I have no reasons for believing that many of them knew of it through the link to FPS, as I did, as FPS is strongly connected with Greek topics, so it's not so strange many of them came to knew of it. You're entitled to have your suspects, but unless you can substantiate them, and bring serious elements before the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, it's better to keep them for yourself.

<p>Hello i think if we keep the articles separate it would be better because the mitanni article describes the location and some information on there kings while the Armenian kingdom of mitanni contains different info we can add it to the see also section.

<p>Aldux, you did your part by pointing out unreferenced sections that I had missed and that long quote that really bothered me too. I didn't want to get rid of it as I thought it's important to understand the speech at the rostra, all is well now.

<p>Thx for leaving me a message. I am sorry if you got the wrong impression that I was trying to say something bad about u, or making any assumptions that you were doing something wrong.It's just that it seems to me that the Pusyamitra hoax is being given undue importance on wikipedia, thanks to partisan ideologies and political interests. This observation is based on my reading many wiki articles where allegations of his "persecution of Buddhists" (based entirely upon Buddhist religious scripture) is prominently featured. The thing is that Sungas are a very unimportant footnote in Indian history in the face of greats like the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauryan_Empire_d897.html" title="Mauryan Empire">Mauryan</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/p/Gupta_Empire_ef36.html" title="Gupta Empire">Guptas</a>, and it is not important enough to be featured so prominently across wikipedia. I think it only deserves brief mentioning on account of it's verifiability. In recent years, political parties and certain "academics" with partisan biases are harping on exaggerations relating to their attitudes towards Buddhism for political purposes (in an ancient country like India, history is often used to rake up political controversy). We in India know this problem well.My feeling is that wikipedia should not be used for political propaganda, and my attempt to put the academic truth (preferentially over Buddhist religious parables) was an attempt to depoliticize the article.I did not assume that you belonged to any such partisan group, and, if you thought I did, then I apologize.However, perhaps you should have opened a dialogue with me in the talk page to discuss my additions and I would have pointed you to the relevant subject matter. It would have avoided needless unpleasantness. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 17:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux.

<dd>Well first of all, I didn't write the Bodele article - my single edit to it was a copyedit. I agree that it is very well written - probably even a bit above what I'm capable of, in fact. (My closest DYK to Chad is <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayajidda.html" title="Bayajidda">Bayajidda</a>, from northern Nigeria - he crossed Chad, but didn't stay. If I've written any Chad articles, they're just geo-stubs or bio-stubs that are so poor I've forgotten them already.) Anyways, because of what you showed me about the naming confusion, I'll withdraw the RM request and leave Faya as a redirect to Faya-Largeau (all incoming links seem to Faya seem to be for the town, not the plant.) Does this sound good? I'm not sure the current dab page, <a href="../../../f/a/y/Faya_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Faya (disambiguation)">Faya (disambiguation)</a>, is needed at all now, because "X (disambiguation)" pages with two entries tend to be pretty useless. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 17:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, first of all, the geo coordinates (17°55′00″N, 19°7′00″E) in the article are wrong. They're off by a little bit, maybe because no one with accurate equipment has ever been to northern Chad, maybe because the French didn't measure it right - I'm not sure why, but I know they aren't quite accurate. The 00s should probably be numbers.</dd>
<dd>Anyways, the locator dot was created so we wouldn't have to upload a picture with a big red dot on it for every town and city - with this, we can upload a national map and place the locator dot <i>over</i> the map. The x and y are coordinates (see also <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinate_system.html" title="Coordinate system">coordinate system</a> for more on them and how to fiddle with them) help move the dot to the correct place. The coordinates in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faya-Largeau&amp;oldid=87622533" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faya-Largeau&amp;oldid=87622533" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the map had the red dot a little to the left of where the small black, so I adjusted it using the preview button until the dots were directly on top of eachother. I assume they weren't on top of eachother like they should've been because of the aforementioned inaccurate coordinates of Faya-Largeau. For me, at least, it was just guess&amp;check work to get the x and y coordinates right. There might be a better way than what I did, but I'm not aware of it.</dd>

<p>Thank you for getting involved in this. I stumbled across this article while doing disambiguation link repair, so I thought I would make a bit of an effort to clean it up.

<dd>Hi Kubigula. The reson I noted it is simply that I have a very vast watchlist, covering almost all Greece-related articles, among other things, only, these are really a lot of articles. As for the way you've handled the matter, I don't have any objections: you noted serious POV and OR problems, and you intervened with civility.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 20:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, the long watchlist - I might have guessed. My watchlist seems to grow by a few articles every day. Sze Cavalary seems to be waiting for your input on Cleophis. May I ask if you intend to edit the article more substantially? No pressure - if you have other areas you would prefer to spend your energy on, I will take a stab at reducing the POV and OR.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 04:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Aldux! And a happy new year! It is the first time we "speak" since the intrusion of 2007! Do you remember explaining me the virtues of being an administrator?! I think I'll go for it, although I still want my time for my articles, and I hope the new duties and responsibilities (if, of course, the RfA is successful, which is something unpredictable) will not jeopardize my editing work. What made me re-think the whole thing was <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcibiades.html" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>'s appearance in the main page tomorrow. I had told you that I will think about it, and I will decide about January 10.

I thought it might be a sign (well, I'm a bit superstitious; but don't worry, I try not to overdo it!), and I was "pushed" by this coincidence towards accepting the prospect of a RfA.</p>
<p>I don't know how should I organize the whole thing. Make a draft page somewhere with the nominations, the questions, the answers etc, and when I'am ready submit it officially? How does this thing work? In any case, I'd be happy if you, Nicos and Rob, namely you who made the proposal and the two other users who commented on it (and with whom I have shared some of the most vivid and creative moments in Wikipedia), could co-nominate me. I would be really honored. Maybe we can prepare the nominatios, then work the (obligatory - if understand how RfA works) questions-answers, and Monday-Tuesday - if I feel everything is ready - submit it. I do not want to hurry; what matters to me is to make the things properly and try to be accurate and well-prepared for the whole proceedure. I wait for your comments.

<dd>Hey, good! Go for it! That way you will be able block me next time I remove Greek poems from my userpage...&#160;:-) As for the process, what I did myself was to prepare most of my answers offline. But of course you can also create a page. If you like you can create it right away in the WP:RFA/... namespace; other people will be supposed to leave it alone until you actually list it at the main WP:RFA page. - Just one thing, about co-nominators, I remember some discussion on RFA talk some time ago where it turned out some people find multiple co-noms annoying. So maybe it's better to get a single person to do the nomination but prepare it well. Of course, Aldux is quite good at these things...&#160;:-) <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I need some help in translating/verifying the examples in <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reflexive_verb.html" title="Reflexive verb">Reflexive verb</a> to Italian (plus, some fact-checking regarding Italian). As you can see, the examples should denote common usages across 5 languages, so, if the appropriate form in Italian is not reflexive, please substitute it with a reflexive one (I'll take care of the Slavic translations).</p>
