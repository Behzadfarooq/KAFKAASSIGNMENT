<dd>For the relatively short time I've been here I learned that no kind of "moderate" action will "soften" nationalistic hot-heads. Forgive me for not asuming good faith anymore when speaking to you Telex, but I can't endlessly tolerate the insults about my people from you and similar types. Like I said - your words and theories will not bring any good (even to what you think is your cause) , but will continue to spread balkan nationalistic poison. And the price is being paid and will continue to be paid by everybody in the region. But I've pretty much given up defending even obvious things, because some thing can't be explained to somebody who refuses to think. Just stop preaching me about nationalism and how to behave here. You don't have the credibility to do that. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealek_4962.html" title="User:Realek">Realek</a> 23:01, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aldux I still havent got any comment from you - are you OK with the version that among other things implies that:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, <b>and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed</b>.</i></li>
<li>Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group</li>
<li><i>Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia</i></li>
<li>There was no resentment towards <i>the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region</i>, by removing that sentance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The text was far from perfect anyway, but this version is even closer to Macedonian negators positions. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealek_4962.html" title="User:Realek">Realek</a> 13:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to break-in but I need to make a remark. Nobody ever claimed that "Greek Macedonians" is a distinct ethnic group. However, I'm not aware of any wikipedia policy which strictly enforces the usage of an ethnic group's name in similar scenarios. Therefore I don't see any valid, non-biased arguments against the use of this term. As far as I'm concerned the name is in wide use by Balkan historians and has a separate entry in the Australian encyclopedia of ethnic origins (as Greek Macedonians arrived in Australia before Macedonia was unified with Greece). Today's Greek population is the amalgam of an ethnically similar, yet culturally diverse people which stressed from the Ionian sea to western Asia Minor. There was a huge cultural difference between the Greeks of the Venetian-held Ionian island and those of Pontus, and a disambiguation must be made where required. Having said that, I see no rational reason to ignore such important cultural elements due to a single editor's ignorance and chauvinist bias. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 20:06, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The evidence is quite clear that Albania as a nation did not exist prior to the 20th century. Giorgios Kastriotis was of Epirotian origin. That is already an established fact. The Epirotians are (as any high school child would know)a very ancient Greek tribe. How on earth did Albania suddenly start claiming the Epirotians is surprising me (Being half Epirotian myself I can trace my anscestors to late Byzantium-something very few people can do). In the 2oth century the western powers gave them North Epirus disregarding the fact that 90% of the population in that region were Greek (Ironically they claim the same in Kosovo today?!). They gave them the Byzantine Eagle as their new national symbol (basically stealing it from the legendary Kastriotis who used that regional Byzantine symbol as his emblem). Kastriotis was a devout Greek Orthodox Christian who fought the Ottomans very bravely. He corresponded with the Paleologi in order to combat the Ottoman onslaught till the very end. I challenge you (or anyone) to show me evidence where Scanderbeg considered himself to be Albanian and more so where the word Albanian exists during his time?! And let us not forget the last fact- that Giorgios Kastriotis' (scanderbeg) native language was Greek (there was no established Albanian language at the time.</p>

<dd>Well at least we can all agree that he was not a pure Albanian. But I urge for anyone to take a look at the fact that he was a prince in Epirus. And Epirus was a classical Greek Kingdom. I will say it should be looked into more (but his bio on Wikipedia should be presented as a a hero of Albania as well as Greece- to be fair).I can tell you Miskin one thing, Constantine Paleologos Dragas (The last Byzantine Emperor was surely Half Serbian and Half Greek).And guess who corresponded with the Byzantine Emperor?!</dd>

<p>Also one other famous man Basil the Second also known as the Bulgar-slayer who was of the Macedonian dynasty fought a very famous Bulgar at the time- Samuel who by the way had a very questionable last name -Kometopoulos!? Go figure. What do I mean by all this? Its the fact that many Emperors were already of mixed descent-that is the point.That is why Scanderbeg cannot be portrayed as just Albanian!</p>

<p>You stated that I am in danger of violating 3RR for the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thracians.html" title="Thracians">Thracians</a> article. Well Aldux, you do emphasize the importance of placing sources whenever something new appears in an article. Case in point, you stated that you would allow the section "Illyrians as Dorians" to appear on the Illyrians article if I provided non-Greek sources. Fair enough. I would love to go an do some research to help further validate (or even dismiss) the content that I placed in the overall section.</p>
<p>Now here is the ironic part. You expect people to provide sources in order for them to validate their statements. A sound policy. For example, in the Illyrians article I completely understood where you were coming from and already decided to conduct some research (instead of engaging in a useless revert war). However, in the Thracians article the section I placed is supported by a source. To, in a sense, "warn" me for violating 3RR because the section I placed in the Thracians article is supported by a valid source is kind of rash. Of course, I don't expect you to agree with me (don't feel bad, a lot of people tend to disagree with me even when I tell them the truth).</p>
<p>Let's be realistic Aldux. Do you really think that banning me will accomplish anything? I am just asking out of curiousity. You know what, don't answer that question. I pretty much have a feeling that your answer will entail the following: "If it stops you from reverting articles, then yes!" Anyway, my job as a sociologist is to conduct research even if the results I get make members of mainstream academia want to commit acts of self-defenistration. Sure, I am what you call an "imperfect sociologist". Yet, I tend to like being unconventional from time to time since it makes life a little bit more interesting. However, you have to ask yourself every time I alter an article, "Why is Deucalionite doing this?" More often than not, I will give you an honest answer if you just ask instead of assume that I am changing articles just to upset you or anyone else for that matter.</p>
<p>Just so you know, I fixed the references in the Thracians article and there is still a reference that supports the section "Thracians and Myceneans". If you want to ban me and receive a barnstar just because I think people deserve the right to know about the Fourth International Congress of Thracology, then have fun. However, please do not follow a certain path that leads you to a place where words and actions don't coincide. Take care and remember that wooden nickels are not legal tender in 48 states. Over and out. - Deucalionite May 5, 2006 6:34 P.M.</p>

<p>Independently of the origins of ancient Macedonians, I think you would agree that everyone in both antiquity and modern times would accept that the Macedonian ruling class descended of the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argos.html" title="Argos">Argives</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heracles.html" title="Heracles">Heraclids</a>, and most definitely participated in the Olympic Games. It is blatant from ancient citations (e.g. Callisthenes, Demosthenes) that Philip II and Alexander III did claim Greek origin at least for themselves (and in several occasions for all Macedonians). Not long ago you said that Pontus was not a fully Hellenic Kingdom because the royal family claimed Persian origin. Aren't you using double standards in the case of Macedon? Why are many Roman Emperors labeled by an ethnic origin and Macedonians aren't? It's almost as if it's been done on purpose. Macedon was 100% Hellenised by the 4th century BC, and it's very probable and well supported that it's been Hellenic since the beginning. Yet the articles deal with it as if it was a barbarian Kingdom similar to Illyria. Do you honestly find the Macedon-related articles completely unbiased? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 11:29, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I wasn't very clear. I don't wish to change the status of the Macedonian language nor try to refer to Macedon as another Greek Kingdom. It was different in several cultural aspects and it has to be differentiated, at least during the Classic period (in Hellenistic time there was a clear assimilation). My objections are on the articles of the Macedonian Kings who felt themselves to be Greek (relates to our older discussion on the criteria of an ethnic group). Alexander III's and Philip II's article nowhere mentions how that at least the Argead dynasty was of Greek origin. In my opinion this is not mentioned due to the general chaos which evolves the word "macedonia", and not because it was simply forgotten. I don't think this is NPOV. The Macedonian royalty has always participated in the Olympics, meaning that they viewed themselves and were viewed by others as Greek. If they were really the descendants of Indo-european Greek-speakers is something irrelevant, let alone impossible to prove. I'm telling you this because I'm plannig to make some edits that will be based on ancient quotations, and I don't want it to be viewed as POV-pushing. I'll cite sources accordingly. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I read what you wrote on <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/Talk%7EW%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_f1c8.html" title="Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło">Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło</a> about the attempt to rename the page into <b>Wladyslaw II/V of Poland, Jogaila of Lithuania</b>, and I agree totally with you. I think as rule there can't be more than <b>one</b> variant of a name in the title of an article. If more than one variant is possible, the title must chose only one and the others must be explained in the text itself and redirects must be used from alternative titles. If such alternative titles were admitted in the article's title itself, then we'd have to rename, for examples, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepanakert.html" title="Stepanakert">Stepanakert</a> into <b>Stepanakert/Xankəndi</b>, <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tighina.html" title="Tighina">Tighina</a> into <b>Tighina/Bender/Bendery</b> or <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> into <b>2003 invasion/liberation of Iraq</b>...</p>
<p>I am myself implicated in a very long and endless debate which is, I think, similar to this one. It's about the need to rename the article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_X_bf45.html" title="Pope Stephen X">Pope Stephen X</a> into <b>Pope Stephen IX</b>, and so on until <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_III_26f2.html" title="Pope Stephen III">Pope Stephen III</a> into <b>Pope Stephen II</b>. The historical reasons of this naming problem are detailed in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope-elect_Stephen_4cfd.html" title="Pope-elect Stephen">Pope-elect Stephen</a>. Those historical facts are not the matter of the debate. Everybody agrees on those facts. The problem is some users want to rename <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_X_bf45.html" title="Pope Stephen X">Pope Stephen X</a> into <b>Pope Stephen IX (or X)</b>, which is an absurdity because of the same reasons as above.</p>
<p>I've launched this debate on 19 February and it is endless because it seems to interest very few people and it's impossible to reach a majority. I'm now prospecting for other people who would share my opinion on the matter. If you think you have something to say about this, I would be very glad if you did on <a href="../../../p/o/p/Talk%7EPope_Stephen_X_f464.html" title="Talk:Pope Stephen X">Talk:Pope_Stephen_X</a>.

<p>Sorry it took me so long to respond. Im avoiding Wikipedia lately because it's really frustrating for me to see what's on the "macedonian" pages. For a Macedonian it is a higly offensive enviroment. I wasn't angry with you Aldux, I was just dissapointed because without neutral people balancing the Greek majority over Macedonians those pages will slide to nasty greek propaganda. As for Telex, considering his knowledge in wikipedia, style and behaviour - I doubt he's a newbie. I know it's not a nice thing to say, but at least I'm honest and I dont hide my thoughts behind nice words like so many hipocrites here do, but their actions make them transparent anyway. But on to the sticky points:</p>
<ol>
<li>I dont know what was your intention but a sentance like: <i>The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed</i> clearly suggests that a distinct identity was absent prior to 1945. I'm confused... Do you support that view?????</li>
<li>I know what you feel about Macedonian Greeks as an ethnic group, that's why I was even more surprised. In your answer to me you say that it's not implying that they are actualy an ethnic group, but the sentance clearly states them as an ethnic group. And you say that compromises are necesary, but how can you make a compromise with a clearly false statemant? And how many compromises should be made under pressure from all kinds of nationalists. To be honest the version that I red before writing this was acceptable to me but again makes me wonder how many Greek explanations, notes, footnotes and so on should theese pages have? Are these pages here for Greek nationalist to express every thought they have and to put pro-greek nationalist POVs in every corner of the articles???</li>
<li>You are wrong about this one. Macedonia wasn't part of "Serbia" in the kingdom of Yugoslavia. Serbia simply didn't exist as an separate entity in the kingdom - Yugoslavia consisted of "banovini". So it wasn't separated from Serbia, but was granted a republic status. And the belif that Tito did whatewer he wanted with Macedonia and the Macedonians is really hard to belive. Altough some of the points mentioned about his "pro-Macedonian" motives are valid, a crucial one is left out: the Macedonian comunist party and liberation army were much more loosely conected to the Yugoslav ones than others in Yugoslavia. There were significant pro-independance forces in Macedonia and this couldn't have been ignored by Tito and KPJ, so concessions to the Macedonians were necesary to keep Macedonia in the new federation peacefuly.</li>
<li>I realy dont understand why I should provide sources for such well known things, especially since it will be reverted anyway (with or without dismissing the sources). All this while some are slipping all kinds of stuff into articles and keeping them there by majorisation in rewert wars.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finaly, you advise me: <i>the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources</i>. I don't think that we should get into sourcing that kind of stuff. I think that those editors are clearly not-well intentioned and I won't accept playing their game by trying to proove such things as my grandfathers national feelings. And even if I do it, it wont make any impression on them. They'll stick to their theories. Altough I'm not a wikipedia member for a long time, I have learned that some people here will negate even pure mathematics.</p>

On a second tone, it's not the evil Graeco-Bulgarian requiring the sources, it's Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">policy</a>, so if you want to work without citing sources, I suggest you start a wiki of your own (call it Realekpedia). BTW, yes, even in Macedonian nationalism, there was some confusion over over the alleged ethnicity of the Macedonians at that time. According to Macedonian nationalists, the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miladinov_Brothers_90f0.html" title="Miladinov Brothers">Miladinov Brothers</a>, who wrote what they called <i>Bulgarian</i> folk songs, in what they described as the <i>Bulgarian</i> languages, really meant <i>Macedonian</i>, just there was some ethnic confusion at that time. As for your claim that we should believe your assertions about the self identification of your gradparents, I'll respond with your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Macedonian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50793912" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Macedonian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50793912" rel="nofollow">words</a>: <i>Why should anybody belive you???

<p>Thank you for the warm welcome, Aldux. I am not quite sure how to get in touch with you, but I hope this is the correct way. If you have visited my User Page(?), you will have seen my brief biography. I am a Zambian and am interested in the history of the whole of the southern African region.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I use the computers of Manchester City Council Libraries, in England. As a member of the libraries, I have access to a whole lot of online resources, such as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and the Encyclopedia Britannica Online Academic Edition. I have been using these to get the gist of the material, then I edit them to avoid plagiarism. Some of the stuff is what I already know from my education in Zambia and my personal reading around the subject of Zambian history. Even if I don't have the books at hand, I have read them and I know that the people who used them as references in Oxford Dictionary or Encyclopedia Britannica have the correct details.</p>
<p>I hope to make good contributions to the Wikipedia, although I am worried that there is so much to read!</p>
<p>Thanks, again.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/d/User_talk%7EAldux_Archive_3_d293.html" title="Edit section: Illyrians as Dorians Section">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Illyrians as Dorians Section</span></h2>
<p>Why did you remove the section "Illyrians as Dorians" in the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrians.html" title="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> article again? Did you actually read the section or did you just assume that it would be the same thing as last time? Did you check the footnotes? The least you could have done was inform me as to why you removed the section this time. I guess you failed in that department. Your job pretty much is to revert article content and ask questions later, right?</p>
<p>I don't know. Perhaps you perceive me as an amateur propagandist and nothing else. Nice assumption, but wrong person. Well, since you cannot give me decent reasons why you reverted the section this time, allow me to help list them for you:</p>
<p>1) Carleton S. Coon is evil and should not be placed in the section.</p>
<p>2) Etienne Balibar and Alexander Fol are not worthy scholars.</p>
<p>3) Roman sources from the 2nd century BC that discussed Queen Teuta's "half-Hellenic" country never existed.</p>
<p>4) Polybius is a fictional character from a science-fiction movie.</p>
<p>5) Greek mythology is not a metaphorical record of oral stories about actual people, but a mere collection of lies.</p>
<p>6) The concept of "barbarian" is simple only meaning "non-Greek" and never meaning "unsophisticated Greek".</p>
<p>7) Sociological analyses of the ancient Greek political climate have no relevance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Of course, the first answer I expect from you when you read this is as follows: "I removed the section because it is 'original research' and there is no one who supports that the Illyrians spoke Greek." Or something along those lines. Yet, you fail to take into consideration the <b>possibility</b> of a connection between Illyrian tribes and Doric tribes. I do not expect you or anyone else to accept the section's content as gospel (though I would be flattered if you did). Besides, if such a connection between Illyrians and Dorians did exist in the past, then why not explain it? I placed sources that validate whatever aspects of "original research" you might find in the section. I guess there is nothing that satisfies your demands.</p>
<p>Here is what you can do. Why don't you actually read the section and make constructive suggestions? No wait. Here is an even better idea. Why don't you actually help me conduct research to validate (or denounce) what was written in the article section? The only way your going to see an expanded Illyrians article is to actually help people who are trying to do such a thing. Being an editor does not only entail hacking, slashing, and decimating content. There are also procedures for refining content and constructively enhancing information that may actually prove to be valuable for readers. Of course, you probably know this already. Or not. I really don't care up to this point.</p>
<p>I am going to put the section back and I expect from you to "warn" me about my violating 3RR (without of course explaining why you removed the section for the second time).

<p>Hello. I've noticed you're working on a major rewrite of <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomaks.html" title="Pomaks">Pomaks</a>. It seems like the article corresponds to the article <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Bulgarians_a3cd.html" title="Muslim Bulgarians">Muslim Bulgarians</a> (<i>Pomaks</i> is just a local/informal/derogatory name) and I believe we should merge them, but would like to know what you think first. I'm interested in this quite vague and sometimes controversial topic and would like to help create a good, neutral and unbiased article. Also, we should settle on some transliteration — whether the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanization_of_Bulgarian_da1c.html" title="Romanization of Bulgarian">official one</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_transliteration.html" title="Scientific transliteration">scientific transliteration</a>.

<dd>That's all right, I only meant making them one article and didn't intend to imply <i>Muslim Bulgarians</i> is a better name — as you said, it isn't.

<dd>Ela re patriotes.

<dd>Hectorian, that's a nice "Latin" nick-name you've got yourself. It's crystal clear to me that, should you really be a Vlach, you belong to the sad faction of the Grecomani Vlachs. A sort of reversed <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janissary.html" title="Janissary">Janissary</a>, exposed from early childhood to Greek only culture, language, school, propaganda, so much in fact that he came to believe he's a Greek, am I correct? But it's your choice, your life. In fact it's too late you became something else by now, so well done, here's another assimilated Vlach, what's the big deal? We are in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, I hope time will come when the Greeks will allow you to have your first Vlach language newspaper or your first Vlach language FM radio station. Even the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baluba.html" title="Baluba">Baluba</a> tribes in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo.html" title="Congo">Congo</a> have probably got their own media by now. You're not asking too much inn'it? What? You don't want this? You don't want to offend the Greeks by asking for rights for Vlach language? Listen, the Greeks are well-known for their generosity and tolerance. So here is yet another reason for wanting to remain a Greek wanabee. Better on the side of the bosses than being the underdog, inn'it?

<dd>Tired, but i will respond to these 'comments': my nick name is not Latin (apart from the -ian, of course). my real name is more greek than u can imagine... apropos, your nick is vlach, isn't it?:p. i am an aromanian (in fact half-aromanian), proud to say it, and i belong to the vast majority of aromanians who have always considered themselves Greeks (cause this is simply what we are). a Janissary? Huh? no need to comment on that (it was deliberately said to bring tension in the discussion). i was indeed exposed to greek culture since i was born...u know, greeks are usually exposed to greek culture, italians to italian and so on... and my ancestors, as further back to the history of my family i can go, they were also exposed to greek culture. vlach language newspaper? hmmm in which alphabet, with which grammar and syntax? u seem to forget that aromanian evolved as an idiom from vulgar latin and never had a written form. not to mentioned that it has always been used along with greek from its speakers. perhaps u are dreaming of someone who will invent all things necessary to create a new ethnic identity? u know, more things are needed for a nation to be born... not to forget that their is no historian from those early times talking about a migration of the romanians to the south (speaking about greek propaganda? why don't u look at the romanian one?)of course, there will always be <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkiviadis_Diamanti_di_Samarina_09d7.html" title="Alkiviadis Diamanti di Samarina">Alkiviades s</a>, trying to create something that never existed for their own purposes (i know that u have been editting articles related to him... always remember that he was a facist <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawn_%28chess%29.html" title="Pawn (chess)">pawn</a>, with no supporters (perhaps the name he should have would be <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephialtes.html" title="Ephialtes">Ephialtes</a>). and for me, all those (a couple of people, i mean) who desperately try to split the aromanians from the rest of the Greeks, are just wannabe princes or dictators. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 00:54, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everything has started with Greeks like Miskin etc. and Italians (if he really is one) who became Greek bootliskers the likes of Aldux deleting and vandalizing my editing. Don't get me wrong. I was just insinuating in a very elegant and gentle manner that according to some scholars <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Cyril_166e.html" title="Saint Cyril">Saint Cyril</a> might have had Slavic roots but that was enough to cause an immense outrage among the Greeks folowed by a violent and co-ordinated strike. They in effect are undermining from inside the wiki project trying to divert it off its neutral non-partizane path and convert it or re-direct it if you wish into a Greek <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentric.html" title="Ethnocentric">ethnocentric</a> national project. Ceea ce-mi displace e faptul ca se ascund, se deghizeaza. Ia-l de exemplu pe acest Aldux. El pretinde ca e italian pe cand, in realitate e grec. Ei vor sa creeze confuzie sa dea impresia ca punctul lor de vedere e sustinut si de non-greci. In acest context, oare nu e logic ca si noi sa ne organizam efectiv si sa ne ajutam reciproc? <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostolos_Margaritis_aa4f.html" title="User:Apostolos Margaritis">Apostolos Margaritis</a> 11:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think Italians really look towards their Eastern European neighbour Greece today with too much <a href="../../../a/w/e/Awe.html" title="Awe">awe</a> in particular or looking for any kind of inspiration. It's the Greeks who buy italiki kouzines, design, cars, food, gellata, clothes, fashion, you name them and NOT the other way round. In fact I've never seen any Greek product being sold or offered for purchase or advertized in Italy. Since you claim you're from Florence Aldux, I remember being in a cafe in Firenze and a group of noisy Greek tourists entering in haste and sitting near our table. The Italian waiter (dressed in starched white shirt and <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">bow tie</a> and extremely courteously and the Greeks putting the order quite rudely and then (almoust tapping the waiter) on his shoulder (a la greque) told him not to worry because Italians and Greeks are allegedly 'una faccia una razza'. The waiter pulled up a wry face and cleared his throat not bothering to hide his disgust towards his customers. Poor Greeks believed that the Italian would feel flatered but he was clearly looking down at his Eastern (and rather bumpkin) so-called relations. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostolos_Margaritis_aa4f.html" title="User:Apostolos Margaritis">Apostolos Margaritis</a> 16:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Response to unsighned contribution, above. Italian olive oil can be up to 50 per cent Greek, but due to import export regulations it is not declared as such.

<dd>Haha, that's a true story! My uncle produces olive oil in Peloponnese and sells most of it to Italian companies who pay him much better than the Greek ones.

<dd>Unfortanately for Greece, this is far from true; Peloponnesian oil is really quite bad, and I know because I've tasted it quite often. And I know what I'm speaking about; I'm an olivicultore myself, and I'm afraid that their simply isn't competition for Greece. But it's true that Greek oil (and Tunisian, Spaniard, Portoguese) are mixed with sothern Italian oil, which anyway, telling the truth, is also quite mediocre.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 21:53, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's like saying that French wine is bad. Where's the good oil then in your opinion? Don't tell me that you find Tuscan oil better than Greek and Sicilian. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, I never even thought the question was disputed; in Italy at least, this is given for granted, and Tuscan oil is sold at a much higher price than Sicilian oil. An important element is the oil acidity, which is 0.4% as a rule in Tuscany, but can go down to 0.1% in the best places. Also, there's the difference between collecting them from the trees or waiting them to fall; the last solution generally gives a worst oil. On the good side, southern Italian oil have a much higher productivity for tree, if lesser quality.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 10:51, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know quite afew Tuscans who would swear that Tuscan oil is the best in the world, but I've met few people who would share this thought. Although not an expert myself, I've worked in a high-class Italian restaurant owned by Sicilians and run by Neopolitans and they imported Greek oil because they claimed it was of better quality. Only 5% of the exported Greek oil is sold under Greek brands, and chances are that you it's not top quality. What I'm saying is that I don't think you've tasted the real thing. You probably know that there's a quality standard for every product, and in the case of the olive oil, quality essentially depends on the olive. Similarly the quality of wine depends on the quality of the grape. If there are better quality of grapes growing in France and better quality of olives growing in Sicily, there's not much you can do in order to compete their potential success in wine or olive oil production. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dorks exist everywhere. I would give you dozens of counter-examples from Italian (or British, or French, or German...) tourists, but I think that it is wrong to generalise this behavior to the whole of the Italian population. Same with the Greeks, but you fail ofcourse to understand that. As for the Greek <i>products</i>, well, you have selective retention or categorization there too: Try <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frappe.html" title="Frappe">frappe</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/t/Feta.html" title="Feta">feta</a>, tourism, hotels, fabrics (I know quite a few internationally famous Greek brands -since I happen to be in the business) and shipping just out of the top of my head. Ofcourse, Greeks don't have that extra fashionable background of the "Made in Italy" tag, but then again, so do the Germans or the Brits. Nobody accuses them of being inferior in <i>inspiration</i> because of that though, the same way as nobody accuses the Italians of being unworthy ship-owners.

<dd>Also, I find it most suspicious that R. Macedonia is willing to accept Bosniak, Aromanian, Turkish minorities, is being highly criticised over its treatment of its Albanians and Serbs (Albania and Serbia border them), and Bulgarians and Greeks officially don't exist, but they are willing to speculate on hundreds of thousands of Macedonians in Bulgaria and Greece. I hope no one denies that there are self-identifying Bulgarians over there... recognition of minorities is obviously selective (just like in Greece). --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 22:46, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Aldux!(for your nice words in Nikola's talk-page):). Italian infuence is still seen in the Dodecanese (they were italian 49 years ago), but mostly in the Ionian islands (u know... had been venetian for a long time, many italian tourists go there every summer, italy is very close, they never were under turkish oppression...). about what u asked, Telex gave u indeed a good answer: the Uniates are not 'respected' in Greece (perhaps we prefer to see things clear, and not dressed up:p). most of the catholics in greece live in Paros, Tinos-half of the population- (the last island to fall under turkish rule in 1714, if i am not wrong), in Patra (i don't know why...) and of course in the Ionian islands (for the reasons i said). In the Ionian islands the dialect spoken has many Italian loanwords and sounds <b>really</b> like italian in accent (that's why i called it graeco-italian pidgin). and yes, i know the special sacred position Zakynthus has in italian poetry and literature... Foscolo was from there, afterall! also (perhaps u didn't know that) the greek national poet, Solomos, was half of Italian(venetian) origins.

<dd>Ciao! My dad is from <a href="../../../p/a/x/Paxos.html" title="Paxos">Paxos</a>. My grandma used to have an Italian accent. I wish I could reproduce it in writing quoting her say: "Ma ton Ái Spyrídhona" or "O-po-po symforá sou, syntelía sou mávri..." When I was young, she used to cook her specialty "pastitsádha" (spaghetti with meat and tomato sauce [slurp!]), and she used to unlock the little "portéli" in her garden to let us in. Even her name sounded Italian, or at least it had an Italian ending: "Mavretta". If you ever go to Paxos, do visit the traditional cafe of Kyr'Theófrastos in Lakka main square, and drink "tsitsibirra", a local special spicy ginger-ale that can't be exported coz the bottles blow up in the transport! There are thousands of Italian tourists in feragosto. So many, that when you bump on someone in the street, you choose subconciously to say "scusi", rather than "syghnómi". Hell, I even see <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlusconi.html" title="Berlusconi">Berlusconi</a> regularly... <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver"><span style="color:white;background:#778">&#160;<span style="background:#889">N<span style="background:#99a">i<span style="background:#aab">k<span style="background:#bbc">o<span style="background:#ccd"><b>S</b></span><b>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><font size="-2"><a href="../../../n/i/k/User_talk%7ENikoSilver_3667.html" title="User talk:NikoSilver">(T)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NikoSilver_2661.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NikoSilver">@</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NikoSilver_1a4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/NikoSilver">(C)</a></font></sup> 21:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know how you call them. We call them simply "Makarónia me kokkinistó" (Spaghetti with red-ed [meat]). In Paxos, however, they are named after <a href="../../../../it/p/a/s/pasticcio_c124.html" class="extiw" title="it:pasticcio">it:pasticcio</a>. The "porta" feminine diminutive would be "portítsa" or "portoúla", not neuter "portéli" and my grandma would be called "Mavra" not "Mavretta"... I wish I could remember more of her strange words, coz I really did love her a lot. At one point I was given a lexicon of Paxos words. I remember only one (not Italian) that I liked: "anapapsólia". It refers to some strange rings hanging from the ceiling above the wedding bed, to help the groom immobilise his virgin wife. The etymology is from "anápafsi" (rest) and "psolí" (ah-hem, quello che questi dello Sud hanno piu grande). BTW nice work on the <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomaks.html" title="Pomaks">Pomaks</a>.

U are doing a really good job in the <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomaks.html" title="Pomaks">Pomaks</a>, and all your edits seem to be well sourced and wellwritten. personally, i do not mind seen notes in articles (no matter how many they can be); on the contrary, they give me the chance to look about something i haven't understoond or for something i may want further details. something looked strange to me in the infobox, though: Related ethnic groups:other Bulgarians, Torbesh, Gorani. hmmm, the Gorani are related to Pomaks <i>ethnically</i>, but the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">Republicans</a> are not? i can understand if this is an attempt not to make the article a 'revert-target'... lastly, the population figure about Greece is old... maybe more up to date estimations are available (i may check it out). --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 23:26, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input. Regarding "related ethnic groups", actually I wasn't even thinking of the Macs.; after all, I'm not <i>that</i> afraid of our Macedonian friends...;-) I simply made the choice on the ground that the key elements of the Pomaks are language (Bulgarian) and religion; so for this I inserted the Torbesh and Gorani, who are both Slavophones and Muslims; the key aspects of Pomak identity; after all, if they were simply Christian they would simply be common Bulgarians; while if they weren't Slavophones they would simply be Turks. Probably I should add Bosnians to the list to make this point clearer. As for the number of Pomaks in Greece, I'll probably put a range of number in its place; there isn't a linguistic census that can be used with certainity, and I don't think it's up to me to chose the right number, so I'll simply give the highest and lowest number proposed by scholars, and discuss the question better in the section on the Pomaks in Greece, that'll be the next section I'll do.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 11:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi&#160;:-) The problem is I'm a bit occupied with the Balkans now, even if I intend to restart intensely on Chad among some weeks.

<dd>Sure there is, but I find the etymology quite descriptive of the particular guy's character. It's just one little summarising phrase, which deserves being there.

Too much wikiwork, I need a rest. As for not awnsering on the talk, I agreed with Ultramarine's points, so didn't see any need to add my point, as it was the same of his.

<p>I think you should write the things referring to the commune itself in the titular entry (infobox - which, remember, has the title <b>Comune di ...</b>, geography, area, population, footer, etc.). If a city within the commune has more importance, you can write a separate article for it (i.e., with the relative <b>History</b> and <b>Main sights</b>) and insert links between the twos (i.e. <b>See also</b>).
