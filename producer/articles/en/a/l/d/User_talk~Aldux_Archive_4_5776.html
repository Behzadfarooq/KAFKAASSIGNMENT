<p>Hi. I have proposed to move the following monarchs from their current, generally Polish-spelled names (with diacriticals) to the systematical English name, citing my general ground that English should be used, not Polish.

<p>Hi Aldux, a question about Italian names. For an article about a 15th-century Venetian military leader, <i>provveditore</i> of the Morea <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacomo_Barbarigo_578c.html" title="Jacomo Barbarigo">Jacomo Barbarigo</a>, which spelling of the first name would you prefer as the primary one: Jacomo, Giacomo, Jacopo?

<dd>Nice work. I don't see great problems: I've found tons of material on the Greek Pomaks, so it'll be considerable bigger.

<p>Aldux, would you be interested in helping with <a href="../../../s/c/l/Sclaveni.html" title="Sclaveni">Sclaveni</a>? It's an article created by Deucalionite about the Slavs in early Byzantium. Interesting topic, but I think it needs some work. I haven't got too much literature about the social and population history of that time here right now (only Mango's <i>Oxford History of Byzantium</i>, which is good, but doesn't provide the sort of detail we'd need.) <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">â¼</a> 20:33, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Aldux. Nice to meet you. Thanks for reverting "BC" back to "BCE" in the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posidonius.html" title="Posidonius">Posidonius</a> article. Wikipedia is a world-wide project so when I made my contributions to the article I wanted to use "BCE" as it's a more universal designation. Probably the anonymous edit was well-intentioned, quite possible that the anon had never heard of "BCE". --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregonsee_a823.html" title="User:Tregonsee">Tregonsee</a> 21:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux, I've given some thought to our last exchange on my talk and wonder if you would accept a nomination for adminship. I glanced over your recent edits and think you would find the privileges useful. A word of caution: I've never seen a nominator who had voluntary desysopped previously. There's an outside chance this may affect some voters, so you may want to seek another nominator. If you're still interested, please glance over <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_requests_for_adminship_d0e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship">the guide</a> and get back to me. There's no rush, so feel free to give it some thought. If you say yes, I'll dig into your edits some more and come up with a nomination in a couple days. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">BT</a> 00:51, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Aldux, I finally managed to start <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aldux_23e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aldux">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aldux</a>. I'm very sorry for the delay; I had forgotten how busy my schedule was for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29_0192.html" title="Independence Day (United States)">Independence Day weekend</a>. I have informed Ezeu that he should go ahead with his co-nom. Please read over my nom statement and let me know if you feel I have misrepresented anything. While I initially wanted to concentrate on the articles we had edited in common, a review of your talk pages convinced me that I needed to address the controversies bleeding over from the Balkan pages directly. Some points that may come up in your nomination that you may want to address in your answers to the standard questions are below, though you may of course ignore them as you wish:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>You have relatively low usage of edit summaries. I would suggest forcing edit summary prompts through your editing preferences tab and making a note of it in the RFA</li>
<li>Use of vulgarity in edit summaries, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61831572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61831572" rel="nofollow">this</a>, even if it is mild vulgarity to exasperating editing, is frowned upon and may earn some opposes. I would recommend addressing this and any other such edit summaries in your answers to questions.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Once Ezeu had added his co-nom, please update the end time and transclude the page into <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> per <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_nominate_0df3.html#What_to_do_if_you_are_nominated_by_someone_else:" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate">this guidance</a>. Remember that the only time limit starts after you accept, so take as much time as you want to answer the questions. Good luck! - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">BT</a> 04:34, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, when I looked at the two articles, I knew that the cross-wiki was a bit off, but it was off for "Hellenisitc civilization" as well. I'm thinking that a completely new page is in order. A google search shows "Hellenistic period" as more often used (433k vs. 190k), but you being an expert on the time period would be better informed as to what the appropriate title will be. Do you think I should create the new article and keep adding translated sections, or should I simply continue work at the talk page and upload the new article when complete, by the way? Also, a minor note, but in English you would say you're "enthusiastic" (or "enthused" if you want to say you've "become enthusiastic," but no one really uses this word and its a bit pedantic) rather than "enthusiast." A better term altogether to use would be "overjoyed" or "excited," though.

<dd>Grazie amico. I supported Greece in the 2004 final (even if I must admit I didn't expect them to win... ah yes the Greeks really took Europe by surprise then&#160;;-)). As for Zizu, I also was a bit sad (just a bit....) for his ending that way such a career, but I must admit I was a bit egoistic; first the victory, than Zizou!

<p>I'm not at all sure, but then what's new, where Chad's concerned!<br />
My edit was based on this [<a href="http://www.izf.net/izf/ee/pro/index_frameset.asp?url=http://www.izf.net/IZF/EE/pro/tchad/2034.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.izf.net/izf/ee/pro/index_frameset.asp?url=http://www.izf.net/IZF/EE/pro/tchad/2034.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>], which quotes a presidential decree of 15 February 2006, nominating ministers, and showing the GNNT under the responsibility of the Minister for Territorial Administration. (Incidentally it also shows the Ministry of Defence as being attached to the Presidency.)<br />
On the other hand, I also found this <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mgnYqpH4-I4J:www.primature-tchad.com/%3F2006/05/10/170-nomminations-au-sein-de-l-armee-nationale-tchadienne+Tchad+ministere+garde+nationale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mgnYqpH4-I4J:www.primature-tchad.com/%3F2006/05/10/170-nomminations-au-sein-de-l-armee-nationale-tchadienne+Tchad+ministere+garde+nationale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, dated 10 May 2006, which says the President, through the Ministry of Defence, nominated two military officers to senior posts in the GNNT. (But this may mean that these are two Army officers being posted to jobs in the GNNT, not that the GNNT is under the Ministry of Defence.)<br />
However, going back to 2004, there are draft minutes of proceedings in the National Assembly <a href="http://www.tchad-gpmps.org/compterendu02du22oct04.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tchad-gpmps.org/compterendu02du22oct04.doc" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> that say the Minister of Defence is responsible the Army, Air Force, GNNT and Gendarmerie.<br />
But finally, legislation dating from 1994, that appears still to be in force <a href="http://droit.francophonie.org/doc/html/td/loi/fr/1994/1994dftdlgfr8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://droit.francophonie.org/doc/html/td/loi/fr/1994/1994dftdlgfr8.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, does show the GNNT as part of the Ministry of the Interior.<br />
So, you can take your pick. My guess is that responsibility is shared and has moved back and forth. Lots of the GNNT are presumably still tied up guarding people, buildings and prisoners in every prefecture and sous-prefecture across the country and therefore take their orders from the local civil administrator, which makes it sensible for them to be part of the territorial administration ministry. On the other hand, when there is rebel activity, some of them presumably get mobilised to fight alongside the Army, so there would be more sense for them to be under the defence ministry. Don't know if this helps!<br />

<p>Congratulations on your recent granting of admin powers. I would like to draw your attention to a worthy use of those powers - the closing of copyvio reports listed on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>. As you'll see there are many tens of such reports that need dealing with each day, and the backlog is barely being kept under control despite a couple of us spending lots of time working on them. The process is pretty easy and sorting a few only takes a little time and with a group of people helping, we can keep the backlog under control easily - just review the article &amp; the source to ensure it is a copy, and then delete. Any help would certainly be appreciated - any questions, ask away. <a href="../../../k/c/o/User%7EKcordina_3fec.html" title="User:Kcordina">Kcordina</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/c/o/User_talk%7EKcordina_5ecd.html" title="User talk:Kcordina">Talk</a></sup> 09:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was nothing, I only saw that the dispute went on and on without a consensus being found, and much worse, Pierre risked making the talk so inflamatory to make the talks of Balkans-related articles masterpieces of good manners.

<dd>Regarding what's happening to your talk page maybe you should consider doing what an editor said wrote on his user talk: "Hello. Thanks for visiting my talk page.

<p>To make it clear, you are free to delete anything Pierre wrote on your talk page, as this is <b>your</b> talk page. If he insists, I'll you, so don't worry for that. But be careful to keep calm, and especially read what he wrote at <a href="../../../j/k/e/User_talk%7EJkelly_f93a.html" title="User talk:Jkelly">User talk:Jkelly</a>, as he's pushing there against you, trying to get you blocked. It's a pity I have so little knowledge of the argument, cause I can't help you much; I only hope Jkelly will be able to do something. I must admit also I'm partly trying to avoid direct confrontation, as he terribly remembers me the Balcanic ultranationalists I've met so many time in wikipedia, and God knows I already have had too many disputes with that sort of guys. But please remember, keep calm; at the end Pierre's rudeness and personal attacks will only damage him, not you.

<p>Bad English?? Come on, this is a cheapshot&#160;:) ... Not the case i am afraid.</p>
<p>'"there are minority communities in Greek Macedonia with their own dialect and history but where the overwhelming majority consists of Greeks (who are also known as Macedonians in the region), as well as in Albania and Bulgaria"</p>
<p>Talking of bad english... This phrase does seem to make sense. Am i not entitle to change it? Seems not.</p>
<p>(In any case between you and me there is no seperate history and if you beleive so please make some reffereces to you sources).</p>
<p>The lack of refferences is quite evident in the whole of the text. I do not see why i should provide bibliography for altering (in good faith) passages that state important but in a way unaccurate facts and do not have any reffences to back them up. In any case, i will do so if anyone asks me for it but i wont lose my time when it seems that certain people are quite satisfied with their wotk and do not accept comments and corrections.(but if this is the case they should not write here, really)</p>
<p>As for the ancient period paragraph. It is quite misleading since it does not refer to ancient times at all. Propably should exclude all the passage from text. It is indeed a controversial article and a very amusing one to follow up, from its creation to the seemingly result. Is like drafting a treaty between hostal tribes. The fact that large parts of the outcome derive from original contributions with very clear, highly nationalistic positions for the one (mostly) and the other side is absolutely charming.</p>
<p>Considering all that, i think that i propably could lower my expectations but of course not abandon them. This article has flaws and can be improved. The fact that is controversial should not be considered a problem. There is no thing like status quo ante in wiki as far as i know. In any case my alterations reffer to comonly accepted facts undisputed by all sides. I will sincerely continue keeping you company in your efforts. Thanks in advance Haas</p>
