<p>Hey man, I'm keeping an eye on that page, certainly there is some stuff that is clearly nonsense, but I'm at least impressed that it has "Citation needed!" next to it. It says it is a work in progress (isn't everything!) so I'll leave it for a couple of days then take another look. The principle problem is that he seems to be swaying over to representing the "Bulgarian view" as fact in some cases. Of course this can be fixed.

<p>If Cretanpride is still using sockpuppets, I'd say a block of a week or even longer would be entirely appropriate. And if he tries to evade that block with more sockpuppets, I think it would be appropriate to lengthen the block (and, obviously, block any sockpuppet accounts or IPs indefinitely).</p>

<dd>Do not attempt to intimidate me. I am fully aware of wikipedia's policies and so should you: the 3RR rule does not apply to simple vandalism, i.e. sneaky vandalism. Something you are now guilty of and have participated in on account of your friend PHG. I suggest that you desist on account of you being guilty of such violations; otherwise, perhaps you should "prepare to pay the consequences (that is getting blocked)". If there is a discussion to be had, then let us discuss. I am more than willing to continue the discussion. Apparently, you are not.</dd>
<dd>As for PHG's additions, they are not to be considered on the main page of an history article for the same reasons that a eugenics theorist should not be included in a modern discussion of sociology: Accepted at one time and no longer accepted. If you accept eugenics as a legitimate theory worthy of being placed on a wikipedia sociology page, well then, we understand your motivations now.</dd>
<dd>Also, I suggest that if you want to continue to be a responsible wikipedia user and contributor, that you check your tone. Your attempts to antagonize me and other users (something you have a track record of) are uncivil, irresponsible, and are not in line with the values of wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevanampriya_2a4e.html" title="User:Devanampriya">User:Devanampriya</a></dd>

<p>Hello Aldux. I don't think for one moment that your conduct towards other users has been of ill-will. I don't support the excising of the information, but can we get more info from Buddhist oriented sources or Jain sources to make it bigger. Because it does seem as though there is not much detail about Ashoka and Buddhism and Ashoka the conqueror, and the same in the Maurya Empire - at the moment there is lots of information about the Greek connection, which inherently there is nothing wrong, but it may give the impression that Ashoka was a Greek reprentative or something - it just feels a bit too oriented on his bloodline and not what he nor the Mauryans achieved. In any case it was interesting that I got <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda.html" title="Mahinda">Mahinda</a> (his son, who brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka) and <a href="../../../m/o/g/Moggaliputta-Tissa_2eea.html" title="Moggaliputta-Tissa">Moggaliputta-Tissa</a> (his spiritual adviser) to DYK in the week leading up to the locking - could we put more stuff about Buddhism into the articles to balance it out as well as his stuff about the Kalinga conquest etc. The Greek stuff is still interesting of course and I don't see a reason to cull it unless there is POV or weaselly stuff compromising it. Anything this old, of course cannot be certain, so as long as we give both a fair hearing then it should work out OK. This could be an interesting case as I am interested in learning more about Asoka. Perhaps I can find more about his Indian activity (religion and miltary) to balance it out. Tell me what you think.

<dd>Hi Aldux. Personally I think it should be removed, I can't see how it is useful in any way as at that stage China and India had no contact with each other and it could have comparisions with any other random empire. Apart from that it seems like original analysis and seems vague and wobbly. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 04:32, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually Aldux blanked out sections from both of those articles including the section on a Mount Rushmore type of mountain of Alexander, something which you Hectorian had edited on. As for this accusation against me, I trust that when the checkuser returns negative, I will deserve an apology, much like Apro Thank you all! <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeraklis_099c.html" title="User:Heraklis">Heraklis</a> 00:40, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did some research, and i saw that the construction has not even started yet. so, the section about this mountain should not be there, for the additional reason that it serves as an advertisement for the company that says that will create it... Wikipedia is not a place for that company to raise money... So, Aldux did well in removing it. About checkuser and stuff, sorry but i have not followed what has happened... --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 00:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um... Aldux. Out of all EU member states (this includes <i>La Repubblica Italiana</i>), only the government of Poland fully recognizes the name "Republic of Macedonia". --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 18:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops, my sock has promptly corrected me&#160;;-) Since Italy in the <a href="../../../c/e/i/CEI_8000.html" title="CEI">CEI</a> uses "Macedonia" instead of Former Republic ecc., I thought this was the norm, since I'd never heard an Italian politician use FYROM, nor is it ever used by Italian, French and British media (can't read German). Anyway, awnsering AIUI, FYROM, or more exactly the long form, is only used in EU-RoM relations; but in bilateral relations everybody is free to use the name they prefer; as the name used in the ONU isn't binding for the single members, so is the case of the EU. Also (but not very important), I doubt there was a vote of the Europarliament on the issue; this was probably decided by the commission, with an accord between Greece and RoM.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 20:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Aldux, but the EU exclussively uses the name 'FYROM' in every paper, and no EU member state (apart from Poland, which entered just 2 years ago) has formaly recognised that country as 'Macedonia'. also, have in mind that the media (Greek, Italian, French, English, German-i cannot read all those languages, but i can understand some words) usually call the USA simply as 'America', the US president simply as the 'American President', US Senate simply as the 'American Senate', a US aircraft-carrier simply as 'an american aircraft-carrier', not to mention that the people of the USA self-identify simply as 'Americans'...! However, i doubt if anyone would like to mess here in Wikipedia with all the Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican et cetera editors, by changing every reference to 'USA' into the term 'America'. In the case of FYROM, however, there has been a monopolisation of the name!... even in the cases were this state is not recognised by this term (international organizations, bileteral relations with countries who still recognise it as FYROM, etc)... <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 20:34, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. I agree that there's more unpleasantness around in general these days. I'm afraid that my own response to the current level of vitriol is to tune out of "Wikipolitics" and try to focus on the articles I care about. Unfortunately, this means that I pay less attention than I should to important pages like AN/I, just because I don't want to get sucked in to these debates.

<dd>Hey -- I've looked into this, and I actually find the evidence very unconvincing, so I unblocked GreekEconomist (see my remark on the user talk page for a thorough explanation). The Greek community (I'm not greek, but I know many of them) is very tight-knit, and I wouldn't be surprised if they settle in specific locations in large concentrations. In other words, I think all of this is explained by one coincidence: that there is another greek user in the same local area; the rest makes a lot of sense. Alexander the Great has got to be a very common choice for a handle. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:31, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the message Aldux. I hadn't, in fact, been aware of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Greek%29_44c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Greek)">Naming conventions (Greek)</a> conventions, even though I've been editing occasionally on and off for a fair while. I can't say I'm happy about them, but these things have a tendency towards immobility so there's not much point complaining; I'll follow the conventions where not using a phonetic transliteration, and alter the proposed titles.</p>
<p>Having said that, what do you feel about the renaming in other respects? I personally feel it's a bit silly to have, for example, a <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicanor_of_Macedon_4f87.html" title="Nicanor of Macedon">Nicanor of Macedon</a> alongside a separate <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicanor_of_Macedonia_00fe.html" title="Nicanor of Macedonia">Nicanor of Macedonia</a>, especially when there are multiple other Macedonian Nicanors as well.</p>
<p>Thanks also for pointing out <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicanor_%28Syrian_general%29_a981.html" title="Nicanor (Syrian general)">Nicanor (Syrian general)</a>, I missed that since he wasn't on the disambig page. He corresponds to what I had marked as "Nicanor (son of Patroclus)" (= Smith i.12); I think I prefer my title because, just judging from Smith, it doesn't look like there are strong grounds for saying he was Syrian (he was sent to Judaea by Lysias of Syria, but that's not quite the same thing). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrouchka_a86b.html" title="User:Petrouchka">Petrouchka</a> 12:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks again, for the extremely useful and informative feedback. I'll adopt all your suggestions (while reserving the possibility of further changes if they seem wise!); I agree that putting the stubs in the disambiguation page is the correct solution (also for ii.1). I'll correct the remaining slips in transliteration in due course.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I'm especially grateful for your pointing out that Smith's i.12 and 1.13 are better treated as the same individual; that's something I probably wouldn't have picked up on until going into his article in detail.

<dd>Another note (unrelated to Nicanor this time; he's mostly taken care of, apart from stuff like templates and other conventions that I am continuing to discover haphazardly).

For my part I'd like to apologise completely for losing my cool -- I must have been under stress at the time or something. My best side doesn't come out on Wikipedia as much as I'd like, as I often edit when I'm insomniac. Anyway, I have enormous respect for the quite breath-taking breadth and depth of work you do here and want to apologise for making your life just that little bit harder that day.

<dd>Hi Aldux, thanks for your generous comments. I'm perplexed over the mediation case you pointed me to! and surprised that the issue is between Latin and Erasmian phonology, rather than Latin and modern, which would make more sense to me. I think ... no, I think I'd rather not go there. I mostly inhabit the Classical and pre-Classical world, anyway, so ... hmm, yep. I'm a bit of a shyster when it comes to heavily disputed articles and issues, I'm afraid. Anyway, now that you've alerted me to the naming conventions policy I'll go along with that. Maybe Latin is the way to resolve all the world's issues after all, I dunno.

<p>Koumra, hm... well let's figure out my process here. Mandoul has three departments, Occidental, Oriental, and Barh Sara. Barh Sara and Oriental are clear on the map, and Occidental must be west of Oriental. Moyen-Chari has three as well, Barh Koh, Grande Sido, and Lac Iro. Barh Koh and Lac Iro are clear on the map, and we know Guera and Haraze Mangueigne aren't part of it, so that establishes the eastern and northern border.</p>
<p>So the goal is to find the third department (Grande Sido) which must lie to the west (or south), and also find Mandoul Occidental, which must lie to the westish of Mandoul Oriental, and this seemed to be the only configuration that made sense - IF I'm reading the map correctly. It's possible one of those lines I drew followed a river, rather than a department boundary. Mandoul and Moyen-Chari correspond exactly to the old prefecture of Moyen-Chari, so we just have to figure out where the new border between the two is. I agree, it seems to be saying Koumra is in Moyen-Chari, which it's not, so ... any thoughts? Perhaps a new set of eyes will tell me if I missed a department boundary. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 11:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Aldux,<br />
I understand what you meant by deleting my stuff in the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vergina_Star_a94b.html" title="Vergina Star">Vergina Star</a> article, but let me remind you of the following:</p>
<p>1. I didn't do anything unilaterally, before adding the stuff I presented <b>everything</b> on the talk page (you can check it) and normally I expected to see the reactions of the other people first before adding anything. There were long discussions with user Politis, at last I think we've agreed that The Ohrid story deserves to be mentioned with a couple of sentences and 2-3 thumbnails without any nationalistic B.S. Just facts.</p>
<p>2. The Ohrid findings ARE related to the Vergina star. No matter if one's a "macedonian nationalist" or "greek nationalist" or <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvalu.html" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a> nationalist, they all agree on one thing: <a href="../../../o/h/r/Ohrid.html" title="Ohrid">Ohrid</a> (a.k.a. Lihnidos in the antiquity) was INDEED a part of the Ancient Macedonian Empire regardless if the ancient macedonians were greeks or something else. Ohrid was Ancient Macedonian city, you will see on the talk page that even Politis who is pro-greek biased agrees with that. Finding such stuff there is not at all unussuall, there is plenty of such stuff, unfortunatelly we are a small and financially weak country so of course we cannot "sell" those things to the world so succesfully as the tourist force Greece can.</p>
<p>3. <b>A 12-rayed star found in Olympias</b> is also mentioned in the article in the very beginning of the text without any explanations. Why don't you delete it? JUSTICE FOR ALL. Its not EXACTLY the same as the well known star of Vergina (its 12 rayed).Also some <b>Bronze Age "star" with 8 rays</b> is mentioned in the article without any further explanations or pics or anything (?!) saying that it was found in the small town of Kratovo for which greek nationalists say it was not in the ancient macedonian kingdom, its "too north" for them. Now what? But again this "bronze age star" is left untouched in the article and it has been "sitting" there for who knows how long and curious surfers are reading about it</p>
<p>4. Maybe my arguments are poorly sourced, but still there is an institution behind it (after all no one mentioned that I must provide lets say an american or norwegian point of view about these findings, although that would be useful indeed). I have provided info about the institute and even contact. Ohrid is a "city of <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>" so it is known for archaelogy and all that, it was a part of the Ancient Macedonian knigdom so summa-summarum I dont see what is so shocking and for some even <b>irritating</b> that those "stars" have been found here in this country too? Its quite funny cause you see, greek nationalists say "Ohrid is ours! It was ancient macedonian, but u slavs took it!" then they say "Bitola (Monastiri) is ours! It was Heraklea Linkestis!", but when you show them the "stars" found in present day <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> they are suddenly "errrm..errm..well doesnt look much like the vergina star u know, the rays are hmm not long enough u know".. Well, excuse me, you said those cities were part of the kingdom so thats it. If the stars can be found in Vergina or Pella, they can be found in Ohrid too. Who knows what is hidden beneath this land, if we were a better organized country who knows how many "suns" we would find.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still think that the Ohrid story deserves attention. --<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 16:49, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>hah, I know what is <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia.html" title="Olympia">Olympia</a> in Peloponissos and who is <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympias.html" title="Olympias">Olympias</a> (its of course...<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_%28film%29.html" title="Alexander (film)">Angelina Jolie</a>). I was typoing so fast and I confused those two "suns" (the 12-rayed and the Bronze age Kratovo one) thats why I said "how they are related" or "it has been found so far away". After I saw the mess, I edited the message afterwards maybe you noticed (message history). Anyway, forget it, I applogize. I'll try to do as u suggest.</p>
<p>Btw you suggest me to I talk to people who are much better in these things, thats good, but then again I just wonder why no one of them except Politis reacted when I presented all my intentions beforehand on the vergina star talkpage? They could give me explanations what to do and what not to do beforehand. well nevermind now.--<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 18:08, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please ragazzo don't let Dahn again change sourced content or "rephrase" information without consensus. 20% of his edits are POV-injections in direct citations. He doesn't let a single edit go "unrephrased" and he doesn't accept anyone to touch his own edits - in fact he will edit-war until he's about to break 3RR and only then he'll consider discussing. If you noticed he reverted my edits as unsourced just because I hadn't added ref tags, ignoring the fact that he had none either. Now I've added tags on every single phrase so that he won't have an excuse on "rephrasing" their meaning. Notice his arguments in discussion, they're pure original research and personal views. Just help protect this article from rv-warring, he's the most stubborn editor I've ever had to face.

<p>Thanks for blocking the troll; I was about to do the same. Did you block the IP range as well?
