<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/d/User_talk%7EAldux_Archive_7_4bc3.html" title="Edit section: Need your opinion, Problem - article: Kiro Gligorov">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Need your opinion, Problem - article: Kiro Gligorov</span></h2>
<p>There were plenty of disputes between me and user Funkyfly on the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiro_Gligorov_1edf.html" title="Kiro Gligorov">Kiro Gligorov</a> article (plz check version history and the discussion) but no one ever came to help us to solve them. The dispute turned into reverting of the article over and over which of course is going nowhere. Knowing that you are sort of <b>veteran here</b>, i hope you can check this problem out, please. If you could intervene on the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vergina_Star_a94b.html" title="Vergina Star">Vergina Star</a> article, Im sure you can intervene here as well (in the name of objectivity right?).</p>
<p>Funkyfly's side:<br />
He/She (sorry I dont know) claims that Kiro Gligorov declared Bulgarian ethnicity in Sofia in 1942. And not only that but it seems to me personally (correct me if Im wrong) that this wikipedia user is trying to turn the whole point of this living person biographical article into <b>"KIRO GLIGOROV IS BULGARIAN?"</b>, like it is the most important subject in the whole story. All the time he/she insists on those statements of his/hers.<br />
To supoort such claims, that user provides links to some document scans without offering much explanations about them. And I must note, unfortunatelly user Funkyfly behaves in a quite arrogant way.</p>
<p>My side: I noticed those scans are published on the official website of the bulgarian nationalist political party VMRO-BND, section for the city of Plovdiv (note: this political party is quite "anti-Gligorov"). Im not saying that such documents should be always ignored! if they are published by some political party, that doesn't mean they are fake by default. Or maybe they ARE fake? We simply dont know. Seeing that the discussion goes nowhere I insisted that at least a detailed explanation of those links should be added cause the readers deserve to know what they're clicking (and they are clicking a link to a website of a political party). Contrary to him/her, for those ceratin links that I added, I also added all the possible details to help the readers (according to Wikipedia rules: detailed explanation of external links is required) so they would know what they're clicking.<br />
Also, user Funkyfly insists that the following sentence should remain untouched, quote: <i>During his studies in the University of Sofia in 1941, and when applying for a position as a lawyer in 1942, Kiro Gligorov declared Bulgarian ethnicity.</i>(end of quote). No source, no citation, no footnote, absolutely nothing is provided, except those questinable scans which are actually not connected to this sentence in any way (footnote, reference or something). The sentence just stays "naked" like it is a 100% absolute truth&#160;:)<br />
When I asked for a citation for this problematic statement, user Funkyfly removed the "citation needed" note that i left, without even trying to explain anything. If you can check at the history of the article, he/she never bothers to explain his/her changes in a normal manner.</p>
<p>Also I have pointed out that Gligorov was a member of the <i>Antifascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia</i> (<a href="../../../a/s/n/ASNOM_17e7.html" title="ASNOM">ASNOM</a>) in 1944 (so just two years after he "declares as Bulgarian" he suddenly fights those same Bulgarians to form a Macedonian state?!) and he was also a high ranking official during Tito's Yugoslavia (Yugoslavia recognized a separate Macedonian nation), so Gligorov is what the bulgarian nationalist can clearly label as an <b>adherent of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonism.html" title="Macedonism">macedonism</a></b> which is completely contrary to the pro-Bulgarian views! Also I have pointed out that Bulgaria as Hitler's ally was not a democratic country with full respect of national rights, so logically, when Gligorov was filling those forms (the scanned documents) he certainly couldnt state any other nationality except Bulgarian of course&#160;:) Many fascist regimes during WWII imposed various measures for ethnic homogenization, assimilation etc. on the freshly occupied territories. I dont see why Bulgaria should be treated as an exception. Before the WWII Gligorov also use to have a serbian name like everybody else in what is today Republic of Macedonia, which was then a part of the serbian dominated <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_cd57.html" title="Kingdom of Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslaviauntil</a> 1941. But that certainly doesnt mean he was Serbian too, of course.</p>
<p>Please let me know about your opinion. Thank you. --<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 18:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help, Aldux, I really apprecciatte it. Now, I <b>really</b> dont want to bother you again, its just i want to point out that meanwhile <b>the same user mentioned above</b> has continued his/her misbehaviour which can be clearly noticed in another article related to <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiro_Gligorov_1edf.html" title="Kiro Gligorov">Kiro Gligorov</a> and thats <a href="../../../a/s/n/ASNOM_17e7.html" title="ASNOM">ASNOM</a>. For me as an ordinary surfer, his/her aim to take control over every article related to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> is quite obvious, plz correct me if Im too paranoid. Those same statements that you removed like "Kiro Gligorov declared Bulgarian etnhnicity" and so on, are just copied and pasted in the article about <a href="../../../a/s/n/ASNOM_17e7.html" title="ASNOM">ASNOM</a> too. And again, there are no sources, no footnotes and quite poor explanations.(check the history page also plz). The situation is similar with the article about <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazar_Koli%C5%A1evski_e8e3.html" title="Lazar Koliševski">Lazar Koliševski</a>, but thats another story. Theres no way for me to solve those problems as I do not present any authority here and that <i>user mentioned above</i> is treating everything as his/her private property. On the other hand I do not wish to torture u with these balkanian troubles, im sure u have more important things in life. this was just an information on <b>how articles related to RoM are constantly being treated</b>. Thank you again for ur kind attention.--<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 03:26, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess some Republicans would rather see the history of their greatest leaders "untainted" by their obvious cooperation with the Bulgarian "occupiers". <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunkyFly_1ae6.html" title="User talk:FunkyFly"><span style="color:#0F0;background:#000;"><b>&#160;&#160;/FunkyFly.talk_</b>&#160;</span></a> 14:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Funkfly</b>, as you see Im trying to avoid further quarells and hostilities. Reverting the article over and over, "war of ego's" or insulting each other's nation is definetly not a solution. Im just asking for a sort of <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">arbitration</a> by a respected and experienced user from a "neutral country"(in this case it's Italy). As you can see I also presented the POV of the both sides in this dispute. As I said, those documents MAY be 100% true, but we are simply far from being 100% sure yet, so right now that's highly questionable. And speaking of your behaviour, its quite obvious.<br />
For <b>Aldux</b>: if I said or did anything wrong Im sure you will tell me. Thank you in advance. --<a href="../../../v/b/b/User%7EVbb-sk-mk_10cd.html" title="User:Vbb-sk-mk">Vbb-sk-mk</a> 16:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux, as you suggested, I'm trying to edit this article so it's better sourced; perhaps you'd like to see how it's going? As I suspected, one of our editors doesn't like my changes. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:13, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ciao, Aldux. I would appreciate your opinion on this kerfuffle. As far as I am concerned, je m'en fous whether AtG is considered this or that. The issue is whether a "masticabibbia" contingent is steering the the article to its own ends. I found particularly revealing an edit comment by one of the group, "The Discussion Does not Warrant This Category given the evidence is not there; if that's the case we might as well place sexual oriented categories in every ancient Greek biography" not only because it is patently false, as have been most of their arguments, but because it offers a glimpse of where this is headed - the removal or blocking of sexual categories from a culture renowned for its homophile interests. It seems to me both dangerous and unwise to cave in to this pressure, since history has shown all too well that appeasement does not work. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 16:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Iranica is one source, not <b>The Truth™</b>; its position should be stated, but you can't pretend to remove the primary sources on the battle numbers only because you don't like them. I haven't heard of the wikipolicy WP:CENSURE; so they shall remain.

<p>I listed historical people whose name has been used and are used as synonymous with betrayal and collaboration with the enemy. Ephialtes seems to be one in Greece, more internationally Brytys and Judas and Quisling. In United States everyone knows what is ment by calling someone Benedict Arnold as is the casse with Kuusinen in my home country. Brutus and Judas lived 500 years later than Ephialtes. There is no periodical connection there and it is not even needed since each time period and culture has it's own historical example of the basic character of a traitor. Ephialtes is the mythical traitor of the anticent Greek history and Brutus is the one for Imperial Rome, Judas for Christianity, Quisling for Norway and much of Western Europe under Nazis adn Kuusinen for Finns who fought the Soviets. In fact there should be a category for achtypes like traitors in history. Please, don't revert the changes.<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpespatriae_6317.html" title="User:Spespatriae">Spespatriae</a> 14:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I edited the article to best fit other cases. The article is not neutrual and shows only one side of a complex story</p>

This is off a Discovery Channel Site</p>

<p>The Mysterious Death of Cleopatra tackles a cold case of regal proportions. Cleopatra inherited the throne of Egypt at age 17, before dodging assassination to rule for more than 20 years. Her life is filled with the enigmatic and the unexplained… as is her untimely death. For two millennia, only one cause has been recorded – suicide by snakebite. Now, cold case criminal profiler Pat Brown and a team of experts that includes an underwater archaeologist and a toxicologist, are re-examining the circumstances of her alleged suicide. Using techniques of 21st century criminal investigations, they reconstruct the 2,000-year-old death scene (which is now submerged beneath Alexandria harbor) and reveal the sinister power games that led to her death.</p>

<p>Hi aldux, I was wondering why the article <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carapelli.html" title="Carapelli">Carapelli</a> links to an american food company. As for the discussions in 'Italian people', you should propose to remove all references about X people being similar to Y in order to avoid POVs. That's how it was decided in 'Greeks' and the article has been peaceful ever since. I'm suggesting it for Italians too but nobody listens, they keep fixed to their POVs. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:17, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would seem that in the USA Carapelli is a subsidiary of this Hormel food company; a company I have honestly never have heard of, while the name Carapelli is quite known in Italy, and they do a lot of publicity. As for <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian people</a>, it's a lot of time I've not given a look at the article; I'll do tomorrow, as now I really have to go to sleep.

</dl>
<p>Ok this is why I thought that Carapelli might be worthy of an article of its own. There's no new content in 'Italian people', just some edit-warring on minor edits concerning the "related ethnic groups" field on the infobox. I haven't been following closely nor participating either, except backing up some of my old edits in Talk. I suggest that in order to stop POV-pushing and disputees, this field should be completely removed. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 11:51, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aldux, you moved the article Thebes (Greece) to 'Thebes, Greece', as if it were a city of US state. What was the problem with how it was before? Secondly, the Egyptian Thebes is an ancient city of a lost people, neither the city itself nor its people exist today - it's undue weight to equate it with the existing, Greek city. I'm not sure whether the Greek Thebes should be disambiguated in the first place, it should keep the name <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes.html" title="Thebes">Thebes</a> and then use a Thebes (Egypt) or Thebes (disambiguation). Finally why did you remove the Turkish and Greek names from <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a>? Those names were in official use for over 1000 years, and Greeks and Turks were a majority population in that city. But besides all that, just take a look at the countless Greek articles which mention Turkish and Venetian names in their heads, and NOT in a separate section (<a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corfu.html" title="Corfu">Corfu</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakynthos.html" title="Zakynthos">Zakynthos</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki.html" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chios.html" title="Chios">Chios</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbos.html" title="Lesbos">Lesbos</a> and the list goes on and on and on and on and on.....!). I don't see how <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a> is an exception to the rule, is it because Macedonian Slavs are bitching more than the other editors? Because for me that's not enough of an excuse. 15:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a note to both of you: I agree with Aldux and Khoikhoi about the Bitola case. About Thebes, please take note that we currently have double redirects and countless wrong links (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Thebes_ae1d.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Thebes">Special:Whatlinkshere/Thebes</a> shows lots of Egypt-related pages). So whatever we do with those articles, there'll be a need of cleanup. I'm for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes.html" title="Thebes">Thebes</a>=dab, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_%28Egypt%29_1768.html" title="Thebes (Egypt)">Thebes (Egypt)</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_%28Greece%29_0c1f.html" title="Thebes (Greece)">Thebes (Greece)</a>. Brackets for disambiguation are good for using the pipe trick, if nothing else. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So why do you agree on the Bitola case, care to explain it to me? Each time I tried to remove Ottoman and Venetian names from an article's head and put it them in the body, I was reverted by Khoikhoi. What is it that makes Bitola an exception? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a question of symbolically promoting or demoting the significance of a name, it's a matter of text organisation. The <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a> article has a well-written, well structured, pretty large section devoted to the various names. If there's that much material, a section in the body text is the best solution. If you can write a section of that size and quality about the history of the various names of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chios.html" title="Chios">Chios</a> or whatever, be my guest. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For ancient towns I've noted that the model I reverted to is the most used; and de facto Thebes case can't be compared with that of Athens, as modern Thebes is just a small town of 20,000 inhabitants, and people were search for info on old Thebes, not modern Thebes. Anyways make a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>; I won't shoot myself anyway it ends. As for the second point, Bitola, I also removed the Slavic name.

<p>I think that you had simply not agreed, the way I see it everyone has his view and follows his own policies.

<p>Thebes might be a small town but it has a continuous history, and it has been important as a Byzantine city and as the capital of the Latin principalities, so it's not true that after antiquity it's been as good as dead (as you imply). If for no good reason, someone might be interested to visit the ruins of the ancient city. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Btw in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki.html" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> the alt. names were also mentioned in the article, yet no-one claimed "duplication of information" so I'm not falling for that excuse. I tried to explain this to <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> but I got sarcasms in reply. I'm expecting more seriousness from your part Aldux, if you remove the alt. names from Bitola again, then I'll justly remove them from Thessaloniki and Crete and then new problems will arise. I really couldn't care less whether the Greek and Turkish name appear in the head of <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitola.html" title="Bitola">Bitola</a>, I just can't stand the double-standard logic go unnoticed. If you decide to remove alternative names, then go ahead and do it <i>from all articles</i>, if you want to keep them then do it as well, <i>from all articles</i>, I just don't see the reason for making exceptions. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 19:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Aldux. I though you might like to know that I'm starting to work on the Hellenistic Art article you asked to have translated from French. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 17:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Translation complete! <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> and others also helped. Can you advise re how to move it to the English Wikipedia page: do we worry about retaining the page history? thanks. (I also asked EdJohnston the same question.) --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:04, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply! Actually, I do have a few questions. I've been wikifying for about a week or so and really getting into it.</p>
<p>One question is: I've been keeping a list in my sandbox, for my own convenience, of users I might want to contact. Do you think this is OK or would it violate some policy, i.e. would the users mind do you think?</p>
<p>Another question: I'm wondering whether anybody is looking after the translation page. For example, is the tranlation of the month changed each month. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> and also the page <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_e83f.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English">Wikipedia:Translation into English</a>. I'm thinking of adding some instructions for other new translators and perhaps suggesting that the page <a href="../../../f/r/e/Wikipedia%7EFrench_Collaboration_Project_4d9c.html" title="Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project">Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project</a> be merged with the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> page. Oho -- I just found the page <a href="../../../f/r/e/Wikipedia%7EFrench_Collaboration_Project_History_95fe.html" title="Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project/History">Wikipedia:French Collaboration Project/History</a> which seems to imply that no, nobody is looking after updating the translation of the month. I would suggest deleting the stuff about translation of the month, if it's not really being looked after. Just an ordinary list of things to be translated, on ONE page, should be good enough. What do you think?</p>
<p>By the way, about the page history: it seems more important to retain the page history which is attached to the sandbox (i.e. history of translating the page) than the page history of the current English page. However, I suppose if I mention on the talk page that I cut-and-pasted from the sandbox then people can follow the links back if they really want to. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:02, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pretty well finished Derveni krater. See notes on its talk page. I won't always be that fast!! --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 21:24, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see you made the title of "Hellenistic art" conform to capitalization and put a redirect from the orphan tranlation sandbox.</p>
<p>Question: I put instructions for proofreaders on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> (just before the Recently Translated section). I suggested going onto the French wikipedia and putting an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlanguage_link.html" title="Interlanguage link">interlanguage link</a> to the translated article. Is that necessary or does a bot do that based on the link from the English article to the French one? --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 12:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I had put links to "Hellenistic Art" on several other pages; I just went and changed them to lowercase a in art. I think I got them all. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 10:02, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

On the other hand, I've been drinking these in Greece since maybe 10 years now. Is it that frequent in Italy?

<dd>I've always wanted to know something more about that:). i know well that drinking coffee is by no means a greek invention, but, is frappe only a "greek thing"? or maybe is it included in the various kinds of coffee served in Italy (primarily, since we have many italian kinds of coffee) or elsewhere? <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 04:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry Niko, I hadn't immediately noticed your post. The awnser to your question is very simple: absolutely no, simply the idea of drinking cold coffee seems weird to me, I've never drunk personally a cold coffee in all my life, neither has anybody in my family; except, obviously, the originally boiling espresso is served cold because of the bar's sloppiness, and then it's really disgusting.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:18, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I knew that was the case, but didn't want to push this so far initially.

I'll make a picture, and if you find it attractive, I'll tell you the (easy) recipe. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">Niko</a><a href="../../../n/%21/_/User_talk%7EN%21_85c3.html" title="User talk:N!">Silver</a> 16:30, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The photo makes it tempting, I admit, but in all honesty, the thought of drinking cold coffee is something that my stomach can't resist. Also, I'm first of all a tea-drinker (which makes me a real outcast in a coffee-mad country like Italy&#160;;-)).

<p>Please, can you take a look at <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">Macedonians (ethnic group)</a>?

<dd>I'd be one of them, and I was blackmailing for sources, coz the infobox shows more Macedonian Slavs in e.g. Italy than those countries, but no category! I'll be adding the respective categories if you don't mind, and that's for consistency in this article. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">Niko</a><a href="../../../n/%21/_/User_talk%7EN%21_85c3.html" title="User talk:N!">Silver</a> 23:23, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Niko, don't forget in such cases we usually make a difference between recent immigrant communities and autochthonous populations. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 23:35, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ultimately, we are all immigrants; who is to define one's status as "recent" and "autochthonous". Anyway - check the categories at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>.--Euthymios 23:39, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ummm, I had no idea about the autochthonous/immigrants thing. In that case, would it be irrational to say that in order to qualify as an immigrant of some ethnicity, that ethnicity has to exist prior to your migration? Hah! Anyway, I wish Greece performs an ethnicity census next time, so that we get done with this. I wonder if Helsinki et al state the method of arriving at those estimates. OTOH, those 2,955 votes are a pretty rational method, dont you think? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">Niko</a><a href="../../../n/%21/_/User_talk%7EN%21_85c3.html" title="User talk:N!">Silver</a> 00:08, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Helsinki monitor never states methods of estimations... btw, have u seen that they even list <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomaks.html" title="Pomaks">Pomaks</a> as "Macedonians"? i am not keen on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theories.html" title="Conspiracy theories">conspiracy theories</a>, but sometimes they do exist!

<dd>Hectorian, are you sure you don't mean euromosaic? I've read the all the Helsinki Monitor reports online on the Pomaks and it was never stated that they were Macedonians. As for the votes of a party, I disagree they are a good criterion to understand the strength of a minority; there was once a Pomak political party in Bulgaria, and it made even worse than the Rainbow party; but nobody serious thought that this meant that the Pomaks didn't exist, or identified all as ethnic Bulgarians.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:26, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know about euromosaic, but i have the impression that Helsinki monitor also links the Pomaks with the "Macedonians"... well, if not the Pomaks (muslims) in western Thrace, surely the Slavic-speaking population (christians) in Eastern Greek Macedonia (Drama and Serres prefectures). seems they are identifing ethnic groups according to the old ottoman tradition, id est according to religion. IMO, the votes of minority and ethnic parties are quite a good criterion for the numerical strength of a specific minority: u can compare the parties of the Basques and the Catalans in Spain, and of the Scots in the UK-maybe not all of them vote for the specific parties, but at least there is not a gap 1 to 300 (as some nationalists in FYROM say: 3,000 votes but 1 million Slavomacedonians...!). and, not only looking at the number of votes, but also in the ethnic or religious affiliation of the MP... e.g., in Greece there are 2 muslim MP from Thrace (something that roughly corresponds to the strength of the muslim minority there. but, "surprisingly", no MP from any other imagined minority... as for the Pomaks, i do not know if they all self-identify as ethnic Bulgarians, but for sure they are neither Turks nor "Macedonians".

<p>I have created the category 'ethnic groups in FYROM', where i included the ethnic groups found only there, and not in the rest of the region of Macedonia. u know well the definitions for both... U are free to rename it into 'category:...<b>Republic of</b> Macedonia' (since Wikipedia has come to a state to have a country under this name...), but not simply as 'Macedonia'. there are categories about ethnic groups in various countries, thus, only under this name (the name of the respective article) such a category can exist.

<p>Most of the people will tell you that is civil war, i mean they will never call it civil war in iraq because that war (its all lousy politics)is lost for usa and 'coalition' and worse worse than vietnam, however, let's ask other historians if they think that was civil war, then we can find best solution.</p>
