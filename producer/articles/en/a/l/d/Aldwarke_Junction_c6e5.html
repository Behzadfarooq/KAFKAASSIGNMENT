<p>The junction is sited immediately north of the site of the former Parkgate and Rawmarsh station, which closed in 1968.</p>
<p>At this point the double track former <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Central_Railway_afed.html" title="Great Central Railway">Great Central Railway</a> line from <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Victoria_railway_station_966f.html" title="Sheffield Victoria railway station">Sheffield Victoria</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexborough.html" title="Mexborough">Mexborough</a> (where it joined the South Yorkshire line to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>) came within 50 yards of the four-track former <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Midland_Railway_76ea.html" title="North Midland Railway">North Midland Railway</a> line from <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby.html" title="Derby">Derby</a>. The original junction was a double track cross-over (scissors crossing) taking traffic to and from the GC lines to the two "slow" lines of the North Midland in the direction of Leeds and to and from the "slow" lines of the North Midland to the GC, in the direction of Mexborough. Further cross-overs were installed to make possible a move from the "slow" to the "fast" lines ( and v.v.) on the North Midland at each end of the junction.</p>
<p>This gave access and egress via the GC to the northern end of the newly built <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinsley_Marshalling_Yard_540c.html" title="Tinsley Marshalling Yard">Tinsley Marshalling Yard</a> at Sheffield and to its southern end via a connection from the North Midland line at Treeton, south of Rotherham.</p>
<p>Operation of the junction and the immediate vicinity through new multiple aspect colour light signalling, four aspect on the Midland "fast" lines and three aspect on the Midland "slow" and G.C. lines, was installed controlled from a new power-operated signal box set just to the north of the scissors crossing. The signal box closed in the late 1970s when the new Sheffield power box took over responsibilities for the area, however the building remained, firstly as an emergency facility due to its strategic location, and later as a staff building.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldwarke_Junction_c6e5.html" title="Edit section: Closures">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Closures</span></h2>
<p>The construction of the junction allowed a double track curve at Swinton between Swinton Town station and Mexborough to be closed. At the same time, Sheffield to Doncaster trains were re-routed to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Midland_railway_station_1460.html" title="Sheffield Midland railway station">Sheffield Midland</a> over the new junction as a part of the plan to close <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Victoria_railway_station_966f.html" title="Sheffield Victoria railway station">Sheffield Victoria</a>, also resulting in the closure of <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotherham_Central_railway_station_078d.html" title="Rotherham Central railway station">Rotherham Central</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldwarke_Junction_c6e5.html" title="Edit section: Rationalisation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rationalisation</span></h2>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s the junction was remodelled. The third and fourth running lines north of the junction were removed and the connection to the G.C. in the Mexborough direction was moved to be a single-line ladder junction north of the existing junction, thus removing the complexity of the double-scissors crossing. To enable trains travelling from Sheffield to Doncaster to call at the new Swinton station the previously lifted double-track curve to the Mexborough line from Swinton was replaced and all passenger traffic routed via this, rendering the former GC line from Aldwarke to Mexborough goods-only.</p>
<p>Today the junction is a known bottleneck with many local stopping trains, fast expresses and freight trains all converging on the junction. Prior to its demise, Railtrack had plans to reinstate the third and fourth running lines north of the junction as far as Swinton junction and remodel Swinton station to increase capacity. These plans do not seem to have been adopted Railtrack's successor Network Rail.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldwarke_Junction_c6e5.html" title="Edit section: Industry in the Area">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Industry in the Area</span></h2>
<p>The junction is sited within a heavy industrial area. Although the coal mines (Aldwarke and Roundwood collieries were adjacent to the junction) have closed, the last in 1964, the Parkgate Iron and Steel Company invested heavily in the mid-1960's in the development of a new site alongside the GC with rail access. Nowadays the site is owned by Corus and comprises not just the Aldwarke (new site) melting and steel processing but was developed further with the opening of the Thrybergh Bar Mill in 1976. At the north end of the junction, adjacent to the North Midland line, and rail connected to it, is situated the just post-war Roundwood Rolling Mill ( commonly known because of the size of metal it rolls as the "10 inch mill" ). However, the former blast furnace and open hearth steel melting plant to the rear of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkgate_and_Rawmarsh_station_59f6.html" title="Parkgate and Rawmarsh station">Parkgate and Rawmarsh station</a> are gone, replaced by large retail parks. The road names, however, reflect the railway theme, although most not from the railways of this area. (Note: The nearby "Great Eastern Way" is, infact, named after the Isambard Kingdom Brunel ship of the same name; the metal plates for its construction being produced at the Parkgate Iron and Steel Company).</p>

<p>At a hearing on 5th July 2004 before Judge Moore in Sheffield Crown Court, Jarvis Facilities Ltd (Jarvis) was fined £400,000 for breaching health and safety law. This prosecution followed an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into a train derailment at Aldwarke Junction, near Rotherham, on 10th November 2002.
