<p>Hi Aldux, and welcome to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You've been doing a lot of good editing. I've noticed that you have been copying text from <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_Greek_and_Roman_Biography_and_Mythology_85cd.html" title="Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</a> by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Smith_%28lexicographer%29_fd41.html" title="William Smith (lexicographer)">William Smith</a>. This is fine from a copyright standpoint since it is in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. However there are some issues with doing this see for example: <a href="../../../1/9/1/Wikipedia%7E1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_18ad.html" title="Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>.</p>
<p>I've made a few changes to <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaeus_%28general%29.html" title="Achaeus (general)">Achaeus (general)</a> that you might want to look at, and which might be good to keep in mind. Some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date formats and linking see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a>. For example I changed "214 b.c." to "[[214 BC]]").</li>
<li>Scanned text will often include unwanted line-break hyphenation (Achaeus had a number of these).</li>
<li>It is usually only necessary to link the first mention of something. I've de-linked several things.</li>
<li>I inserted a template message: {{<a href="../../../s/m/i/Template%7ESmithDGRBM_10af.html" title="Template:SmithDGRBM">SmithDGRBM</a>}} (see <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a>) and <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Sources_of_articles_c696.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles">Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles</a>), which can be used to indicate that some text was copied from Smith's Dictionary. It should be placed at the bottom of the article.</li>
<li>I also reformatted the references, to conform more to house style (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once more welcome to Wikipedia. It is always great to welcome more classical editors (by the way I hope you will tell us something about yourself on your user page: <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> — gets rid of that red link&#160;;-) If you have any questions on the above (or anything else) don't hesitate to ask me on my <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">talk page</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 17:49, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aldux, Since you didn't respond to my answer to your question on my talk page, I've decided to copy your question and my response to here (just in case you didn't see it there — if you just didn't have anything to say that's ok&#160;;-) I also wanted to add to what I said below that another great advantage to the "<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" rel="nofollow">Perseus</a>" site is that you can search individual works. I've also converted the inline citations in <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaeus_%28general%29.html" title="Achaeus (general)">Achaeus (general)</a> to footnotes, and you can see how they work, and how the links to the specific passages work.

<p>(<i>Start of copied text'</i>)</p>
<p>Thanks for sending me your message and for your corrections to the article. I was asking myself: if you incorporate text from more than one source should I template both? You see, I incorporated text from 3 sources in an article i wrote before. A smaller question; why did you change the link for Polybius. Because my source was 1922-27, while your's is 1867, so public domain (even if I believe that also the other is). Thanks in advance for your response. You see, I'm a newbie and I still do a lot of errors. (<i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> at 18:27, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</i>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Aldux. The templates are only intended to be used if you copy text verbatim. If you copy from more than one source then you should mention all of them (using templates if they exist). In any case every work used should be listed in the "References" section, whether or not a "This article incorporates text from ..." template was used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As regards the Polybius reference change, it had nothing to do with dates or being in the public domain, which of course isn't an issue so long as you are not copying text. Either your Edward's Polybius, or my Shuckburgh's Polybius would be ok as a reference. However, it is good where possible to give an "on-paper" reference with complete bibliographic information (e.g. translator, publisher, year etc.), which yours didn't, and I had that info handy for mine. (One of the virtues of "on-paper", is that there will probably be a printed version of Wikipedia someday.) It is of course also very nice to have an online version of the reference, which both our references have. But I much prefer the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" rel="nofollow">Perseus</a> site&#160;;-) it is easier to use and it has a <i>lot more</i> linked information. And you can provide links to the exact passages cited. (For an example see <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demetrius_of_Pharos_9bd3.html#Notes" title="Demetrius of Pharos">Demetrius of Pharos#Notes</a>) In any case we can list both if you want. Or if you just want to provide an online link to that site, without listing it in the references section, you can add an "External links" section, and put it there.</dd>

<dd>By the way, you can sign and time stamp your posts by typing four tildes like so: "~~~~". Happy editing&#160;;-)</dd>

<p>Hi Aldux. You are very welcome. I don't mind at all trying to help a bit with the great contributions you are making. And you do seem to be picking up things quickly.

<p>Hi Aldux, I noticed you are continuing to make excellent progress transferring material from Smith's Dictionary. Are you planning to do the whole thing? I bet you are learning a lot. I also saw you caught and reverted some vandalism at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_empire.html" title="Roman empire">Roman empire</a> good work. So I thought I would award you with a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnstar.html" title="Barnstar">Barnstar</a> on your user page, for all your great work. By the way, I just noticed it says on your user page that you live in Firenze. Lucky you! It is one of my favorite cities.

<p>I really appreciated the award!&#160;:-) That said, I must in honesty reply that Smith's Dictionary (or better Dictionaries, since they're three: Biography, Antiques, Geography) is simply to big for a lazy one like me; and, also, I would like to work a bit on Wace's <i>Dictionary of Christian Biography</i>, a bit partisan but very detailed. For certain I can only say that I'll keep working with the history articles.</p>
<p>As for Firenze, alas!, I've just finished my post-university studies and I've returned home. Not that I've gone very far away: I'm just fifty miles upstream where the river <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arno.html" title="Arno">Arno</a> passes by Firenze, in a small town called Subbiano, near <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arezzo.html" title="Arezzo">Arezzo</a>. As for November, I must confess its to early to answer, since much depends on where the Public Education ministry decides to send me, which is for now a mistery.

<p>Hai <b>Aldux</b>, there are intresting articles about <b>Ayyavazhi</b>, a new religion on both mythology and religiosity. Wikipedia is rich with this topic in English, but poor in other languages. Since french is a leading language in Wikipedia it is better to translate the contents on this <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">AYYAVAZHI</a> family to french. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj">Paul Raj</a></p>

<p>Hello! I've noticed your interest in classical antiquity. Could you please check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_the_Great&amp;diff=24471637&amp;oldid=24464026" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_the_Great&amp;diff=24471637&amp;oldid=24464026" rel="nofollow">change</a> I've just made regarding Thebans on Alexander. I must warn you though that the Alexander wiki attracts vandalism and/or edit wars.</p>
<p>My second request is also about Thebans. If you can please take a look at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Thermopylae_dd24.html#Thebans" title="Talk:Battle of Thermopylae">Talk:Battle_of_Thermopylae#Thebans</a> and the related changes on that article. As you'll read, I'm also looking for <i>Herodotus' malice</i> by Plutarch.</p>

<p>Hi, Matia&#160;:-) I've just controlled that edit on the Thebans &amp; Alexander: i believe your edit is correct, as proved by this:</p>
<p>"His rapid march into the south of Greece over­awed all opposition; Thebes, which had been most active against him, submitted when he ap­peared at its gates; and the assembled Greeks at the Isthmus of Corinth, with the sole exception of the Spartans, elected him to the command against Persia, which had previously been bestowed upon his father. Being now at liberty to reduce the barbarians of the north to obedience, he marched (early in 335 BC) across mount Haemus, defeated the Triballi, and advanced as far as the Danube, which he crossed, and received embassies from the Scythians and other nations. On his return, he marched westward, and subdued the Illyrians and Taulantii, who were obliged to sub­mit to the Macedonian supremacy. While engaged in these distant countries, a report of his death reached Greece, and the Thebans once more took up arms. But a terrible punishment awaited them. He advanced into Boeotia by rapid marches, and appeared before the gates of the city almost before the inhabitants had received intelligence of his approach. The city was taken by assault; all the buildings, with the exception of the house of Pindar, were levelled with the ground; most of the inhabitants butchered, and the rest sold as slaves. Athens feared a similar fate, and sent an embassy deprecating his wrath; but Alexander did not ad­vance further; the punishment of Thebes was a sufficient warning to Greece." <a href="http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0128.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0128.html" rel="nofollow">Smith's Dictionary</a></p>
<p>As for the sources see Plutarch, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+11.1" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+11.1" rel="nofollow">11</a>, Diodorus, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Diod.+17.8.1" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Diod.+17.8.1" rel="nofollow">xvii. 8-17</a>, Justin, <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/justinus_04_books11to20.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/justinus_04_books11to20.htm" rel="nofollow">xi. 1-4</a>, Arrian, <a href="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book1a.asp" class="external text" title="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book1a.asp" rel="nofollow">i. 7-9</a></p>
<p>My only objection is to "Philip was content to deprive Thebes of her dominion over Boeotia." This isn't fully exact: it would also seem from the sources that a Macedonian garrison was imposed by Philip on the Cadmeia, Thebes' citadel.</p>

<dd>Hi! the reason I reverted is that Seleucus II wasn't the last Seleucid king in Persia, and they kept control of the key Iranian provinces (Media, Susiana, Fars) for still a century.

<p>Why are you reverting my changes? Also what kind of references do you need? For what claim? “Unlike the time before WWII, when Macedonia was hotbed for unrest and terror and about 60% of the entire royal Yugoslav police force was stationed there, “ – this is not disputed by anybody. See <a href="../../../v/m/r/VMRO_d0c1.html#The_interwar_years" title="VMRO">VMRO#The_interwar_years</a>. " Numerous assassinations (over 1,000 by one account) were carried out by IMRO agents in many countries, the majority in Yugoslavia. The most spectacular of these was the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou, in Marseille". Or "contemporary observers described the Yugoslav-Bulgarian frontier as the most fortified in Europe"</p>
<p>“after the war there were no signs of disturbances comparable with pre war times or” I don’t need references for event that never happen. It is the Bulgarians that need to put some kind of references of some kind of incident. Surely if 100 K+ was imprisoned we would have at least one bomb or assassination somewhere?</p>
<p>“post war times in other parts of former Yugoslavia, such as Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia.” Read for example <a href="../../../u/s/t/Ustasa.html#After_the_war" title="Ustasa">Ustasa#After_the_war</a>. “Ustaše were implicated in over two dozen terrorist acts following the post-war period.” --<a href="../../../c/i/g/User%7ECigor_f0eb.html" title="User:Cigor">Cigor</a> 17:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Cigor&#160;:-) You must understand that my objections do not come from disbelief, on the contrary between the two theories I think your seems the nearest to truth. But you have to understand that these statements may be contested may be others, all the one you mentioned. <b>When I mean sourcing I mean mentioning scholar xxxx and historian xxxx so to substain the points against possible future objections.</b> Second, context can help: like if you write "Macedonia was very peaceful after WWII, compared to the inter-wars years" and here putting a rapid allusion to the VMRO violence, and if you write "also compared to Croatia and Bosnia", and adding something like, "where ustasa violence was active in the first post-war decade". These are only examples, and I have no doubt you can find something better. If you still have some questions or objections, don't have problems asking. Bye&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In general I agree with you, but I don’t see the same policy applied for the Bulgarian claim. All we have there is statements of politicians. It’s really not that hard to make a decent research of the alleged repressions of Bulgarians in Macedonia. They have an institute in Sophia that deals exclusively about Macedonia. If there were indeed 100K+ (or even few thousands), I am sure some of their scholar would have abundantly documented this claim. But they didn’t and all they have is arbitrary statements from politicians.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, the entire claim makes no sense. Why would “Bulgarians” revolt if the Bulgarian government acknowledged the existence of Macedonian nation after WWII . This policy was reverted in the 1950s/1960s but by that time there was little doubt in Macedonia what kind of people they are.</dd>
<dd>There were 12,000 out of total 18,000 policemen in Macedonia before WWII. As for comparison with Croatia and Serbia, have in mind that there were still cetnicks and ustasa guerilla until the early 1950s. There were many terrorist acts in Croatia and Bosnia. Not to mention the big MASPOK in the early 1970s. None of that occurred in Macedonia. Conclusion: Is it possible that the people in Macedonia were happy with the existing solution?</dd>

<p>I accept your apology Aldux. I too apologize if I said anything that offended you. My purpose here is not to offend anyone or to make anyone think that they are not intelligent enough to contribute positively here on Wikipedia. I truly appreciate your courage in taking the time to apologize. For that, you have my unmitigated respect.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am not against the commonalities shared between Greeks and Romans. I may be so bold as to say that the Romans were offspring of the Greeks. Of course, I have met Italians who don't like that statement. The point I was trying to make in the discussion page is that the Greek social mentality is always oriented on distinguishing itself even if it has commonalities with other civilizations. For instance, Athenians and Spartans were Greeks and both groups knew they were brothers. However, they wanted to retain their distinct local identities.</p>
<p>Look, I never doubted that you were (and still are) adept in your understanding of the Byzantine Empire. Just so you know, I am not against Western European scholarship for their positive contributions to academia. I am against Western European scholarship to the extent that I am against actual academics with Ph.D's and Master's degrees who preach that modern Greeks are Turks or that the Byzantines were non-Greek. Also, there are some Greek scholars who do the same thing, and that I find to be very dishonorable on their part. If any of these statements were true, you would not see me arguing at all. My arguments have their reasons and are based on either sources or well-thought-out social analyses. If I make a mistake, then I accept it and move on (of course, I admit I have inherited the ancient Greek characteristic of extreme stubborness and cannot seem to move on after making a mistake; sometimes I just cannot help it).</p>
<p>Just so you know, I only mock people when I have to defend myself against those who needlessly deride my heritage. Please understand where I am coming from. I have spoken to Turks, Albanians, and F.Y.R.O.Mians (fake "Macedonians") who (for no reason at all) attack my heritage as if they have nothing else better to do. All of this needless pressure sort of forces me to defend my ancestors, their history and heritage. I do not like it when people lie to me about my heritage. Not so much because it bothers me, but also because it does a great injustice to future generations who may want to know the truth about the achievements of great civilizations.</p>
<p>Again, I am sorry if I said anything to offend you. I did keep my promise that I would provide sources to support the statements I have made on the article <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_the_Greeks_c009.html" title="Names of the Greeks">Names of the Greeks</a> (you can find them on the discussion page). I am sorry if I treated you like an alien. I admit, I assumed that you were supporting those Western European "scholars" who love ancient Greece and pretend to love Byzantine history when in fact they despise it. If you are a Roman, then chances are you have Greek blood. Moreover, your love for the Greco-Roman will not go unrewarded.</p>
<p>Your apology is honorably accepted and I hope that we never have to fight again. Take care Aldux. Over and out. - Deucalionite 12/15/05 12:56 P.M. EST</p>

<p>I have no problem with including R. Lane Fox's opinion, however, on omitting the "multiple doses" argument, I disagree. R. Lane Fox is correct that such long-acting poisons were probably not available then, but they weren't needed if you consider multiple doses. There would not need to be a "long acting poison." Multiple doses could've been used.</p>
<p>Also, I disagree with your omission of the fact that the warrior culture favored the sword -- direct killing -- over poison. I believe this is a critical argument against poisoning.</p>

<dd>Hi Primetime&#160;:-) The point is that if we really want to put a pronunciation aid, I have a feeling we should put it for the original Greek name, not for the Latin one.

<p>You edited my last insertion re deaths of Kapwepwe and Nkumbula. FYI, although nothing was even proven the fact remains that a cloud of suspition has always hung there about KK's role, if any. Knowing the man for many years, I doubt he had anything to do with it (nor Miller's death in fact) but the reality of the situation cannot be ignored or PC'd. Further, Kaunda never referred to <i>African</i> Humanisim but plain Humanisim on the basis that he wanted to show his position in a global perspective and not merely an African/regional one.--<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhodie_b611.html" title="User:Rhodie">Rhodie</a> 14:38, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, Aldux, I just noticed this discussion here. I think it would be better to hold it on the Talk page so that all interested editors can contribute. I am not sure why Miskin is opposed to using the word "Ottoman" in this article, as the thing they are most famous for -- the early films -- were made while Monastir was still Ottoman. They apparently stayed on in Yugoslav Bitola until the 20's at least, and at some point apparently left for Greece. It would be good to have more information about all that of course. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If you want me to search other links to add to this one, OK; and I don't see why you should abstain yourself by putting an ex. link, if it's a biog. that adds useful info and not a polemic piece.</dd>

<p>I created an article for <a href="../../../k/u/k/Kukawa.html" title="Kukawa">Kukawa</a>. Could you add when it first became capital? Also I have an old British book (1900) that refers to the independent "Sultanate of Bornu" (It was written after the Anglo-French agreements but just before the partition was actually implemented). I have also seen a reference to Nachtigal visiting the "Sultanate" in 1870. But the ruler seems to have been an Emir. What was the correct name of the country in the late 19th century? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJameswilson_10c0.html" title="User:Jameswilson">Jameswilson</a> 00:15, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your reply. If you put 'rabeh bornu' into google, the top pages listed seem to suggest that he seized power and made himself ruler of Bornu, rather than destroying it. My 1900 book (Geography of the World, George Philip and Son for the Civil Service Book Depot, London) doesnt name him, but certainly confirms that impression. It says that in 1900, Bornu and Wadai (and Wadai's tributary states of Kanem and Bagirmi} were all independent "Mohammedan Negroid States". The European powers had agreed partition but had not yet implemented it. The Kukawa population figure does not have a date (as I wrtongly thought) but certainly no mention is made of any destruction of the city itself.</p>
<p>On Bornu specifically, it says:- " Bornu, that is, Bar-noa, or the Land of Noah, is a lovely and fruitful country, to the west and south of Lake Chad. It has a population of perhaps 50,000 sq m and a population of about 5 million, chiefly Kanuri Negroes, The greater part of Bornu lies within the British sphere. The Kanuri (people of the light) Negroes are a mixed race of Negroes and Tibbus, and are regarded as "the most civiised people in Central Africa and their woven fabrics, pottery and metal ware are highly prized throughoutthe Sudan". Like the Maba Negores, or rather the Negroids of Wadai, the Kanuris hold the Arab immigrants and other races in subjection. Both these Mohammedan Sultanates are indeed remarkable examples of indigenous Negro civilisation, each possessing a well-organised admnistration, a Court and a Government, with all their dignities and offices, Unhappily, however, the whole policy of these States is based on slavery, and the traffic in human beings is still carried on (source: Keith Johnson. The London Geography). The Sultan has an army of 30,000 men partly armed with rifles, a strong force of cavalry, and even some artillery ....There are several towns with over 10,000 inhabitants in Bornu Proper and the larger tributary States, and Kuka or Kukawa, the capital of the Sultanate, has a population of 50,000 to 60,000, and is one of the great markets of the Central Sudan. (my note - old definition of Sudan = countries of the Sahel too). ....A comparatively short line of railway from Yola or from Ribago, to Kuka, would result in a great expansion of British trade in the Central Sudan."</p>

<p>The addition was much needed and it appears good. The only problem I have is the present tense. I think a past tense through the sections would be better (maybe the French preferred the present tense, here?&#160;:) ). I may change it to a past tense myself, and see how it reads.

<p>Actually I'm not retarded. The ancient Assyrians used Cuneiform and spoke a dialect of "Akkadian" just as the Babylonians did. They later adopted Aramaic as their language and used derivative of the Phonecian alphabet. I still don't understand why you're deleting the name in Syriac. You included the Greek names. She clearly wasn't Greek.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you're retarded, and if I gave you this impression, accept my excuses. I included the Greek name because this article is devoted to the mythical figure, first given us by the Greeks; that she really existed, and is Shamuramat, is only a hypothesis.

<p>Please read first the discussion page before intervening on articles. A <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a> unilaterally moved the existing Assyrian genocide article to Syriac genocide. The discussion page clearly shows that this was not sustained by anyone but Benne himself. He's trying to promote the use of the term "Syriacs" in place of "Assyrians", which is the usual scientifically-accepted ethnonym (even if it is also used by Assyrian nationalists). Please revert your modifications there: I couldn't move the article in another way since there was already an Assyrian genocide article, so I hade to use the paste function. Due to Benne's actions (and some other like-minded) a lot of articles have to be corrected now, on the base of scientific articles and books and not on the base of nationalist or religious biases. --Pylambert 15:26, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
