<p>Hi Aldux, the Greek geo articles were recently unprotected again, but Mywayyy hasn't given up and keeps reverting twice or three times daily. Would you consider re-protecting? Please see <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_Mywayyy_ee43.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise/Mywayyy">User:Future Perfect at Sunrise/Mywayyy</a> for the details to-date. -- As for something different, the posting above is by a new user who was trying to make some changes to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">Macedonians (ethnic group)</a> but was reverted, by Telex and others.

<dd>In reponse to your revert comment, there is indeed no reason it should remian - and until the debate is resolved, no reason the original should either - yet you have favoured keeping that. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVastu_ae82.html" title="User:Vastu">Vastu</a> 11:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The awnser is very simple - PHG's map has successfully passed through a Featured article nomination, your's has not, and generally speaking PHG is the main author of several featured articles. So don't be surprised I tend to value PHG's opinion particularly highly.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 12:35, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So have you read the article and decided for yourself, or are you mearly going on this 'reputation', which im sure a person like PHG neither desires or requires, as they obiously consider scholarship paramount to dogma. I shouldnt have to remind you that wikipedia is open to anyone - you are engaging in vandalism of someone's legitimate edit, which has not yet been disproven in any argument. Indeed, I am still awaiting PHG's reply - I am unsure whether he/she plans to reply at all, as they are usually punctual - until then, your reversion amounts to vandalism. I am beggining to suspect ulterior motives here, i.e. Hellenic bias, else why did you revert the image, and not allow PHG to decide? <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVastu_ae82.html" title="User:Vastu">Vastu</a> 18:01, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You will be glad to know that the issue has almost been resolved, and by the latest comment from PHG, will likely end with the general outline of the latest map, with some minor alterations (thinkening of the campaign line. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVastu_ae82.html" title="User:Vastu">Vastu</a> 10:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to express an opinion in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Eluchil404_9c2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Eluchil404">my recent request for adminship</a>. I have withdrawn my self-nomination because there seemed little prospect for further productive discussion or the formation of a consensus to promote. Many commentators offered constructive critisism that I will use to improve myself as a user. Others suggested that the nomination was premature and that a re-nom in a few months would be more likely to gain consensus. You suggested that I did not yet have enough experience for adminship. If you have the time, I would be curious as to what level of edits or time on wikipedia you consider sufficient. As there is a wide range of opinion on these matters I want to do my best to gauge the rough consensus on these issues.

<dd>N'Djamena Accord sounds good - as a title, not in practical terms. From what I've read the accord does not differ at all from the last one so its significance is highly questionable. Regarding Janjaweed, it seems as though the Sudanese government provides money and arms to the Janjaweed, but their actual control and oversight over Janjaweed incursions is unknown and debatable. Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government have similar goals but have fought against each other, according to HRW's report, during this conflict. <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">Tchadienne</a> 22:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Iasson is a banned user, then the thing to do is to rollback every edit from a sockpuppet (even any good edits). It is annoying, especially when other editors who don't know the situation get worked up about it (this happens especially when rolling back messages to user talkpages). But it is the only way to enforce a ban, and it is also the only way to make sure that attempting to create new accounts and continue disrupting Wikipedia is not rewarding. I don't know who Iasson is, which suggests that it might make sense to make sure that you have a summary of the situation handy to link to and to ask more admins to help out.

<p>Sure, if there are two sides which are just blindly reverting without any discussion on the talk page, even if they haven't violated the 3RR it would be fine to block them both for a few hours to calm down. At least get them to stop reverting while you try and calm the situation down. Of course, remember blocking is preventative rather than punative, so if you do block them, watch their talk pages, and point out that you will happily unblock them if they agree to stop reverting each other and start discussing things on the talk page. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 22:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The only problem is that with your move exactly that version was protected what Criztu and Bonaparte like to see - the one without the Hungarian name.

<p>The 72-hour block is a result of repeated use of anonymous and new (i.e. sockpuppet) accounts to evade the original 24-hour block; the bloc was reset twice before it was extended to 72h. The block evasion includes repeating the tendentious edit which got him blocked in the first place, as well as some pretty blatant trolling. I don't think there is likely to be much support for reducing the block. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:03, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand Tchadienne's many good edits, and have no issue with those. However, sockpuppeting to evade the block is specifically against policy, and we shouldn't just ignore it by letting the block lapse. When Tchadienne actually stops evading the block (without us having to range block his/her entire ISP), I'll be happy to consider undoing the block. Until then, I think a cooldown is necessary. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 02:12, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, since I didn't place the range block personally, I'd prefer you go to JzG and advocate for the removal of the range block as well as the block on Tchadienne. I'll put in my two cents on his talk page as well. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict)The reason is very simple: it's extremely simple to detect Mywayyy, as all his IP's use 88.218.xxxx. Don't think that I revert and semiprotect out a love for Turkish names; if it was for me, Turkish mame should be in the lead only in Western Thrace, Rhodes and Kos, as only there can you find Turks, and I have difficulties understanding why we put all these Turkish mames, except for some sort of diplomatic reciprocity. You say they are socks of banned users; but I can't use my admin powers on simple suspects, and I have very little knowledge of editors active in Turkey related articles, so I can't use the tags I use for Mywayyy, i.e.socks of banned users. If you can identify a sock and the sockpuppetter with certainty, that's another story, I'll be happy to act. I'm read to help you as a simple editor, as I said, especially for keeping Greek names; for this you can always ask my help. As for being offline, if I had been online it wouldn't have changed much, because I'll tell you a secret&#160;;-), I don't have any Turkey-related articles on my watchlist, only ancient anatolian ones.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As i said before, i am not saying anything against u. believe me, not even once i thought that u discriminated greek articles in favour of the turkish ones. as for Mywayyy i had no idea that he is so easy to be detected, but i also know that articles can be protected when they are vandalized by IPs (or just registered users), regardless if they are sockpuppets or not. thanks for your help, i am sure i will need it;).

<dd>That IP is based in Ankara (this is no insinuation against our learned Turkish contributors, we all have our share of unhelpfull editors). But how can you tell the IP of a user who has a name, i.e. how can you tell that Mywayyy's IP is 88.218 etc...?

<dd>Oh, that's an easy one; Mywayyy's has often said, while entering with 88.218.xxxxx accounts, that he was Mywayyy, as is the case with 88.218.47.184 (<a href="../../../8/8/2E/User_talk%7E88.218.47.184.html" title="User talk:88.218.47.184">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.218.47.184_4106.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.218.47.184">contribs</a>); and obviously there's the contribution pattern, with his obsession against Turkish names. I also believe that the link between Mywayyy and 88.218.xxxx has been certified by checkuser. More important, until now, he has ALWAYS used for his IP's only 88.218.xxxx. This makes much easier identifying then, say, Bonaparte.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aldux, this is the message that I wrote about the city names to admin Bastique - "if Khoikhoi wants to display the former names of the cities, he should do it in the history section. When he places it in the introduction section, it makes a messy look. In addition, he displays the modern day Greek name in the introduction section which would not be appropriate. Because, if we display all of the foreign names (French, Italian, Korean, etc.), can you imagine how the introduction will look like&#160;:D So, in case of displaying foreign names of the cities, it would be more appropriate to create new pages. And, put the link to it in the 'See also' section." - Aldux, the users Khoikhoi, Hectorian and their gang are Anti-Turkish. They have updated the Turkish pages with misleading, pseudo information (This is not related with the city names issue, but wanted to give heads-up). And, when another user comes to the page, corrects the information with NPOV or asks for reference, the edit war breaks up. And, they find an admin to protect the page and blame the other with vandalization. As Jimmy Wales stated in one of his emails, if a reference is not provided for the displayed information on a request, it should be removed aggressively. <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" rel="nofollow">Jimmy's email</a> So..let's get back to the city names issue. I am sorry, but you are the fooled one in this case. They played you a little game. Before you, they asked Bastique to get it protected. It is not protected and they came to you. Ding Ding Ding, you are the winner!&#160;;) Btw, do not ask me to discuss with these Anti-Turkish people. There is no way to reach a common point with haters. The best solution for this issue will be to provide the above solution that I wrote to Bastique. Thanks. --Zeytin 02:03, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree I wont revert again unless a dispute resolution procedure starts. From my stance, I ll stick to whatever solution is finally presented. That is democracy after all. This should start immediately, let me know please. I believe this process should involve all the Greek islands of Eastern Aegean where this phenomenon is observed plus some cities such as Alexandroupoli, Serres, Kilkis etc. I would like to add a comment to <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a>. I dont think its proper, especially from an Admin to say things such as: 'Mywayyy should remain blocked cause he hasnt done a decent edit in his wikipedian life'. You should know better Aldux. And if you dont know let me tell you that i ve done edits (not so many by your standards but at least some..) regarding various topics and especially aviation topics since im an aerospace engineer and aviation is like my second nature.Mywayyy88.218.47.184 11:22, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, as I promised I'd advocate a lifting of his ban if he responded positively, I think we ought to give him a chance, and use the opportunity to set up a centralised discussion somewhere to solve the Greek and Turkish sides of the issue together. I'm also posting to FrancisTyers if you don't mind (as he first instigated the Mywayyy ban) - maybe the two of you could hammer out an arrangement, with whatever conditions on Mywayyy you see fit, and a plan to proceed for the dispute resolution?

<p>Aldux, the stuff you say about me, prove (apart from other things) that your judgement is not fair (the best word I can use). After the phrase <i>Mywayyy should remain blocked because he hasnt contributed anything worthy in his entire wikipedian life' now you add a new shameful phase: ' considering his hate of anything related to Turkey'. Aldux, I dont know you and you certainly dont know me, but i can assure you I absolutely dont hate Turkey or any other country. If you find something bad I ve writen about Turkey show it to all of us. In the meantime maybe you should ask yourself why you hate ME so much and why you say things that are not correct and more important things you cant prove.Mywayyy88.218.41.233 15:43, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't hate you; I'm only considerably annoyed by all the time I have to lose keeping an eye on socks of banned users. As fo "anything worthy in his entire wikipedian life" that was too strong I recognize it, but I've been keeping an eye on you since you've been banned, and since then I haven't seen all these fantastic edits, that, I confirm, will be reverted mercilessly, because, as a veteran admin told me, the only way sockpuppetters cease vandalising is when they see all their edits reverted. The word "hate" was deliberately strong; but certainly you are biased on the issue of Greek-Turkey relations, and seem to see Turkey like Reagan saw USSR in the 1980s, i.e. "the Great Satan". But the point is you can make the most fantastic edits in the world, this doesn't count, because you cannot edit, and till know have shown no intention of respection the rules; even when you just said that, you violated them by removing Turkish names by Greek islands and editing other articles.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No no, I agree with your revert, but what bothered me is that the reason you have is "because it is sourced".

<dd>Yeah, actually I concur with Macrakis here. No need to expose yourself to any later complaints about admin abuse. We can deal with it through a simple 3RR report if necessary, even if he should game the system in such a way as not to technically touch 3RR within 24h. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:29, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re. your question to Macrakis, apparently the blocking policy says that "sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute". Whether that counts for cases where you've only previously reverted in order to stop disruption seems a bit unclear, I've seen it interpreted that way, but I've also seen some of the rouger admins get away with blocking nevertheless. Anyway, I've now done a regular 3RR report - actually he had broken the rule already. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:25, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aldux. In a response to your message:<br />
QUOTE: <i>Comments like yours violate two fundamental principles of WP, that is WP:CIV and WP:NPA. You must understand this isn't a forum, and strict rules of civility must govern discussions</i></p>
<p>RE: I'm aware of that and I do apologize, but I really wonder why you don't point that out to these guys for example: <a href="../../../r/e/p/Talk%7ERepublic_of_Macedonia_Related_disputes_305e.html" title="Talk:Republic of Macedonia/Related disputes">Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia/Related_disputes</a>. doesn't look much as an 'academic debate' to me, but rather as a drunk party (most of it). So don't blame me, as a naive rookie I 'learn' from what I see.... I thought that first of all those 'veteran' members are supposed to obey the rules and to be sort of role-model for the newcomers such as myself, right?!</p>
<p>QUOTE: <i>Find good, reliable sources, possibly in English or French, if you wan't to be considered. As for giving importance to the positions of the Macedonians, do it; I've read that Hristo Tatarchev also wrote memoirs, it could be a useful source. And it's only an example.</i></p>
<p>RE:</p>
<p>1. I do agree with this, but first of all I suppose you have to 'practise what you preach'. Judging by some of your recent changes to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Struggle_for_Macedonia_0d40.html" title="Greek Struggle for Macedonia">Greek Struggle for Macedonia</a> by putting back some of the stuff that I removed as unveryfied, you haven't provided sources to justify your changes neither (for example: you still stick to the unveryfied claims that those greek armed groups 'fought the Turkish army', which the ideological 'father' of that greek struggle for macedonia germanos Karavangelis himself denies in his own book telling openly how well they've collaborated&#160;:)ok there were two accidental irrelevant skirmishes between them with 1-2 dead but the struggle itself was as i wrote primarily against VMRO, which was the only force completely dedicated to fight the ottoman authorities at that time (I mean Ilinden Uprising, The Krushevo republic, the bomb attacks in Thessaloniki and so on and so on,what more would one want? Even Karavangelis himself admits that VMRO were 'masters on the terrain' in his beginnings in Macedonia). You don't provide any record of any significant battle, operation, diversion etc. of the greek forces against the ottoman authorities in THAT particular conflict (except when Turks shot Pavlos melas by mistake being intentionally misinformed that he is Mitre the Vlah from Konomladi..well, if that can be called "struggle against the Ottomans")</p>
<p>2. Now this is quite questionable: First, what is actually a "good" and "reliable" source? In problematic case with topics such as Macedonia, where there is a pro-greek and pro-macedonian (fyrom) POV, do you really think that quoting lets say a british source will neceserily keep the article unbiased, because a third-party "neutral observer" was cited?</p>
<p>Also should all non-english or non-french sources be disregarded? Wikipedia says: QUOTE: <i>However, do give references in other languages where appropriate. If quoting from a different language source, an English translation should be given with the original-language quote beside it.</i>. BTW, <b>in accordance to these rules</b>, I have suggested some books and stuff as a veryfible source on the subject: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Slavic_toponyms_for_Greek_places#Verification.2C_sources.2C_corrections.2C_explanations.2C_recommended_reading_etc." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Slavic_toponyms_for_Greek_places#Verification.2C_sources.2C_corrections.2C_explanations.2C_recommended_reading_etc." rel="nofollow">HERE</a><br />
But now another problem, some members have doubts whether it is reliable obviously because among other things the books are published in Skopje and thus there's a concern that the book may be biased. You can see the posted quote from a review of that book published on a Greek website. Why should sources published in Skopje always be dubious and questioned just because they r not in accordance with the greek pov and why should a review on some greek website be a good enough reason for suspicion? However, I also received questions concerning the academic credibility of the author, the sources used in the book which is of course OK, but scepticism towards the reliability of the book based on nationalistic prejudice and probably biased reviews? At the same time, the tourist map that i suggested as a source and which is <b>published in Greece</b> was not questioned&#160;:) Double standards?<br />
Also,related to this subject, you mentioned Tatarchev from VMRO for example, actually I have the Memoirs of many of the VMRO leaders incl. him and I would gladly cite them, but all of them are published in Republic of Macedonia and not in english and thus their reliability may be again automatically questioned by the pro-greek and pro-bulgarian members.<br />
For all these reasons in the particular case of my additions in the article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Struggle_for_Macedonia_0d40.html" title="Greek Struggle for Macedonia">Greek Struggle for Macedonia</a> I've intentionally referenced a greek source with it's original greek title so I wouldn't be attacked by the pro-greek biased members for 'spreading <a href="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/A4.4.2.2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/A4.4.2.2.html" rel="nofollow">"Skopjan propagandha"</a>.

<p>Hello, I see that you've made some edits on Italian history articles, and I'm currently starting an Italian History task force (no page yet) at the Military History WikiProject. We need five or so editors to pledge support before we can actually begin, and I was hoping you could join. The project may or may not include Roman history, post your opinion on this topic at the military history talk page, (link straight to it below), and won't necessarily focus on "military" history specifically, but will likely have to pick articles that have some relation to some war, for instance we could edit <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Garibaldi_49eb.html" title="Giuseppe Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> but it'd be a little harder to really collaborate on one like <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Mazzini_d774.html" title="Giuseppe Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>. Anyways, if you have any questions post them on my talk page, or if you're ready to sign your support of the upcoming project, do so at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_4800.html#Italian_Military_History_Task_Force" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history">the military history talk page</a>.

<dd>Ciao again. Do you have by any chance any reference for the Ancient Macedonians' height? I'm sure I've heard it before that they were tall. Also, since I know you contributed to the etymology section in the region article, could you also cite the unatested 'bahuvrili' hypothesis please? <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">:N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>:</span></a> 08:59, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aldux, you may have already spent more time dealing with this than you wish, but I initiated a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation#Registered_users" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation#Registered_users" rel="nofollow">request for investigation</a> into <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECretanpride_4e69.html" title="User:Cretanpride">User:Cretanpride</a>'s editing a couple of days ago. No action has yet been taken. I think you're allowed to add your own comment if you wish.

<p>Thanks for the heads-up about Cretanpride and his socks, Aldux. I feel pretty abashed that I was fooled, but I suppose you're right that the article benefited. Do you think that 48 hours is a sufficient block for Cretanpride? I'd be inclined to block him for longer, but maybe that's just my bruised ego talking. I don't want to do it myself, since I've now become involved in editing the article. What do you think would be the best forum to get a broader discussion of this — AN/I or some page dealing specifically with sockpuppeteers? Sometimes it seems like Wikipedia's bureaucracy is growing faster than I can keep track of it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 20:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure whether I trust my own judgment after being duped by Cretanpride, so I won't alter the block either.

<p>Hi Aldux. Shall i rise some concerns on what is going on in that template? And perhaps about the article <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Greece_3d43.html" title="Ottoman Greece">Ottoman Greece</a>? I doubt if there is anyone who could say that Greece was not invaded and not occupied by the Ottomans... There are other examples as well. e.g. in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Iraq_15a5.html" title="History of Iraq">History of Iraq</a> u can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iraq#The_Turkish_Conquest" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iraq#The_Turkish_Conquest" rel="nofollow">this</a> along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iraq#Coalition_occupation_of_Iraq" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iraq#Coalition_occupation_of_Iraq" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.

I do not think it is historical to present it as if Greece was just an incorporated part of the Ottoman empire. since it was independent before (in the sense of the Byzantine Empire) and is independent after (in the sense Modern Greece), meanwhile it was occupied, right? --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 14:56, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello&#160;:)</p>
<p>You may remember me, I'm the guy that asked you about the milestones template. I have another question. I'm sure this is all explained on some page on Wikipedia, but I can't seem to find it. What's the difference between a user and an administrator? Can anyone become an administrator? If so, what is the criteria for becoming an administrator, and who makes the decision? If you could provide me a link to where all of this is explained, or just give me a short explination yourself, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Since I cannot log in I am obligated to write anonymously. There is a difference between using the same computer and being the same user. Cretanpride's IP addresses were blocked so he used my computer. We are not the same user. You should have been able to notice that, all the other users seem to have. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi. Charmed. I vote for Getica. It is short, simple, and known by everyone interested. The others are good too. I don't have to say, but I will, redirects from all possible variations make life easier on the Wikipedia researcher.

<p>Write. There might be a few obscure Getica's around and I bet there is a modern rock band or some other modern use of the title. Ah yes, I do a search under Google and I find Getica Software, Getica Tour Guides, and who knows what I else there is to find. So, maybe Getica (Jordanes) would be the best.

<dd>Sorry Asterion for awnsering so late. Personally I'd oppose putting the FEDOM number in the box, because it is a partisan source (in the most obvious sense of the world). Also, when we have official data, the rule observed in the boxs is to almost always put only that; while the sourced claims should be elsewhere in the article, probably in a Romanian diaspora section. To repeat myself in the box census and other official data, but partisan sources can be mentioned as pov's. When there are no census obviously, the box has to be filled with what can found; possibly independent esteems.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 21:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problem. I understand. I added the FEDOM figures as a footnote as for the USA entry, leaving only the 2006 <i>padrón</i> (local municipality census) numbers in the infobox. I hope this is OK, if not revert or edit out. Off to bed now.
