<dd>Considered a "Shining Star" of the Core Worlds, wild grasslands and old mountain ranges dominated the planet's surface. Ice-rimmed polar seas were the only large bodies of water, though thousands of freshwater and saltwater lakes provided habitats for a large variety of flora and fauna. Alderaan was also the home-world of some of the galaxy's most famous animals, such as the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatures_of_Star_Wars_a38e.html#Nerf" title="Creatures of Star Wars">nerf</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_creatures_6679.html#Thranta" title="List of Star Wars creatures">Thranta</a>. Cities of Alderaan were often built with great care taken to protect nature. One city was built on the walls of a canyon, nearly invisible from above. Other cities were built on stilts along the shoreline or under the polar ice. The capital, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cities_of_Star_Wars_74c4.html#Aldera" title="Cities of Star Wars">Aldera</a>, known for its university, was built on a small island in the center of a caldera.</dd>

<p>The Alderaanian people highly valued education, arts, architecture, poetry, the performing arts, and peaceful resolutions to conflicts.

<p>Though largely a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democratic society</a>, Alderaan was headed by a hereditary <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, with the Royal House of Organa presiding over the High Court and legislative High Council of Alderaan. Its monarchs have variously borne the titles "Prince", "First Chairman", and "Viceroy". Traditionally, the heir of the Alderaan throne also serves in the legislative High Council of Alderaan and a term as Senator of Alderaan. Bail Organa was the leader of Alderaan and was on the planet when it was destroyed, while his heir and (secretly adopted) daughter Princess Leia served as Senator of Alderaan in the Imperial Senate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/d/Alderaan.html" title="Edit section: History and destruction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History and destruction</span></h2>
<p>After the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>, Alderaan's massive war machine was dismantled and the weapons were placed aboard an armory warship called <i>Another Chance</i>. The ship was programmed to continually jump through hyperspace until called home by the Alderaanian Council.</p>
<p>Alderraan became home to the majority of the remaining Caamasi when their homeworld of Caamas was devastated by the Galactic Empire.{as told in <i>I, Jedi</i> by Micheal Stackpole)</p>
<p>Alderaan was the only planet to be destroyed by the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> in <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i> at <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Moff_Tarkin_aebb.html" title="Grand Moff Tarkin">Grand Moff Tarkin</a>'s order as a demonstration of its power to Princess Leia. (Despite her protests of Alderaan being a peaceful world with no weapons, the films novelization states that the planet had armaments as strong as any planet in the Empire.) Approximately 60,000 natives survived because they were off-world, and many of them relocated to the planet of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28M-N%29_a586.html#New_Alderaan" title="List of Star Wars planets (M-N)">New Alderaan</a>, hoping to recreate the beauty that had been Alderaan.</p>
<p>Alderaan was destroyed by order of Tarkin and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor Palpatine</a>. Tarkin felt the Rebels were growing bolder, and only a very public demonstration of the Death Star's power against a Rebel target would succeed in frightening the Alliance into submission. His argument convinced Palpatine anyway. So Palpatine approved in advance the destruction of the planet. Palpatine publicly adopted his benevolent persona, announcing that he was saddened by the loss of such a noble world, and adding that, had Alderaan entrusted itself to Imperial protection, it would still be thriving. In other words, the destruction of Alderaan might not have been necessary had <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail_Organa_60a4.html" title="Bail Organa">Bail Organa</a> simply bowed before the emperor. He then made an apparently magnanimous offer to resettle the sixty thousand surviving Alderaanians who were away when their homeworld was destroyed, on his "private resort world."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"These people have lost a homeworld through no fault of their own. Offering them a new homeworld is the least I can do to compensate them for their loss."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Exactly how many Alderaanian survivors took Palpatine up on his offer and moved to <a href="../../../b/y/s/Byss.html" title="Byss">Byss</a> is unknown. It may have been better for them to have died in the disaster, considering what really happened to those hopefuls who came to the Deep Core stronghold; many were simply rendered mindless slaves, going about their lives in a deadened bliss while Palpatine and his dark side servants fed from their life energies.</p>
<p>Some of Alderaan's survivors became the most dedicated soldiers of the Alliance, vowing never to let the Empire destroy another world. While some other of the Alderaanians survivors became supporters of the Empire, blaming the inept and traitorous Bail Organa and the rebellion for opposing the Emperor and thereby destroying everything they had, even their loved ones.</p>
<p>Survivors of Alderaan and their descendants practiced a ritual of "returning" to the Alderaan system. Returners would fill memorial capsules with gifts for departed relatives and friends and jettison them into the asteroid field (known as the Graveyard), which was all that remained of the planet after its destruction. Some survivors, such as Tycho Celchu had made known their desires to be buried amongst the remains of their former homeworld after their deaths.</p>
<p>With Alderaan destroyed, some council members led the people to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28M-N%29_a586.html#New_Alderaan" title="List of Star Wars planets (M-N)">New Alderaan</a>, which was founded after the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Civil_War_0a23.html" title="Galactic Civil War">Galactic Civil War</a> died down somewhat. The Royal House of Alderaan, in the person of Leia Organa-Solo and her children, continue to hold sovereignty of both New Alderaan and the Alderaan system. The government on New Alderaan administers both systems.</p>
