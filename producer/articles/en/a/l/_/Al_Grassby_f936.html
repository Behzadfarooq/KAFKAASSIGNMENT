<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Grassby_f936.html" title="Edit section: Political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
<p>Grassby won the rural electorate of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Riverina_20b2.html" title="Division of Riverina">Riverina</a> for the Labor Party at the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> federal election and following Gough Whitlam’s victory at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> election, he was appointed Minister for Immigration. In this role, Grassby quickly became one of the more high profile members of the Whitlam ministry as he gained a reputation as a one person propaganda unit for the benefits of multiculturalism and, among other initiatives, pushed for more immigration from non-English-speaking countries, banned racially selected sporting teams from playing in Australia and repealed the law that required <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> to seek permission before going overseas.</p>
<p>In addition to his high profile crusade for multiculturalism, Grassby also gained wide attention for his flamboyant dress sense; his colourful ties and suits setting him apart from the unwritten dress code for politicians of sombre dark suits and plain ties.</p>
<p>As the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australia_Policy_da7a.html" title="White Australia Policy">White Australia Policy</a> had only been formally revoked less than a decade previously, Grassby’s actions provoked disquiet among sections of the Australian community, including in his Riverina electorate and some of his ALP colleagues, who thought his reforms too radical for the period, but Grassby could point to his enormous popularity within multicultural Australia and the subsequent growth of support for the ALP from this section of the community as more than adequate recompense for any possible loss of support from white Australia.</p>
<p>Grassby’s actions attracted criticism from anti-immigration groups, led by the Immigration Control Association, which targeted his electorate in a campaign at the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_general_election%2C_1974.html" title="Australian general election, 1974">May 1974 election</a>. Partly as a result, Grassby was defeated by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Party</a> candidate, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sullivan_%28Australian_politician%29_5523.html" title="John Sullivan (Australian politician)">John Sullivan</a>. Grassby and his supporters accused these groups of mounting a racist smear campaign against him.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Grassby_f936.html" title="Edit section: Comission for Community Relations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comission for Community Relations</span></h2>
<p>Following his defeat, Grassby was appointed as the first Commissioner for Community Relations, administering the Racial Discrimination Act <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> that he had championed while in parliament. While he continued to work towards a multicultural Australia, Grassby couldn’t escape controversy. In one case, Grassby nominated for preselection for the safe federal Labor seat of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Parramatta_58ea.html" title="Division of Parramatta">Parramatta</a> following encouragement from Gough Whitlam, who sought to return Grassby to the ministry. However, Grassby surprisingly lost the preselection ballot as many rank and file Labor members objected to an outside candidate being foisted upon them.</p>
<p>In another case, he became entangled in one of the more sensational political cases of Australian history when he hired <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junie_Morosi_cac6.html" title="Junie Morosi">Junie Morosi</a> to work at the Commission for Community Relations, which brought her into contact with a number of government ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Cairns_20dd.html" title="Jim Cairns">Jim Cairns</a>. Cairns appointed Morosi as his Principal Private Secretary, a job traditionally held by a senior public servant. The ensuing controversy surrounding the appointment led to the downfall of Cairns and while Grassby was not guilty of any misconduct himself, he attracted criticism by his connection to the case.</p>

<p>Grassby published a number of books, including a biography of early Australian Prime Minister <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Watson_a45c.html" title="Chris Watson">Chris Watson</a> and various studies of multiculturalism in Australia. In recognition of his pioneering work on immigration, Grassby received the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Australia_61eb.html" title="Order of Australia">Order of Australia</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> Peace Medal in 1986.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> Grassby was charged with <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">criminal defamation</a> when it was alleged that he had asked a New South Wales state politician, Michael Maher, to read in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Assembly_3aa3.html" title="New South Wales Legislative Assembly">New South Wales Legislative Assembly</a> a document that imputed that Barbara Mackay and her family solicitor were responsible for the disappearance (and probable murder) of her husband <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Mackay_19ca.html" title="Donald Mackay">Donald Mackay</a>, a prominent Riverina businessman who had been a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> candidate against Grassby in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. Grassby maintained his innocence and fought a twelve year battle in the courts before he was eventually acquitted on appeal in August <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. He was awarded $180,000 in costs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Grassby_f936.html" title="Edit section: Death and subsequent media reports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death and subsequent media reports</span></h2>
<p>Grassby died on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_23.html" title="April 23">April 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, two days after suffering a heart attack, after several months' pneumonia. He was survived by his wife Ellnor Grassby and his daughter Gabriella Davis.</p>
<p>After Grassby's death renewed attacks were made on his reputation, particularly in relation to his alleged links with the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calabria.html" title="Calabria">Calabrian</a> <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griffith%2C_New_South_Wales_7623.html" title="Griffith, New South Wales">Griffith</a> and to the events surrounding the disappearance and probable murder of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Mackay_19ca.html" title="Donald Mackay">Donald Mackay</a>. Beginning on 9 May 2005, the Melbourne <i><a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_Sun_1ee3.html" title="Herald Sun">Herald Sun</a></i> ran a series of articles alleging that Grassby used his influence to thwart a National Crime Authority investigation into the Mafia, and to "let mafia criminals into Australia," and that he was "paid to do the mafia's bidding," including receiving a $40,000 payment from the Griffith Mafia to smear Barbara Mackay.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Grassby had maintained a "double life" with his wife of forty three years, Mrs Ellnor Grassby and his mistress of twenty five years Ms Angela Chan. His wife Ellnor, although admitting that Grassby was a "ladies man" denies any knowledge of a continual relationship with Chan.</p>
<p>A recent decision by the ACT <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Stanhope_d04b.html" title="Jon Stanhope">Jon Stanhope</a> Labor Government to erect a statue of Al Grassby in Canberra has been the subject of much controversy.</p>
