<p>I have merged it into Al Yamamah - there is no need at all for a seperate article. The SFO investigation was about Al Yamamah, so why would a distinct page be required? I'm not happy about the way the information was removed, if there was a valid reason, no problem. However I expect to see that valid reason in an edit summary. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 16:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also what is replaced by is unsatisfactory, "This deal was reported to be under threat unless the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Fraud_Office_investigation_into_the_Al_Yamamah_corruption_allegations_cb3b.html" title="Serious Fraud Office investigation into the Al Yamamah corruption allegations">Serious Fraud Office investigation into the Al Yamamah corruption allegations</a> was discontinued. This investigation was discontinued on the 14th of december 2006." That clearly suggests that it's quid pro quo - My paragraph presents all the (cited) information and allows the reader to make the judgement. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 17:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Err... That was me. It's an ongoing and really quite long-running saga (ie since 2001) that I really thought warranted a page on its own. The December 2006 incident is part of the story, but gets nowhere near to the bottom of it. I had imagined it that it was very obvious we needed a single place for all the multiple articles which concerned it (<a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurofighter.html" title="Eurofighter">Eurofighter</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Yamamah_5781.html" title="Al Yamamah">Al Yamamah</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Fraud_Office_ae31.html" title="Serious Fraud Office">Serious Fraud Office</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/e/BAE_c791.html" title="BAE">BAE</a>), because the story didn't belong to any of them; it belongs to all of them. It certainly doesn't belong on the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Yamamah_5781.html" title="Al Yamamah">Al Yamamah</a> page, because that's really just an old 1980s contract who's investigation is affecting arms corruption as it is happening today. Clearly the case wasn't quite as obvious as I had imagined. I have no idea how to ressurect the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Fraud_Office_investigation_into_the_Al_Yamamah_corruption_allegations_cb3b.html" title="Serious Fraud Office investigation into the Al Yamamah corruption allegations">Serious Fraud Office investigation into the Al Yamamah corruption allegations</a> page, so I'll let you do it if you can. I suspect it needs a <i>CurrentEvent</i> tag at the top because there will be a lot of statements and leaks about it in the coming weeks.<a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatchurch_66eb.html" title="User:Goatchurch">Goatchurch</a> 18:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. "It certainly doesn't belong on the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Yamamah_5781.html" title="Al Yamamah">Al Yamamah</a>"?? The investigation <i>was into Al Yamamah</i>. The Al Yamamah contracts were not just contracts for a few planes, they were contracts for enduring support of Saudi defence capabilites. Al Yamamah is a blanket term for BAE operations in Saudi Arabia to this day (see <a href="http://www.projectay.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.projectay.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.projectay.co.uk/</a>). If the investigation had nothing to do with Al Yamamah why was the SFO seeking the NAO report on it and why has every major news source described it as an invesigation into it? The SFO investigation <i>does</i> belong at that page with summaries at each of the other articles. The only way I would support separating the info again is if you can provide some rationale or explanation as to how the SFO inquiry was somehow detached from Al Yamamah. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 18:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure. Whatever. I mean, corporate chronology on these matters can be pretty difficult. It never fits any pattern, and is often deliberately obscure. But clearly Eurofighters weren't even invented at the time the Thatcher government was doing all those deals. It's a bit like Rocky III, Rocky IV; they're actually different movies from Rocky (which wasn't 'I'), where they've copied the plot, brought back the same stars, but they weren't really envisaged as part of the original movie. They came later when the Hollywood executives found they could build a franchise. Anyways, there's quite a discussion about the original contracts in the book <i>Armour-Plated Ostrich</i>, which maybe I'll reread and put in some material from at some point. (Referring to the Mark Thatcher connection, Tim Webb reported that the deal was sometimes known in the trade as "Who's Ya Mama".) You didn't quite get my point. I didn't say the investigation has nothing to do with Al Yamamah. I merely said that this was a separate story in of itself. Kind of like how Al Fayed's campaign to investigate Diana's car crash isn't really part of the story of her life. Anyway, it's just a matter of opinion, and I don't care very deeply. Of course places that link to this story should carry a summary of it -- once we know what exactly should be summarized. I don't want people to miss the 10 day ultimatum that came two weeks ago, and precipitated this announcement. It's unfortunate that the linking to subsections of a wiki page is such a nuisance. Did you like any of the stuff I added?<a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatchurch_66eb.html" title="User:Goatchurch">Goatchurch</a> 20:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Forgive me, that should have been the first thing I said. A lot of the stuff was great, particularly the Radio 4 programme info. which provided some concrete allegations rather than just a general term of "corruption". Well I respect your decision and we'll just have to agree to disagree. You're right, I didn't get your point, sorry. My thinking is that the investigation (and corruption allegations) is integral to the Al Yamamah article - which is why I made a subsection in the article. I don't think the information is any less useful just because it doesn't have it's own article.</dd>
<dd>As for Mark Thatcher, I read a newspaper article recently which claimed it was rubbish to suggest that he had any influence, i.e. that Thatcher was intent on the deal for the economic benefit and that the Saudis mistakenly believed her son needed buttering up. Sorry I don't have a reference, I'll need to find it again. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 21:12, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can believe that the Mark Thatcher connection was spurious. But with bribes flying all over the place, people living "way beyond the life style of most film stars", all kinds of stuff happen, and none of it can be planned. It was an exciting time. It's ultimately about the oil and the money, of course. Maybe this section could be moved to the bottom of the article, and you can have a clear time-line breakdown of the different episodes in this contract at the top (which I know little about, but do know they were negotiated by different governments), so it's not this great big blob in the middle. I still think it's less useful as a section than its own article, for technical reasons that it can be better tagged and more easily linked to from, say, the page on the Serious Fraud Office (which didn't exist for the duration of most of this contract). So long as the information is there, it can be moved around later.<a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatchurch_66eb.html" title="User:Goatchurch">Goatchurch</a> 22:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had actually wondered about the formatting. You make a good point, to show my good faith (i.e. I'm not being intransigent) I have moved the section to the bottom of the article and I will try to work on a timeline. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 23:06, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is a bit weak on information about the gear that was actually delivered, where it's based, and what it actually does. Do they simply patrol the borders of Saudi Arabia with these jets once a day, or what? How does it fit into the context of Saudi Arabia's defence needs? Surely someone somewhere has an interest in this sort of thing. The story can't all be about corruption payments, much as this interests me. <a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatchurch_66eb.html" title="User:Goatchurch">Goatchurch</a> 18:26, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
