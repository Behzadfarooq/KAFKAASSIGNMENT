<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a>. Three paragraphs about this kid, one about a car accident and two about a marijuana arrest. If this is all we can come up with, then delete. It seems to me like it's more an attempt at smearing his father. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 04:28, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't you have privacy laws in the US? Gore 3 is a private citizen and his misdemeanors are not the public's business. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:07, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not that I know of: in fact we have freedom of speech and freedom of information laws stating the exact opposite. Since he appeared in open court, the information is a matter of public record. That said, I make no vote on whether this article should appear, but if not, it should be based on Wikipedia deciding he is not worthy of an article, not based on privacy concerns, since what he did was fully public. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 06:19, Dec 21, 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Do we have articles on Bush's daughters who I believe have also been in court on minor charges? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:35, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)

<li>We do. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_and_Jenna_Bush_e836.html" title="Barbara and Jenna Bush">Barbara and Jenna Bush</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximus_Rex_f7db.html" title="User:Maximus Rex">Maximus Rex</a> 06:38, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well I would delete that article as well. I am opposed to having articles on private citizens whose only source of interest is that they have the misfortune to be related to someone famous, and particularly the children of the famous. This is just voyeurism and serves no legitimate purpose. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:45, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not voting either to keep or delete, but to answer Adam. The only possible legitimate purpose I can see is as a test of the hypocrisy of the parents. These are people who advocate draconian punishments for using harmless drugs that ruin far more lives than the drugs themselves. If Gore or Bush were to advocate the same punishments for their children that they advocate for our children, I would vote to delete. <a href="../../../m/c/a/User%7EMcarling_0ae7.html" title="User:Mcarling">Mcarling</a> 10:40, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The place to say that is under Bush article, as in "Bush advocated the death penalty for littering, but when his daughter was arrested for littering he made excuses for her," (or whatever). It doesn't mean that the daughter deserves an article to catalogue her misdemeanors. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:16, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>KEEP. We also have <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Clinton_376a.html" title="Chelsea Clinton">Chelsea Clinton</a>. Many wikipedia biographies are on non-government officials. I don't see a reason to delete, <s>but I'm not in full support of keeping</s>. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 09:30, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. He is historically significant because of the 1992 Dem. Convention, which I added. I changed the article to remove the arrest record, which is of dubious historic importance. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 09:38, Dec 21, 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Chelsea Clinton is a public person in her own right and by her own choice. I am not aware that Gore III or the Bush daughters have done anything in their own right. Besides which Chelsea doesn't have any misdemeanors that I am aware of, so an article on her isn't just a vehicle for attacking her father, as Mcarling admits he sees the Bush daughters article as being. And what did Gore III do at the 1992 Convention, when he would have been ten years old? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:42, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Redirect. It's interesting that his accident affected the Democratic primaries, but that's more about Al Jr. than Al III. I've merged it into <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> and I vote to make this a redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> (note that <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> deprecates "merge and delete"). <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> 16:35, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Move relevant into into <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> but keep as redir. Could become an article if he ever does something meaningful besides smoking pot.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a>
<ul>
<li>The classic Wikipedia double standard the private life of a child of a former Dem US Vice President one time perhaps future presidential candidate not worthy but of course it worthy for the current US Gop president. This group sure make sense.
<ul>
<li>Where do you gather that from (the double standard)? <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_saltine_d8c0.html" title="User:Evil saltine">Evil saltine</a> 19:24, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not the individual who posted about the double standard, however if you look at page history someone removed all negative content from the Gore child article while similar content is still the focus of the Bush child article. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximus_Rex_f7db.html" title="User:Maximus Rex">Maximus Rex</a> 21:09, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you don't think this group makes sense, perhaps you should leave it to those of us who think it does. I note you are using the 64.12.97.6 IP address. Might you perhaps be the same person who vandalized <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Levesque_0190.html" title="Paul Levesque">Paul Levesque</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_kiddie.html" title="Script kiddie">Script kiddie</a>? Might you now be trying to generate strife? As for your so-called double standard, the children of a sitting president are more notable than the child of a former vice-president, and there is more material in the Bush article than there ever was in the Gore one. <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> 00:26, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete both the Gore III and Bush twins articles. I don't see why it's a big deal, or even newsworthy, that Gore's son was arrested for marijuana, and I don't think we should focus on the misdemeanors of Bush's daughters if we want to attack him, we should focus on his incompetence as President. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 21:27, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're thinking too much. The article is not intended as an attack, only a statement of what we know. What you think is newsworthy is your mere opinion. What the media thinks is fact. Due the the media, this individual and the Bush daughters are not obsucre people like the 9/11 victims, and therefore deserve enclyclopedia articles. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 21:57, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>

<p>Looking over the old VFD debate above, I find the keep votes unconvincing. The other children of political figures mentioned (Chelsea Clinton, Bush's daughters) are public figures -- they've given interviews, made public statements, etc. Has Gore III ever even answered a reporter's question? While it makes sense to me that a politician's son or daughter would be a lot more <i>likely</i> to warrant an encyclopedia article, I don't think it's automatic. His father has talked about him in public, but it seems to me that that information is more appropriate on his father's article (where it already is, of course). --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 23:58, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. The children of famous people are not automatically worth an article on their own, and this is a prime case in point. The only reason for including this is that it (somewhat) reflects on the father, so why not put it where it is relevant. Those who think that is important information that might be deleted by partisans can watch one article as easily as two. In a few years, if AG3 does something worthy of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the redirect can be broken out into a separate article again. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:55, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strong disagreement</b>. As this article has been subjected to a near-continuous stream of AfDs lately, to the point where the last one was closed down almost immediately as an abuse of process, I can only see any merger as a continuation of that abuse of process. After all, once the material from this article is merged into <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a>, those hellbent on deletion will be able to slowly whittle it down to nothing, which is exactly what they wanted from their nonstop AfDs.

After the 30 days are up, any attempt to turn it into a redirect without a full merge discussion <i>from a fresh start</i> will result in me restoring the article and immediately bringing it up for another full AfD.

<dd>From a process perspective, "merge" is an ordinary editing decision that is distinct from AFD.

The vast majority of merges have nothing to do with AFD, and can be done <b>boldly</b> by any editor.

<dd>You stated that Radiant's merger proposal was a "Continuation of that abuse of process." I hope that someday you will explain to me how abuse of process is not an accusation. You <i>are</i> explicit that merging the information and converting this page into a redirect will somehow allow unspecified minions to remove the information, despite the undoubted vigilence of dozens of Gore-haters who watch every page associated with him. That seems less likely than someone's filling this page with AG3's trivial accomplishments to provide "balance." After all, one cannot have it both ways: AFD has overridden WP:BIO in this instance, and making the debate team seems hardly less trivial than the information already here.</dd>

<dd>No one (in this discussion at least) proposes to excise the information from Wikipedia: that issue has been settled. The information is verifiable, certainly. The remaining question is where should this information reside to have the best encyclopedia? So, let's ask ourselves: Why do we have an article on Al Gore III and none on the thousands of others who have similar records? Answer: Because he is the son of someone famous. As far as I am concerned, all such information belongs in the article on the famous parent, and we can redirect. I see no difference between Al Gore III and Natalie Cantor Metzger in this respect. If he becomes notable on his own, the existing information will need to be completely reworked into the expanded article anyway. Odds are it will be trivia at that point. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 16:48, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong disagreement with merge</b>. I've been watching the continuous stream of AfD nominations on this article, and I agree that the rapid merge proposal, though it *might* be a good faith nomination, does have the appearance of being nothing more than a continuation of the campaign to circumvent process and get this article deleted. To be honest, it appears that there's an agenda here, possibly even with political motivations (getting rid of an "inconvenient" negative article). In my view, Al Gore III passes notability requirements, and the article is appropriate. I <i>would</i>, however, like to see a more positive picture of him, because the current one is negative, and implies that the subject is a criminal. A more pleasant picture (if one can be found or provided) might make the article less objectionable. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>There is no rational basis to suspect Radiant or me of continuing an agenda when neither of us participated in the AFD. You might have noticed that Radiant proposed a merge compromise on another DRV (P-P-P-Powerbook) that was listed on the same day as this one, and that I was concerned in the same DRV. I have also merged other articles about the children of famous people (e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Cantor_Metzger_b644.html" title="Natalie Cantor Metzger">Natalie Cantor Metzger</a>) so it is hardly fair to suggest that I have specific motives here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You are correct that the article poses an NPOV problem, and this is one of the reasons that I think it should be merged. Much of the support for this article comes from editors with political motives, which is just as deplorable as wanting to delete it for political reasons. In effect, there is no non-political decision that we can make here. I do note, however, that isolating the material here tends to make it less prominent, not more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I am sure that there are several positive things to be said about Al Gore III, but few (if any) are likely to be verifiable, nor is a list of his varsity letters likely to make gripping reading. Unlike the Bush daughters, he didn't make speeches or help in the campaign. This is one of the problems with overriding WP:BIO for relatives of famous people. There isn't much to say about them except the (nearly always embarrassing) events that got them briefly in the press. As a result a young person with a kid's problem looks like a criminal, which is probably a distorted view of the individual.</li>

<dd>I see things exactly opposite to David Foster, above. If this were about Al Jones III, the article would have been deleted long ago. Even if the guy had been used as an example of a kid-from-a-good-family-gone-wrong on some TV program, that would not be viewed as providing enough notability. It is only the relation to his father, and the accompanying imputation of fault, that renders this guy even remotely notable.

Specifically living non-public figures are entitled to a degree of privacy far more stringent than for public figures such as Al Gore Jr. Under a strict reading of the policy none of Gore III's arrests should be mentioned in this article as none are directly related to his notability, i.e. Gore III is not notable because of his arrests. I'm letting the pot arrest stay for now, as there was significant media coverage and it was an actual conviction (i.e. not just an arrest), but it may need to be removed at some point as well. Please respect this action as Jimbo is very adament on this policy and will lock an article indefinitely if problems of this nature are persistant. As Jimbo has said, "Real people are involved, and they can be hurt by your words. We are not tabloid journalism, we are an encyclopedia."

<dd>The only reason we heard about these arrests was because of his father's fame. If he'd been your son or mine, it wouldn't have appeared on the news. On the other side, the same argument could be made about the Bush twins. I'd barely know that George W. Bush had daughters except for their frequent (and well documented) underage drinking sprees (and the partisan clamor that followed each such news mention). Yet on their WP pages, only the arrests with convictions (or nolo pleas) are listed. If every child of a politician got tabloid coverage, nobody with children would ever go into politics. Zero reason WP needs that bad karma. See <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Walters_35b3.html" title="David Walters">David Walters</a> for worst case scenario.

The son a fomer Vice-President with a propensity to run his car fast, with alcohol in his system, is a notable story by itself, but now that Gore Senior has decided to make a book, movie and magazine and his son is going to play a role in all of these things the question of whether little Al Gore is notable is foregone conclusion.

<dd>Whoa!!! You did not respond to barely anything that I stated. You only responded to the part that allowed you to use the word, non-sequiter. How impressive! Gore Junior's article will stay. I will repeat for your edification the real reason, not the one that you unsuccessfully attempted turn this into. I will go over it slow. (1) Gore Junior is the son of a former Vice President of the United States. That alone almost gets him to notability. (2) Gore Junior is NOT a quiet titmouse son of a former Vice President, but he has a personality where he has a tendency to fill his circulatory system with large amounts of alcohol and then drive a car at a high rate of speed, above legal limits. This characteristic probably gets him to notability level. But we will continue the analysis. (3) Gore Senior is engaged in a campaign where he is attempting to clean up his public image--either for a Presidential run in 2008 or just to clean up his image for history purposes. Now, in this PR campaign by Gore Senior there are various references to Gore Junior, bringing Gore Junior into the public limelight for reasons other than just being a reckless driving son of a former Vice President. If Gore Junior wants to stay out of Wikipedia and other public limelight situations then he needs to stop driving his car recklessly and he needs to stop working for high visibility political magazines or being referred to in movies that are starring his more famous father. So there you have it. The recent jump in Gore Junior's appearances in the public arena have put a nail in the coffin in the attempt to kill the Gore Junion Wikipedia article. Sorry that I ripped your non-sequiter argument to shreads, but you made it just too easy for me.

All of Gore's children are probably "notable", but I would say only Karenna would qualify as a "public figure", and even then, just barely. Anyone who is notable can have a Wikipedia article, but non-public figures are entitled to a certain degree of privacy regarding their personal lives. How much privacy is arguably a function of how close they come to being a "public figure". Clearly some of Gore III's life involves the public arena, but compared to Karenna (or the Bush sisters) it is only a very small fraction. Indeed Gore III seems to have no interest whatsoever in being in the public limelight. Considering the power we weild to affect people's lives and reputations, it is important for us to respect that. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 00:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the article stays. Gore Junior is making decision today that nullifies your arguments that MIGHT have been true a few years ago, but Gore Junior's actions have put him the public arena and he is notable. You are attempting to split hairs, but it will not work. Also, how do you know that Gore Junior "seems to have no interest whatsoever in being in the public limelight"? Can you read his mind? You don't know. Admit it you don't know. All we have to go on is his actions and he now making choices that put him in the limelight: driving a car at a great deal of speed with alcohol in his system? That makes you think that Gore Junior "seems to have no interest" in the public limelight??? Yeah, right! Did somebody make Gore Junior do that? No. He made a decision, a decision that public him the public spotlight. You are arguing that you KNOW what Junior thinks! How <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludacris.html" title="Ludacris">ludicrious</a>! You want me to respect his desire to stay out of the limelight, correct? That's what you stated. So, how do you know that is his desire? He is call you? Do you know him personally. If so, you did not point that out. What you stated was that you personally believe, based upon what I dod not know, that it "seems" to you that "Gore III" has "no interest" in the "public limelight". Prove it. Show me how you know this.

<dd>When users are referring to the subject of the article as Gore Jr, and belaboring a conversation largely conceded, these are what I refer to as "bordering on troll-like behavior". I can certainly assume good faith while describing potential POV and other violations, but demonstrated patterns of behavior here in this discussion edge close to troll-like behavior. That's hardly a controversial assessment. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 03:13, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

But just because I stated an opinion that you did not like does not make it "troll-like" behavior. As a matter of fact, your comments are a personal attack and that is against Wikipedia policy.

<p>(outdenting) I've never said that Gore III should not have an article, nor have I ever said he was not notable. I don't have to read Gore III's mind to know he is not a public figure. He is not involved in politics or entertainment, not is he especially famous. He has never tried to enter politics or entertainment, nor has he tried to gain fame or even have a presence in the public (obviously it would be rather easy for him to do so if he wanted to). The fact is Gore III is not a public figure and therefore we must follow the appropriate procedures and respect his privacy to a reasonable degree. You can take my word for it, or your can ask Danny, Brad Patrick, or Jimbo as they are very sensitive to this issue. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 02:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. You are incorrect. Gore Junior is a public figure. Every where that I turn I read an article about Gore Junior. Gore Senior refers to him in movies. And now Gore Junior is getting involved in a very public part of the public arena, a magazine. He has stepped out on the stage. Also, you state, "The fact is Gore III is not a public figure" as if you are the arbitor of what is a fact and what is not a fact. That is comment is not a fact, but your opinion. Gore Junior has made decisions, not healthy ones, to get a snoot full and drive a car at fast speed which brings him into the public eye. What a cry for attention. He is making clear choices to step in the limelight for example the magazine and the references in the his father's movies, but he is also making bad choices that bring him into the public also.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 03:28, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I'm sure Gore III begged his father to be mentioned in the movie, decided that he still wasn't famous enough so he needed to get arrested for drinking and driving, and is now hoping against hope that he will go down in history as the most drug-addled, irresponsible son of a vice president in history. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 03:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>[edit conflict] Getaway, you earlier criticized Kaldari for allegedly trying to read Gore III's mind. Please stick to your own advice. You don't know whether Gore's actions constitute a cry for attention. Also, please edit your earlier comments to refer to the subject of the article by his name, Al Gore III (or Gore III, or Gore, for short). He is not Gore Junior, and he certainly isn't [derogatory nickname removed].

<ul>
<li>A few points in response:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>No reputable encyclopedia would refer to Gore III as Gore Junior.</li>
<li>JFK, Jr. was the son of a president, not a vice-president.</li>
<li>JFK, Jr. was the founder of his magazine, while the magazine with whigh Gore III is involved was founded by Ben Goldhirsh.<a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/about" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goodmagazine.com/about" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Gore III does not have a particularly prominent role in the enterprise.</li>
<li>JFK, Jr.'s magazine (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_%28magazine%29.html" title="George (magazine)">George</a>) had at one point the highest circulation of any political magazine in America. <i>Good</i> magazine is nowhere near that notable. It just published its first issue, and even by their own account has slightly under 8,000 subscribers.</li>
</ol>
<p>As such, your comparison is deeply flawed. Your tone isn't particularly helpful, either. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 16:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are right, your tone isn't particularly helpful. Next, you made some very small, insignificant observations. The article on little Gore will stay: (1) he is the son of former Vice President, who looks like he is running again, (2) he had a propensity to drink too much alcohol and then get behind the wheel of car and then drive the car at great deal of speed, endangering his life and the lives of others, and (3) he is the associate publisher of a political magazine that is going to making comments on public figures and his father will be one of the guiding hands behind the editorial policy of the magazine. See the New York Observer article. Little Gore is a public figure (for good or bad) and he is notable. Wikipedia case closed. Have a good day and work on that tone of yours. It isn't helpful.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 18:20, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I ask you once again to adopt a more reasonable tone; if you continue to avoid doing so, people are likely to discount your opinions out of hand. Replying to your points in order: 1) Gore II has given no official indication that he plans to run again; in fact, all of his on-the-record comments have indicated the opposite, and unsourced speculation doesn't belong in Wikipedia. Furthermore, Gore II's hypothetical actions are completely irrelevant here. If Gore III were planning to run for president, <i>that</i> would be worth noting. 2) There's nothing in the article about drunk driving, and even if there were, why would that affect notability? There are thousands of people arrested every year for driving drunk. 3) At present, the magazine is non-notable, and lots of non-notable publications "make comments on public figures". As was the case with your first point, if Gore II is involved with the magazine (something that's not mentioned at all in the Observer article you cite), that's something that belongs in the article on Gore II, not here. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 19:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What a faulty analysis. This analysis is enlightening for how it points out the inconsistencies through Wikipedia, but it there is not one person there who has the driving record of little Gore and you left George H.W. Bush out of your list entirely. It is a grand list of information that makes a statment about Wikipedia, but it does not speak to little Gore at all. What it does show is that more recent politicians get more thorough coverage by Wikipedia than politician that served at a greater distance in the past. But of course that observation has really very little to do with the current discussion.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 18:28, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I left George H.W. Bush out of the list because I was using only vice-presidents who did not subsequently become president (that's the same reason I skipped Gerald Ford, LBJ, and Nixon) and if you were paying attention I noted this as a source of potential selection bias in the post immediately preceding this one. Your point about more recent politicians is also inapplicable, since I deliberately restricted it to the most recent Vice Presidents for exactly that reason. As for the driving thing, it's impractical to suggest that we create a standalone article for every non-notable person who's involved in a car accident. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 19:14, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "missing" articles would almost certainly be put up for AFD, no matter what their contents, and they shouldn't survive. Articles on the children of famous entertainers – personalities probably more well known than half of the Vice Presidents listed above – are routinely deleted on this basis. There just isn't enough for an interesting and well-rounded article. The child may have been trotted out on stage once or twice, or been the subject of a custody battle, but unless the case was precedent-setting or the child does something notable on his or her own, there is little point. Whether free publicity for a would-be entertainer or a plague to a would-be private citizen, such articles should have no place in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You make an interesting but strange analogy, but unfortunately it is just a strawman argument that is not convincing. You know and I know that I was not referring to "your left foot". We know exactly what I WAS referring to which of course is the list of children of Vice Presidents. So your commentary was as dismissive as a Robert West's comment. You don't know and West does not know if there are notable articles there or not. But once again, I am glad that you and West are making these comments because it shows how determined you both are to get this particular article about Gore III removed from Wikipedia--even though your arguments have not been convincing. We will go over it again: (1) son of a former VP, a VP who is still active in politics,</dd>
<dd>(2) a son of a VP that has a long history of reckless driving,</dd>
<dd>(3) a son of a VP that has an alcohol problem,</dd>
<dd>(4) a son of a VP with a substance abuse problem,</dd>
<dd>(5) a son of a VP that is mentioned over and over again by the former VP, Al Gore (the parent), in books, movies, speeches (DNC convention, for example) etc.,</dd>
<dd>(6) a son of a VP that has recently started work as an associate publisher of a political magazine and the son's name is actively being used to promote and sell the magazine (e.g., the New York Observer just happen to drop his name in the article), and</dd>
<dd>(7) a son of a VP who is publishing a political magazine that will be a mouthpiece for the opinions of his famous father, who is still very, very active in politics, and</dd>
<dd>(8) a son of VP that has been the focus of a debate about whether his driving, alcohol, and substance abuse problems are getting very little coverage in the mainstream media in relation to say the Bush daughters.</dd>
<dd>Yeah, he's notable, he's a public figure, and his article will stay in Wikipedia. The only real question is: Is his story being told in a NPOV way?

<dd>I'll concede that "regardless of their contents" sounds a tad peremptory. The intention was "regardless of whether the few verifiable tidbits are complimentary or otherwise." Remember that an arrest for some minor offense makes better copy than making Phi Beta Kappa, even though the latter is a rarer event. This means that an article about a non-notable relative of a famous person will tend to be skewed negative, unless the subject has a publicist. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 06:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I took a quick look for media sources dealing with those people before I listed them, and was unable to find anything significant. As such, I think it's entirely reasonable to conclude that they are by-and-large non-notable. I should also point out once again that I'm not trying to get anything "removed" from Wikipedia; it's my opinion that information about Gore III should be merged to his father's article. Your numbered points are no more persuasive this time around than they were earlier, for reasons that I have already articulated. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 00:02, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow. I have not in anyway "discredited" myself. That is your opinion. Now, we can begin a long and detailed discussion about personal attacks such as the one that you just engaged in or we can focus on the article. I would suggest that you foucus on the article and not me. That is Wikipedia policy, but if isn't then I would like to point me to where you get the privilege to foucs on me personally. I will also point out that if you go down that road and then I will use that mythical policy to discuss you. What is good for one is good for all.

<dd>I would suggest that you quote policy less, and read it more. This schoolyard "did not, did too" stuff plays very well on chatboards, but any account of User:Getaway's comments in the Wikipedia thread above which <i>did not</i> include a description of his or her disrespectful and deeply personal partisan tone would be incomplete. There's nothing controversial in that assessment. I certainly understand why a reasonable person might disagree on these matters, but one user's POV pushing has not been a productive part of this discussion. Same user reinserted birthday, which is a clear violation of policy, even AFTER the above discussion which points that policy out. So willful insertion of birthdate after notification counts as vandalism. Nothing controversial in pointing THAT out. Talking about vandalism made by a user on talk pages is not a personal attack. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 18:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with Al Gore III is that he is notorious for being a son of the former vice-president, that has been arrested a few times. The arrests have made him notorious, thus newsworthy. However, any mention of the arrests have been censured under the rubric that the "arrests" aren't notable. This turns notability on it's head. Al III's arrests wern't strictly tabloid fodder, they were reported over the news-wires and on reputable news-sites. The arrests can be cited to reputable sources. In it's own wikiarticle, subsection of an Al Sr. article, whatever, the arrests are part of the story and need to be mentioned. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 18:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Non-public figures</b></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures.

<p>Here, (1) Al Gore III is clearly not a public figure; and (2) his criminal record, while verifiable, is not, IMHO, relevant to his notablity. There was no major media coverage of the events.

Most of the other photos on the web make Al III look stiff. My question is; does this photo qualify as fair use? and; should we use it on the Al Gore III page? I think, as a freely distributed Christmas card, it is open for use on Wikipedia, and it shows Al Gore III in the context of his family. It's as the son of Al and Tipper, that he has any hint of notability, in the first place. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 19:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are Al Gore III's arrests notable? and</li>
<li>Given the answers to 1 and 2, should the arrests be included in the article?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd like to propose the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's do any form of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> that the proponents of the info want. I think a request for comment makes the most sense, but you can pick.</li>
<li>In the meantime, given that a majority (probably a supermajority) opposes entry, and given that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> advises caution, let's leave the info out while we try to reach <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">consensus</a>.</li>

<dd>(edit conflict) Since the fact of the arrests is true beyond reasonable dispute, I see no harm to leaving them here while they are discussed elsewhere. Nor harm in doing as TheronJ suggests. TheronJ's list avoids the questions that occured to me when I first noticed this article:
<ul>
<li>Is the notable person affected by the arrests actually the father (unquestionably a famous public figure whose abilities as a father are arguably relevant to his notable activities), rather than the son (arguably not a notable figure)?</li>
<li>If so, does the information belong in an article related to the father, rather than here?</li>
<li>If it belongs elsewhere, is there any encyclopedic content left for this article?</li>
<li>If it belongs in this article, is it possible to write an NPOV article about a person who has committed a few relatively minor offenses, but whose other activities are not noteworthy enough to receive much coverage in reliable sources?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I am happy to participate in any dispute resolution and will cheerfully abide by any consensus. I think this article is one instance of a more general problem (notability-by-inheritance) that I would like to see discussed. For that reason, I think that an RFC is most appropriate, although a mention on the BLP noticeboard would invite wider participation and a truer consensus. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 20:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with User:Badlydrawnjeff that page protection is probably not necessary, but the gesture is welcome (and would have been a bit more welcome by everyone earlier today). Things seems to have cooled a bit, but I think virtually everyone associated with this conversation would like some dispute resolution on a few salient points. While I fear to think ill will, it is possible that one user does not wish resolution; if that's the case, I think some disciplinary action may need be investigated and applied under the rules to the betterment of the entire project. I think previous posters have covered most of my concerns as it regards actual content. I propose that in this case, BLP guides are violated to the possible risk of reputation to the pedia. Some expert wikiguidance would protect the pedia and help to assuage any hard feelings which may have any affected users involved. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 04:20, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I'm half American, but haven't lived in the states for about 15 years, so I suppose I qualify. For a reader outside of the States, Gore (IMO) qualifies as a non-notable person. He was mentioned *by* his father in a book and movie, but has done nothing to put himself in the public eye. I see that some consider his editor job at Good Magazine as a claim to notability, but I don't agree. Is there a Wiki article about every editor of every other magazine published? I hope this article stays protected in its present form, and I would prefer to see it deleted entirely. Until Mr. Gore III actually accomplishes something on his own, and is not simply seen as a child of a former vice-president, he certainly seems a private citizen to me.<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 12:29, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think the appropriate question for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is <i>what has he done to place himself in the public eye?</i> If I recall correctly, JFK Jr. was basically a private individual until he dated <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darryl_Hannah_0a46.html" title="Darryl Hannah">Darryl Hannah</a>. The Bush twins? If they've done nothing more than some underage drinking then maybe their biographies should be reviewed per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> too. Wikipedia ought to be nonpartisan. I don't follow children-of-celebrities news very closely, so there may be nuances I've overlooked. Having slept on the matter, I think perhaps the question to ask is, <i>If this person's parents had been dentists, then how famous would this person be?</i> <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 17:14, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a dispute about whether some or all of Al Gore III's police record should be included in his biography article, and/or in the article for his father, Al Gore Jr. If the material is included, should it be limited to convictions, arrests or should speeding tickets be included?</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This avoids three problems with "criminal history". First, that phrase suggests different and more serious offenses. Second, it either limits consideration to convictions and guilty pleas or else mandates that Wikipedia take a position on the truth of matters that never resulted in a verdict, in violation of NPOV. Third, it implicitly excludes the speeding offense, because speeding is neither a misdemeanor nor a felony, and one is not technically arrested for it. We don't need semantic problems that we can avoid. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 17:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>III's arrests are worthy of inclusion as they relate directly to his notability. They are well sourced and relevant, and he is a "public figure" whether he'd prefer to be or not.

<li><b>Include.</b> I believe that the notability of this type of information depends on the type of sources which are covering it. If his arrest is only covered in local press, then no, I wouldn't say it's necessarily worth including in a Wikipedia article, even though it's verifiable. But if it's covered in major national or international press (such as CNN), then it's a credible source, it's verifiable, and it's obviously notable. I would also be uncomfortable if we were to <i>remove</i> the information, because what then happens the next time someone does some research, finds this credible and notable information that isn't in the Wikipedia article, and, in all good faith, tries to re-add it? Do we revert them, even though they have valid credible sources, and say, "Sorry, it's negative, it can't go into the article?" That's going to cause great confusion, and since it's so subjective, will cause many arguments in the future about which information is okay to include. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Omit</b> I respect the assertion Badlydrawnjeff has made, but I disagree with it. If most assistant magazine editors with some arrests and tickets had articles on WP, his argument would be a strong one. I assert that these biographical facts are ONLY notable because of the subject's biological relationship with a public figure. If the subject was the son of any of the editors involved, he'd be non-public on the merits. IMHO, relationship with a public figure is not of itself reason for notability or public status. So IMHO, as long as Al Gore III stays out of his father's political campaigns (and six years since last involvement is significant in this case), he's by definition on non-public figure, and therefore the traffic tickets and lesser offenses stay out per WP:BLP, since consensus says the article should stay per 5 AfDs. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 01:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I want to prevent the solidification of the idea that 5 AfDs all had consensus to keep, even though I'm not sure if that's exactly what you meant. The first two were no consensus, with a majority voting to delete. The third was consensus to keep, though I think (per my comment in the fourth AfD) that those results may have been skewed due to an incomplete nomination. The fourth was speedy-kept despite a majority voting delete, on the ground of "bad faith nom, WP:SNOW, and an AfD determining keep mere days ago". The fifth was speedy kept due to bad-faith nom. The keep in this fifth case was upheld in deletion review due to the recency of the fourth AfD, but the bad-faith accusation was overturned. I say all this now only to point out that "consensus says the article should stay per 5 AfDs" might be an oversimplification. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry if I didn't make myself clear. This article has survived 5 attempts at deletion, for whatever reason and by whatever plurality. That number 5 is statistically significant, no matter what the cases. <i>My personal preference</i> is that the article be merged/deleted, because the focus of this article has been to tar the subject with a black brush and link as a ball and chain to a public figure. If the article must stay, then the traffic tickets and minor offenses should come out. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 18:29, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have to question III's notability, considering that I didn't even know he existed until I saw this RfC. Assuming that he does meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, if the incidents received <i>substantial</i> media coverage, and are sourced by reliable secondary sources, then it probably can go in. (To be consistent with my position on the "outing" of <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Craig_d48b.html" title="Larry Craig">Larry Craig</a>, I am not seeing the coverage referenced here as <i>substantial</i>. But if his notability is based upon these incidents, and there was not <i>substantial</i> media coverage, then III probably shouldn't even have an article on WP. It's sort of a chicken and egg conundrum. As for those who are looking for fairness in the treatment between III and the Bush twins, I would suggest that this is not the venue for it. The MRC article and the discussion about the bias in coverage could make good mention in an article on media bias, but not in a bio of a debatably notable child of a politician. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:54, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I continue to believe, as I have in recent AFDs, that Al Gore III is not sufficiently notable to have a Wikipedia article, the AFD consensus is otherwise. But that AFD consensus of being notable enough to have an article is based, at least in part, on the facts and press coverage about the arrests. See, the discussion in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Al_Gore_III_%28second_nomination%29_1225.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Gore III (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Gore III (second nomination)</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Al_Gore_III_%283rd_nomination%29_9854.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Gore III (3rd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Gore III (3rd nomination)</a>, where t least half those opining keep explicitly referenced the arrests or the opinion of another that referenced the arrests. I therefore conclude that the arrests are relevant to his notability. This means, per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Non-public_figures" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Non-public figures</a>, that information about the arrests should be included in the article. I see two viable alternatives: 1) no article at all for him, as he lacks adequate notability without the arrests and their consequences (merge and redirect is a possibility here); or 2) an article that covers the arrests in their consequences using the highest standards of sourcing and a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not Whitewashing. If it were whitewashing, the traffic citations of every public figure would be listed on their Wikipages, and omitted on this one. As a corollary, the private biographies of millions of non-public Americans like you and I would be allowed on Wikipedia, just because we had a few minor violations. The stakes are pretty high.

<p>I'd never heard of this guy, and I cannot imagine ever wanting to research him and his background. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's close to being disturbingly sad in having made such a small impression (I'm sure many here have done better). There is a vast amount of more significant information needs to be entered into the encyclopedia before we get down to this level (if we ever need to stoop so low). This discussion looks exactly like a feeding frenzy. C'mon guys, get a life. (Apologies to any readers of the "The Sun" coming across what I've said about you, but a pound to a penny not one of you will see this). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">PalestineRemembered</a> 21:00, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dare I raise the spectre that this article might warrant a new AfD at some point in the relatively near future? As the more sensational elements have been (rightly, IMO) expunged, we are left with nothing. The valiant attempt in the first paragraph to make him appear notable in the context of his father's work is all well and good, but really . . . I know the last 2 AfDs closed with some bad vibes, but time has passed and it might be worth giving this a fresh appraisal. Just a thought.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 09:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><s>Also, r</s>Regarding the comments of Getaway above, is there something less than kosher with having all those bald assertions that Gore III has a drug problem, is an alcoholic, etc etc, just sitting on the talk page? I know people were avoiding confronting Getaway head-on because of his tone, but it seems like everyone glossed over all the accusations he made. Can that be considered libelous?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 09:36, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are sources for everything that I said. There is nothing libelous about it. Al Gore III has checked himself into drug and alcohol programs. He has been pulled over for DUI's., etc. There is a record of his actions. This is matter of record. Now, what is your point or intention to using the word "libelous" without any evidence or information to back up your claim?--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 00:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point is that having a claim such as "X has drug and alcohol dependency problems" may be construed as problematic (I will avoid legal words) whether or not you can dig up evidence that he checked himself into a drug treatment program. I am concerned about the appearance of impropriety, so to speak. Pointing out that X was pulled over on a DUI and was busted on personal possession (even if those incidents ended up in every newspaper the next day) is not the same as saying X is an alcoholic and a drug addict.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 05:19, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I find it strange that the lead of the article mentions his father's speach, but no further mention is made in the rest of the article. Per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, new topics should not be introduced in the lead if they are not covered in the body of the article. I request that this article be expanded to include more information about the speech. The portion of the speech dealing with Al Gore III should be included here, if it is not too long. News reports that mention Al Gore III being included in the speech should also be listed here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 07:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What criteria should be used for external links on this page? The only current item, "Bush's Kids versus Gore's Kids" is part reference and part opinion, and its focus is on the media's coverage of the topic of this page (Al Gore III) rather than the topic itself. I will add more relevant material, without distinction of the nature of the external content. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_wiki_6483.html" title="User:Mike wiki">Mike wiki</a> 07:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
