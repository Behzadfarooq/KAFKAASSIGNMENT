<p>I am going to change the translation of the name as al jazeera means (the Island) and not the peninsula as it said in the article. In Arabic شبه جزيرة <i>Shibih Jazeera</i> (lit: sub-island)= Peninsula.</p>
<p>~~Iraqi guy 19/AUG/2006~~</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no way of knowing which is correct, but can we find a source for the translation? Preferably this would be a page about Al Jazeera that contains a translation, rather than a dictionary. --<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethargy_6191.html" title="User:Lethargy">Lethargy</a> 22:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Iraqi Guy's translation is correct. الجزيرة means island, شبه جزيرة is a Peninsula. شبه means roughly "similar to, to resemble".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, الجزيرة commonly also refers (in its plural form الجزائر) to the country Algeria (refering to four islands just off Algier's coast), in singular to its capital Algiers (just as مصر refers to Egypt if used <i>outside of Egypt</i> but commonly to Cairo if used <i>inside of Egypt</i>)(depending on the context of course), the part of Syria which is north of the Euphrates <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Jazira%2C_Mesopotamia_402f.html" title="Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia">Al-Jazira,_Mesopotamia</a>, the affluent island <i>Gezira</i> in Cairo between two branches of the Nile, as well as the Satellite News Station.

<p>The Al Jazeera outside the Middle East section does not explain <i>why</i> "many Americans" where protesting the network.

<p>I am changing the part in the section of Al-Jazeera International, where it states that the launch of the new channel was protested by many Americans. According to a news story, only six people were present at a protest at Al-Jazeera's Offices. I suspect the group the UAC is trying to hype its impact, and piggy back on the interest of this article.</p>

<p>I apologize in advance for any protocol I am messing am because I've never done this before. I simply noticed that the article doesn't deem to speak very much about this organisation's biases, and when it did, it seemed slightly in favor of them. Since this is a difficult subject on which to report objectively, I'm not really sure how to fix this. I thought I would bring what I perceive as a pro-al jazeera bias to the table nonetheless. For example, Al Jazeera's stance on many issues on which it reports does not seem to be included.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I just watched an interview with Al Jazeera's director <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wadah_Khanfar_0ef0.html" title="Wadah Khanfar">Wadah Khanfar</a>, where the issue of the word used by Al Jazeera for suicide terrorists came up. It was a bit confusing, so I won't add it to the article, but here's what I understood: The word used is often mistranslated as 'martyr', but that is a misconception. The word that is used in Arabic (and that they use) is 'amaliyya fida'iyya', not 'ishtishhadiyya'. Then he went on to say that the word they use is 'shahid', which is also used by other Arab stations and is a neutral word, meaning someone who died under abnormal circumstances (it is used for all sorts of people, irrespective of, for example, religion). Because I was confused over the 'exact' meaning of these words and which word they use when, I looked here, but there's no info on it, so could someone who knows add it? Given the controversy about how Al Jazeera deals with terrorism, this seems like a relevant topic. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 13:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A few days ago, I reverted User:Eve215454's move of <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Network_b99a.html" title="Al Jazeera Network">Al Jazeera Network</a>. At the time, I had not seen any evidence that Al Jazeera calls their network of TV channels "Al Jazeera Network" -- i.e. I hadn't seen any mention that an organisation calling itself "Al Jazeera Network" actually exists. I have now seen sporadic, tentative hints on various webpages that Al Jazeera may indeed have formally reorganized itself (or may be in the process of doing so) to form a parent entity called "Al Jazeera Network". However, I would still ask people not to simply repeat the move of <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Network_b99a.html" title="Al Jazeera Network">Al Jazeera Network</a> without prior due diligence. I feel that giving the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Network_b99a.html" title="Al Jazeera Network">Al Jazeera Network</a> its own article should require that the following be done <i>first</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear evidence of a restructuring of Al Jazeera and a concomitant formation of an Al Jazeera Network parent organisation needs to be found and cited. My own cursory Google search didn't turn up suitably unambiguous results.</li>
<li>If and when moving <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Network_b99a.html" title="Al Jazeera Network">Al Jazeera Network</a>, the former article should NOT be made a redirect to the latter. As far as I gather, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> is the English name of the original Arabic language TV channel. So given sufficient evidence of a restructuring, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> should be made into an article about the TV channel and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Network_b99a.html" title="Al Jazeera Network">Al Jazeera Network</a> should be made an article about the network/parent organization.</li>
<li>Currently, the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> article is about the Al Jazeera network (small n) and Al Jazeera channel. Doing the above requires this one article to be divided <i>and rewritten</i> into <b>two</b> articles (neither of which should be a simple redirect to the other).</li>

<p><i>The original Al Jazeera channel was started in 1996 with a US$150 million grant from the emir of Qatar.</i></p>
<p><i>In April 1996, the BBC World Service's Saudi-based Arabic language TV station, faced with censorship demands by the Saudi Arabian government, shut down after two years of operation. Many former BBC World Service staff members joined Al Jazeera, which at the time was not yet on air. The channel began broadcasting in late 1996.</i></p>
<p>Why did the emir of Qatar grant funding? What's the purpose, motivation or interest of the emir? Who founded Al Jazeera and why? <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 04:13, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I can provide some background info and give you my analysis of the situation:</dd>
<dd>The current Emir of Qatar came to power in a bloodless coup in which he deposed his father. Since coming to power, the Emir has modernised and liberalised his country. Five US universities now <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_City_6f6e.html" title="Education City">have campuses in Qatar</a>. Qatar has a population of less than 700,000, but sits on one of the biggest natural gas reserves in the world, which means that unless someone were to invade Qatar and/or steal its natural resources, the Emir and his country are likely to be awash with money. Qatar is home to one of the biggest US military bases in the region. It is also home to probably the freest, least-censored TV channel in the region. The US military base and Al Jazeera's Doha headquarters are really not that far away from each other. My own hunch is that this amounts to a balance of power. This massive US military presence and Al Jazeera's assured ability to get the word out both will make any potential regional aggressors think twice about doing something funny. Yet by being in the country, the US military is to an extent tied to the current Qatari administration, insofar as they now have a vested interest in not pissing off their host country too much. On the other hand, Al Jazeera's ability to get the word out also is an excellent way to reign in the US Tiger in their back yard. Despite this, or maybe because of this, there is strong evidence that suggests that the US at least thought about doing something funny themselves. See <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_bombing_memo_67ed.html" title="Al Jazeera bombing memo">Al Jazeera bombing memo</a>. I don't know if these decisions were made subsequent to that affair or beforehand, but I would note that Al Jazeera has located their international broadcasting centres for <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_English_3f0f.html" title="Al Jazeera English">Al Jazeera English</a> in very visible locations and close to seats of power -- cf. the maps linked from the AJE article. AJE's Washington centre is near the White House, their London centre is near the UK Parliament, the centre in <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuala_Lumpur_b5d7.html" title="Kuala Lumpur">KL</a> is in the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petronas_Twin_Towers_c1c8.html" title="Petronas Twin Towers">Petronas Twin Towers</a> and bombing any of these centres, each of which are reportedly able to operate to operate independently, is going to make an attacker look really shitty on TV. Al Jazeera are quite right to be cautious, because the US has militarily attacked their bureaux before and killed Al Jazeera staff (in Afghanistan and Iraq), and there is strong evidence to suggest that the US knew exactly what they were doing. My own hunch is that the US felt stabbed in the back and wanted to "send a message", because their Qatari friends (=hitherto seen as the "good guys") repeatedly caught and showed them (the US) literally red-handed and reported on some of those <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet_surveys_of_mortality_before_and_after_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq_2d8d.html" title="Lancet surveys of mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq">650,000 deaths</a> that the US would rather forget about. In other words, Rumsfeld, Cheney and Co. knew that Al Jazeera made them look really thoroughly shitty, which they didn't see as legitimate criticism but as stirring up Muslims against them. Contrary to what they <a href="http://www.meib.org/articles/0006_me2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.meib.org/articles/0006_me2.htm" rel="nofollow">previously thought</a>, this suddenly made them view Al Jazeera as the "bad guys", a notion which they have been largely successful in spreading throughout the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occident.html" title="Occident">Occident</a>. May everyone decide for themselves whether that notion is factual and correct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Who funded Al Jazeera and why?</i> Well, 'who' is easy: the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emir_of_Qatar_47f3.html" title="Emir of Qatar">Emir of Qatar</a>, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. His wives --Shaikha Mariam bint Hamad Al Thani, Shaikha Mozah bint Nasser al Missned &amp; Shaikha Noora bint Khalid Al-Thani-- presumably helped. Actually, I don't know for sure about Shaikha Mariam bint Hamad Al Thani and Shaikha Noora bint Khalid Al-Thani, but I know that Shaikha Mozah bint Nasser al Missned did a lot of work. Both <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Sports_223e.html" title="Al Jazeera Sports">Al Jazeera Sports</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Children%27s_Channel_0fa5.html" title="Al Jazeera Children's Channel">Al Jazeera Children's Channel</a> are based in <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_City_6f6e.html" title="Education City">Education City</a>, and Shaikha Mozah bint Nasser al Missned was very involved in establishing Al Jazeera Children's Channel, which is bankrolled by her <a href="../../../q/a/t/Qatar_Foundation_080a.html" title="Qatar Foundation">Qatar Foundation</a>. 'Why?' Well, my guess would be that Al Jazeera's existence serves the security, development, and education interests of Qatar, the Arab world and the Muslim world. IMHO it doesn't exactly hurt the interests of non-violent progressives worldwide (plus it makes folks like me, who love Al Jazeera English, very happy campers). Had the Emir of Qatar actually wanted to bolster his country's security and influence by force, he could easily have followed the military diplomacy model: buy shitloads of weapons and lobby really hard. There are countries that do that. He certainly had the funds to do that. He chose not to do that, and if you're asking me, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Documentary_Channel_e35b.html" title="Al Jazeera Documentary Channel">public</a> <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_City_6f6e.html" title="Education City">education</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_Children%27s_Channel_0fa5.html" title="Al Jazeera Children's Channel">fun</a> &amp; <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Asian_Games_98ad.html" title="2006 Asian Games">games</a> are incomparably better options, even if the freedom of speech aspect has the power to occasionally embarrass those who continue to commit themselves to the military diplomacy model. Sure, Fox viewers now equate Al Jazeera with Al Qaeda, but, hey, there's always going to be dodoheads and nincompoops, right?</dd>

<dd>In any case, I don't really know how most of the above would fit into the article and in the absence of 3rd party sources, some of it would certainly be dismissed as original research.

However, upon reading <a href="http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall02/Iskandar.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall02/Iskandar.html" rel="nofollow">the second reference</a> I found that it does not support that claim. Which leaves the first reference given, and that is this book citation:</p>

</dl>
<p>However, I haven't got that book and I haven't read it. As I am unfamiliar with the book, I am hesitant to re-link it as source for that statement. Could someone familiar with the book's content (or with the study) explain whether or not this book really contains information to the extent of what the above sentence says? If this statement cannot be backed up either by the book or another reference, then I think it should be removed.</p>
<p>But wait! It gets weirder! I'm now finding that right after this edit, the same contributor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Jazeera_Network&amp;diff=94535953&amp;oldid=94534516" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Jazeera_Network&amp;diff=94535953&amp;oldid=94534516" rel="nofollow">removed the link to the above two references</a> himself and instead inserted a reference for <a href="http://hij.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/11" class="external text" title="http://hij.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/11" rel="nofollow">this study</a>, which is unavailable w/o a subscription, which I thus have not read, yadda, yadda, yadda. However: The <i>summary</i> of the paper appears to say the polar opposite of what the aforementioned sentence says.</p>
<p>Again, can people who are familiar with the contents of the Nawawy/Iskandar book and the Harvard paper possibly shed some light on this?</p>

<li>There are claims regarding controversies involving Al Jazeera and Qatar. The only source I could find was a blog post with links to some further somewhat related sources.
