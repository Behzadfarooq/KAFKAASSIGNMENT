	    <p><b>Albert Christopher Ladesich</b> (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>), better known as <b>Al Christy</b>, was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> executive, and radio and television <a href="../../../a/n/n/Announcer.html" title="Announcer">announcer</a>.</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Kansas_4742.html" title="Kansas City, Kansas">Kansas City, Kansas</a>, the son of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian.html" title="Croatian">Croatian</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavian.html" title="Yugoslavian">Yugoslavian</a> parents who had immigrated to the United States a few years before. He graduated from Wyandotte High School in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>. This was where he first became interested in dramatics.</p>
<p>Ladesich began his career working under his father, selling insurance for Armour Packing Company in Kansas City. He then served in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and upon his discharge, returned to Kansas City and became an announcer for radio station <a href="../../../w/d/a/WDAF-FM_b055.html" title="WDAF-FM">WDAF-FM</a>. It was here that he first adopted the stage name "Al Christy." While with WDAF, Ladesich also did acting on various dramatic radio programs being produced in Kansas City, most notably <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Air_Adventures_of_Jimmie_Allen_45d2.html" title="The Air Adventures of Jimmie Allen">The Air Adventures of Jimmie Allen</a>, where he starred as mechanic "Flash" Lewis during the show's 1946-47 run. He also found acting work in educational and industrial films being produced by the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Company_5934.html" title="Calvin Company">Calvin Company</a> of Kansas City, including films directed by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Altman_89d1.html" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a>. Ladesich would continue to appear in Calvin films (and ones produced by <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centron_Corporation_d91e.html" title="Centron Corporation">Centron Corporation</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence%2C_Kansas_0426.html" title="Lawrence, Kansas">Lawrence, Kansas</a>) until the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> shortly after the new <a href="../../../w/d/a/WDAF-TV_7aa0.html" title="WDAF-TV">WDAF-TV</a> station was begun in Kansas City, Ladesich became one of three weathercasters there. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> when popular weather announcer <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelby_Storck_479c.html" title="Shelby Storck">Shelby Storck</a> left WDAF, Ladesich, who by now was assistant program director for the station, took over his spot and the name Al Christy became more well-known in the Kansas City area. The Ladesich family was very much involved in Kansas City media. Al's brother and sister were associated with WDAF-TV as well, as directors and producers.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> Ladesich left WDAF-TV and became a director, writer, producer, and account manager for a Kansas City <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising_agency.html" title="Advertising agency">advertising agency</a> which primarily produced radio and television commercials. Taking normal work hours and not being required to work at night like when toiling in radio and TV, Ladesich now had time in the evenings to devote to what soon became his chief hobby and avocation, acting. In 1956 he began regularly appearing in productions of Kansas City's top little theater group, the Resident Theater. He missed appearing in only four or five Resident productions over a course of twelve years. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> while vacationing in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, he visited his old Kansas City friend Robert Altman, who by now was directing episodic television in Hollywood. Altman told Ladesich about an episode of a TV series he was currently directing, titled <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonanza.html" title="Bonanza">Bonanza</a>, that he needed an actor for to play a bartender. Ladesich spent one day on the set, playing "Joe the Bartender," and scored his first screen credit. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> director <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Brooks_a86d.html" title="Richard Brooks">Richard Brooks</a> planned to shoot his film <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Cold_Blood_08a5.html" title="In Cold Blood">In Cold Blood</a> in and around Kansas City, and endeavored to use local talent for many of the smaller roles. Ladesich was among the local actors enlisted, portraying a sheriff.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> the Resident Theater closed down and soon professional theater was established for the first time in Kansas City, via the Missouri Repertory Theater. Ladesich was a regular there throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and was well-known to Kansas City theatergoers during that time as a versatile character actor who could "do everything from Shakespeare to light comedy." He also, by this time, had been promoted to a vice-president and board member of a Kansas City ad agency and retired early in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. He spent his "retirement" years primarily in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, scoring small roles in various feature films and television shows. He appeared in episodes of <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falcon_Crest_7ac5.html" title="Falcon Crest">Falcon Crest</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Twilight_Zone_97ab.html" title="The Twilight Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>, <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knots_Landing_11bc.html" title="Knots Landing">Knots Landing</a>, and <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punky_Brewster_f754.html" title="Punky Brewster">Punky Brewster</a>, played Dr. Holmes in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> film <i>Stand Alone</i>, and played one half of the third "documentary couple" in <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_Harry_Met_Sally_00fe.html" title="When Harry Met Sally">When Harry Met Sally</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Ladesich had returned to Kansas City and played a judge in the film <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._and_Mrs._Bridge_234a.html" title="Mr. and Mrs. Bridge">Mr. and Mrs. Bridge</a> which was shot there that year. Soon after, he began to suffer from severe heart trouble and then officially "retired." He died in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_failure.html" title="Heart failure">heart failure</a> at his home in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. Al having been a lifelong bachelor, the only remaining Ladesich relative was Al's older brother, who died three years later.</p>
