<p>This person is clearly notable and I will contest any Afd. The fact that he wrote his own article does not mean it should be automatically deleted, but it should be reviewed more closely. In this case, I believe he is notable but the articles needs cleanup and an NPOV rewrite.

<p>Hi, Thank you for editing the entry about me. Do you need references, I can give them, but did not know how to post citations. I am not familiar with this editing process. It is far more complex than the human brain. In any case, thank you for helping. Appreciatively, Al</p>
<p>The Feynman/Seckel stories can be found at <a href="http://www.fotuva.org/online/frameload.htm?/online/seckel.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fotuva.org/online/frameload.htm?/online/seckel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fotuva.org/online/frameload.htm?/online/seckel.htm</a></p>

Let me know what you need. Thanks! Al</p>

<li>It is also wikipedia policy that <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">No legal threats</a> will be tolerated on the wiki. If you have a concern that can not be addressed here you can take it directly to the Foundation but do not post legal threats on wikipedia. It is also a <i>guideline</i> that people should not write <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">articles about themselves</a>. I will consider your claims and those of Tmciver, but keeping foremost in mind wikipedia's policies on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>. In short, neither negative nor positive information will be included unless it can be verified through the applicable policies. It would be extremely useful if you could provide information about any biographies of yourself that have been published (not self-published) in a traditional reliable source such as a magazine or book (that has an independent editorial process). At the present time the article is reasonable neutral; I am at work now and editing wikipedia is not part of my job description. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

It would help to know the name of the supreme court case in which Seckel helped write the amicus brief so I can pull up the citation. Also, are there any references to Seckel's specific participation in the Popoff debunking? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p><b>I was running the Southern California Skeptics during the time of the Peter Popoff invesitigation, many of our members, and magicians, including myself, along with other skeptical organizations were a part of this investigation, which is what I wrote. I did not claim sole responsibilty for this invesitigation. This is all documented in the article, "God's Frequency is 38.17 Mhz: The Investigation of Peter Popoff.</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.215.109.78 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.215.109.78.html" title="User talk:66.215.109.78">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.215.109.78_592a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.215.109.78">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Found a Popoff ref in the Popoff article. It's cited as a book chapter but looks more like a magazine article. Can someone clarify? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:55, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Supreme Court case is Edwards v. Aguillard; the amicus brief is here: <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html</a> There is no mention anywhere of Seckel's "sponsoring" or "writing" the brief. Gell-Mann initiated and led it; lawyers wrote it; Seckel wrote *about* it, claiming credit for himself. I wrote to Lehmann and co-author Kaufman to confirm this. 67.20.104.67 07:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>THIS IS NOT TRUE. One can see the article in Skeptical Inquirer, written by myself and Jeffrey Lehman, entitled "Science, Creationism, and the U.S. Supreme Court," The Skeptical Inquirer, Vol. 11, Winter, 1986-87. There are also numerous newspaper articles at the time, which will verify the original claims. Furthermore, both Jeffrey Lehman and Murray Gell-Mann will verify the original statements, and I will be happy to provide their exact contact information. Furthermore, Michael Shermer, who presently runs the Skeptics wrote a scholarly piece about the U.S. Supreme Court case, which extensively relied on interviews with me, Jeffrey Lehmann, and Murray Gell-Mann, as well as others. I don't have the cite for the Shermer's article, but he is intimately aware of my involvement and heading up the case as originally described. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.215.109.78 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.215.109.78.html" title="User talk:66.215.109.78">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.215.109.78_592a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.215.109.78">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p><b>In the lengthy article from the <i>Skeptical Inqurier</i> (referenced below), written by Jeffrey Lehman, Beth Kaufman, and Al Seckel, it states: "How the Brief Came About. The idea for a friend-of-the court brief was first discused by SCS Executive Director Al Seckel and his friend Jeffrey Lehman, who had just finished clerking for Supreme Court Justice Stevens. Seckel went to the Skeptics' Board of Directors for approval, and Lehaman apprached fellow lawyer Beth Kaufman becaus of her interest in religon cases. The SCS board agreed to help put together and fund a brief on the scientific community. ...SCS Board Member Murray Gell-Mann (also a CSICOP Fellow) agreed to send letters to other scientific organizations and to the US Nobel laureas in science and medicine asking for their participation and support of the brief..."</b></p>

<p>Seckel had nothing to do with the Popoff investigation, except to write about it later (and claim credit for it). I was in SCS at the time, and tried to interest Seckel in Popoff when he came to L.A. for a big show, but Seckel was uninterested. Later, when Randi disclosed results of his completed investigation, Seckel suddenly got interested. <small>Legal threats and/or possible libel removed</small> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tmciver (<a href="../../../t/m/c/User_talk%7ETmciver_2b13.html" title="User talk:Tmciver">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tmciver_6c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tmciver">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The NY Times article crediting Gilman as creator of the Darwin Fish was 11 Feb 2003, and is online at <a href="http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/oese/Car_Fish.html" class="external free" title="http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/oese/Car_Fish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/oese/Car_Fish.html</a>. It does not mention Seckel.</p>
<dl>
<dd>THIS WAS BECAUSE THE REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES WAS UNAWARE OF MY INVOLVEMENT AND ONLY SPOKE TO EVOLUTION/DESIGN. The other two articles (^ Sarah Lubman. "Fish fight looms over bumper ornament", Albany, NY Times-Union (via Knight-Ridder News Service), December 26, 1995.</dd>
</dl>
<p>^ "Origin of a Species of Car Emblems", San Jose Mercury News, December 11, 1995.) were much more authoratitative, and spoke to many witnesses, not just me, who verified the information about the origin of the Darwin fish, and actually looked into the evidence, which was actually printed and dated material for the creation of the Darwin Fish, which far predated any claims by Gillian. Evolution/Design could never show any designs prior to 1990, when we had designs on postmarked and dated newsletters from the early 80s, numerous witnesses from the two groups who purchased the design in the early 80s, and correspondence about our letting other groups use it. This is detailed and reported in the two articles I cited on the Darwin Fish entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.215.109.78 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.215.109.78.html" title="User talk:66.215.109.78">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.215.109.78_592a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.215.109.78">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the court case title and venue? I may be able to look it up. Without such information, an article in the Times (unless you can get them to print a retraction) meets the definition of a reliable source where your personal assertions do not. This is not meant to disparage you. See the policy on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I do not need you to rely on my personal assertions, just look at the two articles that I previously cited. These were comprehensive articles (the NY Times piece was not, and you can make a case out of anything by leaving out half the facts).</p>
<p><br />
I edited out Seckel's implied claims of direct involvement in the Popoff investigation. As for chronology of SCS's collapse and Seckel's illness, Pat Linse is the best source.</p>
<p>AFAIK all information about Seckel's illness comes from Seckel himself -- not a reliable source. As already mentioned, Saucer Smear published some items reporting on SCS and the Seckel Scandal. I have copies.</p>

<p>Seckel's book citations seem more or less accurate, but it is instructive to check out his entry some years ago in Contemporary Authors. There he claimed a number of books "in press" that do not exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tmciver (<a href="../../../t/m/c/User_talk%7ETmciver_2b13.html" title="User talk:Tmciver">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tmciver_6c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tmciver">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<small>Legal threats and/or possible libel removed</small> I would be happy to fax over copies of my hospital reports from Kaiser Sunset, which document quite clearly my illness, which caused the Skeptics to collapse.

<p>One of the issues brought up by Tmciver (<a href="../../../t/m/c/User_talk%7ETmciver_2b13.html" title="User talk:Tmciver">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tmciver_6c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tmciver">contribs</a>) who nominated the article for deletion is that the claims that Seckel and Feyman had a close relationship are false. There is no way to judge the truth of that per wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. (We like to include facts that can be verified, not "truth", which often can't). However it looks like the article's claim for a relationship come from a Feynman "Fan" web site, and may have been put there by Seckel, so while the claim that the relationship is a lie can not be verified per policy, neither can the claim that it did exist. So I removed it pending further verification. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:54, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I removed the MacArthur and CalTech affiliations rather than leave them commented as unverifiable; for two reasons. First, an encyclopedia should say what is, not what isn't. Second, its unneccessarily negative on Seckel. If one or the other of the claims had blown up into a major scandal, it would be mentioned as part of the scandal.

<p>Pat Linse is listed as co-author of some articles. Now at Skeptics Society, she is an *excellent* source of information about Seckel, having worked with him daily for years at SCS.

<p>I am not sure what to say about CSICOP. Originally the article made no mention of CSICOP, so to add the information that CSICOP was embarrassed by SCS seems gratuitous. Just as an article should not go out of its way to praise its subject it should not go ouot of its way to attack its subject. If there were financial or administrative problems with SCS that might be noteworthy since Seckel's founding of SCS is part of the article. Do you have a more specific citation for Hanson's comments (or Moseley 1991)?

Neither I nor any other wikipedia editor can be in a position of moderating a "he said/he said" debate and trying to decide which person is more credible, so we rely on published credible sources.

<p>As a Wikipedia novice, I re-edited some before reading your comments above. I wish to thank you for taking time to look into Seckel's claims, and my corrections of same. <small>Legal threats and/or possible libel removed</small> Nothing can be added to Seckel's entry if Seckel himself did not originally mention it?!! Likewise with Seckel's relation to CSICOP, which was featured in numerous Skeptical Inquirer pieces and by Seckel himself at the time.

<p><small>Legal threats and/or possible libel removed</small></p>
<p>Saucer Smear and Psychical Research journal may be publications to be wary of (though Prometheus Press published Moseley's book), but the passages quoted are true, and relevant to this entry. As far as reliability, the information can be independently confirmed,<small>Legal threats and/or possible libel removed</small></p>
<p>As far as "he said/he said" issues, again Seckel's word is accepted unless laboriously documented to be false, while some of my verifiable objections (when unpublished, or in "dubious" publications) are not. There is an unfair asymmetry here: Seckel's original entry is assumed to be true, while my objections are not. This is why I suggested AFD in the first place. Seckel's own opinion of himself and version of events--i.e. mere "personal communication" from him--is not a "credible published source," but is accepted by wikipedia as default truth, while my rebuttals are not.</p>
<p>Re pursuing the CSICOP issue, this may indeed remain covered up. Seckel and CSICOP did however make much of their relationship with each other. I made a point of it in order to provide evidence with which to judge Seckel's reliability as a source. Unfortunately, many insiders are *not* aware of the situation, because no one but the "dubious" publications chose to report on it. BTW, I have all the old SI journals, plus Seckel's SCS Laser newsletters.</p>
<p>Thank you for editing the Darwin fish section and archives section. Again, my insertions were added to show Seckel's version was misleading. Since AFD was rejected, a third party version such as yours is far preferable to Seckel's.</p>
<p>I just got an e-mail about Seckel from the head of the illusion contest which is revealing, but of course private and unpublished. I don't think serving as a judge for one year merits Wikipedia inclusion anyway.67.20.104.67 05:55, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Psychical Research may be a somewhat reliable source but the fact that it quotes <i>Saucer Smear</i> does not make <i>Saucer Smear</i> into a reliable source. One reason certain sources (for example, newspapers) are considered reliable is that they have lawyers to prevent liable, often have fact checkers and editors review stories, and generally publish corrections if confronted with error. A self-published newsletter (like a blog) is under no such constraints.</li>

<li>The Laser newsletter would be an acceptable primary source about what Seckel wrote or claimed about the SCS. However you have no reliable counter-source. <small>removed reference to deleted information</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The result is that your statement, "we can't put anything in the article that wasn't in Seckel's original version" is mostly true because you want to put in negative things that can't be verified per wikipedia policy. (The Darwin fish is an obvious exception because we do have a source that differs with Seckel's account.)

</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is one alternative and I'm stupid for not thinking of it earlier (it's very late here). The rules for the External Links section are more relaxed because it's not wikipedia content. You can add one or two links to external web sites critical of Seckel and label them as such. Neutral point of view, balance, and prohibitions against link spamming mean you need to keep it to one or two--you can't flood the article--but if you have set up, or wish to set up, or know of, a critical web site or two you can add them to the external link section.

<p>First, as I noted on your talk page, please sign your comments and do not split the comments of other editors, it makes the discussion hard to follow. It would also help to indent your replies by beginning each paragraph with a colon.</p>
<p>Second, I understand your concerns completely. When I said I was on Tmciver's side "as far as policy allows" that is equally true of you. Relevant policies I have not yet mentioned include <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">autobiography is discouraged</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">rules for biographies of living persons</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>.</p>
<p>Third, I want to caution both you and Tmciver that edit warring and personal attacks are not allowed here. If this talk page (or article) becomes a personal battleground, it will probably be necessary to take steps to stop it. Let's keep everyting civil, please. Also, I would remind Tmciver, should he read this, that autobiography is discouraged but not prohibited and that changes made to the article by Mr. Seckel himself are to be judged on their merit and not automatically reverted or reversed.</p>
<p>Fourth, this case is a perfect illustration of why biographies of living people are often a real problem. Unless you have been profiled in some venue with rigorous editing and fact checking (<i>New Yorker</i>, for example) then I (or any wikipedia editor) faces some real problems. I can't take one person's word over another, and I can't do anything with documents you claim to have in your possession. I don't have any way to judge the personal credibility of either one of you, and even if you presented me with your evidence and I was totally convinced, it couldn't be put in the article because that would force future editors and readers to judge <i>my</i> credibility. This is explained more thoroughly at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>. Self-published or non-peer-reviewed sources may be acceptable for some purposes as primary sources but may or may not be acceptable as secondary sources. (see the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable source</a> policy.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations imposed especially by the original source policy, it may be the best solution to have a relatively vanilla article that simply leaves out discussion of contentious issues that can not be proven one way or the other through reliable sources. I will carefully consider your individual replies above and amend the article as it seems reasonable to do so per the policy. I have access to a large academic and public library system and if necessary I can look into publications such as the Skeptical Inquirer, although this will obviously not occur on the instant. I will also watch Tmciver's contributions to make sure they conform to policy as well. It may also be that other editors will join in.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you understand the process and my approach to what I knew when I saw Tmciver's first comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Al_Seckel" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Al_Seckel" rel="nofollow">here</a> was going to be a problem sooner or later. I will do the best I can to ensure the article is fair and accurate and meets all applicable guidelines and policies. I will also carefully re-read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">rules for biographies of living persons</a> myself. I hope you also understand that this is entirely a volunteer effort for me, and that I have a life outside of wikipedia that includes a job which unfortunately does not include "editing wikipedia" in the job description (looks over shoulder). You can contact me personally on my user talk page <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">User talk:Thatcher131</a> to talk about my approach or to discuss issues regarding wikipedia in general. Specific comments about this article should continue to be left here. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:50, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Dear Thacher,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments and I certainly understand all of your concerns. They are completely reasonable. I put my biographical piece up, because since I have reached a certain amount of international fame and recognition (not because of the Skeptics work, but because of my groundbreaking work in cognitive science and illusions, which I am most proud of -- to me my involvement in the skeptical movement is not important, although a part of my life), but because I wanted to make it fully accurate.No false claims. It would be a great disservice to me and to the credibility of Wikepedia to have postings that are libelous and lack credibility, even if they are external links to uncritical and libelous sources. To me it is akin, to the U.S. government claiming that they do not condone torture, but then secretly send prisoners to states where tortue is not only tolerated, but practiced frequently. It only hurts the credibility. I only provided credible sources and external links on my site that would be useful.</p>
<p>I would not be giving invited lectures to Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCLA, USCD, UC Irvine, Boston University, Cornell, TED, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, New England Bio Labs, University of Lund, etc., etc. etc., if I was not considered a leader in my field of cognitive neuroscience. Scientists are not fools, and they would see through my work immediately. Instead, it is only met with the most positive reactions, because my work is groundbreaking. It is a tremendous offense to me to have someone (not in the field) disparage my work. Do a google search on my name and you will find countless positive disinterested references to people (in the field and out) extolling my work.</p>
<p>One only has to go to my home page (or amazon) to read the reviews of my books, lectures, and so forth. They stand for themselves. It is unfortunate that after trying to put up a very positive web site, which would be informational and useful to people, that someone spends an enormous amount of energy to create a negative impression and do damage to something that is positive. My books are positive, well-liked, and get young and old alike to enjoy the pleasure of finding things out, and be inspired into the terrific mysteries of the human mind and perception. I try to make this world a better place by creating positive and good things, not disparaging others.</p>
<p>It is disheartening to me, and I hope that you can understand, that someone is obsessed with trying to rob me of my intellectual creativity, intellectual background, and other achievements in a totally negative way. For example, my close relationship with Dick Feynman, which as I stated above (contrary to his statements) is noted in his definitive biography and elsewhere, especially in his own handwritten letters to me. That is a credible source. I did not put up the Feynman-On-Line site, it was put up by his close friend Ralph Leighton, who certainly was present durin our relationship.</p>
<p>I have had to deal with this type of nonsense from McIver, unfortunately, for years. The sources that i am providing (Science, Discover, Nature, LA Times, etc., etc.,) are peer reviewed. Saucer Smear and his statements are not. They are his alone and without any evidence or justification. they are just that. He will site articles (like the NY Times article) as authorative, but not cite the two other articles, which went into the issue in depth, interviewing scores of people, and actually talking to the attorneys, etc. His comments (even posted here or through an active web link) can have a serious impact on my career to people who are ignorant of the facts, and then want to distance themselves from any kind of controversy. In the past, I have always taken the high road of just ignoring this stuff, because it becomes endless (like trying to administer medicine to a dead patient). I have more positive constructive things to do with my life. I am only anwering this now, because of the tremendous credibility that your source provides, as well how it is referenced by people who know me.</p>
<p>So, I hope that we can remove all of this negativity and put things right and keep someone from disrupting this site whose sole purpose is to create a negative impression. As you have fairly pointed out, he leaves out the good, but puts in the bad, leading the person to a false conclusion.</p>
<p>I am sorry that you have been brought into the middle of this, and appreciate all the time that you have put into it. I hope that one day you can check out my books at Barnes and Nobles and that they will give you some joy.</p>

<li>I will do my best to balance the competing claims. I originally added in the skeptics stuff because that came up more readily to a Lexis/Nexis search, and it certainly is part of your claim to notability. If you would like to provide additional info about your work in perception, that section can be expanded. I will work on your other concerns as I have time. With luck, one or two other good editors will take an interest too. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Thank you, but this is not a question of "balance," but one of merit. Again, stick to your reliable sources (such as my reference to Feynman in his definitive biography, easily available in any bookstore and completely contradicts his clams) and avoid unsubstantiated personal attacks. Yes, I would like to add to my work on perception, as that is the most interesting, and what people now are interested in, and why they will look me up. Obviously, look at the amount of books I have published on this subject, more than anyone else.... BTW, they are cool books, look them up, fun, informative, and interesting.</p>

<p>Given that this article was mainly written by it's subject, it requires a full once-over with the POV comb.

<li>It may be premature for that. I am already in the process of working with both involved parties and I have a number of reference citations I have not yet added. It may take a day or two to go through all the comments by both parties and my collected material. I would like to remove the POV-check tag and then repost it once my rewrites are complete. That will actually help me because I can restore some of the more favorable self-references that Seckel wants but which I would normally be uncomfortable with (and McIver would object to) and then have the article gone over by a third and fourth set of eyes. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:48, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
