<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capp_05ad.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Born <b>Alfred Gerald Caplin</b> of Jewish heritage, Capp was the eldest child of Otto and Tillie Caplin, and a native of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. He lost his right leg in a trolley accident at the age of nine.</p>
<p>Capp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeport%2C_Connecticut_494c.html" title="Bridgeport, Connecticut">Bridgeport</a>, Connecticut without receiving a diploma. The cartoonist liked to tell how he failed geometry for nine straight terms.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ten years later, A. G. Caplin went to New York and found work drawing <i>Mister Gilfeather</i>, a one-panel, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">AP</a>-owned property. He did this long enough to hate the feature and meet <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Caniff_367a.html" title="Milton Caniff">Milton Caniff</a> before leaving town abruptly, moving to Boston and marrying Catherine Wingate Cameron (whom he had met earlier).</p>
<p>Leaving his new wife with her parents in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amesbury%2C_Massachusetts_3e76.html" title="Amesbury, Massachusetts">Amesbury, Massachusetts</a>, he subsequently returned to New York. There he met <a href="../../../h/a/m/Ham_Fisher_b38b.html" title="Ham Fisher">Ham Fisher</a>, who hired him to help on <i><a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Palooka_be39.html" title="Joe Palooka">Joe Palooka</a></i>.</p>
<p>During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's <i>Joe Palooka</i> <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_arc.html" title="Story arc">story arc</a> featured a stupid, strong hillbilly named Big Leviticus, a prototype for Li'l Abner. And, during this period, Capp was also working on samples for the strip that would become <i><a href="../../../l/i/27/Li%27l_Abner_9318.html" title="Li'l Abner">Li'l Abner</a></i>.</p>
<p>Leaving <i>Joe Palooka</i>, Capp sold <i>Li'l Abner</i> to the United Features Syndicate and the feature was launched on Monday August 13, 1934.</p>
<p><a name="Li.27l_Abner" id="Li.27l_Abner"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capp_05ad.html" title="Edit section: Li'l Abner">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Li'l Abner</span></h2>
<p>The comic strip starred Li'l Abner Yokum, the lazy, dumb, but good-natured and strong hillbilly who lived in <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogpatch.html" title="Dogpatch">Dogpatch</a> with Mammy and Pappy Yokum. Whatever energy he had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae, his well-endowed girlfriend, until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This was such big news that the happy couple made the cover of <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_magazine.html" title="Life magazine">Life magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Abner's home town of Dogpatch was peopled with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Wolf Gal, Lena the Hyena, Indian Lonesome Polecat, and a host of others, notably the beautiful, full-figured women Stupefyin' Jones and Moonbeam McSwine. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the <a href="../../../s/h/m/Shmoo.html" title="Shmoo">Shmoo</a>, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Btfsplk_7ce2.html" title="Joe Btfsplk">Joe Btfsplk</a>, who wanted to be a loving friend but was "the world's worst <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinx.html" title="Jinx">jinx</a>", bringing bad <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luck.html" title="Luck">luck</a> to all those nearby. Btfsplk always had a small dark cloud over his head.</p>
<p>Li'l Abner also featured a comic-strip within the comic-strip <i><a href="../../../f/e/a/Fearless_Fosdick_ceae.html" title="Fearless Fosdick">Fearless Fosdick</a></i> (a parody of <i><a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Tracy_f905.html" title="Dick Tracy">Dick Tracy</a></i>).</p>
<p>The Dogpatch residents regularly combatted the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials and intellectuals with their homespun wisdom and ingenuity. Situations often took the characters to other parts of the globe, including <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, tropical islands, and a miserable frozen land of Capp's invention, "Lower Slobbovia."</p>
<p>At its peak, <i>Li'l Abner</i> was read daily by 70 million Americans (when the US population was only 180 million). Many communities, high schools and colleges staged "<a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadie_Hawkins_Day_3002.html" title="Sadie Hawkins Day">Sadie Hawkins Day</a>" events, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.</p>
<p><a name="The_1940s_and_1950s" id="The_1940s_and_1950s"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capp_05ad.html" title="Edit section: The 1940s and 1950s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1940s and 1950s</span></h2>
<p>During and after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Capp worked without pay going to <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a> to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life.</p>
<p>In 1940, a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_picture.html" title="Motion picture">motion picture</a> adaptation starred Granville Owen as Li'l Abner, with <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buster_Keaton_5ace.html" title="Buster Keaton">Buster Keaton</a> taking the role of Lonesome Polecat. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> and had a long run of 693 performances. The stage musical was adapted into a motion picture in 1959 by producer Norman Panama and director Melvin Frank with several performers repeating their Broadway roles.</p>
<p>In one run of strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Worth_%28comic%29_82f5.html" title="Mary Worth (comic)">Mary Worth</a></i> as "Mary Worm", depicting the title character as a nosy do-gooder. Allan Saunders, the creator of the <i>Mary Worth</i> strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character "Hal Rapp", a foul-tempered, ill-mannered cartoonist. Later, it was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and Saunders had cooked up.<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capp_05ad.html" title="Edit section: The '60s &amp; '70s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The '60s &amp; '70s</span></h2>
<p>Capp and a platoon of assistants kept the strip going throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. No matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on drawing the faces and hands himself, and, as is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Frazetta_eadf.html" title="Frank Frazetta">Frank Frazetta</a>, later famous as a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_art.html" title="Fantasy art">fantasy artist</a>, drew the beautiful women in the strip's later years.</p>
<p>In the '60s, Capp's politics swung from <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a>, and instead of caricaturing big business types, he began spoofing <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> icons such as <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Baez_b724.html" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a> (in the character of "Joanie Phoanie", a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage one million dollars' worth of "protest songs"<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). He also attacked student political groups, such as the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society_eba9.html" title="Students for a Democratic Society">Students for a Democratic Society</a> (SDS) as "Students Wildly Indignant About Nearly Everything" (SWINE). He became a popular speaker on college campuses during the era, attacking anti-war protesters and demonstrators, including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoko_Ono_397a.html" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a> at their <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bed-In_d9e1.html" title="Bed-In">Bed-In for Peace</a>. <a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In 1971, he was charged with attempted adultery by complaint of a female student at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison_a81d.html" title="University of Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. It developed that there were similar allegations from other campuses. Capp pleaded <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolo_contendere.html" title="Nolo contendere">no contest</a> and withdrew from public speaking. The resulting bad publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn=" class="external autonumber" title="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn=" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p><i>Li'l Abner</i> lasted until 1977, and Capp died two years later from <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emphysema.html" title="Emphysema">emphysema</a>, at his home in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Hampton%2C_New_Hampshire_3c27.html" title="South Hampton, New Hampshire">South Hampton, New Hampshire</a>.</p>

<p>In 1968 a theme-park called <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogpatch_USA_6bdd.html" title="Dogpatch USA">Dogpatch USA</a> opened at <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper%2C_Arkansas_204a.html" title="Jasper, Arkansas">Jasper</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties and remains unused and in disrepair.</p>
<p>His younger brother <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliot_Caplin_cfe8.html" title="Elliot Caplin">Elliot Caplin</a> also became a comic strip creator, best known for writing the <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> strip <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heart_of_Juliet_Jones_46de.html" title="The Heart of Juliet Jones">The Heart of Juliet Jones</a></i>.</p>
