<p>I suspect that this really was a joke remark, although I am at a loss to then explain the UK gov's stupidly draconian response. I can't believe even a buffoon like Bush would bomb Qatar, it doesn't make any sense (does the memo explicitly specifiy aerial bombing btw? Or just any bombing, e.g. CIA etc?). As it evolves this article should perhaps explicitly state that the actual text is unavailable (or at least I couldn't find it on a quick google search + scanning the likes of Indymedia etc) and the context of the remarks is thus unclear. (These days however, anything is possible- maybe it's time to get my tin hat out and hide in the cellar just in case).</p>

<p>This article is very poorly written and riddled with POV. No-one has even seen the memo and speculations about its content vary widely. The Mirror front page refers to the supposed plan to bomb Al Jazeera yet the most common view of those experts asked of it is that Bush was simply letting off steam and making a joke, if indeed he ever said it. This view is not explained in the article. This article needs a thorough cleanup. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 19:17, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, we've lots of people saying it <i>might</i> be a joke, and some quoting <i>others</i> who think it's a joke. You're quite right that we should say that many people believe it's a joke, but I can't find anyone who says <i>they</i> believe it's a joke. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 20:30, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the Mirror's original sources said it was a joke. I give you the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/22/AR2005112201784.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/22/AR2005112201784.html" rel="nofollow">Washington Post</a>: 'the Bush remark as recounted in the newspaper "sounds like one of the president's one-liners that is meant as a joke."'</dd>
<dd>In case you are thinking that no President could make such a remark as a joke, was <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> joking when he said "I am pleased to tell you I have today signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever.

<dd>"Sounds like" is a quote by a "senior diplomat" and not the words of the Washington Post. As was said above, there are people who say it may have been a joke and others who quote people who think it was a joke but no one has said first hand I've seen the memo or I was there and it's a joke. I personally do think it was (because I cannot believe even the most minorly functional of politicians would want to bomb a news agency for simply disagreeing with them) but as it stands right now, it's all just speculation as to what his intent was while his words themselves are at least some what clearer. - 67.172.124.99 22:53, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would disagree with you here. I think the leaders of many big countries, including the US would be happy to bomb news agencies if they think they could get away with it. The simple fact is, they perceive some agencies as a threat to them. This has been obvious in the sentiment expressed re: US and Al-Jazeera. Al Jazeera publishes information they did not want people to know and ideas they do not want people to have. This is dangerous to their foreign policies goals and intentions in Iraq and Afghanistan and to a degree in many other Arab countries, whatever these goals and intentions may be. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:57, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Bush makes such a joke, given the immense damage it could do to the US if reported, then he is unfit to be president. But then he has shown repeatedly that he is unfit for office. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 21:11, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's in a top-secret meeting with his biggest international ally. I think he might have assumed it would not be published. Whether or not it reflects on his fitness for office is an interesting but separate point as to whether it was a joke. But as I pointed out above, Reagan made a similar joke in front of an open mike. It's not unknown. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:17, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some discussion in wikinews suggests it's unlikely to be a joke because the person who recorded the comment would not have recorded it if it were a joke and in fact, the person who recorded the comment was very concerned about it which is why we got into this memo mess in the first place. Of course, the person who recorded it may have been wrong and I don't think we have any specific evidence the person who recorded it regarded it as serious but if someone can find a source it's an interesting idea <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:47, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you disputing (a) the Daily Mirror is highly critical of U.S. policy over Iraq, or (b) a single front page is not enough to prove the editorial line of the paper?

<dd>Perhaps there isn't a need to source every single fact, but if an allegation is being made that a newspaper or tabloid is Anti-American, as a reader unfamiliar with the publication, I want to learn why and judge for myself, which is why <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> exist in the first place.

<dd>The best way to learn the Mirror is anti-american/anti-bush is to read its website, or look through its archive.

<p>The claim that the paper is anti-American is preposterous. It is anti-Bush and his policies, but then so is most of the planet. Does that mean that most of the planet, including according to polls on Bush and his policies even the UK, the late Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth, all are known to have been extremely critical of Bush, is anti-American? Does that mean that the majority of Americans who voted against Bush in 2000 and the near majority who votes against Bush in 2004 are anti-American? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 02:03, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the context of the UK press, the Mirror is probably the most anti-American paper, with the possible exception of the Independent. The Guardian is rather less so.</p>
<p>If we have a scale of 5 (anti) to 1 (pro) American (and by that I mean - against or for US foreign policy, as put into practice under recent presidents)</p>
<p>Mirror - 5 Independent - 5 Guardian - 4 Sun - 1 Times - 1 (note the Murdoch connection) Telegraph - 2 Mail - 2 Express - 2</p>
<p>Let's be clear here - the Mirror's criticisms of US policy apply (though perhaps not quite so much) to the policy of Clinton and Bush Sr as well as Bush jr, which are blamed for the anti-American (what else would you call it) feeling in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Is the Mirror RIGHT to take the stance it has? Perhaps yes - in my own POV. But it's undoubtedly non-POV to describe it as anti-American in the sense usually meant when discussing foreign policy, the Iraq war, etc. It doesn't mean it's against Mickey Mouse, McDonalds, and Rock and Roll.</p>
<p>Someone who wants British troops out of Ireland could as a shorthand description be called "anti-British" even though he may like tea, cricket and British people as individuals.</p>
<p>Of course such a description could be used to dismiss the allegations made here. However a little research shows that the memo appears to exist - the only dispute is over its contents.</p>

<dd>No, you're confusing matters. For example, the Independent is not anti-American. However, it does tend to be anti-Bush and anti-current-American-policy-in-Iraq. This is not the same thing. George Bush is not 'America'. If someone who wanted British troops out of Ireland was described as anti-British, that description could well be wrong. They might, for example, be a British person themselves, and want the situation to calm down as much as possible. They might even take the view that such a position was pro-British, as they want fewer British troops to die. If you use this shorthand, you will not just be POV, you will be being inaccurate, and lead people to assume things about papers that aren't true. If you mean 'is against US policy in Iraq', say that instead. 09:34, 1 February 2006 (UTC) (Skittle)</dd>

<p>I'm not a Brit, so will ask the question: Is the Daily Mirror a reputable source or a scandal sheet that reports front page stories about princesses having their toes sucked&#160;? If it's as bad as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Enquirer_cab4.html" title="National Enquirer">National Enquirer</a> in the US, I don't think we should be using it directly, or any quotes from it found in other news reports (like the Yahoo source). <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 18:33, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a Brit who is not a Mirror reader perhaps I can give my (biased) view. Mainstream newspapers are divided into two groups - "quality" broadsheets who are fairly reliable (like the Guardian, Telegraph, Independent, Financial Times, Times) and "tabloids" who focus more on celebrity/soap stories and have clear bias in their stories (e.g. The Sun, The Mirror). The Mirror came out against the war and has published inaccurate stories in the past (e.g. publishing fake pictures showing prisoner abuse). I would be very careful of quoting anything that lends itself to bias - stick to the facts because these are likely to be correct. i.e. A transcript exists, it was leaked to an MPs assistant, he passed it to an MP, he passed it back to the government, the leaker and assistant have been charged under the OSA, the AG has threatened any newspaper editor that publishes it with criminal prosecution. It is clear that the memo is important (otherwise why woudl the AG block publication?) and it is alleged that it involves a conversation between Blair and Bush about bombing Al-Jaz. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if the Mirror hasn't even seen the memo. Hope this helps. 155.202.254.82 18:57, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I guess it's the website, kinda gives away the fact that it is a sensationalist tabloid.

<p>I guess it is clear by now that a top-secret document got leaked. In sharing the concerns about the reputation of the Mirror, the authors have gone to great lengths to illuminate the flow of information and the unverified (unverifyable) nature of its contents, wherever appropriate and necessary. After thegag order, it is unlikely to hear further reporting on the document (which has been returned to Blairs office anyway). --vonbergm 19:42, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you don't generally get charged under the OSA unless something was leaked. So its not a question of the mirror lying about the leak, but about the mirror juicing it up. Maybe Bush really was joking, for example. Anywho, we say when we are quoting the mirror, so it should be fine. Nyarlathotep 21:50, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That only works for people who already know the Mirror to be an unreliable source. Most Americans, for example, won't know that.

<li>You can change the fact that it is a sensationlist but the word sensationlist is not POV. Sensationlist does not mean incorrect but blown out of proportion.

<p>I guess we can call the Mirror a "sensationalist tabloid" for buying fabricated photos. But then, of course, we'd have to call the Bush administration a "sensationalist regime" for starting a war over fabricated intelligence. Can't have one but not the other... but then 30,000 people didn't die over the Mirror's sensationalism stunt, you would think, so Bush seems rather more sensationalist in that sense. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:09, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On November 13, 2001 a US cruise missile hit Al Jazeera's office in Kabul after it criticised the US attack on Afghanistan.<a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/aug2003/aljz-a27.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/aug2003/aljz-a27.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Although no Al-Jazeera staff were hurt in the attack, the building was destroyed and the homes of some employees were damaged. At the time, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali, managing editor, said that the coordinates of the office were well known to everyone including the Americans.</p>
<p>In November 2002, Al-Jazeera's office in Kabul, Afghanistan, was destroyed by a U.S. missile. None of the crew was at the office at the time. U.S. officials said they believed the target was a terrorist site and did not know it was Al-Jazeera's office. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-11-22-bush-al-jazeera_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-11-22-bush-al-jazeera_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>On April 8, 2003 a US missile hit an electricity generator at Al Jazeera's office in Baghdad. The resulting fire killed reporter Tareq Ayyoub and wounded another staff member. On February 24, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali had sent a letter (however, it should be noted that the location had not been requested by the US government) with the coordinates of the offices to Victoria Clarke, the US Assistant Secretary of State of Defence for Public Affairs. The assault on the Baghdad office occurred after the network had screened footage of the US bombing of civilian targets in the city.<a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/aug2003/aljz-a27.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/aug2003/aljz-a27.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> a State Department spokesman in Doha, said the strike was a mistake. <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051123/WIRE/51123021/1117/news" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051123/WIRE/51123021/1117/news" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../k/g/r/User%7EKgrr_00fe.html" title="User:Kgrr">Kgrr</a> 15:06, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article has a hidden warning to UK editors:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>UK editors bear in mind the Attorney General's warning "publication of a document that has been unlawfully disclosed by a Crown servant could be in breach of Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this is unnecessary. Wikipedia is governed by Florida state law, not UK law. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> 14:18, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also think it's unnecessary but for other reasons. It would be no defence for a UK editor, if they included the memo (should someone have it) in the article, to say that Wikipedia is governed by Florida law because they would still have disclosed information which might damage national security. However, no-one has got the memo and if they did have, it would be original research to include it. It's a virtual certainty that if the memo is going to be published it will be by a newspaper first. We can cross that bridge when we come to it. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The position with the OSA is that no-one can publish the memo or its contents in the UK without authorisation. Wikipedia itself can publish the memo, and anyone in the UK can read it - but not actually publish it. AFAIK the memo is now back at No 10 and so wikipedia can't do any more than paraphrase the alleged contents, based on the Mirror article. Blair himself will have to present the memo if we're to know the truth. -- Exile 15:45, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It wouldn't be original research to include the memo if someone have a copy. Original research is when you present a new interpretation or untested theories. A copy of the memo would be a copy of something that exist, the editor didn't make it up. Of course, it would be hard for an editor to justify / argue that any such text is the actual memo concern if it's not been published elsewhere, but that's a different matter. Regarding the law, David is right that unless the editor is doing it outside the UK, they are still (according to the AG) breaking UK law by doing it. It doesn't matter where the content then resides. OTOH, I'm not so sure that if it's published, it'll be by a newspaper first. The two most prominent person to say publicly so far that they will publish it if they get hold of a copy is both magazine not newspaper editor. (Boris Johnson MP, editor <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectator_0701.html" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a>, Ian Hislop, editor <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Eye_4f62.html" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a>.) -- <a href="../../../k/t/c/User%7EKTC_0713.html" title="User:KTC">KTC</a> 00:34, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the removal of this. A notice providing a warning to UK editors is very important here. A editor of any nationality making an edit from the geographical territory of the UK could potentially be breaking the law, and they need to be aware of this. I am fairly certain that a UK editor inserting a hyperlink into Wikipedia that led users to a third party website (that publishes the memo) could be deemed an accessory to a breach of the Official Secrets Act (OSA). A single edit (no matter how quickly it was reverted) would be enough to potentially constitute a breach and prosecution. If the memo does appear in the public domain, UK based editors should not link to it or ask or encourage any other wikipedians (wherever they are in the world) to link to it to be sure of staying within the law. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickfraser_0543.html" title="User:Nickfraser">Nick Fraser</a> 09:05, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This [Al-Jazeera Kabul offices hit in US raid BBC news article on the bombing of the Kabul Al-Jazeera offices] (which is alreadly linked to as a source in the article) specifically quotes al-Jazeera's managing director Mohammed Jasim al-Ali:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This office has been known by everybody, the American airplanes know the location of the office, they know we are broadcasting from there," he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the Baghdad attack, in an <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/wartime/fisk_journalists.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sfbg.com/wartime/fisk_journalists.html" rel="nofollow">April 26, 2003 article for the San Francisco Bay Guardian</a>, Robert Fisk says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr al-Ali has given me a copy of his letter to Victoria Clarke, the US Assistant Secretary of State of Defence for Public Affairs in Washington, sent on 24 February this year. In the letter, he gives the address and the map coordinates of the station's office in Baghdad - Lat: 33.19/29.08, Lon 44.24/03.63 - adding that civilian journalists would be working in the building."</p>

<dd>Lets look at the facts here:
<ul>
<li>They knew the existence and location of the office.</li>
<li>They knew the co-ordinates (so exact location) too.</li>
<li>Iraq was heavily bombed</li>
</ul>

<dd>I have an open mind on this issue, but I would agree with both the above opinions. It is an important detail that the US military knew the locations of Al Jazeera. It is also inconclusive.

<li>It is not true to say that the Mirror is anti-American. It is anti-Bush and his foreign policy. That is different.</li>
<li>There is no evidence that it was the Mirror who faked the photographs. All the evidence suggests that it published them in good faith but was duped in a set-up.

<dd>While i agree with Choasfeary's Point of view as to the image text, what he has added in strongly POV. While the previous image text was perhpas mildly POV, the new text is strongly POV. The image text should probably note the source of the image. I am not sure how many sites are listed as displaying the image, but yesterday i could not find the image on google images, so 100's sounds a little excessive. Ideally the image text should note that publication in the Uk, and incitement to publish it in the UK are illegal, but given the size constraints that does ot semm practical.<a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDolive21_f335.html" title="User:Dolive21">Dolive21</a> 11:36, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's reasonable to include the image because it's a nice comment on the way the memo is seen politically within the UK - that those who are anti-Labour (or at least anti-Labour policy on Iraq) are generally of the belief that its publication would aid them. Oddly the Mirror story implied the direct opposite - that Blair had persuaded Bush not to do something stupid. It also indicates a degree of knowledge about the memo among the blogosphere. I'd keep the image in. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:49, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't see any reason why not include it. The only reason I've heard so far is about the notability of Blairwatch.co.uk. As a reminder, Google-watch.org got an <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">entry</a> in wikipedia. Even <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, its founder, got his own controversial article. Indeed, it's just Mr Brandt who's editing his sites while the last time I visited Blairwatch I found 3 users and 317 guests. I am not trying to imply whether any of the websites is notable but implying that if Google-watch is present here than a banner/pic from blairwatch which is directly related to the story is at least notable to this article. The only thing we should discuss is what to mention in the title of the picture, not the presence of it. -- Cheers -- <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 18:52, 30 November 2005 (UTC) <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange">&#160;<sup><i>Wiki me up™</i></sup></font></a></small></p>
<p>I have changed the end of the otherwise good text to remove the reference to 'Blairs edicts'. I probaly swung it too far the other way, so i am very happy for some one to find a better alternative. I think UK law is a better end then blairs edicts.

<dd>The law allows for Blair to suppress news agencies, but it does not require him to. In the end, it is up to Blair to interpret how the law is to be invoked in this matter, thus making it an edict. To call it a matter of British law is incorrect. If it were a matter of law, anyone could enforce it by going to the police and citing how the law was broken. In the case of suppressing the memo, however, only an edict from Blair carries enough authority. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 04:54, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The lord chancellor, one of the law officers, who is , I must admit for clarity, a political appointy, stated that the publcation of the memo would be a breach of the official secrest act. He was acting in pursuance of his duty. It is not an edict. It is in fact quite likely that orders came from the highest levels of goverment not to pursue this matter as forcefully as it could be pursued. The entire editorial staff of the Mirror could be arrested for breaching the official secrets act, conspircay to breach the official secrets act, and being accesories to breaching the official secrets act.<a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDolive21_f335.html" title="User:Dolive21">Dolive21</a> 10:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you may have confused the Lord Chancellor with the Attorney-General. The Lord Chancellor is head of the Judiciary and does not initiate prosecutions, while the Attorney-General is the government's lawyer and in charge of the Crown Prosecution Service. Important prosecutions have to be approved by the Attorney-General personally. There are some fine constitutional principles about the way the Attorney-General can consult other members of the government on whether to initiate or to stop a prosecution (to put it briefly, the Attorney-General is entitled to consult others who have a political view, and to bear this in mind, but cannot be directly ordered to withdraw or initiate a prosection on political grounds). The Campbell case from 1924 is instructive here. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 12:55, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thank you for correcting me on my inaccuracy. I was wrong. The office i should have referd to was the attorney-general. Still, not withstanding the ineptitude with which i made my point, The attornet general was acting rightly in his official capacity by warning the press that publication was illegal. I would also, on an almost entirely unconnected point, like to complement david on supporting a party which offers such a competent and eloquent alternative to the current holder of that post.<a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDolive21_f335.html" title="User:Dolive21">Dolive21</a> 14:46, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it actually were illegal, the attorney general would not have had to "state that the publication of the memo would be a breach of the official secrets act." Any British civilian or law enforcement agent could have read the law and determined that for themselves. Publication of the memo did not become an illegal act until the edict was declared. Until it became illegal, it could not have been considered a necessary part of British law, and since the law did not physically change due to the edict, it could not <i><b>now</b></i> be considered part of British law. Granted, the edict is <i><b>allowed</b></i> by British law, but it <i>was</i> the edict that made it illegal. I have nothing against British law, but I join hundreds of others in opposing edicts used for the sole purpose of hiding conspiracy to commit murder, which I believe the memo will show was the underlying cause of the last two attacks on Al Jazeera.</dd>

<p>Congratulations in your in spired and well balanced image text <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:Dbiv</a>. Just one point, it is clear that publishing classified documents is illegal in the UK. The citation if you want to check it is Official secrets act 1989 Section 5 for the publiaction, and section 3 is the section about international relations. The full memo is beleived to contain details of british troop deployments, which would all under section 2. Section 15 extends the jurisdiction of the offence to anyone with british citizen ship any where in the world. If you want ot look this up it is on pages 280 - 286 of blackstones statutes on criminal law, or on line at <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1989/Ukpga_19890006_en_1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1989/Ukpga_19890006_en_1.htm" rel="nofollow">HMSO</a>. The above was from Blackstones 14th edition. The entry in blackstones about the official secrets act is identical to the act, which is crown copyright and can be reproduced freely as long as attributed. Please keep these two sentences in if you use this information.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Does the act apply to non-citizens resident in the UK? I presume it does not apply to non-citizens outside of the UK. Does the place of publication matter. ie, I live in the UK but I am not a UK citizen, can I publish to a US hosted website? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> 12:12, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It applies to anyone in the UK. However, section 5 does <i>not</i> apply to British citizens abroad, as section 15 (the part of the act which applies the law extraterritorially) explicitly discounts section 5, saying "Any act [done by a British citizen abroad is an offence if] it would be an offence by that person under any provision of this Act other than section 8(1), (4) or (5) when done by him in the United Kingdom". -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 12:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Section 15 excludes sub sections 8 (1) (4) and (5.) subsection 8 (5) is about failing to safegaurd classified documents. Section 5 is about publishing classifeid documets, and does have extra territorial jurisdiction. As to whether a non-citizen can commit the offence, it works a bit like treason, british citizens anywhere in the world are bound by it and so is everyone in british territory. If you publish the information, and are subject to the act, you can be prosecuted, so if you are in the UK, it does not matter where you post it, it would be illegal.<a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDolive21_f335.html" title="User:Dolive21">Dolive21</a> 14:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
