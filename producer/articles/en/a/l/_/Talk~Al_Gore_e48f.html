<p>Gore didn't technically win the Academy Award for An Inconvenient Truth - the award goes to the film's producers, even though he was invited on stage to join them at the Oscar ceremony. I think, accordingly, that we should remove the descriptive piece and merely insert it as part of his bio with due explanation...</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Also the sentence that states he won the award is grammatically incorrect.</p>

<p>I think we should keep what we have but the sentence should be changed. Al Gore's movie won an oscar but Al Gore certainly did not. <a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiffypopmetaltop_3d5a.html" title="User:Jiffypopmetaltop">Jiffypopmetaltop</a> 19:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Statements like "Gore was misrepresented" are not facts and shouldn't be on the page. Wikipedia readers may deduce it by reading Gore's CNN comments and comparing it to others' comments, but they should reach that conclusion by themselves.</p>

<li>Why? Gore said X. Other people said Gore said Y. That's misrepresentation. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 00:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

</ul>

</ul>
<p>In the late 1980s, Gore introduced the Gore Bill, which was later passed as the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991. The bill was one of the most important pieces of legislation directly affecting the expansion of the internet. That second sentence doesn't have a source. Most important is very subjective.

<p>I edited the "Early Life" section by adding an "Education" sub-heading. I added the facts from the "Interesting Academic Facts" section that I wrote earlier and modified some of the writing to make it flow better. In the "Education" section I added Al Gore's class ranking at St. Alban's School, Al Gore's SAT scores, the fact that Harvard was the only university that he applied to, that he was an english major, changed the stated "government major" into Al Gore receiving a B.A. in government, and Al Gore's IQ scores. I also added information on his post-Vietnam attempts at graduate school in religious studies and law school at Vanderbilt university.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a problem with removing the text "Gore was alleged to have said that he was a much more important influence on the novel than he was" from the triva section? It is uncited and ambiguous. What does "much more important influence" mean? The controversies page covers this topic and has a citation where the author says that Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones were the basis for the main character in the novel. Without defining "much more important influence" it is difficult to see how Al Gore's claim to any level of importance can be questioned.--12.149.111.5 00:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel like the section on the environment does not provide a good summary of Gore's record. The artical states that Gore's record does not live up to Nader's standards. Without further info this statement is pretty much useless. Gore's mixed record on environmental issues has been overshadowed by the praise he has recieved for making An Inconvenient Truth. The league of conservation voters gave him a mediocre lifetime rating of 64 percent going into the primary with Bradley--hardly anything to be proud of, and pretty contradictory to what he now says he cares about. I think a re-write or at least a thorough editing is waranted. Any thoughts? Jamec378 19:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)jamec378 Absolutely. Although the lack of environmental issues described in his political achievements is telling in itself, I think Al Gore's two faced behavior should be better explained. Also there has been a lot of discussion about Gore's energy consumption in his personal life and some information should be added about that. 75.72.209.176 17:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC) I also miss any reference to Gore's past ownership of a large stake in the oil major Occidental Petroleum, relevant if one decides to become a spokesman against big oil. aussiesta</p>

<p>Could someone please ad that Al Gore was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize 2007 (31st of January 2007). The Nomination was made by Børge Brende former Minister of the Environment of Norway (2001-2004) and Heidi Pedersen. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded annually in Norway (summer/autumn).

<dd>It doesn't make sense to mention this. Nominations have no official standing. For example, Hitler and Stalin were nominees. Rush Limbaugh is also apparently a nominee this year along with Al Gore, yet I hardly think Limbaugh's article should give him credit for that. Winning the prize is all that matters.

<dd>Apples and elephants. For the Oscars, each category is voted upon by people who work in the same field (except for Best Picture). And the nominations are the five entries that received the most votes in the initial ballot. With only five nominees per category, it is an honour just to be nominated.

<p>Why is there no "Criticisms" section in the AL Gore article? Articles on prominent political figures (i.e. Ronald Reagan, etc.) on Wikipedia have one. There is a link to a "Controversies" article, but if you look at the history of that article you see (rightly) that anything the editors deem a criticism, not a controversy, is systematically removed from there, to the point that many of the criticisms in the original article are gone. It seems to be a pattern; the criticisms are moved to the controversy page, they are eventually labeled not technically controversies, and then they are removed. Don't get me wrong..I don't know Al Gore from a hole in the head and don't have any factual information to contribute, but it seems like a strange break in standard procedure. The Controversies section seems toothless for such a prominent person and a poor substitute for an honest section on criticisms. For that matter, why was the Controversies section moved to a separate page in the first place...it seems to only leave, at best, an incomplete picture of the man in his biography. .--<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a> 21 Sunday, 2007-02-11 T 23:11 UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to go ahead and delete this business from the Tennessee Policy Group. A bit of research about the organization reveals that they're a right-wing public relations group with dubious claims of legitimacy (the Tennessee Tax Department doesn't recognize them as a legitimate organization according to&#160;:<a href="http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?news_id=54656" class="external free" title="http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?news_id=54656" rel="nofollow">http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?news_id=54656</a>). This looks like a smear campaign agaisnt Al Gore to me, and doesn't rightfully belong in his Wikipedia entry. Benji 16:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's pretty clear that the Tennessee Policy Group is indeed a right-wing group. However, their info about Al Gore's house appears to be more or less true. This article should at least mention that Al Gore's mansion uses a lot of energy. It's noteworthy since Al Gore is an environmentalist. A neutral article should contain negative aspects of someone in addition to positive aspects. JackWilliams 04:37, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no way of determining if the energy used in the Gore home is "green" or not. The statement is 100% spin.</p>

<p>"Physical laws determine where electricity is ultimately used, so power from these sources will go into TVA’s electric system as part of the Valley’s total power mix, rather than to individual homes or businesses."</p>
<p>Even excessive uses of Green power would mean that more 'non-green' power is needed for the total power mix to replace that being used.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What the hell does that mean? If Gore buys a jillion kw then the TVA is contracted to buy that jillion kw from united windfarms or whoever, where does the non-green power come in? Also, the information that somebody's home which contains a business/office component which is probably bigger than half the businesses in Tennessee, happens to use a lot more electricity than most homes, is non-notable to the point of trivia; applied to Gore, it sort of smells POV. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 16:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please sign your comments. We aren't here to debate Al Gore's house, but the "Tennessee Center for Policy Research" is a highly questionable source, as the state evidently does not regard them as a legitimate think tank. At the least, this should be explicitly stated, since their funding is explicitly right wing and partisan. It's POV and doesn't belong.--<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactusnonverbus_68c7.html" title="User:Factusnonverbus">FNV</a> 04:51, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Point Being? Jesus Christ was also a questionable source - someone "claiming" to be the son of god should not have been take seriously right? Does that mean Jesus is also wrong? No. It doesnt matter where the source comes from. The funny thing is the source turned out to be right! Al gore does use 10x the amount of electricty that the average family does - his own spokesperson confirmed that- although their excuse was that Mr. Gore took steps to "reduce his carbon footprint" such as flying in a private jet around the worl, when there are perfectly fine commerical airliners that most "average" families are happy to travel in. I guess the creator of the internet (and self appointed creator of the universe) is too good for average.</p>

<p>Why does it say "Gore publicly conceded the election after the Supreme Court of the United States in Bush v. Gore ruled 5-4 that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts.". This is plainly incorrect. There were two rulings. In the first, the the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the ongoing recount procedure was unconstitutional owing to different standards that would be used in different parts of the state. It then halted further recounts by voting 5-4 to ban recounts using alternate procedures.</p>
<p>I understand that many folks have strong feelings for Al Gore, but isn't wikipedia supposed to be factual? This information used to be correct on this page.</p>

<p>This excerpt from the second paragraph really displays quite an attitude:</p>
<p>"Despite the fact that he won a plurality of the popular vote, with over half a million more votes than the Republican candidate George W. Bush, Gore ultimately lost the electoral college. A month of ballot recounts and court challenges in the state of Florida led the U. S. Supreme Court to end the highly disputed contest with its final ruling of Bush v. Gore, handing the electoral college victory, and consequently the presidency, to Bush.[1]"</p>
<p>Don't you think it would be much more neutral if it read:</p>
<p>"Gore lost the electoral college by XXX-YYY, despite the fact that he won a plurality of the popular vote, with ZZZZZ more votes than Bush ..."</p>
<p>We don't usually report that despite the fact that the Atlanta Braves soundly thrashed the NY Mets, with over 6 more hits and 2 more walks, they ultimately lost the run total. After 9 long innings, the umpires ended the hard fought contest with their final ruling in Braves vs. Mets, handing the final score, and consequently the game, to the Mets.</p>
<p>The rest of the paragraph contains obvious bias as well - "handing the victory..." In fact, the whole article is quite biased; compare with similar articles vs. say, Gingrich or Reagan.</p>
<p>Come on guys, think about it. What good is Wikipedia when articles about controversial public figures are biased and locked? This shouldn't be one more warzone for politics.</p>

<p>The article is locked, so that it can't be modified. Presumably, that would allow the editors to put back the accuracy, and remove the obvious point of view. Why hasn't that happened? The facts used to be accurately portrayed here, and the bias was far less obvious.</p>
