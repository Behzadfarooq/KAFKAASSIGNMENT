<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question about article size and pictures</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone agree/disagree with the following observation on my part--this article seems way too bloated and either needs cutting or to have portions spun off into separate articles, and _eight_ pictures is about five too many, even for a notable politician like Gore? Just curious if I'm alone here. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 00:44, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Some of the stuff in this article would be much better of under its own sections. As long as the images are relevant to the content however, I don't see a problem with it... --<a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikingstad_a5e4.html" title="User:Vikingstad">Vikingstad</a> 00:50, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I think this is going to be a recurring problem on Wikipedia--our article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is many times longer than our article on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Modern political figures always will get excessive attention relative to their historical importance; I think the best thing to do is roll with it. As for the pictures, you have a point. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> 00:59, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been trying to better cooperate with others and follow the rules. However, Anthony and Rick continue to lie and exaggerate about me. If they dedicated the energy that they use harassing me editing pages, the encyclopedia would be full. But just look at my profile page. I have edited quite a bit of pages in a short time. I just don't know what some people's problem is. They started this from the very begining against me and now I am trying to ignore it and continue to try to do better and they make it hard.

<dd>Chris, yes, you have been doing a great job at cooperating and doing this by the book. I commend you. Continue to work hard. Actions speak louder than words (although in wikipedia, actions ARE words....heh).

<dd>Yes, all I ask is to quite being harassed everytime I edit the page. I want the Gore Views section to stay along with the pics of Gore as a congressman, VP, running for Pres, and bearded.

<dd>Let's begin with these two disputed paragraphs. If you add them and anyone reverts you they will lose support for their actions and will have trouble explaining it in regards to a dispute with you.

<dd>Al and Tipper Gore have been a pair of the strongest voices for America's families. Each year the two host the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Re-Union_1389.html" title="Family Re-Union">Family Re-Union</a> policy conference in Nashville which has promotes new initiatives strengthening fatherhood, increasing flexibility for mothers and fathers in the workplace, and giving parents more control over information that comes into their homes. In 2002, the Gore's co-wrote two books about the modern American family. (<i>Joined at the Heart</i> and <i>Spirit of the Family</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For eight years as Vice President, Al Gore was a key member of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Clinton_d8be.html" title="President Clinton">President Clinton</a>'s economic team. Gore casted the tie-breaking Senate vote for the plan in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, which led to the first balanced budget in 30 years. Also to the credit of the Clinton-Gore administration is: the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history, with over 22 million new jobs, wages rising twice the rate of inflation, the lowest African-American and Hispanic poverty on record, the highest level of private home ownership ever, more investment in our cities, and the lowest unemployment in 29 years.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can they be rewritten to avoid a direct copy of the Gore campaign web site? How about this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Al and Tipper Gore host a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Re-Union_1389.html" title="Family Re-Union">Family Re-Union</a> policy conference in Nashville. This is where Al and Tipper are a strong voice for America's families through promotion of fatherhood, workplace flextime for parents, and control over what information can be accessed in their own home. Al and Tipper are co-authors of <i>Joined at the Heart</i> and <i>Spirit of the Family</i> about the modern American family.</dd>

<dd>The Clinton-Gore administration is credited by the Gore campaign with "<i>the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history, with over 22 million new jobs, wages rising twice the rate of inflation, the lowest African-American and Hispanic poverty on record, the highest level of private home ownership ever, more investment in our cities, and the lowest unemployment in 29 years.</i>" During his two terms as Vice President, Al Gore contributed as part of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Clinton_d8be.html" title="President Clinton">President Clinton</a>'s economic team and casted the deciding vote in the Senate in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> that led to the nations first balanced budget in 30 years.</dd>

<ul>
<li>What behavior is not going to fly? You (more specifically, Texture) asked for my suggestion. Chris has made a complete mess of the Al Gore page and dozens of other pages. Sorting through these pages to find out what is legit and what isn't is going to take a very long time, and the longer he is allowed to do this, the worse it's going to be. Reverting all of his edits now is the best solution. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony DiPierro</a> 05:21, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gore 2000 Website Issues</span></h2>
<p>I just got an email from arhcive.com which now houses the Al Gore campaign site of 2000 about use of it's content and here is what she says:</p>
<p><i>Hello,</i> Copyrights are a very tricky area of the law, and I am not a lawyer. Therefore I cannot answer you with a definite yes or no answer to your question. <b>The general terms of use for the site state that the</b> items on the site can be used for non-commercial use<b>. However you are still</b> dealing with potentially copyrighted information. It might be wise to try to get in contact with the people that used to run the site. They might still have an email address still working from the old site. Since it is for Gore, there is probably still some staffers or volunteers still working for him that were involved with the site.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, Astrid Bragg Office Manager Internet Archive astrid@archive.org</p>
<p>Really, I don't think any of the Gore people would care and as the lady said, as most campaign sites are, you can use it non commmercially.</p>

<dd>Chris, the content you submit must be written by you. If it's not written by you, then you should identify your source both in your submit comments as well as within the text as a reference. And then you can only submit works which are either <b>explicitly</b> released into the public domain, or <b>explicitly</b> released under the GFDL. Alternatively, you can sometimes submit content which was created before 1923, but that gets tricky. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony DiPierro</a> 13:43, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gore's grandfather</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps we could open this entry briefly to correct a clerical error? Al Gore was not the grandson of Senator Thomas Gore; his grandparents were Allen Gore and Margie Denny. Allen Gore was a farmer in Tennessee, and, as far as can be told, had no relation to the Senator from Oklahoma. <a href="../../../t/m/i/User%7ETMiscia_e99e.html" title="User:TMiscia">TMiscia</a> March 25, 2004</p>
<p>I've made this fix on the temporary page. Perhaps Gore was confused with <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore_Vidal_7281.html" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>. -<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.13.224.74.html" title="User:24.13.224.74">24.13.224.74</a> 23:27, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, I appreciate it. I didn't want people to get confused on that point. Al Gore being Gore Vidal's first cousin would've made quite a story if it were true, though. -<a href="../../../t/m/i/User%7ETMiscia_e99e.html" title="User:TMiscia">TMiscia</a> 1:36, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gee, Vidal's one of those who thinks he's cousin (degree never specified) to AG ... but <a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/wreitwiesn/candidates2000/gore.html" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/wreitwiesn/candidates2000/gore.html" rel="nofollow">this trace</a> of the ancestry finds no New World relation in the Gores. (But it did find AG and Nixon are cousins (~8th degree), which would doubtless delight Vidal =) 142.177.121.225 15:34, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>From what i can gather, from the page you noted Anthony, Chris used a quote by Al Gore. Its verbatim, because its a quote. In the article is signaled with "" and atributed to Gore. I see no problem with it. Anthony, can you point precisely the copyvio you are sugesting, except this quote? Chris, can you stop insulting people in edit summaries?

<p>Chris, when you copy something from another page, even if you change a few words around, you still have to acknowledge your source, and you should not claim that you wrote it, doing so is plagiarism. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony DiPierro</a> 01:37, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your point is? That is not plagirism! You need to re take you so called law classes. Those sentences are nothing alike and are far from plagirism.

<dd>Look, it's not about this particular contribution. This is the tip of the iceberg. Nearly every single time Chris writes something, it's from somewhere else. The times I don't find evidence of his plagiarism, it's probably just that I haven't searched enough. And then, even after he is challenged, he lies and says that he wrote it himself. Even when presented with direct evidence, he claims that it's some sort of coincidence that his sentence just happens to be exactly the same with a few words added to make it more difficult to detect. I shouldn't have to chase down every single instance and point out exactly where it came from. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony DiPierro</a> 02:11, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<p>Anthony, it would be desirable if you would compile a page such as Wikipedia:Matter of Chris Jackson evidence where you would collect such instances, with diffs and the sources where they are from. I am sure that as soon as there is some evidence, other people will start to help you.</p>
<p>Chris, if Anthony is indeed correct, it would be best to just admit it now and pledge not to copy and paste in the future. We won't hold it against you. If you do so we can go through your contributions together and remove/rewrite any instances of copy and pasting from the past. If he is incorrect you can of course lay back and wait for him to come up with evidence which you say does not exist; however, if it turns out that you deliberately deceived us, it is quite likely that sanctions will follow.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 02:15, Mar 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anthony you are the liar. I did write the stuff I added. Of course I had sources, but those are my words besides the quotes.

<p>Gore has mostly been a behind-the-scenes player. Early in Clinton's first term, the president enlisted Gore to study the entire federal government to pinpoint wasteful areas. Gore's National Performance Review guided Clinton when he downsized the government. The vice president was also instrumental in the passage of 1993's North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

<li>Chris, will you please refrain from insults and personal attacks? If you have such admiration for Al Gore, take a lesson from him. As upset as Gore got in his political career, he did not stoop to the level of name calling and insulting. He kept his cool. Think always, Chris: What would Al do? <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 02:45, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<li>No one harrassed Al Gore as this person does me along with others here. If they had, I am sure they would have been put away. Namecalling is common in politics all the time and this is no different. He lies and exaggerates to make his points and just loves edit wars. The only person in politics he can be compared to is probably Ken Starr or Newt Gingrich.

<li>Yea the right wing ate him up in 2000, but he kept his cool. However, I feel that might of contributed to his loss by not refuting their lies and exaggerating.

<p>"Although Gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than <b>500,000 votes</b>, he eventually lost the election by 5 electoral votes, with the outcome ultimately decided by the few hundred votes in Florida. In the end, Gore recieved the most votes of any Democrat in U.S. history."</p>
<p>I removed the bolding. It's unnecessary. I took out "eventually". Also unnecessary (and somewhat misleading, he lost, not eventually, at the time of the electoral college vote, same as any other election). I also removed "the outcome ultimately decided by the few hundred votes in Florida." This is awkwardly phrased. The outcome was decided by <b>many</b> factors. The election hinged on Florida no more than any other state with at least 5 electoral votes. The election hinged on the Supreme Court. The election hinged on Nader. The election hinged on Katherine Harris certifying the vote. The election hinged on the butterfly ballot. I had tried phrasing it as "A swing of only a few hundred popular votes in Florda would have caused the election to go the other way" but this was not accepted by ChrisDJackson. Finally, in the last sentence, I removed "In the end". Again, unnecessary, somewhat POV, and misleading.

<dd>If two baseball teams are tied going into the last day of the season, and one wins its game while the other loses, it's common to say that the last game decided the pennant. Logically, one might argue that the pennant was decided on the day back in July when the eventual winner swept a doubleheader from the eventual loser, thus swinging two games in the standings, not just one. Nevertheless, it's fairly common to point to the last-in-time event as the decisive one. By analogy, I think Chris's emphasis on Florida is correct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To accommodate Anthony's objection, though, the reference should make clear that the disposition of the Florida electoral votes was decided <i>after</i> all the other factors, such as Nader, had worked their influence.
