<p>Al Capone went to Chicago and actually worked for Big Jim THAT RAT Colossimo who was the number one brothel operator in Chicago and quite successful. Torrio was not the leader of what was then Colossimo's operation. Torrio was Colissimo's underling. When Prohibition started, Capone and Torrio tried in vain to get Big Jim into bootlegging. Big Jim was too fat and happy being a night club owner and did not want to "branch out." There were other reasons but my crime books are in storage. Capone and Torrio had had enough and decided that Colossimo was standing in their way of making the really big money in illegal alcohol. They had him killed and took over.</p>
<p>The leaders of the north siders were Dion O'Banion who was killed by the Capones, then Hymie Weiss took over but was also murdered, then Bugs Moran. At some point (I think between O'Banion and Weiss) there was a guy named "Schemer" Drucci, but I can't remember for sure where he fits in. This article needs work, but I don't have the time and all my references are in storage. Oakridgetn1947 02:18, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Capone was living lavishly in Palm Beach, and assigned one of his top associates "Machine Gun" McGurn to mastermind the hit. McGurn had one of his bootleggers lure members of the Moran gang into a garage to buy liquor at an unreasonably cheap price. The deal was made and the delivery was scheduled to take place on Valentines Day. McGurn and his men awaited them in stolen police uniforms. When they arrived, McGurn's gang pretended to be police making a bust, and ordered all of Moran's men to stand facing the wall. Thinking that they had just been caught by police, seven members of the Moran gang turned to the wall awaiting arrest. McGurn and his men opened fire with machine guns, fatally killing the gangsters. Bugs, who saw the police car before stopping and thought it was a raid, fled the scene. Capone was credited with what would be deemed one of the most famous mass murders in American history, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

<p>The Ness article states that Capone was charged with 22 violations rather than the 23 mentioned here. Also, it says that he was sentenced to 11 years instead of 10. Can someone check which of these is correct?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Laurence Bergreen in his biography, "Capone: The Man &amp; The Era" gives 22 counts and explains that Capone had to serve 10 years in federal prison plus one year in county prison (which he served first) - which equals 11 years total. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.247.155.203 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.155.203_6d7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.155.203">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>I read "somewhere" that Capone had a phobia about medical needles - and so refused treatment for his syphilis. Any comments?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, Capone picked up syphillis before penicillin was invented. I have read that treatment for that disease was and ordeal but did not include any injections. But, of course, I can't add any references, so my comment stays on the discussion page. I think treatment included small doses of arsenic. Oakridgetn1947 02:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, you are both right in a way. Capone did dislike needles. When he first went to prison, he was given a thorough medical examination. When the doctors diagnosed Capone with syphillis, he told them that it had been cured and that a spinal tap to determine if he was still infected, (which involved needles), was unnessecary. Once Penicillin was discovered, he took the treatment one hundred percent willingly, (It didn't involve needles). Capone was fully treated of the disease in 1942, but by then he had already suffered severe brain damage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the book I read on Capone. "Al Capone - The Life and Times" I read that his own personal physician came to Al Capone and told him a woman who Al had had relations with had recently been treated for syphillis. Al refused the origianl treatment his doctor recommended for him which later caused the complications. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.39.163.114 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.39.163.114.html" title="User talk:24.39.163.114">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.39.163.114_fc7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.39.163.114">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
