<dd>His A&amp;E Biography from 2001 says his mother, Ida Neidel, came from Russia to the US in 1913 at age 16. She met Alexander Meister, also Russian-born, and they married in 1922. Al(bert) Meister was born on April 30, 1923 and they settled into the Jewish ghetto of Brownsville. His later born brothers were Philip and Henry. Alexander died in 1929 and Ida in 1950. His sons are David, Ted and Paul Lewis. The only document the Biography actually shows with his birthdate is a school registration card from Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn (which he dropped out of in his junior year). The Biography also confirms his enlistment in the Merchant Marines during World War II. Gardn108 07:47, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good information! Thanks for posting that. The 1920 U.S. census does have an Alex Meister, age 26, single, residing in Detroit, Michigan. Occupation: welder, steel co.

<p>Feb 5, 2006: Al Lewis' son, Ted Lewis, is stating that his father was born in 1923 and not 1910. This should settle the dispute. Here is the the link: <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OBIT_LEWIS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2006-02-04-23-48-28" class="external free" title="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OBIT_LEWIS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2006-02-04-23-48-28" rel="nofollow">http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OBIT_LEWIS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2006-02-04-23-48-28</a> (Dead Link: 12/21/2006)</p>

The obits say he was 95, so I have adjusted the birthdate back to 1910, since that would make the correct age. Also did he die Feb 3 or 4? We have a conflict in the article. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebdj_16b6.html" title="User:Thebdj">Thebdj</a> 20:09, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be some dispute about his birth name. We report it here as Albert, but the Yahoo article of his passing (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060204/ap_on_en_tv/obit_lewis" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060204/ap_on_en_tv/obit_lewis" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) says it is Alexander. Do we know which is right? MrB 20:15, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Okay, before we start changing over and over again. We have an argument over the birth year. Now, ever obituary printed thus far states his age as 95. The two references to the contrary point to one site that does not provide an actual year just says 1910 isn't right. The other is a newgroup that mentions 1923 from an episode of Biography. Now, we obviously should try to find the correct date because there are plenty more sources in favor of 1910 then 1923. If anyone knows where we can get "undeniable" proof of age we can solve this problem outright, but it does need to be addressed. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebdj_16b6.html" title="User:Thebdj">Thebdj</a> 20:21, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, if we go with 1923 as his year of birth we should ignore any other bio information in the article. Otherwise we are talking about a 6 yr old circus performer getting a PhD at 18. While I suppose neither are totally absurd, they are both unlikely and are common bios based on the "false" birth date.</dd>

<p>CNN just reported that he died at age 83... Don't know what to think now.</p>

<p>In a 1997 interview Al Lewis said he was born 30 April 1910. He started in show business in 1923.

<p>Note that AP is now using 1923 as the birth year, citing Lewis' son. If it were me, I'd sure want to see some paperwork as proof.

<p>I inclined to believe that he was born in 1910 and lied at some point to appear younger when it was to his advantage to advance his career, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If he were born in 1923, he would have been at prime age to be drafted to serve during World War II and, as far as I can tell, none of the bios or obits mention any military service or even alternative state-side service during the War. Even if he were declared ineligible for military service, all American men born in 1923 were directly affected by World War II.</li>
<li>His bio claims he was a member of the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacco_and_Vanzetti_5e12.html" title="Sacco and Vanzetti">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> Defense Committee as a young man. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in 1927. Lewis would have been all of four years old.</li>
<li>As others have mentioned, if he were born in 1923, he would have earned a PhD at age 18. Even given that people sometimes earned college and advanced degrees at younger ages years ago, that seems quite unlikely given the other activities he was engaged in in his early days. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 08:15, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yup, should be interesting, although if were actually born in 1910 there wouldn't have been any <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_number_6651.html" title="Social Security number">Social_Security_number</a> to apply for when he was 16-18, since these didn't start being issued until 1937, though I do think it's perfectly conceivable that he has been lying for many decades. I think Columbia would have come forward by now if he didn't actually have a PhD, but they wouldn't have challenged, or even known, that he clamed he was 31 when he was really 18. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 09:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The same article that you are quoting that says Columbia has no record of his Ph.D. does say he graduated from high school in 1927. The information from Columbia that came out during the gubernational campain was just what I was looking to debunk that Columbia claim. I never said he was not born in 1910. I think he was. We don't know if he needed or wanted retirement benefits, by way.

<p>I always have a good time on Wikipedia whenever someone famous dies - especially someone who was born way back when. There's always a huge debate on their birth dates, which for whatever reason are always bungled by the press, media or the person themselves. Even <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Penn_65c0.html" title="Chris Penn">Chris Penn</a> has a similar situation and the recently deceased <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelley_Winters_92e3.html" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a> did as well. It just makes you wonder - exactly how many (live) people are out there on Wikipedia right now with incorrect birth dates that no one will notice until they die?&#160;::Honestly, though - we just need to find someone who has a subscription to rootsweb.com or one of those birth-certificate sites. Al Lewis - i.e. Albert Meister - should be listed under one of the census' or whatnot. It's not that common a name. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 05:39, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

More common than you think. I could find no Albert Meisters born in <i>exactly</i> 1910 or 1923 in the 1930 US Census at Ancestry.com. Several near misses on both years, however, and over 100 Albert Meisters alive at the time. It is possible even his real name is obscured somehow - it wouldn't make him an "enormous liar", as entertainers of his generation often fabricated bios, a kind of industry custom. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the U.S. census taken on January 1, 1920, I do find an "Alex Meister", age 8 (hence, born 1911). He was living with his parents, Yiddish-speaking immigrants, at 39 Watkins St., which is in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. There were only five people named Alex— Meister in the 1920 U.S. census, and the others were living in Kansas (born 1903); Michigan (1893); Lancaster, New York (1918); and Wisconsin (1891).</dd>

<p>When the news of this guy dying hit the AP, I checked out his page here at Wikipedia. It correctly mentioned that the guy had given his birthdate as 1910 but he was really born in 1923. I thought it really funny the the whole press got this bit wrong (at first, nobody else even disputed it), but once again Wikipedia got it right - and even explained why everyone else was mistaken. Then Wikipedia changed it... because everyone else had it wrong, so they had to get it wrong too? I'm disappointed. People should have showed more restraint when editing. And the people who run wikipedia should have locked down this article soon after the guy died, since the original information was most likely accurate and written without an agenda.</p>

<dd>We don't have a monopoly on what's correct. The only true information will be a birth certificate. Even his marriage certificates can have the wrong age.

I found 60 articles in the NYT form 1921 to 1927 mentioning the Sacco and Venzetti Defense Committee. Not one mentioned an Al Lewis or anyone named Meister. Meister is probably his original last name. This obit of his brother Philip Meister mentions Al Lewis. His brother would have been born around 1927. So if anyone has access to the 1930 census records, they could find Philip Meister (likely in New York City) then look for a nearby record for an Al (or Albert or Alex).

<dd>The Philip Meister who died in April 1982 was born on 9 July 1926, and his Social Security number was issued in the state of New York in 1936-1950. I have looked for him in the 1930 U.S. census, as indexed at Ancestry.com, even using Soundex variations on the surname Meister, and Phil— as the first name. The only result was a Philip Meister, age 3 years 8 months (hence born between 2 July 1926 and 1 August 1926), a resident of the Home for Hebrew Infants in the Bronx, New York City. He was born in New York and his parents were born in Russia. But there is no other Meister in that institution. The only Albert Meister in the 1930 U.S. census who was born within two years of 1923 is an Albert W. Meister, age 6, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, who has no brothers named Henry or Philip, and whose parents were born in Minnesota. And the only Alex— Meister in the 1930 U.S. census born within two years of 1923 lived near Madison, Wisconsin, with no siblings Henry or Philip. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 02:59, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I phoned Columbia University today, both the Alumni Relations Office and the Registrar's Office. Both offices informed me that all degree and enrollment verifications are done through the National Student Clearinghouse, a private organization housed online at degreeverify.com. They charge for this service. I'm curious to determine if Al Lewis, Albert Meister, or Alexander Meister earned a degree from Columbia but I don't want to pay for this information.

Although my librarian told me the results aren't 100% accurate because not all dissertations and theses make it in (though just for kicks I checked my own and it was there). Anyway, the results for author=Lewis school=Columbia are, of course, a bit longer because you can't, or I don't know how, to limit the placement of Lewis to just the last name. I'll see what I can find. My guess is that if he did not earn the degree, he may have taken some courses and maybe went on to make some donations to Columbia which is why the univeristy has turned a blind eye to his public declarations of a Ph.D. Universities do that all the time. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 20:00, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Lewis has also been criticized for misstating his age on a voter registration form-claiming to be 75 rather than 88-which he chalked up to an attempt to 'counter the rampant age discrimination in the entertainment business,' according to The Times." Seems even Al admits to manipulating his age. Although it's kind of weird that he'd think 75 would be seen as significantly younger than 88 in this age-obsessed society. <a href="http://newtimes.rway.com/1998/102898/cover.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://newtimes.rway.com/1998/102898/cover.shtml" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Gibbative 02:33, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a person in the U.S. census taken on April 1, 1930, who fits a 1910 birth. Albert Meister, age 19 (hence, born between April 2, 1910 and April 1, 1911) was living with his widowed mother Elma Meister and two sisters in Ozone Park, Queens, New York. His occupation was "checker, stock exchange". He was born in the state of New York. (Queens Co., New York, enumeration district 483, p. 9-A, family 120.) I also find him in the U.S. census taken on January 1, 1920. Albert Meister, age 9 (hence, born in 1910) was living with his parents John and Elma Meister and his sisters in Brooklyn, New York. John's occupation was "carpenter". (Kings Co., New York, enumeration district 1420, p. 13-A, family 263.) — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 21:42, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This seems like it would be the right record. I don't think things are heavily leaning in favor of him being born in 1910; in the interview/news story that's in the external links, it mentions how he once lied on a voter registration card, putting his age as 75 (it was really 88) because of age discrimination in the showbiz industry. I'm not sure how true that is or not, but it could certainly account for the (1923-1910=13) confusion over his birth date. 71.10.26.170 05:02, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think this is the fellow (based on his birthdate) is recorded in the death index as having passed in 2002, hence not Al Lewis. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't be so sure about that. The individual who died in 2002 was born in 1911, not 1910 (I do realize that early 1911 is within the time frame set by Walloon above, but there doesn't seem to be any argument over the fact that he was born on April 30th, whether it was actually 1910 or 1923, so the 2002 guy doesn't fit). Also, the guy that died in 2002 was born in Hamburg, NY, which is clear across the state over by Lake Erie. Plus, Walloon's info above fits with the little we know about his childhood - namely that heis mother was windowed when he was a child. 71.10.26.170 19:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One thing working against that person being Al Lewis is that in both 1920 and 1930, Albert Meister's mother Elma is listed as having been born in the state of New York, as were her parents.

<p>//I have seen incorrect, (or at least in conflict with date on their headstone), Social Security listings for personal friends. Perhaps it was poor secretarial work, in any case, not the final piece of evidence.//</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps your friends have been deceptive with you about their real age, or the person that gave the tombstone cutter the date was wrong. For Social Security you have to present them with a copy of a birth certificate. It is possible to have a clerical error in their database, but short of seeing a birth certificate, they are the authority. Some people don't have birth certificates, they were born at home in a rural area or born abroad, or the paper was lost in the San Francisco earthquake. For older people you first sign up for social security you fill out a form and supply your name and birthdate and your parent's name. Now when you fill in a form for a SS number you have to mail in a copy of the birth certificate, or bring it in to the SS office. You can send away for a copy of the application for anyone that is dead for around $30, it used to be $7. When it comes time to collect, or get a new card, you have to send them in your birth certificate. Tombstones rely on the next of kin to supply the date, just like in a death certificate, and the reliability depends on how knowledgeable the person they ask is. My guess is that Grandpa Al's death certificate will not contain his parent's names or a reliable birthday. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 16:40, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did we go back to saying he worked on Sacco and Scottsboro? I am going to change the wording again if I don't hear any objections. He would have been 7 years old in 1930, if the 1923 birth date is correct. And why do we need sentences explaining who Sacco and the Scottsboro boys were, when they are already linked to full explanations. In a small biography such as this discussion of these two topics seems out of place.

Oh, and you said "less careful readers, who might take 1910 as authorative". Well, there's absolutely nothing in the article that mentions 1910 without mentioning 1923 in the same sentence.

<dd>perhaps his father left when he was young, or he was illegitimate and never even knew who he was? That might explain the vagueness. Arniep 15:37, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

The column does say that Al was in fact born in 1923, but this little summary of it which I found doesn't repeat what the evidence that the columnist used (if any) to reach this conclusion was. I'd still say we should wait until the SS death certificate is available before we make any final conclusions. Just because a columnist in the NY Times says it's true doesn't make it fact. But it certainly does lead more credence to the 1923 DOB. 71.10.26.170 05:59, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, Whose Grandpa Didn't Tell Some Tales?</p>
<p>Dan Barry, NY Times</p>
<p>NEWSPAPERS across the country, including this one, published a small correction a few days ago. Al Lewis, the actor who played Grandpa in <i>The Munsters,</i> died on Roosevelt Island last week at the age of 82. He was not, repeat, not 95.</p>
<p>A 13-year discrepancy in the age of a minor celebrity poses no threat to the well-being of our nation. Nor does it silence the laughter that Mr. Lewis continues to coax from us through sitcom perpetuity, or diminish the passion he demonstrated as an advocate for reform and the Green Party candidate for governor in 1998, when he was 88 -- that is, 75.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis was both Grandpa and another <i>drum major for</i> justice, <i>said his friend, the Rev. Lawrence Lucas, a Roman</i> Catholic priest. <i>Al challenged the system.</i></p>
<p>But he also challenged the concept of chronology. Judging by interviews he gave over the years, much of Mr. Lewis's life was a kind of performance from which he could never retire. Even when not in makeup or costume, he still wore a mask.</p>
<p>Actors who lie about their age usually subtract, not add, years, and few would have the nerve to fudge those years by more than a decade. But at some point Mr. Lewis began to claim that he was born in 1910, when he was actually born in 1923. In other words, he was 13 years old by the time he was born.</p>
<p>Why? The prevailing theory holds that in 1964, when he was vying for the role as ancient Grandpa, Mr. Lewis worried that he might lose the job because he was actually younger than Yvonne De Carlo, the actress who would be playing his daughter, Lily. So he aged himself, a lot, in a ruse no doubt abetted by his rubbery face.</p>
<p>This little lie may not have mattered much at the time. But as the years passed, and as Lewis emerged in New York as a cranky radio talk-show host and freewheeling candidate, he apparently chose to flesh out those 13 phantom years of his.</p>
<p>He was said to have been born Alexander or Albert Meister in 1910, in the upstate town of Wolcott; officials there say they have no record of any Meister. After moving to Brooklyn, he was said to have worked on the defense committee for Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian anarchists who were executed in 1927; challenging work for a child of 4.</p>
<p>When Lewis talked about the 1930's, he described himself not as a boy growing into long pants, but as an adventurous man, always in the mix of history. He said that he worked as a radio actor, circus clown, trapeze artist, medicine show <i>professor,</i> and union organizer in the South, where, he once said, <i>you faced death at any moment.</i></p>
<p>He said that he appeared in Olsen and Johnson's <i>Hellzapoppin',</i> the Broadway hit of 1938. He said that he championed the cause of the Scottsboro Boys, nine black teenagers who were accused of raping two white women in a profoundly flawed case.</p>
<p>All this while he was working on a doctorate in child psychology, which he was said to have earned at Columbia University in 1941 -- or 1949. The university, though, has no record of this.</p>
<p>Lewis also said that he was a merchant seaman who had to abandon a torpedoed ship not once, but twice. <i>You don't</i> know what it's like to be in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, <i>he told The Shadow, an alternative newspaper, in</i> 1997. <i>There is no more lonely feeling. You see nothing,</i> nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>MAYBE this was true. Maybe Mr. Lewis did meet Charlie Chaplin at John Garfield's house, as he claimed. Maybe he did ride shotgun while escorting W. E. B. DuBois to the burial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Maybe he did retain Charles Manson as a baby sitter.</p>
<p>Or maybe he was just acting. Captive to his minor deceit, perhaps he chose to pose as a witness to American history: to remind people of the deprivations of the Depression, which he experienced, but also to keep certain events from slipping from the nation's memory. Sacco and Vanzetti. The Scottsboro Boys. The labor wars. The Rosenbergs. Even two zany comedians, long forgotten: Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson.</p>
<p>Butch Patrick, who played Mr. Lewis's television grandson, Eddie Munster, and in recent years appeared with him at conventions and car shows, described his former co-star as an entertainer above all, eager to tell people what they wanted to hear.</p>
<p><i>He was well read, and the information he was throwing out</i> there was accurate, <i>he said.</i> He just placed himself there so the credibility level would be there. That's my spin on it.</p>
<p>There is no question that in his later years, which were not as late as they seemed, Mr. Lewis backed up his strong convictions with his presence and his money. He advocated prison reform, vigorously opposed the Rockefeller drug laws as unnecessarily punitive, and argued both against police brutality and for police salary increases.</p>
<p>His energy and passion seemed especially remarkable given his, uuh, age, which few doubted. Father Lucas vividly recalled attending Mr. Lewis's 90th birthday party, when Mr. Lewis was 77.</p>
<p>Even Karen Lewis, his wife of more than two decades, believed that her husband was in his 90's. That is, until his health began to fail a couple of years ago, and she came across what she called <i>evidence</i> while collecting documents for his hospitalization.</p>
<p><i>He always told me he was born in 1910,</i> she said. <i>But I</i> don't think it matters at all.</p>
<p>Maybe she's right. Maybe it was just Grandpa being Grandpa. " <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 07:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Um, I had feelings of deja vu while reading Barry's article. Much of it seemed to be composed from the Wiki article, mostly the leading part of it, in the fact order and phrasing.
