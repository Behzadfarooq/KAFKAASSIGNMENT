<p>The funny thing about the Fametracker web site is that I created the Photoshopped image they use for my (long since defunct) Golden Horde: The Al Leong Fan Club web site. I don't begrudge them using it, of course: I'm glad someone out there is paying Al the respect he deserves.</p>
<p>I have put all of the filmographic data I have online. Note: some of this is written tongue-in-cheek, and may need a bit of revision to be appropriate for an encyclopedia entry. There are a few gaps. Maybe someone can fill those in. My next step is to go through and Wiki-link the more interesting cross-references (e.g., <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Sidaris_70f0.html" title="Andy Sidaris">Andy Sidaris</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambo.html" title="Rambo">Rambo</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>).

<dd>This isn't an encyclopedia: it doesn't have fact-checking or a real editor. Real encyclopedias don't let any moron edit any article they want. This is a glorified blog, not an encyclopedia.

<dd>I checked your userpage, and knowing that you're familiar with Wikipedia saves me some typing-of-the-obvious. So lemme cut to the chase and ask, if you're so worked up about how unprofessional this project is, why are you getting offended about someone stating the obvious in that "Way to go, Al!" doesn't belong in an entry? Why not create a private webpage where you can write all the slavering fanboy prose you want? You burned out on WP, fine, you're not alone, but WP isn't yours exclusively and you don't have the right to subvert the last remaining articles in which you have interest.<br /></dd>
<dd>One solution to "improving" this article's POV and unencyclopedic violations would be to remove all the offending sections until someone comes up with something better. That has the potential to start an edit war, and I read that you're tired of that kind of bs, and I have no interest in it either. Instead of that, I'll keep it confined to this talk page, and hope that another editor comes along and realizes that work needs to be done here.

<dd>Adding a left brace at the beginning of the first table seems to help, but then the table is way too wide and for some reason everything from <i>Black Rain</i> onward is boldfaced, if I do that.

<dd>Feel free to delete anything that is not verifiable. Feel free to rephrase anything that is not NPOV. Feel free to delete anything that isn't notable and relevant to this article. However, Leong's dialogue <b>is</b> notable, because it is one of the distinguishing characteristics of his roles -- his dialogue, or lack thereof, is part of what makes Leong himself notable. Removing Leong's dialogue from the article would be like removing the paintings from the article on <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_van_Gogh_769c.html" title="Vincent van Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> -- it would eliminate a major portion of what makes the article relevant to its subject. As for removing the synopses, that would be acceptable as long as the verifiable information contained in them is moved to another Wikipedia article (one for each film, presumably). However, be aware that since one of Leong's signature attributes is that he is a bit player, Leong's appearance in a film might <i>not</i> be notable in an article devoted to that film, while it <i>is</i> notable in an article devoted to Leong himself. Ergo, much of what is currently contained in the film synopses may be notable only within the context of <i>this</i> article -- and thus, should <i>stay</i> in this article. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/b/l/User_talk%7EBblackmoor_cd2b.html" title="User talk:Bblackmoor">(talk)</a></small></sup> 04:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You do not think Wikipedia is an appropriate place for detailed, verifiable, NPOV information? I will respectfully agree to disagree. As for "shoving something down your throat", no one is forcing you to read an article in which you clearly have no interest. There are much longer articles on Wikipedia than this one, which do not interest me. Should I go and delete large portions of them for that reason?

Entire lists of dialogue and descriptions of characters which don't even have names are completely irrelevant and make this article very difficult to read.

<dd>There is no need to defend this article's length in comparison to the length of any other Wikipedia article: that is not a relevant concern. However, if you would like work on Spielberg's article to make it longer, then of course you should feel free to do so. Incidentally, "elucidate" does not mean what you appear to think it means. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/b/l/User_talk%7EBblackmoor_cd2b.html" title="User talk:Bblackmoor">(talk)</a></small></sup> 15:39, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I enjoyed reading this article. Seeing every death of a career villain listed in a row is a kick, and a chart like the one on this page would fit in very well on a "bad movies" site. However, it doesn't really belong on Wikipedia, even if it's verifiable, interesting, and funny. It's not about length so much as whether the content is encyclopedic or not. I have no problem with the Al Leong article being as long or longer than Steven Spielberg's, but if the content is a chart of funny quotes, lengthy descriptions of roles, and causes of death, then it really belongs on a humor/movie buff site rather than an encyclopedia. <font face="georgia"><a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnurks_9a10.html" title="User:Snurks">Snurks</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/n/u/User_talk%7ESnurks_2400.html" title="User talk:Snurks">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snurks_439e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snurks">C</a></sup></small></font> 21:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. Providing a comprehensive reference is an encyclopedia's <i>raison d'etre</i>. There is no precedent, as far as I know, for excluding verifiable information from Wikipedia simply because the topic is related to pop culture.

<dd>The list is indiscriminate, in that it makes no attempt to put the filmography into any context of notability. This goes against the letter of wikipedia, and perhaps, more importantly, against the spirit. The inclusion of a synopsis for each film is redundant - this is covered in the the entry for each film (where there is one). I've cleaned up the section inline with my previous suggestion&#160;:: <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincess_Tiswas_8ce5.html" title="User:Princess Tiswas">Princess Tiswas</a> 19:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Leong's filmography is not indiscriminate -- the discriminating factor is that it's a list of films in which he has appeared. Nor are the synopses of the films redundant with the listings for the films themselves: as has already been pointed out, one of the earmarks of Leong's appearances is that he plays minor characters who nearly always die, and who would ordinarily not even be mentioned in a film's conventional synopsis.

<dd>I've reverted the changes back to the previous version, for the very reasons given above. The inclusion of pedantic minutae to illustrate a point merely adds bloat.

<p>I have reverted Mr Tan's edit, where he replaced the "Asian-American Actor" category with "Chinese-American Actor". I reverted it because although Leong looks Asian (and I suppose that's important to some people), we have no evidence or references to verify the assertion that Leong identifies himself as "Chinese-American". Personally, I find the introduction of categories like "Asian-American" and "Chinese-American" offensive and inappropriate. On the one hand, he was born in the USA, and he's a US citizen. That makes him an American. No hyphen. On the other hand, categories like "Asian-American" are meaningless: the vast bulk of the people living in the USA have ancestors from numerous continents. The whole concept of "[whatever]-American" is inane, in my opinion. However, I have simply reverted the category instead of deleting it, because I know I am outnumbered by those who think such a category is relevant. -- -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/b/l/User_talk%7EBblackmoor_cd2b.html" title="User talk:Bblackmoor">(talk)</a></small></sup> 20:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Racism is shameful. An American is an American. However, if you cite a source that verifies that Leong identifies himself as "Chinese American", then that assertion can stay in the article.

<p>I know that Bblackmoor cares deeply about this article, but in the process of adding wikilinks, I had to change some of the more tongue-in-cheek and colloquial turns of phrase.
