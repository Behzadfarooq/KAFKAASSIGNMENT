<p>I did not authorize this web page. This page was apparently uploaded by nathan.com who then blocked any editing for both this page and that of my cousin Marc Coppola who is my opponent in the September 12, 2006 primary. This version is distinctly unflattering. My true resume' follows:</p>
<p>General: Al Coppola is a lifelong Buffalo resident and former businessman who represented Buffalo’s Delaware District as Council member for 17 years He both served the region as State Senator and was Director of Senior Services of Buffalo. Councilman Coppola originally ran for the Buffalo Common Council in order to help individual members of the public who were in danger of being overrun by the huge City and NFTA bureaucracy. He owned a restaurant whose business was severely impacted by the Buffalo Main Street transit construction. Al’s no-nonsense reputation is built on strong results-oriented constituent service, bold stands on alternative energy sources to stimulate the local economy, tough environmental proposals and intense scrutiny of government budget, contracts and standards of integrity.</p>
<p>When the Buffalo Common Council voted for their pay raise, Al Copploa refused his $10,000.</p>
<p>When the Buffalo Common Council voted for the garbage tax, Al Coppola voted no.</p>
<p>Al helped lead the way in developing Buffalo’s recycling program and spearheaded the Buffalo Common Council’s Medical Waste Task Force, resulting in safe disposal of hazardous waste. He oversaw the rehabilitation of Delaware Park’s Casino, facilitated Canisius College’s Delavan townhouses and blew the whistle on Parks Department fraud. He had proposals for waterfront development, a plan to municipalize electric service to lower local energy rates and a vision of a healthy, developing Western New York. Through his efforts, over $2 million in Niagara Mohawk overcharges were recovered for Buffalo and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>In his one year in the State Senate, Al sponsored a bill to eliminate tolls at Grand Island’s bridges; proposed a referendum on local casino gambling and supported expansions of Epic coverage and health benefits for working families, extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit, a state aid increase to public schools, legislation increasing penalties for crimes against children and passage of the Pesticide 48 Hour Notification Bill. He brought back $45 million to finally settle the 8 year long lawsuit between the Buffalo Board of Education and the Buffalo Teacher’s Federation, successfully sponsored a bill allowing Niagara Falls to broaden their search area for skilled workers and was part of passing a budget that was only 14 days late.</p>
<p>Committed to our Western New York Community, Al is a member of the Knight of Columbus, North Buffalo Kiwanis, Grand Island Moose and Father Flanagan’s Boys and Girls Town. He also serves on the Boards of the Energy Cooperative of New York, Benedict House and Alleyway Theater.</p>
<p>Al Coppola has been happily married to his wife, the former Carol Grabski, for 40 years, and they are the parents of three adult children</p>
<p>On Energy:</p>
<p>“As part of the relicensing of the Niagara Project, I was the first to propose that the New York Power Authority, in order to mitigate its impact on the American river shore, both establish the Niagara Greenway and make a substantial contribution to Buffalo Outer Harbor development. Historically the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigated claims that the Power Authority had contributed to ice related flooding on the upper river. The Power Authority changed its operating practices as a result. Concerning the Greenway, I reminded the Power Authority is that this is exactly what Ontario Power has been funding for decades on their side of the Niagara River.</p>
<p>The promise to fund the Outer Harbor initiative occurred following my published criticisms of the impacts of the ice boom on Erie County and Buffalo's Outer Harbor. I pointed out that the site that NYPA uses to store and maintain the boom was a real eye sore and a major impediment to up scale construction.</p>
<p>Both measures will result in the Authority's contributing on the order of one-half billion dollars to the region for the life of the renewed license.</p>
<p>While on the Buffalo Council, I insisted on an independent energy audit through Troy and Banks that resulted in a refund to Buffalo of nearly $2 million in overcharges for non-existent lighting. Now NiMo policy includes checking lights at night instead of day to ensure they work and Buffalo has an accurate accounting of its infrastructure.</p>
<p>I’ve been a believer in public power for years – it could save homeowners and local businesses significant amounts on their bills, and help stimulate the local economy. As one of the founders of the Energy Cooperative of WNY, and a current Board Member, I know that we have saved businesses 8% off their gas and electric bills over the past 6 years.</p>
<p>On a Buffalo Casino:</p>
<p>I originally was in favor of a ballot initiative that would let the voters decide whether or not they wanted another casino in the region. Since then I have studied the impact of the Seneca Casino in Niagara Falls. The neighborhoods surrounding it are as blighted as ever and there is no sign of any economic activity. I noticed the same effect in Atlantic City. The gambling halls do not want their patrons to leave the premises for any purpose once they have arrived.</p>
<p><br />
On Government Corruption and Abuse:</p>
<p>“While I was a Delaware District Buffalo Council member , I uncovered corruption in our Parks system and abuse of the Federal Food Program. City assets were being passed along to cronies, some outside of Buffalo. City cars and trucks were being used privately, identified by magnetic peel-off City seals that were removed at the end of the workday. As a result of my disclosures that were heavily reported in the Buffalo News, Buffalo’s Parks system was streamlined and made more accountable, pass through moneys were more closely tracked and abuse of City assets was stopped.</p>
