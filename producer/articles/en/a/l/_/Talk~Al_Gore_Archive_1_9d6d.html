<p>- Hi again. Please please put the beard thing in there.</p>
<p>- Dude! The BEARD debate was HILARIOUS! I mean, who gives a damn whether a bearded Gore pic is put into the article or not? Man, I can't stop laughing.</p>
<p>This article needs NPOV-ing. (Yes, this will be hard) --<a href="../../../k/2E/l/User%7EK.lee_8d20.html" title="User:K.lee">k.lee</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of which: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.229.90.232" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.229.90.232" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> just added some poorly fact-checked junk on Gore's academic record. In fact, Gore did not "rarely get grades better than C's and D's"---he graduated <i>cum laude</i> from Harvard <a href="http://quest.cjonline.com/stories/031900/gen_gorepost.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://quest.cjonline.com/stories/031900/gen_gorepost.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which is perhaps not spectacular but respectable nonetheless. Contrast w/ the entry on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. If I may be so bold, a horde of anonymous cowards is conspiring to make Bush's entry a <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a> and Gore's entry a farce.</p>
<p>- No, actually graduating cum laude from Harvard is not respectable, considering the 94% of graduating seniors graduate with honors (ie. cum laude). Therefore, it is no special accomplishment that Gore graduated cum laude--he merely graduated in the top 94% of his class!</p>
<p>Some more fact checking:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current commercialized private-sector Internet and the Defense Dept.'s ARPANET are not the same, and it was far from a foregone conclusion that one would become the other. See <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>, this should be obvious.</li>
<li>Winifred Skinner did not collcans as a hobby, and no media source I can find (including the conservative National Review) has claimed this. The most they have alleged is that Skinner's son could have given her money for the medication. Sources report that her income was a little over $800 a month, and her prescription drugs cost about $250 a month, which certainly means that prescription drug costs constituted a large portion of her small income.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I suggest we reorganize this page substantially; breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>"42nd vice president..."</li>
<li>Gore birthdate and family. (1-2 sentences)</li>
<li>1-paragraph summary of Gore's career (just facts: went to Harvard, Vietnam, reporter, elected senator, attempts to get Presidential nomination, VP.)</li>
<li>Short section on (alleged) accomplishments of Gore political career</li>
<li>Long section on Gore biographical controversies: academics, Vietnam</li>
<li>Long section on 2000 campaign: alleged lies and character problems, media coverage thereof</li>
<li>Short section on political presence after 2000 election</li>
</ul>

<p>---</p>
<p>The "poorly fact checked junk" came from the washington post. THe source is listed on the page. If it's incorrect, it can be deleted. Although, I've seen it backed up on a number of news pages.</p>
<p>The Bush page is full of criticisms (for example, he's the only president I've seen on Wiki that has an entire section of his page devoted to how he's "ruining" the environment), so I don't see why a few negative things shouldn't be added to Gore's page in fairness. I don't care about criticizing any politician, but let's do it to all of them if we're going to do it to one.</p>
<p>The thing about Skinner: Her son said himself said that he has offered on many occasions to pay for her perscription drugs, but she refuses it because she enjoys picking up the cans. Those were the son's words, not mine. There is a quote from her son on one of the cable news websites. I'll see if I can find it again. - jazz77</p>
<hr />
<p>The exact information from the Washington Post has been documented by many pages: Gore got a number of C's in college, including one bad year in which he got several C's and a D. This does not justify your phrasing of the matter: I defy you to explain to me how someone could graduate from Harvard cum laude while "rarely" doing better than C's and D's. All the other citations on conservative magazines and websites appear to be echo chamber ramblings. For some rare actual facts, see the following: <a href="http://www.insidepolitics.org/heard/heard32300.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.insidepolitics.org/heard/heard32300.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>BTW I am entirely in favor of criticism of Al Gore. I simply prefer that the criticisms be grounded in fact and given appropriate proportional time in a balanced article---Gore's undergraduate transcript does not belong in the second real paragraph, ahead of his entire political career. (I would prefer even more that the criticisms be of his political positions rather than miscellaneous random trivialities, but perhaps that's a bit much to hope for.) Anyway, talk is cheap. I'll be editing the entry myself soon enough, and then you can edit my edit. --<a href="../../../k/2E/l/User%7EK.lee_8d20.html" title="User:K.lee">k.lee</a></p>
<p>--- I was under the impression that I was quoting exact information as reported by the Washington Post. Anything I added to the article was found on multiple websites for news organizations, so I assumed they knew what they were talking about (not that being a news organization means that you know what you're talking about of course). The information I saw said that he "rarely did better" than Cs and Ds.. that was exactly how it was posted on the news article. Do not assume that I am not interested in "actual facts". I thought I was quoting "actual facts" and did my best to make sure I could find more than one source for each addition I made. -jazz77</p>
<p><br />
I haven't researched Gore's education at all, but based on the article as it is at the moment, I can't even verify that he completed a bachelor's degree, much less what sort of degree it is. At a minimum, please indicate what degree(s) he did earn and from what universities; whether those degrees were also cum laude or whatever would be relevant, as well as what his major was for his bachelor's degree. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Wesley, here's the result of a bit of Google searching (<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a>):</p>
<p>"Gore received a degree in government with honors from Harvard University in 1969." <a href="http://www.chuckiii.com/Reports/Political_Science/Al_Gore_Biography.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chuckiii.com/Reports/Political_Science/Al_Gore_Biography.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Gore received a degree in government with honors from Harvard University in 1969. After graduation, he volunteered for enlistment in the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam. Returning to civilian life, Vice President Gore became an investigative reporter with The Tennessean in Nashville. He attended Vanderbilt University Divinity School and Vanderbilt Law School. <a href="http://www.al-gore-2004.org/gorebiography/albio.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.al-gore-2004.org/gorebiography/albio.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.multied.com/elections/algore.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.multied.com/elections/algore.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.a-ten.com/biographies/al_gore.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.a-ten.com/biographies/al_gore.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Gore got bad grades at Harvard, flunked out of Vanderbilt twice. <a href="http://www.larryelder.com/Gore/goredubiousrecord.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.larryelder.com/Gore/goredubiousrecord.htm" rel="nofollow">Boston Globe column</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks Ed, now we're getting somewhere. So what was the degree? Was it a B.S., a B.A., an M.A.?? I'm guessing B.A., but could be B.S. for all I know. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know. I suspect it's BS (wink), because all 4 sites I cited used the same wording -- one copying the other, no doubt. No, seriously, it's unclear whether the "honors" degree was undergraduate or graduate -- although generally postgraduate degrees name the School (like <i>Yale Law School</i> or <i>Harvard Business School</i>), so we could <i><b>guess</b></i> that it was undergrad. Then, we could take further guesses on whether "goverment" is considered science or liberal arts. The point is, though, that Bush's educational career clearly outstrips Gore's -- despite Democratic Party propagandizing to the contrary. (Although Gore rightfully gets credit for pushing Internet funding.) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></dd>

<p>Thanks, Soulpatch. As a liberal myself, I would have found it hard to consider Gore a liberal, but I was afraid of changing that paragraph for fear of being NPOV. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>

<dd>You're welcome. &#160;:) <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoulpatch_82fb.html" title="User:Soulpatch">soulpatch</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>OK, finally got my promised rewrite done. There are probably parts that edge off NPOV, but I make no apologies. The prior Gore piece had a number of strong ideological slants, and I did a lot of fact checking for my rewrite. This may not be purely NPOV but it's way fairer than it was before. I encourage you to edit at will, but do your fact checking, and by that I mean more than copying and pasting from random partisan Geocities pages (yes, prior editors of both this page and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore-ism.html" title="Gore-ism">Gore-ism</a> <i>clearly</i> did exactly that). The Washington Post series on Al Gore's life is excellent, BTW (I linked it up at bottom).</p>
<p>It's a pure right-wing smear to claim that Gore "flunked" out of Vanderbilt Law School. He <i>left law school to run for Congress</i>, a detail that all conservative sources I've seen omit. As for flunking in Divinity School, that seems legit. BTW the fact that people are posting about the merits of Gore's academic career without even knowing basic facts about it does not give me warm fuzzy feelings.</p>
<p>Also, I am hard-pressed to find the "rarely got better than C's and D's" wording anywhere on Google. Perhaps jazz was confused by the Boston Globe, which wrote that Gore's transcript was "riddled with C's". This is a sneaky way of phrasing the matter: the propositional content is simply that Gore's transript had some unspecified number of C's, but it makes it sound as if Gore's transcript consisted <i>mostly</i> of C's without actually saying so (which would be an outright lie). In any case, until someone cites sources that give more details on Gore's transcript, I will go on what I have.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding my edits on <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore-ism.html" title="Gore-ism">Gore-ism</a>, those may also be non-NPOV, but frankly the old page was a wholesale copy-and-paste from conservative hit pieces (Google will turn them up) so I make no apologies there either. It's less slanted than before, and I will stand by that.</p>

<p>What an awful article right now (11/13/02), written from the perspective of Gore-haters vs. Gore-defenders, rather than attempting to write a comprehensive history of Gore's career. I may try to slog through this mess, but it may take someone more daring than I.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>

<dd>Gee, thanks. If you go back to <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Al_Gore&amp;oldid=385985" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Al_Gore&amp;oldid=385985" rel="nofollow">the old version</a> prior to my edits, you'll see it was disogranized, slanted, and factually incorrect. I went and did some research to flesh out the article and decrease the bogosity level, rather than deleting the previous NPOV nonsense about his academic career and his military service (which would have been my first inclination). If you think this is now too much, then go ahead and edit it down. I would not mind if the sections on "controversies about Gore's personal life" and "controversies about Gore's political views and career" were substantially trimmed. <a href="../../../k/2E/l/User%7EK.lee_8d20.html" title="User:K.lee">k.lee</a></dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> Florida Statistical Abstract census asked how people voted in the 2000 election. The results showed that Gore received over 1000 fewer votes than President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Given the margin of error and the margin of victory, this number is as statistically meaningless as every other statistic that has been compiled regarding the votes in the 2000 election, and falls under the umbrella of the "confusing results" mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Actually no, the margin of error was far less than the 1000. According to the "ultra-right wing" CNN.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Gore was embarrassed by a statement made by former campaign strategist <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Whouley_eb19.html" title="Michael Whouley">Michael Whouley</a>, where it was revealed that Gore's 2000 presidential campaign deliberately caused a traffic jam on a major road in southern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> on primary day to keep <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bradley_af16.html" title="Bill Bradley">Bill Bradley</a> voters away from the polls. Whouley said that the Gore campaign team had seen exit polls that suggested that a large number of independents living in southern New Hampshire suburbs, were turning out to vote for Bradley. Gore's campaign team organized a caravan to clog traffic along Interstate 93, to keep potential Bradley voters away.</dd>

<p>It is relevant because he has recently opposed the 2003 Iraq war, which was included in my version of PRIVATE Citizen:</p>
<p>Under private citizen, it ends by saying he vowed to stay invovled. That doesnt even go there. Please revert it to this:</p>

<p>Again, I don't see where you two say that is biased towards anyone. -ChrisDJackson</p>
<p>The Iraq War and Operation Desert Fox are under different cirumstances. Desert Fox was not a full-fledged invasion and had UN backing and support. Therefore, it's not entirely illogicial for him to support one but not the other. If there's irony, the irony must be explcicit, but I dont see it.</p>
<p>The last sentence of your second paragraph can be avoided because it is basically a summary of your first paragraph, which is a listing of all the major speeches he made. Just find the first link for "2003 invasion of Iraq" to see what I'm talking about. There's no need to mention things twice.</p>

<p>They are two different conflicts, but many criticized him for supporting one and not the other. I think that should be put in the endorsement area of Dean. He said that that is the major reason he endorsed Dean. ( Not supporting the war)</p>
<p>The two set of speeches mentioned is two differnt things and times. The first set was when he was making up his mind to run or not, that was in 2002. The second set with civilv liberties and such was in 2003.</p>

<li>Keep the information! I strongly agree with Moink that this is an informative, useful, even necessary addition to an accurate and full article on Gore. While some may have an agenda and prefer one type of (flattering) information, if you sincerely find the <b>tone</b> rather than the <b>content</b> POV, please edit the article.

<li>Keep. A very good article. I went presuming a heap of nonsense based on comments made here. But it is well sourced, well written, and unambiguously NPOV and encyclopædic. Rumours and conspiracies are part and parcel of politics and a credible encyclopædia should have no problem explaining what are the claims, who makes them and what the factual evidence is. We do it about JFK, Bush and others. Gore warrants the same. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><i>Fear<b>ÉIREANN</b></i></a> 03:02, 3 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete, as it stands now. This article has potential, but it is currently a mess. If I were grading this as a paper, I'd give it a D. It is formatted poorly and organized weakly. It quotes items second and third hand without citing references. Parts were paraphrased from other sites. Its title is sloppy. It should really be named <i>Personal and political controversies of Al Gore</i>.

<p>I haven't followed this debate, but the controversies clearly belong in this article, preferably in the sections where the historical events they relate to are discussed (and with an even level of detail throughout).
