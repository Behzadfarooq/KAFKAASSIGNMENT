<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revert war</span></h2>
<p>This is getting pretty tired, I think it should stay the way it is now. The other gives an appearance of POV. If it happens again I'm going to put it into dispute. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooguse_1ac5.html" title="User:Googuse">googuse</a> 03:40, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have placed the page under a POV dispute and will request arbitration - the daily reverts by Josephf are tiring. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooguse_1ac5.html" title="User:Googuse">googuse</a> 06:52, July 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you, Googuse, I agree, it's getting tiresome. I've made a couple more edits to the section in question:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Removed: "As stated by Franken and the show organizers, a principal cause for Air America's formation was to defeat the re-election of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>."</p>
<dl>
<dd>If someone wants to keep this, please provide a source. <a href="../../../-/a/s/User%7E-asx-.html" title="User:-asx-">-asx-</a> 00:44, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Heres a source, It has a link to a transcript of Franken's interview on CBS&#160;: <a href="http://radio.about.com/b/a/084357.htm" class="external free" title="http://radio.about.com/b/a/084357.htm" rel="nofollow">http://radio.about.com/b/a/084357.htm</a></p>
<p>Removed: "Franken said that he chose the title <i>The O'Franken Factor</i> in hopes that <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a>, who hosts <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O%27Reilly_Factor_e2b2.html" title="The O'Reilly Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Radio_Factor_d9ba.html" title="The Radio Factor">The Radio Factor</a></i>, would sue him. O'Reilly never took the bait, so . . ."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, this may or may not be true, but given that it appears to be designed to make Franken look bad, I have removed it as of questionable veracity. <a href="../../../-/a/s/User%7E-asx-.html" title="User:-asx-">-asx-</a> 00:44, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Removed: "Although the original goal failed to materialize and Bush was re-elected, Franken signed on with Air America for another two years."</p>
<dl>
<dd>This represents, as far as I can tell, the personal opinion of one contributor to Wikipedia. If it is indeed a fact, it should not be hard for the one contributor to post a citation. <a href="../../../-/a/s/User%7E-asx-.html" title="User:-asx-">-asx-</a> 00:44, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't have a dog in this hunt, but this seems like a rather petty dispute. The Air America guys don't like O'Reilly and would love to annoy him, and they don't like Bush and they were unhappy Bush got elected but they haven't folded their tent and gone away. This doesn't make Franken look either good or bad, it just makes Franken look like a feisty player in the political-media arena, which is what he is. You could flip all this around to describe Limbaugh's reaction to Bill Clinton being reelected, and you have the same thing. So what's the big deal? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 01:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mbstone wrote...</span></h2>
<p>I deleted a phrase that began, "It is rumoured..." one, because we can do better than rumours (or rumors); and also, this article is about Franken, not the Fox pundit who is rumoured to have been behind Fox's ill-fated lawsuit.<a href="../../../m/b/s/User%7EMbstone_0ce4.html" title="User:Mbstone">Mbstone</a> 00:46, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, lots of people are described in Wikipedia as "funny" and/or "successful" and/or "famous." Maybe all three together is a little POV, but each of these terms is accurate as pertains to Franken, and perhaps the people who delete these characterizations are proving to everyone how absolutely humorless some fanatics of a certain right-wing-propaganda cable channel can sometimes be.<a href="../../../m/b/s/User%7EMbstone_0ce4.html" title="User:Mbstone">Mbstone</a> 00:50, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism?</span></h2>
<p>Shouldn't there be a criticism section? Bill O'Reilly, Michael Moore, etc. all have a criticism section.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Not having one is odd, considering Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, etc. have one. What about the Air America scandal about stealing money from a Boys &amp; Girls Club?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I second that. Its bizarre... Every other article has a criticism section, especially with th conservative radio personalities. Sometimes, in the case of hannity, there is a criticism section just to state that he is 'controversial' or 'mean' ... I don't see why Franken shouldn't have this as well... Anything else reveals a clear bias. If no one else starts on, I will.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>without a doubt... Start it!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You know what's even more odd than the lack of a criticism section? The way no one in this thread <i>signs their freakin posts</i>. Please use ~~~~ to sign. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 09:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're reading that into it. The anon didn't mention the lack of criticism section. In fact, we don't know what the anon found objectionably biased about the article. For all we know, the anon was infuriated that the article didn't mention Franken's role in the Liberal Jewish Media conspiracy that takes orders from the UFO's around Jupiter*.

<dd>I hesitated to edit but then figured if my solution to this concern was incorrect, someone else could undo what I did. I concur that there needs to be some reference to his religious proclivities, as he's made it clear they are important to him. So I added "into a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> family" before "and grew up in St. Louis Park." I noticed in the Woody Allen entry and others, that's how it was tastefully included. I'd also included Al Franken's name in the category of Jewish American actors. Though it can be argued he's not the best of actors, he does belong in the same company with Gene Wilder, Gilda Radner and Woody Allen. Oh, and shouldn't the quotes be over at wikiquote.org or is there a reason why he doesn't have a wikiquote page? <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachsMind_d463.html" title="User:ZachsMind">ZachsMind</a> 22:50, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Michael Medved once stated that he asked Franken why he's never been invited on <i>The Al Franken Show</i> and was told the show didn't have guests, yet I know numerous liberals have been guests on the show (Bill Moyers being one of the more prominent names I can think of).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV Push?</span></h2>
<p>In my opinion, it is not necessary to say, "When the original goal failed to materialize and Bush was re-elected, Franken expressed his deep disappointment and signed on with Air America for another two years." It is more neutral and succinct to simply say, "When Bush was re-elected, Franken signed on with Air America for another two years." Franken's disappointment with the election results is already obvious and is irrelevent in this sentence. Is someone reveling in Franken's disappointment? Is that the reason for including it? To my mind, including it is akin to saying, "Ha! You LOST!" <span style="color:#AE0000; padding: 1px 6px; border: 1px solid #ddd; background:#FAFAFA;"><a href="../../../-/a/s/User%7E-asx-.html" title="User:-asx-">-asx-</a> 05:18, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</span></p>

<p><br />
Actually it is the removal of the RELEVANT story regarding the Boys and Girls Club and Air America that is a POV.</p>
<p>Al Franken is, for most people, the face of Air America. He has been the point man for this scandal, and addressed the media about it quite recently <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;hs=xf1&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=franken+air+america+crook&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external free" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;hs=xf1&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=franken+air+america+crook&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;hs=xf1&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=franken+air+america+crook&amp;btnG=Search+News</a></p>
<p>He also did by far the most number of interviews HYPING Air America when they first launched.</p>
<p>The two most relevant people to Air America are it's founder and Franken...and at least one of them is a crook - this according to Franken.</p>
<p>Now, it may be a bit premature to make any harsh judgments about Franken regarding this imbroglio, but he does receive a salary from Air America and the monies originally paid to him came from their seed fund, some of which was taking food out of the mouths of orphans and widows.</p>
<p>No one is disputing that. They're all just trying to blame it on Evan Cohen.</p>
<p>And to suggest, that this is "a scandal that Franken was not involved in at all" is laughable.</p>
<p>It's like saying O'Reilly had nothing to do with the lawsuit Fox filed against Franken's book.</p>
<p>So, the only FAIR thing to do is either remove that section from O'Reilly's entry or include the Gloria Wise scandal in Franken's.</p>
<p>And that's what I propose.</p>

<dl>
<dd>It would be POV, in my opinion, to include unsubstantiated accusations about Franken being involved in this scandal, or even implying it by making it a large part of this article. Franken did state that O'Reilly was the one pushing for Fox's lawsuit. If you can find someone noteworthy accusing Franken of being involved in the scandal or someone involved in the case stating that, then I think it would be more than fair to put it in the article. As it stands, there is nothing connecting him, and I think that it is more or less a POV attack on the man to imply association with a scandal he had nothing to do with. -- <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahmn_743a.html" title="User:Micahmn">MicahMN</a> | <b><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMicahmn_1f20.html" title="User talk:Micahmn">μ</a></b> 04:27, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmmm...Let me get this straight. In the Bill O'Reilly entry, O'Reilly is trashed by quotes from Al Franken.</p>
<p>And on the Al Franken entry, O'Reilly is...er...trashed by quotes from Al Franken!</p>
<p>I say we just get rid of the following paragraph. It's not funny in the least, even if it wasn't a lie and serves no purpose whatsoever except to take an unwarranted hit on two conservatives.</p>
<p>One of his more famous jokes goes: "Hey Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh have never been to Iraq or done a USO tour", to which he would respond, "Oh honey, thats not fair; they have no talent." Factually, however, this has proven to be false, both have been to Iraq and Afghanistan several times. Big Daddy 03:31, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I took that STUPID, ridiculous and compltely unfunny cheap-shot-that-is-supposed-to-be-a-joke out.</p>
<p>Now, if I were a liberal editor, I could include some additional 'USO info' about Al Franken.</p>
<p>Like for example how Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and many others have observed that he literally 'cries on cue' when discussing the USO. In fact, in the infamous CBC interview, Coulter predicts that he will cry and at what point he will begin doing so...and Franken was kind of enough to prove Ann prophetic!</p>

<p>Franken got in trouble for lying to the Attorney General of the United States (amongst others) in letters he wrote using Harvard letterhead stationery in an unauthorized fashion.

<dd>Franken didn't "get in trouble for lying" to anyone. He used the stationery, of an organization that he was a member of, in an improper fashion to glean a response from public figure for a <i>parody</i> book. He was in no way "reprimanded" by Harvard. Franken cleared up the confusion on his own, writing a letter of apology to the AG. <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/frankenabs1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/frankenabs1.html" rel="nofollow">link to the actual letter and apology from The Smoking Gun</a>.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Additionally, to say "He used the stationary...in an improper fashion..." is technically correct but ambiguous. In what improper fashion were they used? Were they burnt or used as toilet paper? No. With the appearance of Harvard's imprimatur, <b>intentionally</b> false statements were written on them and sent to a high ranking public official. Franken mentions the "awkward and difficult position" he has put Harvard in and asks that this [what he did] not be held against them, along with stating that the conservative leaders he lied about will receive his letter of apology as well.</dd>

<p>I am an engineer w a BIG company. Some years ago a friend finished law school and requested a letter of recommendation to the Bar Association. I thought it would be nice to write the letter on the company letterhead to establish my own bona fides as a professional. However, I FIRST checked w the company lawyers. They agreed it was a nice idea, but forbid me from doing it. So I didn't. I used blank paper and included my job title and company (as suggested by the lawyers). Just because you are a member of an establishment does NOT permit you to arbitrarily use that relationship for personal or fraudulent advantage.</p>

<dd>Fox news is hardly a tabloid media outlet. The only people who assert so make clear their bias. Would you consider CBS a valid news source, despite the "Memogate" scandal? There is no reason to rule out Fox as a non-mainstream and acceptable source. Your POV is showing.216.39.146.25 16:36, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was simply drawing FOX's name out of a hat of similar organizations, it wasn't really germane to the subject. I could have as easily said, <i>The Washington Times</i> or the <i>Voz de Aztlan</i> or any other media organization with a clearly established bias and documented history of misinformation. FOX is simply better known, so people would be more likely to understand my point. You still haven't answered Gamaliel's request for sourcing, I note. So far, all I've seen is a lot of heated rhetoric and frantic attempts to change the subject or otherwise misdirect, and when these fail, sullen one-liners (compare "so?" to "shut up!")... actually, that reminds me a great deal of FOX news, now that I think of it.

<dd>Kas, I'm one of those who readily accedes Fox is biased conservatively...as much as the mainstream media is biased liberally. I think you are incorrect, however, if you assert that Fox News is not citable according to wikipedia standards. But isn't this moot?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apology to Attorney General and conservative leaders</span></h2>
<p>Well, it seems there have been many edits to the little section I created. I thought I did a damn good job being NPOV when I created it, my dislike of Franken notwithstanding, so here are my suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Someone wrote, "The letter was written on letterhead from the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government where Franken was a Fellow at the time <i>to work on the book</i>." He was indeed a Fellow at the center but who can say what the scope of his Fellowship was? One could make a case that Franken's saying his biggest regret in sending the letter was that it was on the Center's stationary implies that he was not at the center for that purpose. Is there a source that says he was officially at the Shorenstein Center to work on the book? Please provide one or let's take out the part that says what he was working on as a Fellow.</p>
<p>2. Someone wrote, "Although most observers at the time clearly saw the prankish spirit in Franken's letter, some conservative critics professed outrage."</p>
<dl>
<dd>a. Please provide sources on what most observers thought or let's take it out.<br />
b. "Professed" is often times used to mean "pretended". If that's how you meant it, please provide sources. If that's <i>not</i> how you meant it, let's change the wording so its not subject to interpretation. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 20:22, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The problem with this section of the article is that, if one were to read only it, it would give the impression that the apology letter was serious. In reality, it is obvious in the tone of his book which includes both letters, that both the original letter, and the following apology letter were meant to be comical. --<a href="../../../d/t/_/User%7EDT_Strain_cc95.html" title="User:DT Strain">Daniel</a> 21:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you have some <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">non-original research</a> that supports the idea the letter of apology was also insincere, by all means include it. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 22:44, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the link to that 2004 article. But it clearly says that Franken is only 50/50 about running, and that he won't make a firm decision until "next year" (2005). I haven't read or seen anything recently that confirms he has made up his mind. I really don't think he should be referenced as a candidate in the 1st paragraph of the article until he has indicated he definitely will run.

<p>This is re: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Franken&amp;curid=251879&amp;diff=33901143&amp;oldid=33895922" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Franken&amp;curid=251879&amp;diff=33901143&amp;oldid=33895922" rel="nofollow">the recently added selected quotes section</a>. I'm a little worried about these quotations because they frankly seem to aiming at playing "gotcha" with Franken and have an anti-Franken POV. Not only that, but Franken is a comedian, and a lot of what he says could be taken out of context to imply things that he didn't actually mean (like the McCain quote specifically). I also wonder if they shouldn't be moved to wikiquote if they were to be kept. I would support keeping them if they were key to some sort of controversy with him, but they just seem to be out to paint him in a bad light.

<dd>Two things are wrong with these quotes. One, as <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahmn_743a.html" title="User:Micahmn">MicahMN</a> suggests, they definitely don't belong here and should be moved to wikiquotes. Two, they were specifically chosen and placed here strictly in an attempt to present an anti-Franken POV to the article. If the comments had been intended seriously I could understand why someone who hated Fraken would gleefully place them here as amazing revelations, but he's a comedian, and his job while performing as a comic is to elicit laughter. Sometimes this involves the use of material that could be seen as borderline offensive to some but such humorous comments should not be taken seriously and certainly should not be put here as "representative" of how Franken thinks. These quotes have no place in this article and should be removed.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 01:41, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Hasty Pudding quote should be right out. One of the purposes of Hasty Pudding is a tounge-in-cheek roast of the recipient. Franken is only responding sarcastically, as expected.

<dd>It's pretty dishonest to have that John McCain joke presented as a straight-ahead quote. Franken told it as a joke, meant it as a joke and obviously, obviously doesn't actually think that prisoners of war are lazy.

<dd>I'll accept the deletion, and yes, I do dislike Al Franken... HOWEVER: Al Franken consistently blasts Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh for their tongue-in-cheek remarks, and states that he wants to bring civility to public discourse. In fact, he often resorts to the kinds of TIC remarks many conservative firebrands do. This is inconsistent with his contention that he is a higher caliber social and political commentator. Does anyone here disagree? You know, David Horowitz's page is filled with partial quotes included to make him look racist and such. --Gerkinstock 20:30, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gerkin: As a libertarian with conservative values I really really dislike Franken and agree about his inconsistency/hypocrisy (I gave out 12 copies of Schweizer's book for Xmas, really) but let's not put quotes in an article just to do a hatchet job. I think a "quotes" section (whether it be Franken's or O'Reilly's) should give a good flavor of the article's subject, not just show their bad points. And I agree with Jordoh regarding the Hasty Pudding and McCain quotes...they're totally misleading. Franken is ridiculous enough without needing to quote him out of context. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 22:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Clearly, most of the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a> quotes were submitted by anti-Horowitz posters (up until recently, anyway), but that's no reason to delete them. Plus, there is the point that Franken says things in jest that are considered tasteless by some but then goes on to criticize conservatives who do the same. Also, was his statement on how to deal with terrorists taken out of context? It was a fairly long quote. --Gerkinstock 22:47, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the quotes are misleading (e.g. because they were taken out of context) they should be deleted, just as the ones here were. re Franken being hypocritical in his criticism of conservatives, I think that's a perfect first entry for a "Criticism" section in his article. Make sure you've got outside sources that make this point, and not just yourself...this should not be hard to do, I would think. I don't know enough about the specific Franken quote to know if it was out of context or not, it just appeared the Hasty Pudding and McCain quotes were. Make a case here that it's not, and I'll join the fight for its inclusion. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 04:00, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I absolutely agree that Franken was being sarcastic regarding the McCain and Hasty Pudding comments. My point is that when Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh make similar comments, aimed at liberals and meant to be tongue-in-cheek, Al Franken has criticized them (he once commented that conservatives spread "filth, sleaze and bile through the media apparatus" and called Bernard Goldberg an "asshole" for writing the book 'Bias') and stated that he sees himself as elevating political discourse, saying, "My grandiose vision is to change the dialogue in this country," and that "we have to be civil to each other." This coming from a man whose most successful book was titled 'Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot' and was followed by 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.' You're right, though, those quotes would be better suited for a "Criticism" section than a quote section. The comment about torturing terrorsts, however, did not seem to be sarcastic at all. It was laced with humor, but he meant what he said. -- Gerkinstock 22:32, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Facetiousness is one of Franken's comedic talents. My reading of Franken's books is that he's trying to keep everyone guessing at all times whether he actually means everything he says. While it makes great comedy, it's some damned shaky ground to launch a political career from. In short, I believe Franken's choice of titles like "Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot" are themselves a satirical reference to the uncivil political culture he rails against. Sort of like "A Modest Proposal", whose author knew quite well the proposal was not modest. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 09:46, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kasreyn, I certainly appreciate your point about Franken "keep[ing] everyone guessing . . . whether he actually means everything he says." As a person who by no means is a fan of Franken, I would be tempted to believe this strategy is not only deliberate but cowardly; if a given attack works, then Franken can come across as a hero (as in attacking Limbaugh in his first best seller), but if it falls flat (as with the Ashcroft incident), a retreat can be made under the banner of "Just a Satirist." I take that you may not agree, but I'm with you on the "shaky ground" comment as that duality of "I'm serious/no, I'm just a satirist" that I find in Franken simply is not sustainable in political life, where you have to stand (even when insincere about it, as some politicians can be) for some kind of position.</dd>

<dd>Getting back to the subtopic, though, I'm wondering why there is such wringing of hands about "selected quotes" being fair to Franken when no such anguish appears to be expended on, say, the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> entry. There, someone has already added the "rat poisoning in Justice Stevens' creme brulee" comment of less than a week ago. Are the quotes on the Coulter page fair to Coulter? That's a judgment for the individual reader, and I for one would say go ahead and keep even what might be argued as unfair there--just so long as the same standards are applied to political opposites of Coulter like Franken. The present state of the Franken article treats its subject with kid gloves compared with the present state of the Coulter article. I would prefer to see a balance in both: "This is who Franken or Coulter is, here is a summary of controversy and criticism, here is what his/her defenders have to say." But that seems elusive in such a politically-charged topic as this entry's is. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMollyTheCat_20c5.html" title="User:MollyTheCat">MollyTheCat</a> 00:17, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E200.122.158.40.html" title="User:200.122.158.40">User:200.122.158.40</a>: Your 13:03, February 6, 2006 edit summary states, "despite an earlier claim, Franken's letter says nothing about apologizing for lying". I disagree. In his letter of apology to Ashcroft, Franken wrote,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"None of the people mentioned in the original letter had sent me their abstinence stories. To them, I am sincerely sorry if I caused any discomfort. They, along with everyone who received my original letter, will receive this apology."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Franken states that none of the people, whom he said had sent him stories, really had. Where I come from, if you say someone did something they really didn't, we don't say you <b>misled</b> them...we say you <b>lied about</b> them. He then apologizes for any discomfort he caused. Did he mislead them <i>in addition to</i> lying about them? If so, that's not clear to me. Can you explain how he misled them? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 01:03, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a>, most of your edits in this article seem to be honest attempts at maintaining NPOV, despite your obvious dislike of Al Franken, so I'm surprised by your insistence on using the word "lie" here. Do you believe that all satirists and comedians should be held to the same standards as Franken? If so, do you believe all such comedians/satirists are liars? David Letterman and Jay Leno, for example, frequently utilize political humor as part of their opening monologues, much of which stretches the truth for humorous effect. People laugh, not because they are responding to what they believe to be mundane, unadulterated facts, but because they are able to recognize and appreciate satire and humorous exaggeration. Franken's letter, which from your comments I would have to assume you believe is completely devoid of humor, was clearly meant to be perceived as satire. You believe it failed miserably as such, or, perhaps, you don't truly believe it was meant as satire at all. That said, many of us find the contents of the letter, and the subsequent "controversy", quite amusing.</dd>

<dd>More seriously, do you truly feel that any of the recipients really believed that a letter from AL FRANKEN was intended seriously? Especially considering the subject matter? Per Franken himself, none of them responded to his request for information. This indicates to me that, if they even read the letter, they were easily able to see that attempts were being made to belittle their allegedly hypocritical stance on abstinence. I don't even believe that anyone was really misled, but in any case, "lie" is way too strong a word to use here. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 02:15, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your point is well made regarding talk show opening monologues. In trying to come up with something analogous to Franken's situation I imagined in my mind a hilarious hypothetical opening bit with <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Leno_9d45.html" title="Jay Leno">Jay Leno</a> making fun of Bush's malpropisms (strategery, etc.) by saying Bush said something he really hadn't. If somehow, Leno was made to apologize by <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, would I expect him to say "I'm sorry I lied about the President"? No. That being said, Franken identifies and singles out and apologizes to those leaders <i>about whom he said he had received material but in reality hadn't</i>. How about we just identify them that way? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 07:28, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're welcome. The more I think about it the more I think I was wrong for wanting Franken's article to say he "lied". Thinking whether or not Franken lied about those persons probably hinges on whether you think as part of Franken's satire he intended (hoped?) Ashcroft might take him seriously. As you mentioned earlier, when talk show hosts do a satirical monologue, they're not expecting (nor trying to get) anybody in the audience to take what they're saying as truth and therefore, not "lying" about someone. Even though, in his letter of apology, Franken states "...I hope you will take my original letter with a measure of the humor with which it was intended," I believe Franken hoped Ashcroft might take it seriously enough to reply, providing more material to satire in the real book he was writing. That however, is entirely my POV and should not be reflected in Franken's article. This has turned into a great exercise in introspection.

<p>Whether Franken's 'Savin' It' letter was "prankish" or "hypocritical" is entirely a matter of perspective. It is a clear POV violation to claim that there was an obvious "prankish spirit." Had Mr. Ashcroft replied and been subsequently humiliated by Franken, I doubt the "prankish spirit" would have been the standout feature of the ruse.</p>
<p>Also, removed the "liar" quote, as it was not terribly important and it's pretty clear that Franken did in fact lie prodigiously in composing the letter. That doesn't necessarily make someone a "liar" in general, but in regard to this episode, it's pretty hard to argue otherwise. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by DrZin (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DrZin_c6e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/DrZin">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I think subject's ongoing feud with Bill O'Reilly merits more explanation.

The Fox lawsuit is mentioned in the article, as is Franken's statement that he named his radio show the O'Franken Factor "'to annoy and to bait' Bill O'Reilly to sue him again."

<dd>Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. No offense intended, but we get a lot of people claiming to be celebrities, so forgive me if what I say seems impolite or disrespectful. Editing Wikipedia is as simple as finding information with an outside, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, checking to make sure it is notable to the subject matter, and inserting it with a writeup which is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral in tone</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While there is no problem normally with people going ahead and making changes as soon as they see the need, it is generally seen as unacceptable for a person to edit an article about themselves. So, assuming you really are Al Franken, I'd advise against making major changes. People are much more likely to jump all over you for perceived neutrality issues if you are the article's subject. It might be safer to go over proposed changes on the talk page to avoid any appearance of bias.

<dd>This was indeed a controversy, albeit one so short-lived that I had completely forgotten about it until you added the info to the article. At the time, some conservative editorialists and bloggers were outraged that Franken was not immediately arrested for assaulting the poor man, and in their reporting of the incident conveniently left out details about the heckler shoving and elbowing various people, including Franken. According to the news source I added, immediately after Franken tackled him, the heckler took advantage of a commotion being caused by <i>another</i> heckler (apparently working in cahoots with the first one) to get up and rush to a balcony where he proceeded to scream at Dean from the balcony's railing; he didn't stop until the theater manager threatened to call the police. I've added some details to the section, all taken from the sourced article, because the way it was originally worded made it seem like Franken simply walked up to a man who was exercising his right to free speech and slammed him to the ground. Franken's detractors tried to paint it that way but the article tells a different story--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 16:51, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In fairness, this was the first I heard that the man elbowed Franken first, although I did know that his glasses were broken. I saw it as a "final insult" moment, like when Neo kicks that Agent's glasses in the Matrix and you're like, "oh man, now he's called down the thunder."

<p>Like AL Franken, I was on my highschool wrestling team. From Franken's and other people's accounts, I know that Franken did a standard wrestling <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takedown.html" title="Takedown">takedown</a> on the guy. When done properly, a wrestling takedown does not hurt a person. When you have been a wrestler you remember these things for the rest of your life. I can see myself taking down a roudy person who elbows me in the face. It is not a secret that Franken was a wrestler and anyone with either experience or a brain and a little research skill knows what a takedown is. Yet people still insist on referring to it as a tackle.

I'm not 100% certain but I think the only thing he had to do with it was letting people follow him around with cameras. So I think the article should say, "A documentary about Al Franken is scheduled for a September 2006 release titled Al Franken: God Spoke." Qw3rty 22:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When did he drop the Jr.?</span></h2>
<p>Franken was once known as <b>Al Franken, Jr.</b>, which ought to be mentioned in the article. He announced he was dropping the "Jr." on an SNL broadcast in the late 1980s or early 1990s. As I am less familiar with his biography than other contributors to this article, I'd be happy if someone else can add this info. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 11:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't remember that. However, the sufix "jr" is normally dropped when the senior of the two passes on. Perhaps his father has died?<a href="../../../r/s/m/User%7ERsm99833_7388.html" title="User:Rsm99833">Rsm99833</a> 15:40, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where did Franken's discussion forum go?</span></h2>
<p>It used to be here, I know it still exists. In the External Links section Alfrankenweb.com has been removed. Looks like someone just tried to add it back in but again it was removed. The Alfrankenweb.com discussion forum is the ONLY one linked directly on The Al Franken Show website yet it isn't deemed worthy at Wikipedia? What gives? Why is a factless site such as frankenlies.com ok to be linked and other fan sites but not THE fan discussion forum that is again linked on Al's own AAR show site.</p>
<p>Something is a foul at Wikipedia, that's too bad I used to depend on it for accurate and timely information. But I guess someone has an agenda.</p>

<dd><b>I have to side with Lawyer2b</b> on this issue--by the way, kudos to you for efforting to keep politics out of this--because I don't know think they have a "feud" ala Fox and Franken. There first needs to be reliable sources, which that paragraph does not have. Second, Franken was pointing out Limbaugh's hypocrisy because Limbaugh *lambasted* people who suffer from drug addiction so many times, that for him to have one himself was very hypocritical (not "perceived" hypocrisy). Franken admitting he had used drugs, and then lambasting Limbaugh for his "hypocrisy" (not drug addiction) are separate things, and that paragraph conflates the two. Had Franken himself lambasted drug users, then he would be a hypocrite also; but he hasn't. If anything, that paragraph just highlights Limbaugh's hypocrisy and Franken pointing it out. It's just not appropriate. And this isn't a pro-Franken thing; I've added to the controversies of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Doherty_4634.html" title="Pete Doherty">Pete Doherty</a>, even though he is one of my favorite musicians, whose lyrics have had an affect on my own life. It's just that the paragraph is sloppy and note cited properly.

<dd>Al Franken has "feuded" with Rush Limbaugh for many years. Why else did he name a book "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot"? It all goes back to Rush Limbaugh's "views" when he had a syndicated tv show &amp; his radio presence was bigger. Limbaugh used it to just spout things that were controversial to try to get his name in the news.</dd>

<dd>Its pretty simple. One solitary rant from an anti-Franken blog does not constitute a controversy.

<dd>I apologize for not immediately placing my rationale for the tag in talk, as I was consulting with some other users for objectivity on the subject. My concern is with the 'controversy section', as these are not preferred in <a href="../../../b/l/p/BLP_1238.html" title="BLP">BLP</a>'s and tend to promote <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28internet%29.html" title="Troll (internet)">trolls</a>. All of the mentioned controversies, excepting maybe 'Radio show', could easily be placed in the main article under more appropriate categories. the Fox News and Ashcroft info could go under 'Writer and performer', and 'the takedown', IMHO, is just silly and could be placed anywhere, as this is clearly not a genuine controversy. Feel free to let me know what your thoughts are, and I will wait for a general concensus before making any moves here.

<dd>I'd be fine with reworking the article along those lines, though I don't think that the presence of a "controversy section" is by definition a POV issue. I would agree that information in this section features more prominently than it should, and a title like "The Takedown" is unencyclopedic, though I don't know that it really espouses a point of view. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 00:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think adding a "neutrality violation" tag was not necessary to effect your desired change but, be that as it may, I'm the original author of the whole "Savin' It" piece and I see no problem with it (and the other things in the controversy section for that matter) being distributed throughout the article so long as none of it is actually removed. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 05:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy section</span></h2>
<p>It is my contention to simply move the info without any major deletions, however at least one line in the "savin it" piece: "some conservative critics claimed there was no obvious satirical intent in his actions and charged the comedian with being a hypocrite who lied in order to make fun of the concept of abstinence-only sex education programs [15]" is referenced by a purely editorial blog, which is not an acceptable ref for info on a BLP. This line is pure POV anyhow, and does not add any new or relevant factual info to the subject. Other than this one minor sentence, I see no other real problems.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 08:35, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Upon further reading, I found and removed one more purely POV, blog-referenced sentence: "Conservative bloggers criticized Franken; they said that he physically assaulted somebody for expressing free speech.[14]".
