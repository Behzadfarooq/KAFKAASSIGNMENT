<p>I know it's been brought up before, but this article is still in need of criticism.

<dd>Franken hasn't had the same number of well-publicized public feuds that O'Reilly has. Franken is less well-known and has a much diminished platform. He has feuded with O'Reilly and Limbaugh, but beyond that, the list is pretty short. He and Ann Coulter have traded shots, there was a run-in with Neil Boortz on Franken's radio show, and there's the Ashcroft letter. Most of those are addressed in the article. O'Reilly, by contrast, makes a point of engaging in these feuds and controversies. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 23:21, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yea, where is the criticisms section people. This is extremely biased that Oreilly and Limbaugh have these MASSIVE criticisms list, yet a well known liberal commentator like al has none. I believe this point to larger biases in the wikipedia audience. I wish i knew more about Al so I could add a section myself, but frankly i do not. 66.31.222.89 00:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)peterp</p>
<p>Just because the Al Franken page lacks a huge criticism list like the ones found on O'Reilly or Limbaugh doesn't mean the article is biased. Perhaps O'Reilly and Limbaugh have actually done things to merit such criticism. I'm not saying there is no controversy surrounding Al, but I certainly haven't found any outside of those who have a serious conflict of interest&#160;;) Maybe the fact that you don't have any dirt on him says something. -km</p>
<p>Well since you bring it up (and no one else seems to want to do it), I will spend the next few weeks researching criticisms of Al. Many can be found already in other wiki articles such as his involvement in the Air America Loan scandal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America-Gloria_Wise_loan_controversy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America-Gloria_Wise_loan_controversy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America-Gloria_Wise_loan_controversy</a> I will also try and cross reference the criticism between O'reilly and Al as well since it is WELL documented. 2 Be Continued 66.31.222.89 15:37, 10 January 2007 (UTC)peterp</p>
<p>How is it that the same people who are demanding a seperate "criticism" page are at a loss to come up with critical examples off the top of their heads? I'd like this to be fair as well, but it shouldn't be forced just to provide a perceived balance to other topics. --24.199.105.177 00:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are <i>several</i> criticisms of Al, such as those at [<a href="http://www.frankenlies.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frankenlies.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. They are immediately scrubbed by editors here, however. D323P 09:32, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also believe that Al Franken needs a criticisms section. I saw a short clip of his fight with O Reilly on C-Span 2, which got me interested in Frankin, but I had to look elsewhere for any details. (IMO most modern political pundits need a brief criticisms section because so much of their career is spent arguing and tearing others down that it is hard to separate their feuds from their professional body of work.)Bookswinters 19:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is already loaded with material that would appear in a typical criticism section. The "writer and performer" section has two large paragraphs about controversy surrounding one chapter in one Franken book. The material about that single controversy is longer than the material about his entire 15 year SNL career. Far from being biased, this article focuses too much on criticism and not enough on a neutral overview of his career. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I first started editing this page a few months ago, I initially noticed the ridiculously oversized criticism/controversy section, which was filled with many of the same silly and frankly un-controversial things that are now integrated into the article proper. It was my doing, having reached a concensus in discussion, to remove the criticism/controversy section title and integrate the so-called controversial information into the rest of the article. I did this so as not to cause a ruckus, but honstly IMHO the info seems to pale in comparison to, say, O'Reilly or Limbaugh's controversies. Franken tricked some neocons into believing he was writing a book about abstinence; Limbaugh said that MJ Fox was faking his Parkinson's to win votes. I see a major difference between the controversies of these aformentioned pundits and Franken's controversies, which, as Franken <i>is a comedian</i>, are largely a by-product of joking around with the wrong people.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 23:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Al Franken is not of reputable character, and many logical people know this. And wikipedia does have a lot of leftist bias as well. DUH. The problem is that the bias cannot be addressed as wikipedia guidelines are used for defending left-wing ideologies, and for attacking right-wing ideology. Yet, at the same time, look at how much Bill Oreilly gets attacked and the size of his platform. Oreilly, Limbaugh, etc etc etc are all major voices and affect people by what they say...and people listen. I dont see Franken that much...he is the reason I cant eat Parkway Butter anymore.</p>

<dd>Folks - if there's a "pro-Franken" bias, it's only because you have not done much in the way of making well-researched contributions to the article. Personally, I believe that O'Reilly is much looser with the truth than Franken, so if his article reveals that, it's probably just a reflection of reality. If you disagree, fine - MAKE AN EDIT already. Just don't forget to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> credible sources. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 00:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One other thing - as you make those edits, consider carefully whether they belong here or on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Al_Franken_Show_60b5.html" title="The Al Franken Show">The Al Franken Show</a> page - that's probably the better place for the kind of thing being discussed, if it's more about Franken as a talk show host than as a person. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 00:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which logical people are these? Sorry that was innapropiate, POV, and baiting. But wikipedia doesn't have a liberal bias. If they did, You would be able to tell. They would start the Ann Coulter section by calling her a liar or something.

<p>I removed him from this category because Al Franken is not a journalist, he is a writer/commentator. As he is not a journalist, he cannot be a journalist accused of fabrication or plagiarism. Writers are allowed to fabricate in many cases, but they are never allowed to plagiarize. I didn't see any allegations of plagiarism in this article, nor can I remember any being made in the news. If anyone can cite examples of him plagiarizing anything, perhaps he should be added to a category for writers accused of plagiarism. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He also did a dead-on Paul Tsongas on SNL during the 1992 Democratic primaries. Which was interesting, since Tsongas was a major critic of Bill Clinton during those primaries for "wanting to be Santa Claus" (with promises of a middle class tax cut), and Al later became a big fan and defender of the Clintons.

<p>David, I'm irritated by your reversion earlier this evening. Your comment indicated that you prefer that one sentence stay in, but your reversion of my <b>entire</b> edit undid more of my work than just that sentence. I have now reinstated those other revisions, <b>leaving that sentence intact.</b> I left it because I have no interest in getting into a "revert war," but I still think it should go. Even if the citations support it, the tone of that sentence (stating that Franken had told political insiders that he would run) is more suitable to a gossip column than an encyclopedia. I can't see what historical significance it has, now that it's established that he's running - and there are all kinds of other references to his hints that he might run. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 06:56, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry that you were irritated, but it's asking a little much to sloppily remove an entire paragraph and then expect another editor to ensure that your own work is preserved. But I see no reason to brow-beat a mistake. For a long time Franken has hinted he might seek office, but for two weeks prior to throwing his hant in the ring he told senior Minnesota Democrats that yes, he would be running. I guess I'm not wed to that one sentence - but what I don't understand is why it is such an issue for you to keep it in? Remove it if you like; that one sentence isn't worth the effort to write paragraphs over. I was more bothered that an entire section had been sloppily edited out. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 12:54, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If this discussion is about the sentence starting <i>"The decision was not unexpected ..."</i> then let me contribute that that sentence is not a helpful addition to the article. Grammatically, if doesn't state by whom it was not unexpected. Second, it is not noteworthy that before a candidate announces a candidacy, some people expected him to run. Most substantively, if an editor really, really wants to note that the general public had a good idea Franken would run, reference should be to his many broad hints, on his show &amp; elsewhere, heard by millions of persons, and not to a private conversation about which few people know nor ever knew. <a href="../../../r/e/w/User%7ERewinn_167e.html" title="User:Rewinn">rewinn</a> 15:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am concerned that the "vandalism" removed by Chivista is in fact neutral, appropriate, and well sourced. I pointed out that that there happens to be a popular book entitled: "100 People who are Screwing Up America (and Al Franken is #37)" by bestselling author Bernard Goldberg. This is reasonable and relevant. The highlighting of Franken was done by the author, not me. This is not an obscure book- it is literally on the the shelves of airport bookstores out there. I am not stating any opinion, but rather highlighting Franken's impact on the media. Is criticism in popular literature off limits?

I think it's common courtesy to make a note of those deletions, and the reason for them, on the "talk" page - even if it's an uncontroversial removal, it makes it clear to other editors that it was an intentional act. Still, I should not have called it "vandalism" withoug looking into it further, and I'm sorry. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 21:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A mediator has ruled that Frankenlies.com is NOT spam. Here is the mediator's response:
<dl>
<dd><i>::No, it is not. Spam according to policy is widespread inclusion of external links. The inclusion of a valid external link related to the article is not spam. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 19:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</i>

<dd><i>That is only one form of SPAM.

<dl>
<dd><i>I'm well aware of what the forms of spam are. However, keep in mind two things: one, WP:SPAM is not policy, it is a guideline. Two, from that page: "There are four types of wikispam: advertisements masquerading as articles, wide-scale external link spamming, bandspam (tangential references instead of disambiguation which promote some entity) and "Wikipedian-on-Wikipedian" spamming or, "canvassing" (also known as "internal spamming" and "cross-posting")." Frankenlies.com is not the 1st kind of spam, as this article is about Lying Liars. It is not the 2nd kind of spam because it is not being widely included. It is not the 3rd kind of spam because it is not tangential, it is directly related. It is not the 4th kind of spam because it is not "crossposting" across user talk pages.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Therefore, this site fails to meet all 4 definitions of spam.</i></dd>

<li>Dave Pierre, SwatJester didn't "rule" anything -he offered an opinion, an opinion that has no more or less weight than mine or yours on this website. Wikipedia doesn't have a heirarchy like that. SwatJester has administrative tools he is authorized to use, but otherwise has no more authority than you or I do. You can ask him yourself, if you don't believe me. At the very least, your inclusion of your own website is a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of Interest</a>. You shouldn't be the one fighting this battle, for your own website. You aren't a disinterested editor as regards your own self-published web pages. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">David Shankbone</a> 15:11, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't see that there was a dispute here. Even ignoring the obvious conflict of interest involved in posting your own site, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> prevents your site from being linked from here. Here's the relevant part of the policy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material found in self-published books, zines, websites or blogs should never be used, unless written or published by the subject (see below). These sources should also not be included as external links in BLPs, subject to the same exception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will continue to revert this link per BLP guidelines. Also note that there are no external links critical of, say, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. In both cases, it's certainly not because they aren't out there. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 10:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC) <a name="Franken.27s_degree" id="Franken.27s_degree"></a></p>

<p>I just removed a reference to the degree that Al Franken earned. According to our article, his degree was in government, citing <i>Time</i> magazine, which only refers to his year of graduation, not to his major. According to his <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=719955132&amp;highlight" class="external text" title="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=719955132&amp;highlight" rel="nofollow">Facebook profile</a>, he majored in general studies. (To see the Facebook profile, you will have to become his friend on Facebook to see it; I think he usually friends anyone who asks.) Ordinarily I would see citing Facebook as something akin to amputating a limb, but Facebook's system of registration provides a fairly high degree of certainty that Franken is actually the one behind his profile.</p>
<p>Please note that I have merely removed reference to his particular major, since that is the item in doubt. I have not replaced it with his major according to facebook.</p>
<p>I sent an email to his campaign website, alfranken.com, asking for further confirmation. I will post further bulletins as events warrant. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Dickman_bcce.html" title="User:Karl Dickman">Karl&#160;Dickman</a>&#160;<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarl_Dickman_2fc9.html" title="User talk:Karl Dickman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 20:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Listen, I like Al, I'm a Democrat, mostly liberal, etc.</p>
<p>But some of the language in here seems awfully POV-ish. I'm going to try and find a transcript of his Fresh Air comments re Fox and the book. As written now, it sounds incredibly biased. He may well have said all that, but directly quoting him would come across much more clearly as reporting, vs. bias. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 15:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
