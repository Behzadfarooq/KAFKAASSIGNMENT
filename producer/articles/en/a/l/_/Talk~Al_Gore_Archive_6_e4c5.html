<p>From 'Views and Controversies': "His views on environmental policy have been cast in the media as politically radical and Canada hating." Any documentation there? I googled "Al Gore Canada Controversy" and found a Wikipedia article stating that in a 2000 poll, Canadians said that they would vote for Gore over Bush by a 20% margin.</p>

<p>Recent edits were by me, my first contribution to wikipedia, hope it's appreciated. Just noticed the account creation option after making edits.</p>
<p>Brief summary of changes:</p>
<p>1) Margin of 537 votes on which the election hung out of approx 105 million was astonishingly close.</p>
<p>2) Article presented only one side of the significant controversies surrounding the election and the recounts.</p>
<p>3) Statement was made that if a statewide recount had been made, Gore "would have" won the election. The cited source does NOT state OR support this conclusion; it states very clearly that Gore "MIGHT" have won. Huge difference there.</p>

<p>Also, there have been other columnists and pundits who have said that if Gore was to run, he would be the frontrunner. I think it is common logic to realize that. If he and Hillary were both to run, they each would be frontrunners. Notice, the sentence did not say the frontrunner, but a frontrunner, which is gramatically correct. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisDJackson_0242.html" title="User:ChrisDJackson">ChrisDJackson</a></p>

I thought that all that was being claimed, was that this was the coldest January 15 (measured by lowest temperature) in 47 years. (For which I know of no evidence but would be interested. If measured by mean temperature, instead of lowest temperature, it's not true, for which see evidence at noaa.gov, going to their climate data for NY City.) <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a>‐<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchissel_dfe5.html" title="User talk:Schissel"><i>bowl listen</i></a> 02:52, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mr. Jackson: I realize that you are fervent believer in global warming and that you regard the attacks on this speech as cheap. I suspect that a disinterested reader who read this paragraph would come away with the impression that the attacks were, at the very least, factually challenged. Nonetheless, this event got about as much attention as anything Gore did between dropping out of the race and the Democratic National Convention, so it is deserving of coverage. Personally, I think that it makes some of Al Gore's foes look rather bad. (For somebody who elsewhere complains about the threat of having your content destroyed, you certainly seem awfully quick to remove other people's content.)</dd>

<p>And it doesn't matter if global warming has been proven to exist. If it sounds like a really bad thing, then we have to treat it as if it definitely exists, just because of the gravity of the situation, hypothetical or not. There are ideologues on both sides of the issue.</p>

<dd>That's not entirely your call to make; the 32kb advised limit exists for a reason. Furthermore, it's somewhat good form - it seems better, usually, to have multiple lengthy articles on a subject, rather than one überlengthy article. However, I rarely see a major reason to snip an article because it's gotten a little large. If it were, say, 70kb, then there'd be a definite case for splitting it out into sub-articles. Please don't be so defensive about it; this can be discussed. Personally, I don't see a major reason to split it at this moment.

<p>Mr. Jackson, I am not the only person to complain about this. As you will note from my previous comment, the size of the article <i>was</i> discussed in March 2004 — which you know, because you participated in that discussion. Moreover, the wiki itself complains about articles that get over 32KB in size, which is why I noticed the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>I am definitely not trying to destroy content. I am trying to relocate content and remove duplication of content. What is the point of having a really in-depth discussion of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign here when there is already an article specifically discussing Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign? It's much better to keep all this information in one place, if only so that the reader doesn't have to shuttle back-and-forth between that article and this just to get all the facts.</p>
<p>Finally, putting on my spelling and grammar nazi hat: neither of the "its" in your comment should have an apostrophe. "In depthness", insofar as it is a word or phrase, should be hyphenated.</p>

<dd>I agree. When an article gets over 32k, it should be split unless there is a very good reason not. I don't see any such reason here. Cutting off some of the election campaign stuff in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Summary Style</a>, as long as it is all duplicated in the election article, sounds like a reasonable way to do it, but count me neutral as far as exactly how the article should be cut down. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:44, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I don't see a problem with the Gore page. If it were to be cut down, the way to do it is to craft a summary of a particular topic that's covered elsewhere, rather than excising it entirely, and deciding exactly what goes into the summary can be a time-consuming and disputatious process. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 03:53, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong, Ohio is a perfect example of where it was important to count every vote. Couting votes does not just include those that were cast and count, but those in dispute that were thrown out for various reasons. Also, perfect example was in Washington's governor race. Mrs. Gregoire would have lost if it would have not been for the counting of the 700 votes in King County. Now, she is ready to assume the governship next month because the were counted.

<p>I would like whoever is removing the reference in election 2000 to the challenge of the Florida electors to stop doing so. It is a crucial part of election 2000 and I believe it needs to be included. Didn't you see Fahrenheit 911? It is truth the the Congressional Black Caucus stood up in the congressional chambers to challenge the Florida electors. It is truth that not one Senator's signature could be garnered to sign the challlenge. It is truth that the lawsutis were initiated by George W. Bush. It is truth that the Florida electors counted were not the original set of electors sent to Washington. It is truth that there was outrage about disenfranchisement of blacks. It was not just an "abnormality," it was fraud, as was shown when the NAACP had to settle out of court with Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris which is also a fact not included here. Why do you insist on sugarcoating the facts of this heionous act? Is not an encyclopedia supposed to tell the truth? And yes, I am an anon user and I prefer to stay that way. Thank you.

I'll give one example: With regard to the standards of vote counting in Florida, when you write "Al Gore would have won if most of the methods were adopted" as opposed to "some", this sounds like an attempt to say that Gore should have won. The actual number of methods is in reality irrelevant: the fact is that some of the standards would have led to a Gore victory, and some to a Bush victory.

<dd>If the amount of methods is irrelevant, why do mention it at all then? The press said he would have won if most of the methods were adopted, as did the NORC consortium count.That is not taking it from any view but TRUTH. Where are your sources to back the original comment then? I don't see them noted anywhere here. Telling the facts as they happened is representing no point of view but the truth. I will keep putting thay truth here as long as it keeps being removed. You want links to support it, I'll provide them, but don't assume I am taking this from any angle but as it happened.

<p>Why should I have to discuss this, when you say people (plural) have reverted my edits, without showing any reason WHY or discussing it themselves? I am being treated biasedly here. This encyclopedia is for anyone to edit articles. How then can a rule be broken if users are allowed to edit? You have also given me NO substantiated reason as to why I cannot include historical fact regarding the challenge to the electoral votes in this section. You have already taken it upon yourself that my edits will be given NO consideration by your unfriendly responses. Check your facts regarding the challenge to the Florida electors that took place in 2001. Check your facts regarding how the electors were chosen. Check your facts regarding the outcome of the recount. I won't even waste my time anymore trying to tell truth here. It is obvious you and all who run this page are only out to make a sugarcoated version of this event. I will then look elsewhere to find people who post this historical event truthfully.

<dd>There is zero chance Gore is going to run, and even less of a chance that he would be nominated. He may put out some feelers just for fun, but Gore is not even a blip on the politcal radar.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I question why there's even a section documenting an event that may or may not occur in the future. If there was actually some evidence that Gore was planning a bid for the Whithouse in '08 then the fact that he is making plans could be included. But as it is the section says very little other than "Gore could run in '08."</p>
<p>Even if the section is kept, it should be written in a way that would still make sense if it was being read in 2009 whether or not Gore had run. The last sentence with it's "Gore has not yet..." is the problem IMO.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is A LOT of talk about and support for a Gore run in 2008 in the "netroots" of the Democratic party. For example, <a href="http://www.draftgore.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.draftgore.com/" rel="nofollow">DraftGore.com</a> is already active and I've seen quite a few very active petitions. Just about every straw poll I've seen that includes him as a choice, comes out with him being the number one or two choice. Granted, this is mostly in the progressive blogosphere and not out in the physical "grassroots," but it's still a lot of support. This being early 2006, before even the midterms, it wouldn't make sense for Gore to give any indication of what he intends to do. Most candidates don't make their final decisions until around the middle of the year before a presidential election. Also, Wikipedia articles are updated frequently and speak in terms of "now" and not in such permanent language used in hard-copy encyclopedias. As time progresses and things change, so do the wiki articles. Uruz7 06:46, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, there was a recent front-page article in The American Prospect about Gore and the prospect of an '08 campaign: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewPrint&amp;articleId=11299" class="external text" title="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewPrint&amp;articleId=11299" rel="nofollow"><i>The New New Gore</i></a> Uruz7 06:57, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How does tying an article to a PAC committee website seeking political donations add to the concept, value, or nature of an encyclopedia? How does removal of such links constitute vandalism? Johnwhunt 18:29, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From Wikipedia: "Vandalism is indisputable bad-faith addition, deletion, or change to content, made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia. The largest quantity of vandalism consists of replacement of prominent articles with obscenities, namecalling, or other wholly irrelevant content. Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad faith edits that do not make their bad faith nature explicit and inarguable, are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia."</p>
<p>Jpgordon, I ask again - how is deleting PAC committee websites vandalism? Johnwhunt 15:26, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that this edit was vandalism, since as far as I can tell there's a good-faith dispute. I think that the Al Gore Support Center and the others go far beyond merely being "website[s] seeking political donations". Each of them has more detailed information about Gore, which is one of the circumstances under which an external link is appropriate. Calling them "campaign" sites, however, is potentially misleading, given that Gore has not announced any campaign for 2008. I've left the links in but removed that subheading. While I was at it, I converted all the "External links" subheadings into normal Wikipedia format, so that they show up in the table of contents. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 18:06, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks, James, for the comment. It was not vandalism, and I, in case you couldn't tell, bristled at the suggestion. However, I still believe it is inappropriate for an article to link onto a PAC or other donation site.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia: What Wikipedia is not: Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a chatroom, discussion forum, or vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not: 1. Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.</p>

There's NPOV, and then there's spin. Certainly this fact is debated, but if you go back to the original source he's grandstanding a bit, perhaps, but he was definitely the only politician of the time to recognize that funding should go to this nascent Internet to make it the Internet that's publicly accessible today.

<p>The mention of being cousins with Gore Vidal has been deleted as "believed to be false". Vidal has mentioned this several times in easily confirmable media. It is also easy to confirm that Vidal's grandfather was Thomas Gore, the senator from Oklahoma. It might be a total coincidence that there was a totally unrelated senator Al Gore Sr. from Tennessee a few decades later, but membership in congress often runs in the family and it seems uncoincidental when combined with Vidal's statements. I haven't seen any documentation showing that Vidal lied about this. The fact that Al Gore Jr. doesn't seem to have commented is understandable since he wants to keep his centrist appeal and avoid public emphasis on a family connection with an outspoken liberal.

<p>There was text in the "Views and Controversies" section that referred to Gore's 9-23-02 speech to the Commonwealth Club <a href="http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> as supporting the invasion.

<p>The thing about Gore not telling Lieberman that he was about to endore Dean... if anyone wants to reinsert that in a way that doesn't disrupt the flow of the writing, I won't object, but it would be better with a reference. In contrast, I will insist on a verifiable reference for any claim that Gore ever supported President Bush's invasion of Iraq. I have followed the issue and have seen no evidence that he ever took a position other than to oppose the invasion. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 06:20, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">comments on latest edits</span></h2>
<p>Some of the material that Kirby Morgan edited did indeed contain POV language in favor of Gore. But in several cases, Morgan has replaced it with language that I feel is POV against Gore. For example, to say that Gore "claimed" something makes sense if the claim is genuinely disputed, but if the claim is not disputed it is more neutral to say that Gore "said" something.</p>
<p>In other cases, Morgan has added what appear to me to be unsourced allegations against Gore. Did Gore really call Rush Limbaugh a "distinguished American"? Morgan hasn't given us a reference for this, so I don't know. One could argue that much of what is already in the article is unreferenced, which would be true. But it is especially important to provide references for negative (or laudatory) statements about Gore, because they are especially likely to be controversial.</p>
<p>Kirby, thanks for your edits. If we build on them I think they will ultimately lead to a better article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gore's Vietnam service</span></h2>
<p>I find that the section of Al Gore's vietnam service fails the neutral POV test. It describes his service *exclusively* in terms of how it has been contradicted by various (imo irreputable) sources, completely fails to mention Mr. Gore's service as a swift boat captain, completely fails to mention how Mr. Gore earned his three purple hearts that eventually lead to his honorable discharge.</p>
<p>The fact that the end of Mr. Gore's end of service is describe as a "discharge" as opposed to an "honorable discharge" is an insult to servicemen everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure how to fix this section, but it's clear to me that extensive revision is necessary. Neutral POV does not mean simply omitting all the information that any knucklehead objects to.</p>

<p>Irregularities favoring Bush included the notorious Palm Beach "butterfly ballots", which were alleged to have produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for Reform Rarty candidate <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> (however, the Reform Party candidate had received about as many votes in the 1996 election), and a purge of some 50,000 alleged felons from the Florida voting rolls that included many voters who were eligible to vote under Florida law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unreferenced and I don't know whether it's true. But more importantly, it's not the comparison that most people found relevant in 2000. In 1996, Ross Perot was the Reform Party candidate and did far better nationwide than did Pat Buchanan in 2000. Pat Buchanan got far more votes in Palm Beach County, per capita, than in other Florida counties in 2000, and that's the comparison that most people made. <a href="http://elections.fas.harvard.edu/wssmh/node3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://elections.fas.harvard.edu/wssmh/node3.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 20:55, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">explanation for changing/removing text on Bush v. Gore</span></h2>
<p>I'm removing the second block of text in bold here, and substituting the first part in bold for what was there before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al Gore publicly conceded the election after the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> in <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_v._Gore_bc81.html" title="Bush v. Gore">Bush v. Gore</a></i> voted 7 to 2 to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional <b>because it feared that different standards would be used in different parts of the state</b>, and 5 to 4 to ban recounts using other procedures <b>which could have extended the deadline for the vote count. A practical matter, that there was no longer time to recount the votes yet again without a deadline extension, sealed the election victory for President George W. Bush.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second sentence I'm removing because I feel it is stating an opinion as fact: Florida was <i>ordered</i> to stop the recount, and the <i>Supreme Court</i> judged there was not time to recount within the deadline. Florida was in the process of trying, and we'll never know if they would have succeeded. The last part of the first sentence I don't understand. I thought the "other procedures" referred to procedures that would correct the problems the Court had with the recount as it was. Where did extending the deadline come in? Finally, I'm making the change in the first sentence because that's my understanding of the decision. The ongoing recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court was already statewide. If I'm wrong please explain. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 22:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fox News calling for Bush</span></h2>
<p><i>On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, then Fox News decided to call it for Bush and all of the other news stations followed their decision.</i> This quote is seriously biased and misleading. Here's a chronology of that night: 19:49 EST: NBC calls Florida for Gore 19:50 EST: CBS calls Florida for Gore 19:52 EST: Fox calls Florida for Gore 20:02 EST: ABC calls Florida for Gore 22:00 EST: CBS retracts Florida for Gore 2:16 EST: Fox calls Florida for Bush 2:17:30 EST: NBC calls Florida for Bush 2:17:52 EST: CBS calls Florida for Bush 2:20 EST: ABC calls Florida for Bush 3:57 EST: CBS retracts Florida for Bush 4:00 EST: ABC retracts Florida for Bush 4:02 EST: NBC retracts Florida for Bush 4:05 EST: Fox retracts Florida for Bush</p>
<p>The reason that the decisions seem clumped together is because all the networks shared the same feed from the Voter News Survey. The quote makes it seem that everyone called Florida for Gore than switched to Bush on Fox's singso. In fact in the space of a few minutes everyone called it for Gore, there was a long pause where the networks retract that [not listed up there, but the other non-CBS networks will retract Florida], in the space of a few minutes everyone calls it for Bush, there is another interugnum and (to repeat the refrain) in the space of a few minutes everyone retracts it from Bush.

<li>Me, I think <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhea_Perlman_2da3.html" title="Rhea Perlman">Rhea Perlman</a>'s more likely the alien. But the stupidest damn thing about this is that March 31, 1948 isn't 280 days, it's 281 days after the Roswell incident; 1948 was a leap year. So, going by No Dodo's presentation (of the generally agreed upon gestation period), we should be looking for aliens among people born on March 30. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 04:36, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">South Park reference</span></h2>
<p>I don't think that South Park featuring Gore as a character in an episode (not actually voiced by Gore) is a notable part of his life. If a barely-notable person were featured as a character on South Park, that might be a notable part of his or her life (probably not, but maybe). But for someone as hugely famous as Gore, I don't think it really registers. I doubt it would even appear in a book-length biography. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:16, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pro-life politician</span></h2>
<p>Al Gore used to have a pro-life political stance and therefore belongs in the Pro-life politican category. Even though he no longer has this stance, he still belongs in the category, just as former Jews are still in Jewish categories. 75.3.4.54 01:50, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Former Jews are still in Jewish categories because "Jewish" is used as an ethnic, as well as a religious, label. Are former Christians still in Christian categories? I'm honestly not sure, but whether they are or not, there's also the issue of whether Gore was ever pro-life. He was once against federal funding for abortion, and he was once (and may still be, for all I know) personally against abortion. For some people, that's enough to call a person pro-life. But other people use the term "pro-life" to refer to people who are against legalized abortion, which Gore has never been. That's why (setting aside the issue of former-vs-current views), categorizing Gore as "pro-life" is inherently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>: it is only true from a non-consensus point of view. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Or the fact that while attending the Cannes premier, Gore and his WHOLE MOTORCADE decided to DRIVE rather than walk a single half-mile to the theater. It would be interesting to compare the amount of global-warming pollution Gore created in that single half-mile with his WHOLE MOTORCADE to the average created by individual Americans (and we won't even discuss the pollution he created just attending the premier ...). Don't you liberals ever have trouble keeping a straight face sometimes when you're preaching this silliness?</p>

But anyway, if any of you bothered to listen to the man you would actually learn that he offsets all his polluting activities by planting trees, sequestration etc. Consequently he is one of the very few people on this earth who can genuinely claim to live a carbon neutral life.

<p>I would like to ask why there is no reference in this article to his Climate Project, or his organization, Alliance for Climate Protection. I would be more than happy to write up a paragraph including those links if I can. Also, as I have read here previously, this is a site that deals in facts. Therefore I find it curious that political speculation is being allowed to be posted here. I think it is obvious that people wanting him to run are posting biased views on that rather than concentrating on the important work he is doing now regarding the climate crisis. He is also starting a grassroots effort in 2007 calling for a carbon freeze, and hoping to deliver 1 million signatures to Congress regarding global warming legislation. I really fail to see how this article cannot be deemed biased when it is obviously geared more to political speculation than current reality.

<p>The "Environment" section claims that Gore "helped" MMT receive funding from DOE. The reference, which isn't a suitable source anyway, says nothing of the kind. I'll note that it was full of highly POV phrasing, which I redacted. If anyone can verifiably source that Gore extended regulatory assistance to this company, that would be great.

<dd>Agree. Move it to talk on the the controversies subarticle, and see if anyone wants it. It's far too trivial to go here, I'm not even sure what the "controversy" is. "Views and Controversies" is a nonsensical section. What do the two have in common? We ought to have a separate Controversies section with a link to the main article, using <a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">Template:Main</a>.

<dd>(Edit conflicted, but I'll just drop my reply in anyway). That's exactly the reason for subarticles, to keep excessive detail out of the main article. That's particularly important for "controversies" articles, since every partisan on the planet wants to drop every detail of every piffle into wikipedia. That said, I don't care if the oil thing goes away entirely. I've seen no evidence at all that it was a notable or significant controversy. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 03:57, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sympathetic to the desire to have a valve for the partisan stuff; however, I'm not sure that using a subarticle as a sink for these things is the best solution. As that filmthreat citation showed, the subarticle can be just as visible to the outside world as the main article. People can still quote it and say, "Here's what Wikipedia sees fit to say on this topic..." The heated debate can be draining, but I fear that sometimes the only solution is to face the issue directly and say, "No, that's just not an encyclopedic element of Al Gore's life." --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 04:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, if it's a one-off addition, we can safely dump it. But, if it keeps getting added, it's because it <i>is</i> notable, even if only to a fringe crowd. In that case there is value to getting all the facts out there; otherwise the only coverage on the net is the partisan take. Second, it might be possible to hold the line on Gore, since he's not really that prominent at the moment. But, I'm a grizzled veteran of battles with POV-pushers from the Swift Vet days onwards. And it's just a losing fight on even a moderately active article; it can't be done without eternal vigilance.</dd>

<dd>My preference is to go ahead and get a good neutral version in place, on the subarticle. That can be defended from partisans with simple reverts, without cries of censorship. If we try to keep minor controversies out as unencyclopedic, then newcomers will just assume it hasn't been covered yet. Then they'll write a new horrible version, and insist that it be included, and it will generate endless battles and endless editing before it is eventually purged again. And then the cycle repeats. Having a good base version to defend breaks the POV-pushing cycle; you can just punch revert unless it's a genuine improvement.</dd>

On the general question of the "controversies" article. I think it's a good idea to have such an article, though the current one is weak. A good article could be very useful, explaining what was actually said and the actual facts are, who first started various storylines, etc. In the case of Gore, a remarkable number of controversies were invented out of whole cloth by the media and repeated endlessly; others are highly exaggerated.

<dd>If we can find something else I agree. Unless a picture is specifically intended to convey a particular emotion, then we should use a non-negative one if possible. In my opinion, usual practice for all article should be to post one of the more flattering pics available. That makes for a more attractive encyclopedia, and eliminates any problem with pic-switching games.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other observations. A few of the pics on this page are of technically poor quality, at least at the presented size. For example, I'd suggest enlarging the convention acceptance pic, possibly cropping it a bit on the sides to facilitate that. Crop the Clinton &amp; Gore walking pic too; it's badly framed. The top pic looks very old, is there something more current available? Do we really need Futurama, Saturday Night Live, and Southpark?

<p>This needs a brief summary of the controversies article. Strangely, "views and controversies" was a section. I separated out the views, and was left with only a greatly over-detailed internet quote section for controversies. I cut that as unsuitable. So, now we need a paragraph or two describing each section on the controversy article in a sentence or two. For the moment, I've added a "see also link" to the controveries article at the bottom, replacing a narrower controversies link. The coverage of "views" is embarassingly slim. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 21:43, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no intent to "hide away". That's the whole point of providing a summary section here. Remember though, this is an encyclopedia article, not a book. We are supposed to provide an overview of the notable aspects of the subject. There's nothing wrong with a more in-depth analysis of specialist topics about a subject; that's the point of a controversy article. We can actually provide greater coverage there than would ever be appropriate in the main article. Our job is neither to hide away nor to highlight, but to provide a dispassionate overview of greatest utility to the ordinary reader. In the scope of history, a misinterpreted remark about the internet hardly deserves twice as much space as the entire presentation of his views on all major issues put together. Is the Internet tempest really what schoolkids should know most about Al Gore? I think not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">David Foster Edits</span></h2>
<p>David Foster Edits were reverted for the following reasons. Other politicians articles do not list grades. These facts are well documented and not in dispute. Al Gore was not the first Presidential candidate to lose his home state. GHW Bush lost all of New England in 1992 just to name one. --<a href="../../../8/b/i/User%7E8bitJake_8c43.html" title="User:8bitJake">8bitJake</a> 18:28, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're in error, Jake. GHWBush claimed Texas as his home state, despite the fact that his 'property' in Texas was an undeveloped smallish lot in a prestigious area of Houston, and his 'home' in Texas was a hotel suite permanently rented in his name, and he spent much more time in his Kennebunkport Maine vacation home. Even though the Bushs are definitely from Connecticut, they call themselves Texans.</p>
<p>Then the information should also be changed on the 2000 presidential election page for it has the very facts which you reverted <small>(<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.122.192.129 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.122.192.129.html" title="User talk:202.122.192.129">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.122.192.129_e11a.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.122.192.129">contribs</a>).</small>)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">War Views</span></h2>
<p>How can it be argued that supporting the 1991 Gulf War and then opposing the 2003 Iraq War is evidence of a change in political stance. The 1991 War was the response to an Iraqi invasion of a sovereign state and was supported by the United Nations and a massive coalition contributing troops and logistical support to Desert Shield/Desert Storm/Operation Granby. The 2003 War (which I support incidentally) was, regardless of stance, sold to the American and British public through deception and outright lies based on heavily flawed intelligence. The fact that Gore's stance has not changed is shown in this article by the fact that he supported the 1998 actions against Slobodan Milosovic and also Operation Desert Fox.</p>

<p>"His Keynote presentation on global warming has received standing ovations, and he has presented it at least 1000 times."</p>
<p>I think a statement like this should be referenced somehow to show its factual basis, and thus prove its objectivity as a statement. It looks like someone who just wanted me to know Al Gore's speech is cool and he speaks it alot.</p>

<p>Here's a paragraph on Gore's effect (or lack thereof) on the environment in general during 1993-2001 that his fans censor from the main article. It's contrary to the perceptions that they wish to promote. Bottom line is that Gore has never owned up or even mentioned these items in his "new" championing of the environment.</p>

<dd>Hey, how about a little <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> here?!? Ok, the first thing you need to know is that you're in danger of violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a>. Second, and more importantly, absolutely <i>none</i> of the sources you've cited to support your claim mention Gore. Zero. Your use of the sources to support your claim about his legacy therefore constitutes original research in violation of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research policy</a>. Finally, the wording you use is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and provides undue weight to an anti-Gore viewpoint. Consider, for example, that one could counter your point by stating that the Republicans were in control of congress for nearly all of the Clinton-Gore administration, or one could argue that Gore was in no posisiton to exert influence on policy when when he was not even President and his party did not control the legislature. I haven't inserted these arguments into the article because they are my opinion, much like the information you have inserted is yours. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 21:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Supreme Court Decision</span></h2>
<p>Some clarification probably needs to be made in the second paragraph as far as "7-2" vs. "5-4" on the decision. The <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_v._Gore_bc81.html" title="Bush v. Gore">Bush v. Gore</a> article referenced in the same paragraph states "In three separate opinions, seven justices found that a ballot recount then being conducted in certain counties in the State of Florida was to be stopped due to the lack of a consistent standard; two justices disagreed. A 5-4 majority further declared in a per curiam opinion that there was insufficient time to establish standards for a new recount that would meet Florida's deadline for certifying electors." Given this, I can see why someone would change this article to read 7-2, since that seems to apply to the stopping of the recount while the 5-4 said that there was not time to establish a new standard. I don't know which is correct, but I perceive an inconsistency which should be corrected in one or both articles. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian_G_f919.html" title="User talk:Brian G">Talk</a>) 17:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">South Park picture (again)</span></h2>
<p>Over a long period, the Southpark pic has been inserted and removed numerous times. I don't really see the relevance of even the reference, and certainly not of a picture of it. It's an encylopedia article about Gore. And a reference in a comedy central cartoon just doesn't seem that relevant to the scope of the man's importance. Not that it should be censored, there's already an <a href="../../../m/a/n/ManBearPig_046c.html" title="ManBearPig">entire article</a> on it. should leave the ManBearPig pic to that SouthPark episode article. (It's very dubious whether the use of that pic even qualifies as fair use for this article, but that's a separate issue.)</p>
<p>But at any rate, to those of you who support the inclusion here. Would you also support putting the Southpark "Jesus shitting on Bush and US flag" picture in both the Jesus and Bush articles? I don't think it has much relevance to them, no more so than SouthPark to this. But what's the difference, if there is one?

<dd>The picture is not necessary. I'm ambivalent about mentioning the SP episode as Gore did comment on it at one point but it's rather trivial.

<dd>You're gonna see a constant attempt to hype the South Park episode. The same thing happened on the IMDB forum for an Inconvenient truth (I'm a bit biased on this topic). Those hoping to attack Gore think promoting the south park episode does so.

<dd>NEW YORK (Reuters) Mon Sep 18, 5:27 PM ET - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Monday suggested taxing carbon dioxide emissions instead of employees' pay in a bid to stem global warming.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Penalizing pollution instead of penalizing employment will work to reduce that pollution," Gore said in a speech at New York University School of Law.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The pollution tax would replace all payroll taxes, including those for Social Security and unemployment compensation, Gore said. He said the overall level of taxation, would remain the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Instead of discouraging businesses from hiring more employees it would discourage business from producing more pollution," Gore said.</dd>

<p>I'm not sure how to work this apparently rather novel proposal into the article, and I don't have an account and the article is protected anyway, so I'll leave it to others. I think this should be included though, because this sort of thing hints he may be running for the 2008 nomination. 66.159.220.115 02:42, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2000 presidential election</span></h2>
<p>The article currently reads:</p>
<p>The popular political blog The Daily Howler contends that Gore lost the election due to a relentless media "war," (...) Singled out by The Daily Howler for particularly misleading accounts of Gore and his candidacy are Ceci Connolly of the Washington Post, Katherine "Kit" Seelye of the New York Times and television talk-show host Chris Matthews.</p>
<p>This is an important topic, although loaded with partisan sentiments. However, there is more than just the dailyhowler blog (which is, by political blog standards, only semipopular) making this claim:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5920188/the_press_vs_al_gore" class="external free" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5920188/the_press_vs_al_gore" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5920188/the_press_vs_al_gore</a> and also statements in Harris/Halperin: The Way to Win: Taking the White House in 2008 Centrist democrat blogger Mickey Kaus and even conservative pundit Joe Scarborough ("I think, in the 2000 election, I think [the media] were fairly brutal to Al Gore. I think they hit him hard on a lot of things like inventing the Internet and some of those other things, and I think there was a generalization they bought into that, if they had done that to a Republican candidate, I’d be going on your show saying, you know, that they were being biased.") made public statements going in the same direction.</p>
<p>I suggest to change as follows: There are several commentators (Eric Boehlert/link, Bob Somerby blog daily howler) contending that Gore etc ... Singled out for particularly misleading accounts of Gore and his candidacy etc</p>
<p>One might even go for a stronger formulation: "There are several accounts, some of which are well-documented, that ..." etc. It's clearly much more than just one blogger's opinion. Rbrilla 19:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I entirely agree. This is an encyclopedia, not a collection of trivia.

<dd>Don't agree. I think that most of these pop culture references are of interest and should stay (I am not sure about e.g. the songs at the convention and some other points). Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but must not copy limitations, style and presentation of e.g. the encyclopedia brittanica since it can do more. Since the trivia section is titled as such, it's easy to skip if you don't want to read it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rbrilla (<a href="../../../r/b/r/User_talk%7ERbrilla_50ad.html" title="User talk:Rbrilla">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rbrilla_6350.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rbrilla">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>2000 Presidential election Photograph caption reads:</p>
<p><i>After a close campaign, Gore greets President-select Bush at the White House in late December of 2000.</i></p>

<dd>Am I the only one who finds the trivia section worthwhile? If a politician has dubbed for futurama like Gore did, it is very hard to bring this into any of the other chapters, or him being the first politician on c-span ... still, both are apparently facts, and I do think they deserve being mentioned (about climbing Mt. Mckinley, I don't know...), and the best place for this page is the trivia section (if the page was about an actor, it's a completely different story, it must go into the description of his work). <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> states: "This guideline does not suggest deletion of trivia sections. Instead, consider it a list of "facts pending integration" or "facts lacking sufficient context for integration". Seek to minimize it." These facts are interesting, yet they can't be integrated reasonably, hence the trivia section. Thank you, Derex, for signing instruction. Rbrilla 19:21, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pictures</span></h2>
<p>For what it's worth, I think it's a good idea to update the picture in the infobox with a newer picture of Gore (the current picture is 12 years old).

Obviously, we shouldn't be using a picture that has unknown copyright status. But I hope the copyright status is the reason the image is being reverted, not merely a desire to have the old picture in the infobox. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 00:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
