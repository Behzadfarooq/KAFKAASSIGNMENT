	    <p>Asking "when were the weapons removed?" is the wrong question, and does nothing but cloud the issue. The real question is "Why wasn't the facility hit with an air strike during the air war and destroyed, *before* the invasion?" Destroying the enemies weapons stores is a central tenet in the art of war, and these weapons were well documented. It is gross deriliction of duty to allow a site like this to remain vulnerable to looting, and yet another example of the massive incompetence with which this war was executed.</p>
<p>Can anyone provide a good reason to have left this facility intact?</p>
<p>Were there any nearby structures that would present an unacceptably high number of civilian casualties? Was there a possibility of chemical or toxic weapons in the plants that could have been released into the atmosphere? I don't know, that's why I'm asking - though it sounds like a valid point not to hit it. - James 21:44, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On October 28, 2004, the <a href="../../../i/a/e/IAEA_43be.html" title="IAEA">IAEA</a> said it warned the United States about the vulnerability of explosives stored at Al-Qaqaa after Iraq's <a href="../../../t/u/w/Tuwaitha.html" title="Tuwaitha">Tuwaitha</a> nuclear complex was looted. "After we heard reports of looting at the Tuwaitha site in April 2003, the agency's chief <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> inspectors alerted American officials that we were concerned about the security of the high explosives stored at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaqaa_1eb2.html" title="Al-Qaqaa">Al-Qaqaa</a>," IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>. She did not say which officials were notified or exactly when. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041028-115519-3700r.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041028-115519-3700r.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>About 380 tons of RDX and HMX, used in making such arms, were reported missing from the Al-Qaqaa weapons facility, though the Pentagon and an embedded NBC News correspondent said the facility appeared to have been emptied by the time U.S. forces got there. [] --Washington Times</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's why it says in the Timeline, "Internal IAEA memorandum reportedly warns that terrorists might be helping "themselves to the greatest explosives bonanza in history.""&#160;;-) If someone were to actually produce those documents or confirm who it came to, it should be upgraded from "reportedly" to whatever. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 19:43, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Democrats, which I suppose includes whoever's writing this article, keep <b>implying</b> that US troops got to Al Qaqaa and then didn't bother to check up on the 380 tons of explosives.</p>
<p>The news reports I've heard, plus the Wikipedia article (before I started correcting it), say or hint that the 3rd Division just breezed into town and remained oblivious -- which is Bush's fault for letting the Pentagon ignore the noble, selfless and utterly trustworthy IAEA.</p>
<p>To make it worse, when the 101st Division got there, they discovered that all the explosives had been looted <b>since the arrival of the the 3rd Division</b>.</p>
<p>Well, the facts don't all point to this point of view, so this POV should not be reported in the Wikipedia as an 'undisputed fact' and put in a timeline as if everyone knew it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to fix the entire article. I simply don't have time. But if there is anyone who believes in accuracy AND the Wikipedia's NPOV policy, I'll thank them to put in BOTH SIDES of the story. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(El Dunce)</a> 15:50, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm the original author of (and followup author of most of) the summary, HE, facilities, and timelines sections (not the overview). I think you must be referring to the overview section though. Just to be clear, I have VERY high standards, which means that I think that everything must be either from original documents (in other words, first hand accounts that were documented, such as contemporary IAEA media advisories, video footage, or documents such as satellite photos); from multiple-sourced media reports (i.e. not just multiple stories but stories with <i>different</i> sources); under these circumstances. Some small amount of other stuff (some accounts that were first-hand but given after the fact) gets in with the qualification "reportedly".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, at the moment I don't have the time to deal with the "overview" section which as I said was written by someone else. The issues you discuss seem to apply only to that section. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 19:40, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So a single IAEA statement has credibility, but not a single statement from a US army soldier? Sounds like anti-US bias to me. Why not just balance the 2 points of view?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Have you looked at the IAEA material? I (personally) do not consider an IAEA statement to have any more credibility than a Pentagon statement. However I do consider an official IAEA statement to have more credibility than a soldier's statement (from anyone's army). NPOV doesn't come from providing two POVs (two wrongs don't make a right). We must evaluate the material that is available against reasonable yardsticks ourselves, not just repeat the verbiage brought forth by different factions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the IAEA material I have based many of the timeline points on is not a statement. One of the (group of) sources I reviewed consist of dozens of media releases and daily summaries released by the IAEA and UNMOVIC at the time (contemporaneously, as it were). These are still archived online, and can also be verified at a bunch of 3rd party sites. These were of course released long before the controversy began. I have also reviewed, IAEA and UNMOVIC speeches to the Security Council, and media coverage of IAEA statements to the press to make sure that they match the other documents.<a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 01:46, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't mind if you say "reportedly", as long as people stop deleting the dozens of quotes I keep finding which balance the UN/Kerry point of view. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(El Dunce)</a> 20:28, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I deleted one, because I didn't think it belonged in the summary (as it was fairly particular). Next time I'll move it instead. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 01:46, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the dispute is between the UN and US versions of what happened, then please allow the article to provide a balance between the POVs of both those sides.</p>
<p>And if both those sides agree on a point, don't just consider it a given: say that both sides agree.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"according to the IAEA" ... also according to US government. it's not a disputed fact.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just because it's not a dispute doesn't mean it shouldn't be documented. Every part of this which we can find a source for (or 2 different sources, as you said above), should be documented. Don't you think so? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(El Dunce)</a> 20:41, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree. How about, that for the dispute elements, they will be gathered together into a section of the article that is on the subject of disputed elements. As you say there is much that is either undisputable due to primary evidence, and/or is totally agreed upon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the question if there is a dispute between UN and US (government). I do not believe this to be the case. There are certainly some people who would paint it that way, but overall I think that, despite the rhetoric, the major details stated as <b>facts</b> by the IAEA and the US govt are not disputed by the other side (the Iraq govt on the other hand, disagrees with the US in the statement that they were definitely taken post-invasion). So, I think the appropriate response (personally) is in the timeline to stick to the facts -- which up until the KSTP footage came out left it open (now to re-evaluate). <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 01:46, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed:</p>

<li>Ventilation shafts serving the facility remained open and provided easy access to the explosives, according to the IAEA. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137017,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137017,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<p>Two reasons. (1) IAEA is notorious for being extradorinarly anal about sealing things with thier little tamper evident seal, it is very unlikely that they would have noticed this and not taken action after noticing it (some thing which the report does not say did or did not happen). (2) Only one openly right wing news source is reporting it. <a href="../../../p/d/b/User%7EPdbailey_283d.html" title="User:Pdbailey">Pdbailey</a> 03:46, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

It would seem, though, that the IAEA also didnt think this was much of a problem (perhaps they were so small it would have been too difficult to remove the tonnes this way) <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 06:18, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is ballooning with political items, who said what, who claims what, and so on. I'm not particularly interested in that. I'm interested in what actually happened prior to when the NYT story came out.

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong; but wasn't Al Qaqaa one of several such facilities looted after the US invasion?

<p>This article is long overdue for a rewrite. There is no more need for electioneering here, and the issues surrounding al Qaqaa can be sorted out in a clearer manner instead of having two sides and a valiant but inaccurate attempt at "balance." Nobody seriously contends anymore that the weapons were removed prior to the US arrival. There is a quote on the page about the US having accounted for the weapons, but where are they then? If that were the case, the US could quickly put an end to this "controversy" by producing the evidence. This page makes it seem as if it were a big mystery where the weapons are and whether they were looted before or after the fall of Saddam but it's pretty clear where they are now; in the hands of insurgents. There is also the issue of weapons from other facilities, including nuclear material that went missing after the looting (I will need to re-research this point; it has been a while). But the nuclear stuff didn't get the media coverage that al-Qaqaa did because of the timing (it was discovered 2003 and forgotten by the election). My big objection here is that the article was mostly written before the 2004 election, and it sounds as if the only important issue here is the effect this will have on the election. Well, the election is over; what is the result of the investigation Bush allegedly was waiting for? The NYT reported in 2005 that insurgents looted the facility systematically, with organized trucks and people who obviously knew where the weapons were -- these were weapons that were under IAEA control under Saddam. I think it was in Dec. 2004 that they found a letter confirming that an Iraqi official sent Saddam a letter suggesting looting those explosives for suicide bombers to use in response to the US invasion. There is no question at all anymore that the weapons were stolen by Baathist insurgents, I don't think.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 09:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>TDC's recent edits deleted relevant and sourced material and changed the wording ofanother paragraph in order to push a POV that is not supported in any current reports about this situation. If he had actually followed the discussion on this page he would have noted my comments above; the election is over, and there is no reason to continue using this page for electioneering. It's 2006 now! There has been no U.S. investigation, and all the evidence since Oct 2004 has shown that the weapons were looted after the invasion.

<dd>First, Frank Rich is not a fountain of truth, and nothing could support the following statement:
<dl>
<dd>"It has since become clear that the explosives were removed <b>after</b> invading US forces captured the facility."</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Nobody called anyone a 'fountain of truth' except you. Frank Rich is simply summarizing what the NYT reported, which has never been refuted, since it was reported in 3/05, i.e. after the election. the right wing gave up on the bogus argument after the election, as you would know if you would read the rest of this talk page. It was confirmed that the weapons were taken after the invasion and there is <b>no</b> "evidence" to the contrary; simply 'claims' that turned out to be false. Why are you resurrecting election propaganda that was even abandoned by Bush? Now please stop the nonsense, unless you actually have any published info later than 3/05 on this issue.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 04:54, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As far as the NY Times piece goes, it is a news story, so to use it to definitively say one way or the other what really happened is misleading at best. Considering that there is photographic evidence that Russian generals Vladislav Achalov and Igor Maltsev were in Iraq days before the start of the invasion <a href="http://gazeta.ru/2003/04/02/Wedidntflyto.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://gazeta.ru/2003/04/02/Wedidntflyto.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, there is reason to believe that they had a hand in removing equipment, perhaps at as Shaw claims, perhaps not, but it does pass the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requirement. After all, they did not “fly to Baghdad to drink coffee”. This also appears to confirm what Gertz wrote back in 2004. Considering that it would have taken dozens of trucks to remove this much material, ordinary looters could not have pulled this off, and I doubt it could have occurred after the US troops were in the area.[ <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=20&amp;artnum=2&amp;issue=20060306" class="external free" title="http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=20&amp;artnum=2&amp;issue=20060306" rel="nofollow">http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=20&amp;artnum=2&amp;issue=20060306</a>] I know, its not from Wayne Madsen, but what can I say?</dd>

<dd>Why do you keep insisting that Wayne madsen has anything to do with any of this? Are you just so excited that you were once right about something that you have to keep reminding people even in places where it is totally irrelevant? As for the KTSP story, this does not have anything to do with this as far as I can tell -- your problem seems to be with the Frank Rich quote summarizing the LAT and NYT pieces that were reported after the election. Your claim that we can not use a news story definitively to say one thing or another is silly; I presume you prefer a frontpage summary of an unverifiable book? You can't just delete news reports you don't like. The idea that because Russian generals are there they must have had a hand in moving weapons is as ludicrous as reasoning that because a star appears in a CIA book that it was Valerie Plame's fault he or she got killed. As far as you "doubting" that this could have happened, your doubts are neither relevant or encyclopedic. We have eyewitnesses both US and Iraqi who contradict your Madsenesque "logic." By the way, you're right, IBD isn't Madsen, but it is the source of the claim that an "Iraqi intelligence manual" proved al Qaeda ties... the so-called manual was a web page from the Federation of American Scientists from 1997.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:14, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wayne Madsen has everything to do with the bar you place on your sources, but its just an observation on my part. The KTSP story has everything to do with it, because the video footage does not show IAEA seals at the site. Christopher Andrew is not at issue here, and has a much finer academic reputation than you will ever have I might add. A book from a widely respected academic (even the Nation Magazine has had nice things to say about Andrew) does not even exist on the same plane as 99.9995% of newspaper stories, including this one. We have no eyewitness, only second and third hand reports from the NY Times and LA Times and they should be treated as such, non-definitive. The “letters from Frank Rich to the Corinthians” are also not notable in this case. Rich is a talking head DNC opinion machine, and he has no expertise on this issue, only a lot of posturing. The fact that Russian generals were there goes to support one of Shaws claim that, well, the Russian military was in Iraq just before the invasion. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 23:37, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How many times must I concede I was wrong about Madsen? I knew nothing of him before you pointed the stuff out. I am not interested in your estimation of my reputation, nor am I interested in hearing more about how you are now tracking my IPs to learn my name, my home address, my place of work, or my academic reputation. I'm just not interested in anything you have to say about those things, and they are not relevant to the discussion; you are again just trying to intimidate. We have eyewitnesses who spoke to the LATimes and NYTimes; your insistence on keeping them out of wikipedia is pure censorship. Frank Rich summarizes those two articles; if you would like to quote from them directly perhaps we can remove the quote but otherwise it stays. The article on Russian generals does not mention this incident at all; any connection to it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<p>I'm going to suggest that the "evidence" sections be removed entirely after the information is incorporated into the narrative below. The representation of this as a debate with two sides that is still ongoing is absolutely fallacious. Nobody at all has been arguing in any published source since Nov. 2004 that the weapons were removed before the US invasion. Nobody. The arguments made before the election were contradictory -- they said the US moved the explosives, then they said the Iraqis took them before the invasion (both can't be true, and the first should be verifiable, but no evidence was presented). It's clear it was an election strategy to defeat the story, which is fine -- that's to be expected. But the election is over, and nobody in the public sphere is pretending anymore that the admin's stories are true. We can include a section indicating there was a dispute about this during the election, but wikipedia is meant to withstand the test of time; I'm hoping we can move beyond this silly right-wing/left-wing breakdown of such issues.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:15, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>. The "documentary evidence" -- you keep moving it, insisting it says the opposite of what it says. Please read it more carefully.</li>
<li>. Pentagon official section -- your summary is inferior; it makes it sound as if the fellow is anonymous in his daily life.</li>

<p>2) TDC deletes the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Frank Rich editorialized in the <i>New York Times</i> (May 15, 2005):
<dl>
<dd><i>It's also because of incompetent Pentagon planning that other troops may now be victims of weapons looted from Saddam's munitions depots after the fall of Baghdad. Yet when The New York Times reported one such looting incident, in Al Qaqaa, before the election, the administration and many in the blogosphere reflexively branded the story fraudulent. But the story was true. It was later corroborated not only by United States Army reservists and national guardsmen who spoke to The Los Angeles Times but also by Iraq's own deputy minister of industry, who told The New York Times two months ago that Al Qaqaa was only one of many such weapon caches hijacked on America's undermanned post-invasion watch.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe it should stay in as it summarizes the NYT and LAT reports on this issue. TDC deletes it because he doesn't like Frank Rich's opinion -- that is fine but it is clearly indicated as opinion; also, I have said over and over I would be happy to have that deleted if it is replaced with the same information from the sources themselves rather than just censored.(csloat)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rich is not notable here, as his is primarily an opinion columnist, and nothing more. Including a blockquote from his editorial seriously skews the POV of the article. (TDC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, if you don't like Rich, please write a summary of these points but do not simply remove the facts. POV is not about how big a quote you use.

<p>3) TDC moves the quote below from "Evidence against the claim of removal prior to US invasion" to the opposite category:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Documentary evidence -- a letter from former Iraqi Foreign Minister <a href="../../../n/a/j/Naji_Sabri_2b89.html" title="Naji Sabri">Naji Sabri</a> (who was also a CIA asset at the time<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11927856" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11927856" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>) to deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein "suggests taking the HMX from underground bunkers where it had been kept under seal by the International Atomic Energy Agency and giving it to suicide bombers."<a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/research_topics/research_topics_show.htm?doc_id=251835&amp;attrib_id=7511" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/research_topics/research_topics_show.htm?doc_id=251835&amp;attrib_id=7511" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> The letter was written on 4 April 2003.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To me, this statement clearly indicates the letter suggested a future course of action from 4/4, when the US invasion was well underway -- one does not "suggest" something that one already did. TDC seems to think the letter indicates the opposite, somehow.(csloat)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As illustrated above, the source is being grossly taken out of context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"It now appears that senior officials in the Iraqi government were discussing the removal of the HMX before the fall of Saddam. The letter from Dr Sabri, obtained by The Independent, was sent on 4 April 2003 as US tanks were advancing on Baghdad. It said that the world was getting the impression that Iraqi civilians were co-operating with American soldiers."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are wrong TDC. The <b>discussion</b> took place before the fall of Saddam (five days before). The letter suggests the weapons should be removed, which indicates a future course of action. I'm not sure why this is so hard to understand.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:34, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are reading information into the source which is suspect to interpretation, the source makes very clear ” that senior officials in the Iraqi government were discussing the removal of the HMX before the fall of Saddam”, which would support the claim that the explosives were indeed removed from AlQaqaa before US forces arrived there. Also, Cockburn’s article has been used exclusively by individuals who believe that AlQaqaa was raided before US forces arrived. <a href="http://frontpagemag.org/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=16204" class="external autonumber" title="http://frontpagemag.org/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=16204" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 19:46, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The source makes it clear that they were discussing this five days before the fall of Saddam, well after the US forces were in Iraq. This is not about who used Cockburn's article; this is about what it clearly says, which is that a letter five days before the fall of Saddam suggests looting the site. We have eyewitnesses from both the Iraqi and American side who saw the looting take place after the fall of Saddam. Why are you resurrecting election propaganda that even the Bush Administration has abandoned?-<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:01, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>4) The section beginning "*Pentagon official--" -- TDC changes it to wording that is simply poor. His wording suggests the official is always anonymous, which is ludicrous; mine quotes more of the AP report and shows that the official "spoke under the condition of anonymity" which is more accurate.(csloat)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The AP story clearly identifies the the source as being an anonymous Pentagon official, and Sloat is attempting to rephrase it so that it appears that this has come from the Pentagon directly. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 20:22, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not at all. It says clearly the official "spoke under the condition of anonymity." TDC's rephrasing makes it sound as if the official is anonymous while he is working at the Pentagon, which is unlikely.

<p>5) TDC insists on removing this sourced quotation: "The <i>New York Times</i> summarized in April 2005, "videos taken by television crews with American troops show the bunkers were still full of explosives well after the invasion."<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/26/international/middleeast/26weapons.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/26/international/middleeast/26weapons.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>" TDC claims his own watching of what he claims are the same videos do not show any explosives.

<p>Overall, I think the main issue between TDC and myself is that I think this article should not be about the 2004 U.S. presidential election. TDC feels it necessary to try to use this article to prove that Bush's campaign managers were telling the truth here; notice that not a single piece of information in support of TDC's view comes from after November 2004. The Bush campaigners have dropped these claims; there is no reason to give them such prominence on Wikipedia when all evidence since Nov 2004 has suggested they were wrong, and the campaigners (except for TDC) have not bothered to refute the more recent evidence. As I said above, the whole "evidence for"/"evidence against" section is ludicrous as it falsely suggests this issue is still being debated by anyone notable. It is not.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:34, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the mind reading, but perhaps I could summarize my position a bit better than you could. I am simply trying to stop Sloat from turning this article, as he has done with almost every article he involves himself in, into a mirror for his blog. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 19:46, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This excerpt comes from the May-June 2005 issue of Military Review:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The insurgency's ability to construct IEDs depends on the availability of bombmaking materials, particularly explosives. The widespread availability of explosives in Iraq means the insurgency will have the material resources to build IEDs for many years to come. Currently, approximately 80 tons of powerful conventional explosives (mainly HMX and RDX) are missing from the former Iraqi military base at Al Qaqaa. These explosives could produce bombs strong enough to shatter airplanes or tear apart buildings and are probably already in the hands of the insurgency. The director of the Iraqi police unit that defuses and investigates IEDs notes: "One of the coalition's fatal mistakes was to allow the terrorists into army storerooms.... The terrorists took all the explosives they would ever need."</dd>

<p>And this in December 2005 from the Strategic Studies Institute:</p>
<dl>
<dd>That additional U.S. forces would have been useful can scarcely be denied. Iraq’s borders were left unguarded for a year, according to Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, and clearly more might have been done on that score. Also, a large number of ammunition dumps across the country were left unguarded for months, including critical facilities like the al-Qaqaa one south of Baghdad. U.S. forces were clearly shorthanded in dealing with the anarchical conditions in Iraq.</dd>
