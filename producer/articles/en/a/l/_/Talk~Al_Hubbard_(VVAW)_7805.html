<li><i><b>The use of mere facts, rather than works of creative expression, does not constitute plagiarism.</b> For the latter, the issue of public domain works versus copyrighted works is irrelevant to the concept of plagiarism. For instance, it is legal for a student to copy several paragraphs (or even pages) of text from a public domain book, such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and then directly add these quotations to his or her own paper. However if these quotations were not clearly identified as to his or her source, then the student would be guilty of plagiarism, using another writer's work as if it were his or her own.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Not only are you an idiot for failing to see the what you are doing is plagarism, I suspect you do realize that what you are doing is plagarism and are think you can pull one over on people.</p>

<dd>I see no use of "creative expression" in your misquotes, just a brief statement of facts. Please, tell us again just where this plagiarism is? -Rob</dd>

<p>The NRO article is quite specific on its source, and does not try to pass it off as original work as you are trying to do.</p>
<p>I would also point out that the user in question has had a long history of plagiarism in VVAW related articles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TDC/VVAW_Winter_soldier" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TDC/VVAW_Winter_soldier" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 16:27, Dec 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for your "Defenition of Plagarism." You might check the spelling of the word "of." Next, you might wish to recheck your supposed quote from the wiki-article - it is inaccurate, and not a quote at all. Or are you attempting to "pull one over on people?" Third, your edits contain deletions of significant content completely unrelated to your above listed complaint. Was this an oversight on your part, or are you attempting to implement "stealth edits" without having to explain them? Forth, calling editors "idiot" isn't very productive, and could be construed as a personal attack. Finally, in your allegations of "history of plagiarism," might I suggest you be more specific in indicating the "user in question?" -Rob</p>
<p>Rob, dont be stupid, if that is possible. I used an advanced IP trace. I know your name home adress and telphone number. All the anons are you. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 06:21, Jan 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You remove the information that he was a Panther, as well as the more detailed explanation of his “war injuries”, when he got them playing B-ball. You then introduces the “inconclusive” nature of his records where it pertains to Vietnam, when those records are very conclusive in the fact that there is no mention of him ever being there. Hubbard dod claim to have been wounded in Vietnam, as the Meet the Press interview has him stating this very matter of fact. Would you like to see the video of it? <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Ten Dead Chickens</a> 21:00, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If Rob removed information that he was a Panther, fear not, cuz I put it back for you. But in a more correct form - he was a sympathizer, and even recruited vets from their meetings, but was never a member. Have info to the contrary? Sources please. The records do look inconclusive, with DoD talking heads saying so: "Despite that, Defense Department officials stressed it was still possible Hubbard could have served in Vietnam, flying in and out from Tacoma." and "...he could have been in Vietnam for brief periods during cargo loading, unloading operations or for crew rest purposes." (see your linked article). Can I also see this video you mentioned above? 165.247.219.220 21:53, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He started a Black Panther Chapter in VVAW, 53-54 Nicosia. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Ten Dead Chickens</a> 22:06, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You mean he started a Black Panther chapter of VVAW in Harlem, correct. But he wasn't officially a Panther. He also started several Campus chapters of VVAW, but he wasn't at that time a student. And he started the first VVAW PAC involved in congressional elections, but he wasn't a congressman. Same Nicosia source. 165.247.219.220 22:33, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting. Perhaps Nicosia has learned more about the man subsequent to his published book; good enough for me, so I put it back in the article. (Until I discover that Nicosia was misquoted, or simply incorrect.) Can I see the video you offered to Rob above? 165.247.219.220 23:00, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
