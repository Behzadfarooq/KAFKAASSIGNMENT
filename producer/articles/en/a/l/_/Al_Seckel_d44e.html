<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Seckel_d44e.html" title="Edit section: Freethought movement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Freethought movement</span></h2>
<p>Throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, Al Seckel was active in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">freethought movement</a>. In this capacity he authored a number of articles and pamphlets. He also edited two books on the English rationalist philosopher <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Seckel and John Edwards co-created the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_fish.html" title="Darwin fish">Darwin fish</a> design, which was first sold as a bumper sticker and on T-shirts in 1983-84 by a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_California_3bf5.html" title="Southern California">southern California</a> group called Atheists United.<sup id="_ref-Fish_fight_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fish_fight" title="">[1]</a></sup> Chris Gilman, a Hollywood <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatrical_properties.html" title="Theatrical properties">prop</a> maker, manufactured the first plastic car ornaments in 1990, and licensed the design to Evolution Design of Austin, Texas.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup>. When the emblem evolved into a million-dollar business, Evolution Design began threatening to sue distributors of look-alike and derivative products (like a Jewish "gefilte" fish). Seckel in turn sued Evolution Design for copyright infringement. Seckel did not seek royalties, but wanted Evolution Design to allow free use of the design by anyone authorized by him. Although Seckel was able to produce examples of the design that predated Gilman's claimed 1990 copyright date, the suit was settled when it became apparent that Seckel and Edwards had allowed the design to fall into <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>.<sup id="_ref-Fish_fight_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fish_fight" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, Seckel started the Southern California Skeptics (SCS), and became a spokesperson for science and its relationship to the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a>.<sup id="_ref-Nostradamus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nostradamus" title="">[3]</a></sup> SCS co-sponsored and produced a monthly series of lectures held monthly at the California Institute of Technology, other meetings were also held on the campus of Cal State Fullerton, that explained alleged paranormal phenomena such as <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra-sensory_perception.html" title="Extra-sensory perception">Extra-sensory perception</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firewalking.html" title="Firewalking">firewalking</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Good_show_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Good_show" title="">[6]</a></sup> Seckel also wrote about investigating various supernatural claims from the scientific perspective. One such investigation, led by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Randi_0c19.html" title="James Randi">James Randi</a>, concerned faith healer <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Popoff_f3e8.html" title="Peter Popoff">Peter Popoff</a>, who used a hearing transmitter to give the impression that he was psychic and hearing private information from God.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup> Seckel also wrote a column for the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> and the <i>Santa Monica Monthly News</i> from 1987-1989, explaining apparently amazing or paranormal phenomena in scientific terms.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1987, SCS and Seckel helped sponsor an <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus.html" title="Amicus">amicus</a> brief before the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> in the case <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwards_v._Aguillard_603f.html" title="Edwards v. Aguillard">Edwards v. Aguillard</a>, challenging the constitutionality of a <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> law calling for the classroom inclusion of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">creation science</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> The brief was written by a group of attorneys led by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_S._Lehman_6404.html" title="Jeffrey S. Lehman">Jeffrey Lehman</a> (later president of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>), and SCS board member and <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_prize.html" title="Nobel prize">Nobel</a> Laureate <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Gell-Mann_e5d9.html" title="Murray Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> recruited the signatures of 72 Nobel Laureates, 17 State Academies of Science, and 7 other scientific organizations.<sup id="_ref-Good_show_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Good_show" title="">[6]</a></sup> It argued that "creation science" was counter not only to the study of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, but to all sciences. The court decided a 7-2 vote that so-called "creation-science" was in fact, religion disguised as science, deliberately construed as such in order to circumvent the consititutional prohibitions of keeping Church and State separate, especially in the public science classroom. All of the opinions cited the brief, including the dissents.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In late 1989, due to a sudden onset of <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leukemia.html" title="Leukemia">leukemia</a>, Seckel had to enter the hospital, where his health quickly deteriorated. The Southern California Skeptics folded. In 1991, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Shermer_b2d1.html" title="Michael Shermer">Michael Shermer</a> started a new <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>-area skeptical group called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Skeptics_Society_8487.html" title="The Skeptics Society">The Skeptics Society</a>, using SCS's mailing list and involving many of its original board members. Seckel started to recover from his illness in 1992, turning his full attention to studying the human brain, specifically vision and how it relates to perception.</p>

<p>Seckel collects, researches, and experiments with visual and other types of sensory illusions. Up through 2005, Seckel was affiliated with <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Institute_of_Technology_ed1e.html" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> vision scientist Shinsuke Shimojo and computational neuroscientist Christof Koch.<sup id="_ref-Netwatch_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Netwatch" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Seeing_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seeing" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[13]</a></sup> Seckel has written a number of books on visual illusions and has given invited lectures at a number of universities.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>His book, <i>Masters of Deception: Escher, Dali, and the Artists of Optical Illusion</i> (2004), collects the work of many prominent international visual illusion artists, including among others <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Arcimboldo_319c.html" title="Giuseppe Arcimboldo">Giuseppe Arcimboldo</a> (1527-1593), <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a> (1904-1989), <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._C._Escher_c947.html" title="M.

Seckel is also writing a book on the science of visual illusions and perception for The MIT Press, entitled <i>Your Mind's Eye: An Interactive Journey through Perception.</i> This university-level book will contain an interactive <a href="../../../c/d/-/CD-ROM_f9c9.html" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> featuring hundreds of interactive applets, where the user can manipulate various critical parameters behind each illusion.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1994, Seckel designed and put up the first free interactive website on illusions<sup id="_ref-Seeing_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seeing" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[16]</a></sup> and has developed visual illusion installation for museums around the world.<sup id="_ref-Netwatch_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Netwatch" title="">[11]</a></sup> Seckel has also written a series of optical illusion picture books for children including <i>Ambiguous Illusions</i> (2005), <i>Action Optical Ilusions</i> (2005) and <i>Stereo Optical Illusions</i> (2006). Seckel writes a monthly column on illusions for <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Kids_2da4.html" title="National Geographic Kids">National Geographic Kids</a> magazine.</p>
<p>In 2005, Seckel was one of the judges at the first "Best Visual Illusion of the Year" contest held in <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Coru%C3%B1a_9e04.html" title="A Coruña">A Coruña</a>, Spain at the European Conference on Visual Perception.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[17]</a></sup> In 2006 he was listed as one of the contest's sponsors.</p>

<p>During the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Seckel and rare-book dealer Jeremy Norman purchased, collected, and organized the original papers of many of the pioneers in the history of the development of molecular biology, so that these papers would be preserved together for scholarly use.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[18]</a></sup> At the time they were collected, the papers had no apparent market value and institutions were not interested in keeping the archives of their retired scientists. After the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellcome_Trust_4ffb.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> purchased the papers of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Crick_68e2.html" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a> for $2.4 million, Norman offered his collection for sale piecemeal through <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christie%27s.html" title="Christie's">Christie's</a>. Seckel brought forth a lawsuit against Norman and Christies to keep the collection in one piece. A settlement was reached where Norman through Christies was allowed to sell the collection in its entirety to preserve free access to scholars.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[19]</a></sup> Former colleagues and associates of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_D._Watson_dd64.html" title="James D.
