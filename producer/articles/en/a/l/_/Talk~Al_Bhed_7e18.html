<p>.... it says that the summoner dies upon recieving the final aeon, which is wrong. The summoner dies later, though I forget if its upon summoning the aeon or after the aeon defeats Sin (is this even covered in the game? in the <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a> article, it says that Yevon kills the summoner when combining with the final aeon, but I don't recall this being in the game).</p>

<dl>
<dd>You're right, <i>receiving</i> the Final Aeon itself doesn't kill the summoner - I was wrong on that. In the scene at Home, Rikku says that <i>summoning</i> the Final Aeon kills the summoner:
<dl>
<dd>Rikku: <i>The pilgrimages have to stop! If they don't, and they get to Zanarkand... They might defeat Sin. Yunie could...but then she... Yunie will die, you know? You know, don't you? Summoners journey to get the Final Aeon. Yuna told you, didn't she? With the Final Aeon, she can beat Sin. But then...but then... If she calls it, the Final Aeon's going to kill her! Even if she defeats Sin, it will kill Yunie too, you know!</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Later, Yunalesca confirms it:
<dl>
<dd>Yunalesca: <i>There is nothing to fear. You will soon be freed of worry and pain. For once you call forth the Final Aeon, your life will end. Death is the ultimate and final liberation. Your father, Braska, chose this path.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Looking through the game script, I couldn't find anything about Yu Yevon killing the summoner while combining with the Final Aeon, and the conversation with the Fayth of Bahamut says nothing about it. I don't know where the Yevon article is getting this information from, but for now I think I'm going to go with what the characters say above. If you can find anything that indicates otherwise, do tell! -- Saikiri 16:29, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a> article I find other strange things that I don't remember - but that can be attributed to the fact that I only played the game at a friend's, and never saw the ending properly. Specificly, Yevon as Yunalesca's father... I'll stop there because I will be going off topic. I'll post something in the Yevon discussion about this</dd>

<p>User 203.62.10.9, I took out your mention of a Gravaton Geomatrix drive - nothing personal, I just didn't find a reference to it in the game script, therefore is it official? (Or actually necessary for that matter =) )</p>

<dd>Certainly not necessary, but not even mentioned anywhere as far as I know, and I didn't miss a single thing in Final Fantasy X in terms of the script.

<p>After the merger with the <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyreflies.html" title="Pyreflies">Pyreflies</a> article, I've been thinking "Do we really need all these FFX pages?" I know FFX goes into a lot more detail about the world than most <i>Final Fantasy</i> games, to say nothing of how much more detail it goes into than most games in general. That said, despite all that's been done to improve it, Wikipedia looks like a <i>Final Fantasy</i> fansite. <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloud_Strife_e5f7.html" title="Cloud Strife">Cloud's</a> page looks like a biography, <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advent_Children_363a.html" title="Advent Children">Advent Children's</a> looks like the reports that came out of Venice when the film was first screened there, just yesterday I had to merge <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_Weapon_4f1d.html" title="Ultima Weapon">Ultima Weapon</a> with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_%28Final_Fantasy%29_fbfe.html" title="Weapon (Final Fantasy)">Weapons</a>, and here we've got <i>eight pages</i> talking about Final Fantasy X alone; that's not including character pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira.html" title="Spira">Spira</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzball.html" title="Blitzball">Blitzball</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Bhed_78df.html" title="Al Bhed">Al Bhed</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_Grid_2766.html" title="Sphere Grid">Sphere Grid</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayth.html" title="Fayth">Fayth</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/i/Final_Fantasy_X%7E_Original_Soundtrack_7e10.html" title="Final Fantasy X: Original Soundtrack">Final Fantasy X: Original Soundtrack</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I'm not excluding the other Final Fantasies from this either. <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> and <i>Final Fantasy IX</i> are actually decently condensed, I believe, but <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> is another guilty offender. Until recently, the bloody <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sister_Ray_7bde.html" title="Sister Ray">Sister Ray</a> even had its own article, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midgar.html" title="Midgar">Midgar</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_Locations_98d3.html" title="List of Final Fantasy VII Locations">List of Final Fantasy VII Locations</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materia.html" title="Materia">Materia</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../m/a/k/Mako.html" title="Mako">Mako</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to be making some proposals over on the <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> pages too, but here, I think the following ideas should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzball.html" title="Blitzball">Blitzball</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira.html" title="Spira">Spira</a> if in any way possible; maybe at the very end.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Bhed_78df.html" title="Al Bhed">Al Bhed</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../r/a/c/Races_of_Final_Fantasy_0360.html" title="Races of Final Fantasy">Races of Final Fantasy</a> (not a lot to say there to begin with, and plenty of overlap of material).</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_Grid_2766.html" title="Sphere Grid">Sphere Grid</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a> (applies to only this game, and there's already overlap of material).</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayth.html" title="Fayth">Fayth</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a> (there's really not much to say about the Fayth without talking about Yevon in the first place).</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_Original_Soundtrack_5629.html" title="Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack">Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a> (how did it even get its own page to begin with?).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I'm for the <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a> page staying, and if there's a lot of objections to the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_Original_Soundtrack_5629.html" title="Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack">Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack</a> page being merged out of individuality, so be it (can't see what there is to say about it that can't be said on the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a> page, though); that would still take us from eight down to four.</p>
<p>I haven't even looked at the character pages that much, really, but I'm not going to worry about them for now. What's everyone's thoughts on this stuff?

<dd>There is of course another possibility: merge this article into FF, and then create a smaller article specifically about the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Bhed_language_9ea9.html" title="Al Bhed language">Al Bhed language</a>.

<li>Seems to me that the problem is that constructed languages, including but not limited to Al Bhed, are getting the shaft by being on a page that is <i>merely a list of languages</i>. Both Jan and Kappa are correct, the subject deserves much more than the current laundry list without narrative. How about both Jan and Kappa fix the problem at the source, i.e, at <i>the</i> place to talk about constructed languages&#160;? <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenmiri_65fe.html" title="User:Renmiri">Renmiri</a> 02:08, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
