<p>D'Amato was born in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> and raised on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>. He is a graduate of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaminade_High_School_1ef6.html" title="Chaminade High School">Chaminade High School</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_d1c9.html" title="Syracuse University">Syracuse University</a>, and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_College_of_Law_5a75.html" title="Syracuse University College of Law">Syracuse Law School</a>. He is a brother of the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Chi_Rho_94c7.html" title="Alpha Chi Rho">Alpha Chi Rho</a> fraternity. His political career started with the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nassau_County%2C_New_York_358d.html" title="Nassau County, New York">Nassau County</a> Republican Party, and he held the appointive position of Public Administrator of Nassau County, where he was responsible for managing the assets of county residents who died without <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">wills</a>. He was first appointed and then elected Receiver of Taxes of <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_of_Hempstead%2C_New_York_d80e.html" title="Town of Hempstead, New York">Hempstead, New York</a>. He left this office to become a town supervisor in Hempstead and in 1977 he was elected presiding supervisor.</p>
<p>D'Amato is divorced from his first wife, with whom he has four children. He has dated several well-known personalities, including entertainment television reporter <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudia_Cohen_b889.html" title="Claudia Cohen">Claudia Cohen</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> he married Katuria Elizabeth Smith.</p>

<p>As a rather obscure candidate, he then defeated incumbent Sen. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Javits_2e57.html" title="Jacob Javits">Jacob Javits</a> in the 1980 Republican <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_election.html" title="Primary election">primary election</a>, taking advantage of Javits' 1979 diagnosis of generally fatal <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_neurone_disease.html" title="Motor neurone disease">amytrophic lateral sclerosis</a>. Javits nevertheless pursued the seat on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28New_York_State%29_0b85.html" title="Liberal Party (New York State)">Liberal Party</a> ticket, <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split_vote.html" title="Split vote">splitting</a> the left-wing vote in ordinarily liberal New York with Democratic Congresswoman <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Holtzman_214e.html" title="Elizabeth Holtzman">Elizabeth Holtzman</a> and leading to D'Amato's 45% <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Past_the_Post_electoral_system_687b.html" title="First Past the Post electoral system">plurality victory</a>. This victory is largely credited to his campaign manager, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_J._Finkelstein_3e9b.html" title="Arthur J. Finkelstein">Arthur J. Finkelstein</a>.</p>
<p>D'Amato drew the nickname <i>Senator Pothole</i> for his delivery of "constituent services," helping citizens with their individual cases. Many New Yorkers meant the nickname as a pejorative.</p>
<p>Senator D'Amato also holds the record for the second and seventh longest <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster.html" title="Filibuster">filibusters</a> ever recorded in the United States Senate. He is remembered for his unique and rather comical filibusters. In 1986, a filibuster he conducted against a military bill lasted 23 hours, 30 minutes and he was known for reading the <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_Columbia_9454.html" title="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a> phonebook during a filibuster. On another occasion he once filibustered a bill that would have caused the loss of 750 jobs in upstate New York by singing "South of the Border (Down Mexico Way)"</p>
<p>Senator D'Amato is also remembered for using a poster of a "Taxasaurus Rex" he then wildly stabbed the poster with an oversized pencil.</p>
<p>He was a member of the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) which was set up in September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_91ad.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am Flight 103</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>.</p>
<p>While he was in office, he was <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a> of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_Committee_on_Banking%2C_Housing_and_Urban_Affairs_07c3.html" title="U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs">Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs</a>, and was a member of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_Committee_on_Finance_e2a3.html" title="U.S. Senate Committee on Finance">Senate Finance Committee</a>. As a member of the latter, he championed the cause of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_survivor.html" title="Holocaust survivor">Holocaust survivors</a> trying to recover relatives' funds from accounts in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_bank.html" title="Swiss bank">Swiss banks</a>.</p>
<p>D'Amato was known for being fairly <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_conservatism.html" title="American conservatism">conservative</a>, a reflection of then conservative-leaning <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nassau_County%2C_New_York_358d.html" title="Nassau County, New York">Nassau County</a>, yet very popular among New York's liberal voters. He strongly supported the conservative positions of his party on "law and order" issues such as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> and harsh penalties for drug offenses. On some issues he agreed with the opposition: in 1993 D'Amato was one of only three Republicans to vote in favor of allowing gays to serve openly in the U.S. military. In 1996 he was among the minority of Republicans to vote to extend federal protections against discrimination in hiring to homosexuals. On <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_in_the_United_States_5c18.html" title="Labor in the United States">labor</a> issues too he frequently sided with Democrats. His 1998 loss was attributed to a lack of support among moderate voters in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where opponent Charles Schumer was a Representative. Another factor contributing to his loss was his labeling of Rep. Schumer as a "putz-head," which means "fool" or "penis-head" in <a href="../../../y/i/d/Yiddish.html" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>. This was ironic on several levels: first, D'Amato had previously enjoyed considerable Jewish support because of his strong pro-Israel stance, as well as his efforts to help Holocaust survivors. Second, D'Amato won in 1992 for the same reason he lost in 1998; his 1992 opponent, then-attorney general <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Abrams_d8c2.html" title="Robert Abrams">Robert Abrams</a>, called D'Amato a "<a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a>," which people (including D'Amato himself) interpreted as an ethnic slur because D'Amato is Italian. After his defeat, he became a correspondent for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Magazine_a3f3.html" title="George Magazine">George Magazine</a> until it ceased publication in 2001, and was also a commentator on <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_News_e423.html" title="Fox News">Fox News</a>. He is now managing director of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Associates_369f.html" title="Computer Associates">Computer Associates</a> and also serves as Chairman of the Board of the Poker Players Alliance.</p>
<p>D'Amato's decline may also have mirrored that of Nassau County's Republicans. In 2001, after years of alleged scandal and financial mismanagement, Republicans lost control of the county legislature for the first time in 40 years, and Democrat <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Suozzi_e560.html" title="Thomas Suozzi">Thomas Suozzi</a> was elected County Executive.</p>

<p>D'Amato is also known for his public controversies and brash style. After a series of investigations in 1991, the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_Ethics_Committee_d721.html" title="Senate Ethics Committee">Senate Ethics Committee</a> reprimanded D'Amato for allowing his brother <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armand_Paul_D%27Amato_a9c3.html" title="Armand Paul D'Amato">Armand</a>, a <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobbyist.html" title="Lobbyist">lobbyist</a>, to use office stationery to help solicit million-dollar <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">Navy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_contractor.html" title="Military contractor">contracts</a> for <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unisys.html" title="Unisys">Unisys</a>. Armand D'Amato was convicted on 7 of the 24 counts of mail fraud in May 1993. A federal appeals court reversed Armand D'Amato's mail fraud conviction, finding insufficient evidence against him. Al D'Amato attributes <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Weld_9bc1.html" title="William Weld">William Weld</a>, at the time a federal prosecutor, for an overzealous prosecution against Armand.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Imus_00a0.html" title="Don Imus">Don Imus</a> radio program on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, he used a mock Japanese accent to impersonate <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Ito_cf8e.html" title="Lance Ito">Lance Ito</a>, a <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_American_2d8f.html" title="Japanese American">Japanese American</a> <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judge</a> overseeing the ongoing <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_76f9.html" title="O.J.

<p>In 1994, he insulted <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betsy_McCaughey_Ross_cfdc.html" title="Betsy McCaughey Ross">Betsy McCaughey Ross</a>, the Republican candidate for New York <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Governor_64a0.html" title="Lieutenant Governor">Lieutenant Governor</a>; he joked that in order to get an endorsement for her running mate, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Pataki_5e01.html" title="George Pataki">George Pataki</a>, she should have sex with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor.html" title="Mayor">mayor</a> <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudy_Giuliani_d5f0.html" title="Rudy Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, who had endorsed <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Cuomo_0832.html" title="Mario Cuomo">Mario Cuomo</a>.</p>
<p>In October 1998, D'Amato was criticized for insulting Congressman <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Nadler_2784.html" title="Jerry Nadler">Jerry Nadler</a>. According to <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USAToday_f82e.html" title="USAToday">USAToday</a></i>, D'Amato "referred to the heavyset Nadler as 'Congressman Waddler.' He also did a physical imitation of Nadler, D-N.Y., waddling like a duck." <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/ny/ny026.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/ny/ny026.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> D'Amato subsequently apologized, saying, "It was a poor attempt at humor, and I was wrong, and I apologized to him."</p>
