	    <p><b>Alvin Mackling</b> (born <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg%2C_Manitoba_55db.html" title="Winnipeg, Manitoba">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>) is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politician</a> in Manitoba, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. He was a member of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_Manitoba_631d.html" title="Legislative Assembly of Manitoba">Legislative Assembly of Manitoba</a> from 1969 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1988, and was a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_minister.html" title="Cabinet minister">cabinet minister</a> in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_of_Manitoba_1356.html" title="New Democratic Party of Manitoba">New Democratic Party</a> governments of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Schreyer_ee9f.html" title="Edward Schreyer">Edward Schreyer</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Pawley_d8fc.html" title="Howard Pawley">Howard Pawley</a>.</p>
<p>Mackling was educated at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Winnipeg_2630.html" title="University of Winnipeg">University of Winnipeg</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Manitoba_696a.html" title="University of Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> Law School, and worked as a lawyer in private life. In the early 1950s, he was employed at the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg.html" title="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> offices of the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> pool elevators.</p>
<p>Mackling was involved with the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative_Commonwealth_Federation_56ff.html" title="Cooperative Commonwealth Federation">Cooperative Commonwealth Federation</a> (predecessor to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a>) in the 1950s, and ran for the party on a number of occasions. In the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1953.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1953">1953 provincial election</a>, he ran for the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Cooperative_Commonwealth_Federation_a384.html" title="Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation">Manitoba CCF</a> in the west-end Winnipeg <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riding.html" title="Riding">riding</a> of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assiniboia_%28Manitoba_riding%29_4728.html" title="Assiniboia (Manitoba riding)">Assiniboia</a>, and came within 300 votes of defeating <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Liberal_Party_c226.html" title="Manitoba Liberal Party">Liberal-Progressive</a> candidate <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Wightman_49c8.html" title="Reginald Wightman">Reginald Wightman</a>. He also ran for the party in <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-elections</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, without success. He ran in the riding of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James_%28Manitoba_riding%29_0ef7.html" title="St. James (Manitoba riding)">St. James</a> in the provincial elections of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1958.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1958">1958</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1959.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1959">1959</a>, respectively finishing third and second. He also ran for the federal CCF <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1957.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1957">1957 federal election</a>, finishing a distant third in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_South_Centre_ced6.html" title="Winnipeg South Centre">Winnipeg South Centre</a>.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, Mackling and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Pawley_d8fc.html" title="Howard Pawley">Howard Pawley</a> were regarded as rebels against the CCF establishment in Manitoba. Both opposed the party's decision to dissolve itself into the New Democratic Party, and supported <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazen_Argue_9db8.html" title="Hazen Argue">Hazen Argue</a>'s decision to sit as federal House Leader in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. Notwithstanding his opposition to the change, Mackling ran for the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_New_Democratic_Party_69f0.html" title="Manitoba New Democratic Party">Manitoba NDP</a> in Assiniboia in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1962.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1962">1962 election</a>, this time finishing a weak third.</p>
<p>He considered running to replace <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Paulley_87af.html" title="Russell Paulley">Russell Paulley</a> as leader of the provincial NDP in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. Although nothing came of these speculations, <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Green_c89c.html" title="Sidney Green">Sidney Green</a> later claimed that he challenged Paulley's leadership the following year in part because he did not want to see Mackling take the position.</p>
<p>Mackling was finally elected to the Manitoba assembly in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1969.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1969">1969 election</a>, in which the party formed a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minority_government.html" title="Minority government">minority government</a> under the leadership of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Schreyer_ee9f.html" title="Edward Schreyer">Edward Schreyer</a>; again running in St. James, he defeated incumbent <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Manitoba_fc22.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba">Progressive Conservative</a> <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Stanes_0a65.html" title="Douglas Stanes">Douglas Stanes</a> by almost 1,000 votes. He was named as the province's Attorney General on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and held the position for the Schreyer government's first term in office. He also served as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_20.html" title="August 20">August 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>.</p>
<p>Mackling's tenure as Attorney-General was controversial. He was regarded as unnecessarily dogmatic by others in the NDP caucus, and was criticized by civil libertarians for shutting down a theatre which was screening the film <i><a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Tango_in_Paris_0847.html" title="Last Tango in Paris">Last Tango in Paris</a></i> without consulting other government ministers. He was also criticized by some in the St. James riding for supporting amalgamation with the city of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg%2C_Manitoba_55db.html" title="Winnipeg, Manitoba">Winnipeg</a>, which brought about an increase in local taxation. In the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1973.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1973">1973 election</a>, he lost his seat to Tory <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Minaker_13bb.html" title="George Minaker">George Minaker</a> by 374 votes.</p>
<p>He returned to provincial politics after his friend Howard Pawley won the provincial NDP leadership in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. In the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1981.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1981">1981 provincial election</a>, he defeated Minaker by almost 800 votes to reclaim the riding of St. James. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, he was named Minister of Natural Resources, a position he retained until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. He also held responsibility for the Manitoba Housing Act and the Renewal Corporation Act from <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Mackling was named <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Minister_of_Labour_a27e.html" title="Manitoba Minister of Labour">Minister of Labour</a> with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System Act, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Service_Act_%28Manitoba_ministry%29_2338.html" title="Civil Service Act (Manitoba ministry)">Civil Service Act</a>, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Service_Superannuation_Act_%28Manitoba_ministry%29_b6de.html" title="Civil Service Superannuation Act (Manitoba ministry)">Civil Service Superannuation Act</a>, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Service_Special_Supplementary_Severance_Benefit_Act_%28Manitoba_ministry%29_5a85.html" title="Civil Service Special Supplementary Severance Benefit Act (Manitoba ministry)">Civil Service Special Supplementary Severance Benefit Act</a> and the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Servants_Insurance_Act_%28Manitoba_ministry%29_b193.html" title="Public Servants Insurance Act (Manitoba ministry)">Public Servants Insurance Act</a>. He was narrowly re-elected in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_general_election%2C_1986.html" title="Manitoba general election, 1986">1986 election</a> against a challenge from Tory Eldon Ross.</p>
<p>At one stage in Mackling's tenure as Labour Minister, there was a significant dispute in Manitoba between the <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eaton%27s.html" title="Eaton's">Eaton's</a> company and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers_Union_2259.html" title="United Food and Commercial Workers Union">United Food and Commercial Workers Union</a>. Mackling publicly cut up his Eaton's credit card in an attempt to show support for the union.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">April 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, he was retained in the Labour portfolio, but relieved of all other ministerial responsibilities except for the Telephone System Act and named Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs for a second time. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, he was relieved of the TSA responsibility.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, he was removed as Minister of Labour and named <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Minister_of_Business_Development_and_Tourism_8d5e.html" title="Manitoba Minister of Business Development and Tourism">Minister of Business Development and Tourism</a>, also retaining the Consumer and Corporate Affairs portfolio.</p>
<p>The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, at a time when the party was performing poorly in public opinion polls. Mackling decided not to contest the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> election, and has not returned to political life since this time.</p>
<p>Mackling now serves on the Executive of the Manitoba Forestry Association, and is President of the Winnipeg Game and Fish Association.</p>
