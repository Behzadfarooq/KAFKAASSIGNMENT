<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Imagen 285.jpg</b>. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.</p>
<p>As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p>I think you are very confused on this subject. First of all, I didn't replace any image. I've never seen the image of the red car before, I only uploaded the image of the grey car to the Commons. Secondly, an image is only fair use "where the image is unrepeatable, i.e. a free image could not be created to replace it", and free images have already been created so it fails fair use. You're talking to the wrong person, and you have your facts mixed up. <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a> 17:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you're having a problem with the whole "fair use" license for the picture you've uploaded. I remember back in the days when all pics were under fair-use and almost every page had a nice little pic to go along with it. Only a few months ago did a few guys (not going to name names) decide to clamp down on fair-use pics, which resulted in most to them being deleted. =(<br />
I stopped using the fair-use license altogether and instead got screenshots and U.S. gov pics instead. Those license are fortunately very clear and not under scrutiny.<br />
