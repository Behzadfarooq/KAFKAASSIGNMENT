<p><b>Adrian Fahrenheit Tepes</b> (<a href="../../../%C5%A3/e/p/%C5%A2epe%C5%9F.html" title="Ţepeş">Ţepeş</a>), better known as <b>Alucard</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">アルカード</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Arukādo</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, is the son of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula_%28Castlevania%29_db73.html" title="Dracula (Castlevania)">Dracula</a> in the <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Castlevania.html" title="Castlevania">Castlevania</a></i> <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> series. As the offspring of an unnatural bond between Dracula and a human woman named <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_%28Castlevania%29_cf92.html" title="Lisa (Castlevania)">Lisa</a>, Adrian had special powers, preordained to be stronger than any human but not potentially as strong as his father. After Lisa was tried and killed, mistaken for a <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witch</a>, Adrian grew up under the influence of his father, where he was taught in the dark arts and molded into a warrior who would one day fight for the side of evil.</p>
<p>Adrian's existence did not come without quirks, as the gentle, human side of his mother always seemed to cloud his "better judgment", as Dracula would have put it. Before his mother's death, Adrian was by her side. Even though he was enraged, she insisted that he not take that anger out on the humans. With those thoughts forever implanted into his being, his mind always wandered as he questioned his father's intentions. After standing by for as long as he could, he broke away from his father's army and disappeared. Understanding that Dracula was going to implore his wrath on the people, Adrian would turn his efforts towards destroying his father's army, hopefully encouraging him to reconsider. Furthermore, he chose to go under the name "Alucard" — his father's branded name in reverse — to represent that he stood for beliefs opposite those of his father.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Alucard's past, particularly his age and when he was born (although in <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Castlevania%7E_Symphony_of_the_Night_c6e9.html" title="Castlevania: Symphony of the Night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></i> he was estimated to be 400 years old, the game took place in 1797, therefore we can assume he was born in the late 1300s or early 1400s), much less how his father came to have a relationship with Lisa. Chronologically, the events occur sometime before <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Castlevania_III%7E_Dracula%27s_Curse_1de3.html" title="Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse">Castlevania III</a>.</i> Alucard is also absent for many of the games in the series. He does not appear after <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Castlevania_III%7E_Dracula%27s_Curse_1de3.html" title="Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse">Castlevania III</a></i> until <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Castlevania%7E_Symphony_of_the_Night_c6e9.html" title="Castlevania: Symphony of the Night">Symphony of the Night</a></i>. At the end of <a href="../../../s/y/m/Castlevania%7E_Symphony_of_the_Night_c6e9.html" title="Castlevania: Symphony of the Night">Symphony of the Night</a>, he announces his intention to go in to hiding, sparing the world from the cursed blood in his veins. However, he returns in <a href="../../../a/r/i/Castlevania%7E_Aria_of_Sorrow_76a7.html" title="Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow">Aria of Sorrow</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/w/Castlevania%7E_Dawn_of_Sorrow_799c.html" title="Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow">Dawn of Sorrow</a>. What he does in these stretches of time, as well as his origins, may be explained in future games.</p>
<p>Alucard is an adept swordsman, and typically wields one-handed swords. Alucard's other attacks use dark magic. As a shape shifter like his father, Alucard can change into mist, a bat, or other animals.</p>

<p>Although <a href="../../../l/e/g/Castlevania%7E_Legends_28ce.html" title="Castlevania: Legends">Castlevania: Legends</a> was retroactively removed from the Japanese <i>Castlevania</i> timeline by current director Koji Igarashi, Konami USA has not reflected this, and it remained canon according to Konami USA in a Konami Timeline printed in Nintendo Power around the release of the <i>Sorrow</i> series. However, recently Konami USA left out <i>Legends</i> in their Xtreme Desktop Timeline, which indicates that Konami USA has changed their decision, and are taking the series closer to IGA's vision.</p>
<p>The first game where Alucard would have chronologically appeared was <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Castlevania_Legends_3748.html" title="Castlevania Legends">Castlevania Legends</a></i>, yet not as a playable character. In the year <a href="../../../1/4/5/1450.html" title="1450">1450</a>, Alucard met Sonia Belmont. Alucard then revealed his intentions to her: His father had to be stopped, and he was the one to do it.</p>
<p>Sonia revealed to Alucard that she intended to do the same. They had to part ways at this point, as Sonia would go on to battle her way through the castle of Dracula. During her adventure, Sonia would encounter Alucard one more time as he tested her skills in battle and found her to be more than worthy.</p>
<p>Feeling that he could be a danger to humankind afterwards, Alucard submerged his powers and put himself into a state of rest, much to the sadness of Sonia. He would rise again soon enough, however.</p>

Alucard in Castlevania 3.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1476 when <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Belmont_8acd.html" title="Trevor Belmont">Trevor Belmont</a> was on his own quest to hunt out the Count Dracula, Alucard would be waiting for Trevor Belmont to come by. Alucard acted like a boss at this point, testing the skills of the hero. Alucard was surprised by Trevor's strength when he was defeated by the young vampire hunter, and asked if he could join Trevor on his quest.</p>
<p>If you accept his offer, he then becomes one of the four playable characters in the game.</p>
<p>After helping to destroy Dracula, and despite his good intentions, Alucard couldn't help but feel guilty for <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricide.html" title="Patricide">patricide</a>. To ease his pain, he put himself to rest, submerging his powers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/u/Alucard_%28Castlevania%29_ead1.html" title="Edit section: Castlevania: Symphony of the Night">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</span></h3>
<p>In 1797, due to an unexpected lack of a Belmont and re-emergence of Dracula's castle, Alucard had no choice but to awaken from his slumber to investigate the matter and infiltrate Castlevania. He was able to find out that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richter_Belmont_a5b4.html" title="Richter Belmont">Richter Belmont</a> had been seduced by an evil force and was controlling the castle.</p>
<p>With the help of Richter's sister-in-law, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Renard_1645.html" title="Maria Renard">Maria Renard</a>, they were able to find out the truth: The dark priest <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaft_%28Castlevania%29_b4ea.html" title="Shaft (Castlevania)">Shaft</a> was controlling Richter and wanted to raise Dracula from his dark slumber. Richter's own excuse, while under Shaft's control, was that he wanted to resurrect Dracula so that the battle between the Belmonts and Dracula could go on forever. After releasing Richter from Shaft's control, Alucard entered an upside-down version of Castlevania in the clouds, above the original. The inverted castle contained more powerful enemies, and Alucard's final goal. He then proceeded to find and confront Shaft.</p>
<p>Having defeated Shaft, Alucard discovered that his efforts were in vain, as Shaft's plan had come to fruition regardless. He solely defeated his father in combat once more, and sent him back to the grave, though Dracula did show a spark of humanity after Alucard told him Lisa's last words: that mankind should be left in peace, and that she would always love him. Alucard then planned to put himself back at rest, but since Maria had fallen in love with him during their previous meetings, she tried to prevent him from doing so. Whether she managed to stop him in time is not known.</p>

Genya, an extremely cold man with an inhumanly attractive face, was a member of a shadowy Japanese government organization somehow related to national security. He and Yoko knew well about the events where the castle was sealed away in the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipse.html" title="Eclipse">eclipse</a> by a group of vampire hunters, and about the prophecy that says someone would come to the castle in 2035 to inherit Dracula's powers.</p>
<p>In their investigation, they found the link between the <i>Hakuba Shrine</i> and the dark side of the eclipse. They decided to enter the castle, where they planned to prevent the rebirth of Count Dracula.</p>
<p>In reality, Genya Arikado' was Alucard himself, risen from his resting place due to the absence of a Belmont to deal with the situation. Julius Belmont was present, roaming the castle, but his amnesia and advanced age made it too risky for him to get involved in big conflicts.</p>
<p>Alucard knew that the power of the seal holding Dracula was wearing off. If someone with bad intentions (like <a href="../../../s/o/r/List_of_characters_in_Castlevania%7E_Sorrow_series_d64c.html#Graham_Jones" title="List of characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series">Graham Jones</a>) were to seize the opportunity and inherit that power, his father would return, reborn.</p>
<p>Alucard then came up with a plan. He would find the person truly prophesied to inherit the Dark Lord's powers and summon him to the castle on the day of the solar eclipse. That person turned out to be <a href="../../../s/o/m/Soma_Cruz_2f28.html" title="Soma Cruz">Soma Cruz</a>. Alucard helped him to discover his natural absorbing abilities in hope that Soma would use that power to collect the enemies' souls and the castle's energy essence, becoming someone as powerful as Dracula. A self-aware absorber who would use that collected power to enter into where only Dracula could go: The Chaotic Realm where the seal remained broken, having the chance to fix it by destroying the source.</p>
<p>After killing <a href="../../../s/o/r/List_of_characters_in_Castlevania%7E_Sorrow_series_d64c.html#Graham_Jones" title="List of characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series">Graham Jones</a>, Soma realized that he himself was the rebirth of Dracula, so Alucard ordered him to find and cut the flow of Chaos and suppress Dracula's spirit before it could take over his body completely, resealing the castle within the eclipse, bringing his friends to safety, and ending the threat of Dracula's resurrection for the time being.</p>
<p>Although his true origin is very, very heavily implied during various cut scenes, Arikado's true nature is never openly revealed within this game. The only hint of it is Arikado's large knowledge of Castlevania and Yoko's first lines "Did you meet Aluca- I mean Genya Arikado". In the best ending of the game, when everyone congratulates Soma, Alucard makes a reference to his mother Lisa: "In my mother's name, I send thanks to you".</p>
<p>As an interesting note, at the beginning of the game when Soma and Mina are transported into the castle, Alucard protects them from a horde of monster by using some type of attack. The attack makes the screen flash briefly causing the enemies to explode while their souls fly into Alucard. This attack is very similar to if not Alucard's Soul Steal spell from <a href="../../../s/y/m/Castlevania%7E_Symphony_of_the_Night_c6e9.html" title="Castlevania: Symphony of the Night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>. In <a href="../../../d/a/w/Castlevania%7E_Dawn_of_Sorrow_799c.html" title="Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a> when playing in Julius Mode, Alucard is unable to do this attack.</p>

<p>Alucard first makes his appearance in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow as Genya Arikado to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Soma_Cruz_2f28.html" title="Soma Cruz">Soma Cruz</a> at the beginning of the game, as he enters during the game's opening scenes, attempting to protect him from Celia, the leader of the cult devoted to recreating the Dark Lord. After Soma defeats the monsters that Celia summoned using the Knife that Arikado throws to him and absorbs their souls, he wonders why his "power of dominance" has returned. Arikado reveals that he has always had that power, it was just that he never had a need for it after he left Dracula's castle. After their discussion, Arikado tells Soma that he and his associates will handle Celia and asks him not to get involved.</p>
<p>Their next meeting is in the Demon Guest House, where Arikado angrily berates Soma for involving himself in this affair. However, he agrees to Soma's continued participation because he has already entered the castle. He asks Soma about what he has encountered so far and Soma reveals Celia's plan to slay him and replace him using the Dark Lord's candidates, Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi (although Dmitrii is "killed" at this point). Arikado reveals his intention to look into the matter further and also gives Soma a letter from <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mina_Hakuba_14ab.html" title="Mina Hakuba">Mina</a>, which contains a talisman that will protect Soma from evil energy. He then departs, in search of Celia.</p>
<p>When Soma first enters the Cursed Clock Tower, he runs in along with <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Belmont_208e.html" title="Julius Belmont">Julius Belmont</a> &amp; <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genya_Arikado_14cc.html" title="Genya Arikado">Genya Arikado</a> to find Celia waiting for them. Celia reveals that she has fused a flame demon to Dario's soul that has drastically increased his powers. Afterwards, Celia teleports away and Arikado tells Julius to pursue Dario while he will hunt for Celia.</p>
<p>At one of the game's critical junctions, Arikado runs into the <i>Garden of Madness</i> to stop Soma from transforming into the Dark Lord after Celia killed "Mina". Due to the fact that Soma was wearing Mina's Talisman, he was able to break the transformation, much to Celia's chagrin. However, a black soul flew from Soma into the Doppelganger that was posing as the "Mina" that Celia slew. That Doppelganger became Dmitrii, who had been believed to been slain by Soma earlier in the game. Arikado realizes that Dmitrii has copied Soma's power of dominance, and it is the key to becoming the Dark Lord. As Arikado moves forward to confront Dmitrii, however, Dmitrii reveals that he knows Arikado's true identity as Alucard, son of Dracula (although he does not explicitly reveal this fact), and that he will kill Soma if Arikado comes forward. Dmitrii and Celia teleport away and Arikado reveals to Soma that there is a gateway to the origin of the dark energy the castle has been accessing underneath the castle (the Abyss) and this is where Dmitrii and Celia have fled.</p>
<p>However, in order to gain access to the Abyss, Arikado is forced to enlist the talents of Julius Belmont, who shatters the barrier dividing that area from the rest of the castle. Julius is reluctant to do so because it will drain his power and leave him unable to fight but Arikado says his power is the only way the barrier can be broken. As the barrier is broken, Arikado falls into the passageway and renews his pursuit of Dmitrii and Celia.</p>
<p>At the game's final stages, Arikado is standing with Dmitrii in the final, massive room of the Abyss, apparently drained. He reveals to Soma that Dmitrii's sacrifice of Celia created a reversal of his powers and canceled his attempts to assault Dmitrii. As Dmitrii prepares for the showdown of his power of dominance against Soma's, he becomes engulfed in dark energy, and Arikado realizes that since Dmitrii's soul is weaker than Soma's, he cannot retain full dominance of the souls of the monsters he gained dominance over. In his anger, Dmitrii blasts Arikado away with a spell before the creatures escape his body and converge to form the gargantuan Menace, who is Soma's final opponent.</p>
<p>Near the end, as numerous characters went to embrace Soma after his victory, Alucard stood alone, thinking that "If the world needs a Dark Lord, one will emerge, even if it's not Soma."</p>
<p>Alucard can be unlocked as a playable character in Julius Mode, complete in his <i>Symphony of the Night</i> attire. He has changed, as he lost most of his spells and the ability to switch weapons. He can still backdash, double jump and super jump, transform into a Bat, and cast the Hellfire spell. He also has his heirloom Alucard Sword equipped with the Teleport Double-Slash attack at his disposal. To put it simply, in Dawn of Sorrow, he works more as a utility/reconnaissance unit (compared to Julius for the offense and Yoko for the sniping/support), though his teleport-slash still makes him good for battle.</p>

<p>Simon Belmont and Dracula appeared in the video game cartoon <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_N_ddd0.html" title="Captain N">Captain N: The Game Master</a></i>. At least one episode featured Alucard. However, Alucard was depicted as a rebellious music-loving teenager with sunglasses and blond hair, shirking his appearance in <i>Castlevania III</i> (which was not unusual, as nearly every game character in the cartoon was heavily modified from their game appearance).</p>
