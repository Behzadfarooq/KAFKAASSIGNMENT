household aluminum foil</div>

<p>Foil made from a thin leaf of <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin.html" title="Tin">tin</a> was commercially available before the aluminium counterpart. In the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, tin foil was in common use, and some people continue to refer to the new product by the name of the old one. Tin foil is stiffer than aluminium foil. It tends to give a slight tin taste to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> wrapped in it, which is one major reason it has largely been supplanted by aluminium and other materials for wrapping food.</p>
<p>The first audio recordings on <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonograph_cylinder.html" title="Phonograph cylinder">phonograph cylinders</a> were made on tin foil.</p>

Decorative aluminium foils, in bright colors</div>

<p>Aluminium foil typically has a highly reflective side and a more matte side. This is a result of common manufacturing processes. As aluminium foil is easy to tear, the foil is sent through machines in pairs. The side where the aluminium foil was in contact with the other sheet is more matte than the exterior side. This unconformity of finish has led to the perception that favoring a side has an effect when cooking. While many believe that the shiny side's reflective properties keep heat in when wrapped on the interior and keep heat out when facing exterior, the actual difference is imperceptible without instrumentation.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Aluminium foil is used to make long life packs for <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drink.html" title="Drink">drinks</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dairy.html" title="Dairy">dairy</a> products, and many other sensitive foods. The foil acts as a complete barrier to <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a> (which spoils <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fat.html" title="Fat">fats</a>), <a href="../../../o/d/o/Odour.html" title="Odour">odours</a>, loss or gain of <a href="../../../m/o/i/Moisture.html" title="Moisture">moisture</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>. Aluminium foil containers and trays are used to bake pies and to pack <a href="../../../t/a/k/Take-out.html" title="Take-out">takeaway</a> meals, ready snacks and long life <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet.html" title="Pet">pet</a> foods.</p>
<p>Aluminium foil is also widely used for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_insulation.html" title="Thermal insulation">insulation</a> (barrier and reflectivity), heat exchangers (<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_conduction.html" title="Heat conduction">heat conduction</a>) and cable liners (barrier and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_conductivity.html" title="Electrical conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>). Foils in special <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloys</a> are even used for structural <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeycomb.html" title="Honeycomb">honeycomb</a> components for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>. Aluminium foil's heat conductive qualities make it a common accessory in <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hookah.html" title="Hookah">hookah</a> smoking: a sheet of perforated aluminum foil is frequently placed between the coal and the tobacco, allowing the tobacco to be heated without coming into direct contact with the burning coal.</p>
<p>Aluminium foil is widely sold into the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer.html" title="Consumer">consumer</a> market, usually in rolls of around 50 <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimetre.html" title="Centimetre">centimetres</a> width and several <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">metres</a> in length. It is used for wrapping <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> in order to preserve it, for example when storing leftover food in a <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigerator.html" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a> (where it serves the additional purpose of preventing odour exchange), when taking <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandwich.html" title="Sandwich">sandwiches</a> on a journey, or when selling some kinds of <a href="../../../t/a/k/Take-away.html" title="Take-away">take-away</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_food.html" title="Fast food">fast food</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_cuisine.html" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican restaurants</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, for example, typically provide take-away <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burrito_%28food%29.html" title="Burrito (food)">burritos</a> wrapped in aluminium foil. It is also used for <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbecue.html" title="Barbecue">barbecuing</a> more delicate foods such as mushrooms and vegetables; food is wrapped in foil then placed on the grill, preventing loss of moisture that may result in a less appealing texture.</p>
<p>Heavier foils made of aluminium are used for art, decoration, and crafts, especially in bright metallic colours. Metallic aluminium, normally silvery in colour, can be made to take on other colours through anodization. Anodizing creates an oxide layer on the aluminium surface that can accept coloured dyes or metallic salts, depending on the process used. In this way, aluminium is used to create an inexpensive gold foil that actually contains no gold, and many other bright metallic colours. These foils are sometimes used in distinctive packaging.</p>
<p>Aluminium foil is also sometimes used in the training of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cats</a>; as cats have an inborn dislike of either the texture or noise caused by sheets of aluminium foil, it is possible to prevent cats from jumping on or otherwise damaging furniture by covering its surfaces.</p>
<p>As is the case with all metallic items, aluminum foil reacts to being <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microwave_Oven_b8d6.html" title="Microwave Oven">microwaved</a>. This is due to the effect of electric fields of the microwaves causing a build up of charge to form between the sharp points in the aluminum; if enough charge accumulates it will discharge to a different place on the foil, creating a spark (i.e. arcing). Due to frequent use in food services, this commonly leads to kitchen fires.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium_foil.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>The extensive use of aluminium foil has been criticised by some <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalism.html" title="Environmentalism">environmentalists</a> because of the high <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resource_%28economics%29.html" title="Resource (economics)">resource</a> <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost.html" title="Cost">cost</a> of extracting aluminium, primarily as a result of the large amount of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a> used to decompose <a href="../../../b/a/u/Bauxite.html" title="Bauxite">bauxite</a>. However, this cost is greatly reduced via <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recycling.html" title="Recycling">recycling</a> and the fact that many foods that would otherwise perish can be protected over long periods without refrigeration thanks to the total barrier properties of aluminium foil. Many aluminium foil products can be recycled at around 5% of the original <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">energy</a> cost.</p>
