<p>At the bottom of the article it mentions that Canadians call it aluminum (as opposed to aluminium). While this may be practically true due to the influence of our southern neighbors, the official spelling in Canada IS aluminium. Should the article reflect this? <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELommer_bc78.html" title="User:Lommer">lommer</a> 19:32, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the reasoning is probably quite simple - we use mainly US scientific texts at Canadian universities. In my 3 yrs of chemistry at the University of Victoria, it was only referred to as aluminum in spelling (although one British prof I had referred to it as aluminium in speech). None of the supplementary texts published by the university (lab texts, etc) used the spelling aluminum. So in my personal experience, I think it is safe to say Canadians spell it (and generally say it) as "aluminum."<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 05:09, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a side note, Canada has two official language, and in all french textbooks and class material, we use aluminium as well. So at best, Canada uses both spellings.</dd>

<p>For the love of Mike, please stop moving the page to a non-standard spelling. The word is "aluminium". <i>Read the article</i> for clear and explicit evidence of this. The variant usage "aluminum" should certainly be mentioned and a redirect from that page to the main page is appropriate.

<dl>
<dd>The official policy on British vs American spellings here in wikiland is to go with what the article was originally created at and mention and redirect the other spelling to it. The case for the British spelling here is even more concrete because <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_2cc4.html" title="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> has standardized on the ium spelling. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<p>I notices that some of this article had the North American spelling, while the vast majority was had the International spelling. I have changed the 6 or so 'num's to 'nium's.

<dd>the "historical reason" favors -num. i say the idea of ending it in -ium was always, well, worth its weight in platinium (hint: ideas lack significant mass, and "platinium" is not the name of an element) - what name was the article originally created with anyway? --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">832</a> 10:42, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Neither Borg-Word nor m-w.com recognize "chlorure". Searching the Web for it doesn't generally produce English-language sites. My Longman Advanced English dict. doesn't have it either.

<p>I've never understood why the "precedent set by potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium" is used as opposed to the standard set by platinum, molybdenum, lanthanum, and tantalum [not to mention the original latin aurum, argentum, cuprum, plumbum, etc, none of which end in "ium"] --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">832</a> 10:42, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a correlation with German: Kalium, Natrium, Magnesium, Kalzium, Strontium and Platin, Molybdän, Lanthan,Tantal. BTW, it's Aluminium in German. I don't understand 'precedent'.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>The first paragraph of the 'notable characteristics' section states that aluminium is both soft and strong. This seems unlikely to be the case. In the case of pure aluminium the yield strength is in the region of 10 MPa which certainly isn't strong as far as construction materials are concerned (Al alloys may have yield strengths in the region of 200-500 MPa). As a result I have removed the word strong (alloying is mentioned later anyway).</p>
<p>Surely aluminium is not resistent to magnetism but is simply non-magnetic? I have altered the 'applications' section to reflect this (and hopefully I'm right).</p>
<p>The term 'weak' is ambiguous (strength, stiffness, hardness, toughness, fatigue resistance?). I replaced it with a link to tensile strength as this is probably the most familar mechanical property.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>The Engineering use section needs major revisions. I removed the second paragraph about fatigue failure, as this applies to any structural material, not just Al. The section should focus on the different aluminium alloys and their mechanical properties, manufacturing techniques and more examples of use.</p>

<p>This proposal, I think, is without merit. The Google Test is simply not relevant in this case: all it establishes is that "aluminum" is more common <i>on the Internet</i>. It ignores the official usage endorsed by the IUPAC, as well as the <i>International</i> usage. Note that I do not have any objection to <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfur.html" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> (though the International spelling is sulphur); to keep this at aluminium seems, at the very least, to be a reasonable compromise. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 13:35, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed; it would be somewhat odd to label the IUPAC's decision as NPOV, certainly (I think that "sulfur" is a terribly shoddy compromise), but "aluminium" or a similar inflexion is used on every country on Earth (if only rarely in the US and Canada); "aluminum" is, well, not.</dd>

It also allows the article to be consistent, as under the terms of existing policy, the IUPAC term 'aluminium' should be used in the body of the article itself. Leave the article where it is.</dd>

<dd>Also I deeply resent the suggestion that preferring non-U.S. terms over U.S. terms is anti-American. It's as ridiculous as suggesting that those preferring U.S. terms are trying to impose some linguistic hegemony over the rest of the English world. We all prefer reading English in a style we are used to, Americans and non-Americans are no different in this respect. We reach a reasonable compromise between the competing styles and move on. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 15:00, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

By my understanding, aluminium is used in North America as well as the (more-common-there) aluminum, where as aluminium is used almost without exception elsewhere, and used to be used in the US:
<dl>
<dd><i>"You probably noted that the title uses "aluminium" instead of the American "aluminum," which I did purely in futile protest. Until 1925, the word was "aluminium" even in the U.S., but in that year the American Chemical Society decided to change it. We also got "sulfur" in that same year, which still looks silly, and was not universally adopted by the engineering world. It's the Latin spelling, as is "sulpur."</i> [sic] <i>Fortunately, the urge for simplified spelling did not result in Fosforus or Thorum, or even Jermanum, combining both types of change. The -ia ending of a refractory oxide, such as alumina or thoria, usually named the metal with an -ium ending. Why aluminum had to be different, I do not know. A divergence in pronunciation also results, "alyouminium" versus "aloominum." The latter may have been a vulgar pronunciation. It is usually the English who have trouble pronouncing more than three syllables in a word, not the colonials."'</i></dd>

<p>Over the past few of days there have been a couple of edit and reverts changing the general spelling throughout the article between British English and U.S. English.</p>
<p>I hope this isn't going to continue — its enough trouble keeping a lid on the choice of IUPAC spelling of the article title. The Manual of Style at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html#Usage_and_spelling" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS#Usage_and_spelling</a> is quite clear on these issues. As far as I'm concerned, this is an international article with no prior preference for one version of English over another. As such the spelling should conform to whichever version of English was used when the article was created (I haven't checked but I would imagine that was U.S. English in this case). The choice of IUPAC spelling for the word 'aluminium' itself, is an independent decision and shouldn't be taken as an endorsement to convert to British English spelling for the rest of the article. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 17:33, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree strongly with Dforest that if the spelling used in the title is bases on IUPAC recommended spelling, then it cannot determine whether the article should use British or U.S. or some other national variant of spelling. Furthermore, who the first contributor was is immaterial; it is the first use by a significant contributor (not a stub) that matters, and the "gray" spelling is as good a clue as any for determining this.</dd>

Regarding the variant spelling of the element name itself, it's a mistake to see "-ium" as the British form, it's the international form and historically the most common form (as the article explains). "-um" is parochial to North America in the last hundred years. The IUPAC recognises "aluminum" and "cesium" as optional alternative spellings, and I can't find either being used in a modern IUPAC document on their own, as opposed to in brackets after the preferred spelling. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Andrew Norman</a> 13:31, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google "aluminum" 15,200,000 hits; "aluminium" 6,420,000 hits. It's not just "parochial to North America"; if it were, you'd have more than a 1.7:1 ratio for aluminium to aluminum when you limit it to site:.uk (e.g., litre:liter is more than 12:1 on site:.uk). Some of that, of course, is North American usage, but you will also find lots of examples of native usage of "aluminum" there and around the world, Australia, New Zealand, wherever. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:06, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolute Rubbish - <b>No-one</b> in Britain pronounces the word as "aluminum" let alone spells it that way. This is where the Internet throws things skew-whiff. A lot of pages that have a .uk suffix are simply cut and pasted by large American organisations from their international corporate site to the sites they use for marketing their products in the UK. This is why Google is a complete waste of time for making these kinds of decisions. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 15:56, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, IUPAC often <b>uses</b> both spellings, and sometimes only <i>aluminum</i>. Can anybody actually point us to a specific IUPAC rule <b>actually prescribing</b> a certain spelling?

<dd>That latter question was answered in the article itself, with the 1993 official recognition of "aluminum" as a variant spelling by IUPAC. So it isn't quite true that IUPAC prescribes the "aluminium" spelling as is sometimes argued, nor as Andrew Norman claimed that it is the "correct" one in any absolute sense, though if we read his comment as "the correct choice for use in the Wikipedia article" it makes sense as a validly held opinion shared by others including some who'd spell it aluminum themselves. Note that a Google search for aluminum and not aluminium on site:iupac.org gets 171 hits. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 12:37, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The title was not chosen because it is "British English", but because it was considered the dominant IUPAC spelling. You may not think it is relevant, but it does not make this a British English article nor justify your changes in spelling.

<p>Dforest - please stop changing the the spelling of the only remaining word on this page which has a different spelling in BE and AE. The choice of spelling of the words within the article should be consistent with the article title -as per MoS. The reason for the choice of one spelling over the can be for numerous reasons. In this case it has been decided to use the BE spelling and therefore the choice of spelling and idiom within the article should reflect BE usage - You and others (to the detriment of the value of the article itself) - ) have taken it upon yourselves to rid this article of words which have different spellings in BE and AE.

<dd>Jooler, you took it upon yourself to change <i>all</i> the so-called AE spellings to BE. Others agreed that the choice of IUPAC spelling does not mean the article is British English. Following Darrien's lead, I tried to compromise by rewriting the contentious words in neutral English.

<dd>As far as I can see, the only point in mentioning it is to establish the relative frequency of use of each spelling. In the past I've worked with someone developing word counting/indexing software for use by dictionary editors (I can't now remember whether it was the OED or Collins). They pay careful attention to source of text that would be considered relevant and I doubt Google would pass muster (for example you don't include data from the language used in the 1911EB to determine current usage). They were actually using vast collections of electronic texts - I have a vague impression that collections of newspapers were considered particularly fruitful, but I can't remember the reasoning - possibly because their daily timestamp was useful for tracking the historical variations in word usage.</dd>

<dd>Actually, use of Google hits counts is a fast-growing area of real (albeit informal, but done by professionals, not just amateurs) linguistic research. Second, I don't see anything wrong with including the <i>fact</i> that Google has more hits for <i>aluminum</i> than <i>aluminium</i>. It's a verifiable fact, something that is perfectly acceptable for inclusion on Wikipedia. It would be a step too far to say that the Google results necessarily mean that <i>aluminum</i> is more common than <i>aluminium</i> in English usage <i>overall</i>, but there is nothing wrong with saying that Google has more hits for <i>aluminum</i> than <i>aluminium</i>, and in a section describing contention over the spelling of the word, such a fact is perfectly relevant and demonstrative. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 06:37, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

What purpose is there in suppressing the presentation of actual, verifiable facts on Wikipedia articles other than to further some hidden agenda?

Note that Google News, which indexes many newspapers around the world, has a ratio of 4:1 of aluminum:aluminium.

<p>Well, I recently excised a statement in the Spelling section of the main article which claimed that <i>aluminium</i> is the more widespread usage, with no source to back it up. The "Google test" gave me a good reason to delete that claim. That isn't original research; it merely checks out a suspicion about an unsourced statement in a WikiP article. (It was actually a "Yahoo" test, which found 72.5 million examples of the American version and 19.9 million for the British usage.)</p>

<dd>Well that just shows you how meaningless and unreliable Google/Yahoo tests are in this kind of situation. All that tells you is that it is more common on the pages indexed by Google. And funnily enough the majority of those tend to be US. Secondly and more importantly Google indexes pages not by the content but by the links.

<p>OK. I'm an American and I teach chemistry in the good old USA. My textbooks spell it aluminum and with my students I use it as aluminum (although I point out the IUPAC spelling). <i>Aluminium</i> is the IUPAC reccommended spelling just as <i>sulfur</i> is - and wikipedia chemistry project made the decision to go with IUPAC. It's been bashed about too many times, give it up - on wikipedia it is spelled <b>aluminium</b>. When I find <i>aluminum</i> on wiki, I change it to <i>aluminium</i> - just as I change <i>sulphur</i> to <i>sulfur</i> (Historical/archaic usage and place names aside).

<dd>Nonsense. Total, utter nonsense. Wikipedia has no "official spellings". Each article is spelled according to the national spelling style used for that article. If an article otherwise uses American spellings, then there is no reason why it should use the non-American spelling <i>aluminum</i>. AFAIK there is no policy which supports changing all instances of the word <i>aluminum</i> to <i>aluminium</i>, so I suggest you stop that. Furthermore, the fact that IUPAC chooses some particular spelling should have no bearing at all on how Wikipedia chooses to spell an ordinary word like <i>aluminum</i>. I accept that community consensus supports spelling it aluminium at the moment, but I definitely do <i>not</i> support Wikipedia's acceding to some foreign spelling authority. We decide our own spellings around here based on our own policies which are decided using the NPOV.

<dd>"Foreign" to whom exactly? Bad attitude. "We" do <b>not</b> decide our own spellings - that's nonsense. This is an encyclopedia and it is supposed to reflect the world, not shape it. In this case the article explains the etymology and adequately covers the fact that in the American branch of English sub-dialects there is a slight deviation from the normal spelling. The view of the international body simply reflects the status quo. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 12:32, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IUPAC is foreign to Wikipedia and they have no authority to legislate how we use the English language, nor is there any policy that says we should obey IUPAC's preferences. A majority of native English speakers are speakers of American English. Calling American English a "branch of sub-dialects" makes it seem at though American English is some uninfluential minority dialect. It is not. And furthermore, if you want to accurately "reflect the world", the reality is that a giant fraction of English speakers, if not a majority, spell and pronounce this word "aluminum", and I see no Wikipedia policy that says valid American spellings should be dispreferred. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 06:00, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the IUPAC has no authority to *legislate* over linguistic usage. But the suggestion that its approach "should have no bearing at all" is completely lunatic. Again, I agree that since langauge is a matter of convention, the *primary* consideration should be working out what that convention is: ie do a greater total of English speakers say Aluminum or Alumimium? But if this long debate has proved anything, it's that none of us has any particularly good evidence of this - especially on the issue of which form English-as-a-second-language people tend to use. Given that the evidence as to the global convention is so hopeless inconclusive, then the fact that the international body that chemists (the professionals in the field) rely on to set standards has adopted a particular approach to spelling is surely a very good tie-breaker in the circumstances. The people above seem to mistakenly believe that Wikipedia must either treat an IUPAC policy as conclusive or ignore it entirely. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanward_c6b7.html" title="User:Danward">Danward</a> 18:18, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The contestant decided to use his ask-the-audience lifeline and I knew immediately he would lose. Sure enough, they picked Syndey and he went with them.

<dd>Sophistry. The point of this anecdote is to impeach Americans' intelligence, and then by implication impeach their authority to decide how to spell words. <i>Spellings</i> of words are not "facts"; they are conventions. Conventions are established by usage or custom. If a large fraction (or even a majority) of users of a word spell it a particular way, then that spelling is <i>by definition</i> conventional. This story has nothing to support the theory that "aluminium" is somehow "more correct" than "aluminum". <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 06:00, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Talk about not seeing the forest for the trees!? The NYT is an American newspaper, butI would imagine, like all newspapers around the world it carries syndicated stories written by international news organizations like <a href="../../../a/f/p/AFP_db74.html" title="AFP">AFP</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>. Likewise the Internet is predominantly an American entity, the rest follows. Statistics without context are meaningless. The context is that Google both reflects and and enhances the American English bias of the Internet (which is a no-brainer). With this in mind the fact that Google prefers <i>aluminum</i> over <i>aluminium</i> is no more interesting or relevant to this page than the fact that Google prefers <i>humor</i> to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humour.html" title="Humour">humour</a><i>. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 08:07, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>Newspaper that carry stories from international news organizations copyedit them to adhere to their house styles. All articles published in the NYT follow NYT house style rules. If you didn't know that, fine, but the analogy remains totally inept and unapt. Second, it does not go without saying that the internet is inherently biased in favor of the U.S. It has been a long time now that the U.S. does not constitute a majority of the internet. Information about relative sizes of usage groups is not necessarily a given, and we mustn't lose sight of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EState_the_obvious_1904.html" title="Wikipedia:State the obvious">Wikipedia:State the obvious</a>. It may be obvious to you that a Google search will show more hits for aluminum than for aluminium, but that's not true of everyone else. I don't have any problem with tempering the information with caveats about potential biases and so forth, but I don't really see a reasonable argument for completely suppressing it. Furthermore, the interesting fact is that even though "aluminium" is the "official" spelling of IUPAC and is the supposed "international standard", Google still has more hits for aluminum than aluminium, but that the <i>number</i> of Google hits for aluminum is about 13.5 million and the <i>number</i> of Google hits for aluminium is about 5 million; that ratio on the internet is about 2.7 to 1 in favor of "aluminum", which indicates that yes, "aluminum" has a majority of usage on the internet, but that "aluminium" also constitutes a significant minority usage, not a marginal spelling. The statistics serve as a counterbalance to the other descriptions of usage, which seem to "favor" the spelling "aluminium". <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 08:33, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The notable thing about a <i>commodity'</i> is that there are producers and there are consumers. The majority of producers of websites on the Internet and the software products that are used to produce them are American. In this sense it IS without question a predominantly American entity (certainly from the perspective of the English language). The reason for this imbalance is primarily the economic power of American IT corporations. If you load up Microsoft Word using the default installation for English, what do you get? You get English (U.S.), how many non-native English speakers in Germany, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Norway change this to English (British)? No-one - that is no-one - in the UK pronounces the word as <i>aluminum</i>, and consequently no-one - that is - no-one - in the UK spells it as <i>aluminum</i>, and yet we find that a huge number of web-pages sited within the .uk domain use the American spelling!? What is your explanation for this&#160;? Is it that suddenly we have decided to adopt the US spelling? No. The reason is that these web-pages are almost mostly written by Americans and have been cut/and pasted to .uk sites. It is thus a prime example of the pro-American bias of the Internet and displays that Google hit-counts are entirely meaningless in the real world. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 13:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>American English *is* a branch of English. It may not be uninflential but it is certainly a minority as the majority of people speaking English do not reside in the US (nor do they spell aluminium without an 'i'). Fact checking needs to be done... and not through use of American internet sources like Google. This is a fundamental stumbling point. I believe the point of Nelson Ricardo's anecdote was <i>not</i> to impugn the intelligence of Americans, but to illustrate that just because one group sets a convention does not mean that it is correct, either in absolute terms or in relation to the rest of the world. When perception is coloured then facts will be confused.

<dd>You misunderstand. There are two different issues here. The first is how Wikipedia articles in general should spell the word "aluminum". The second is whether or not the article about aluminum should include information from Google about the number of pages that use different results. Furthermore, there is a qualitative difference between making linguistic arguments based on some what self-appointed authority says is correct and making linguistic arguments based on preponderances of usage. The former is called "prescriptivism" and the latter is called "descriptivism". The former is not really accepted by professional linguists as a valid argument for pretty much anything, but the latter forms the basis for how all scientific study of language is undertaken. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:15, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lol. I was just about to say that! I understood there are two elements to this, but the threads are a little confused. On the first point, as I have said, I think the article covers the fact that there are two spellings adequately. It even gives quite a detailed history. The second points seems like <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">primary research</a> to me too. I suspect you may disagree, but I haven't been able to find a policy line on the use of Google. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 20:20, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, what? What does American linguistic imperialism have to do with presenting some simple facts about usage in the article? Are you suggesting that the fact that according to Google "aluminum" is 2.7 times more common on the internet than "aluminium" should be suppressed as some kind of "compensation" for alleged American linguistic imperialism? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 21:13, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nohat. I was in fact following the consensus that the Google statistics were not relevant and should not be included on this page that had been established quite some time ago, when Dforest last went about trying to include them back in July.

Those figures are well known to be hugely inaccurate for several reasons and were in fact the subject of some debate on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Talk%7EEnglish_language_d9ac.html" title="Talk:English language">talk:English language</a> page. See [Talk:English_language#Pie_Chart] and then see [Talk:English_language#Indian_English_Speakers] which states "a 1997 'India Today' survey suggested that about a third of the population has the ability to carry on a conversation in English you end up with around 350 million English language speakers in India" - I was being conservative. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 21:57, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This still doesn't address the issue of how statistics of usage on the internet are <i>invalid</i>. They don't represent all written English, sure, but the internet is a large and important subset of written usage, and has the added benefit of being measurable. Imperfect data shouldn't be suppressed; it should simply be presented with its imperfections. With the exception of cold, hard, data that directly contradicts the Google data, there is nothing you can say or do to convince me that it's invalid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, given that, I disagree that the data is as useless as you claim, and until anyone provides any kind of data or evidence; anything at all whatsoever that directly contradicts the Google data, I don't see any reason to discount it. All these theories and arguments about how Google <i>may potentially</i> be biased or unreliable are just that: theories and arguments. Unless hard facts can be shown that directly contradict the data, the data cannot be denied. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 22:09, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok try to convince me - what <i>exactly'</i> do 18.5 million Google hits actually tell us? (BTW I get 13.5). What do 389,000 "aluminum site:uk" hits tells us? That's the clincher isn't it? 18.5 million hits for <i>aluminum</i> proves that a whole bunch of people wrote the word <i>aluminum</i> on the Internet, and Google counted 'em and added a whole bunch of other false positives (see above) and came out with a figure of 18.5 million. Nothing more nothing less. What do 822,000 hits for "Guiness"(sic) tell us?, What do 2,960,000 hits for "seperate" tells us? what do 4,910,000 hits for "millenium" tell us? It tells us that a lot of people don't use a spellchecker when they write stuff on the Internet (myself included, but my main problem is my inability to touch type). <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 22:20, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What does 4,780 hits for "analogue disc record" tell us?

Ohh and before you start to bang on about the "unaptness" of these analogies - I would like to point out that all analogies are subject to failure if you attempt to take them too far. As it might say on a the cover of a TV dinner, they are for illustrative purposes only. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 22:59, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aluminium is not a misspelling. It's a variant spelling. So making comparisons to common misspellings is not a very illuminating analogy. Besides, none of your examples show anything interesting. All of the misspellings get significantly fewer hits than the correct spelling: "Guinness" gets 3,170,000 hits and Guiness gets 822,000, a ratio of 3.8 to 1. Same for seperate/separate: 40.8 to 1. And so forth. Google shows us that misspellings are not as popular as the correct spellings, and that's not a particularly interesting or unexpected fact. One would expect that correct spellings are more popular. On the other hand, the aluminum article says that IUPAC's official spelling is aluminium and that is the spelling used in most English-speaking countries except the U.S. and Canada. And yet, despite the official preference by IUPAC and the apparent popular preference by so many countries, the American spelling still has dominance on the internet. This is where the Google search shows evidence that is contrary to what someone might expect. That's an interesting fact, and that's something that should be included in the article. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 23:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You say "And yet, despite the official preference by IUPAC and the apparent popular preference by so many countries, the American spelling still has dominance on the internet." - well what can be the explanation for that? What can be the explanation for 389,000 "aluminum site:uk" hits? If you don't accept my explanation, what is your explanation? Oh and again, the analogies are for illustrative purposes only, i.e. they illustrate that Google hit counts are generally not particulary interesting usefull or informative, which is precisely my point with regards to Aluminium. Maybe an article on it's own, but then we have <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a> and the caveats with its usage should be listed there.

A short sentence indicating that fact, with the Google results as evidence is all that is necessary. At least two people think it's relevant and interesting. I think most of the other facts in this article are unsurprising and uninteresting, but you don't see me suggesting that they be removed.

<dd>They are <i>true</i> in a very narrow context, a context which is not particularly interesting in this case, or indeed in any other case regarding US English usage. Why can't you see that? It seems perfectly obvious to me. If it is not obvious to you then fair enough, make your "interesting" point about usage, but make it somewhere else where the context is right.

<dd>This article has an extensive section on "spelling" of the word aluminum. It contains information about which organizations have an official spelling for the word. It contains information about which countries generally prefer which spelling. It even contains information about how the word is spelled in Finnish and Estonian! I don't see any reason why it shouldn't also contain information about which spelling is more popular on the internet. I don't understand how you can say that how the Estonians spell a word in Estonian is relevant to the <i>English</i> Wikipedia, but which English spelling is more common on the internet is irrelevant. That is blatant and POV preference for prescriptive information, while descriptive information is being suppressed by being called "biased" and "irrelevant" without any actual proof of it, just a lot of speculation and blubbering. This discrimination against valid linguistic information is unjustified and intolerable.</dd>

<dd>I'm not proposing any analysis at all anymore. Just the simple facts that Google returns 13.5 million for "aluminum" and 5 million for "aluminium". All I propose is to just use Google as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> to give two facts, and let the reader decide for himself whether the facts are interesting or relevant. I note that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> says "... research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."</dd>
<dd>I recognize that not everyone is linguistically savvy and capable of comprehending the importance of descriptive linguistic data when discussing usage; however, linguistic naïveté should not motivate the suppression of valid and relevant information. Where else would be a better place to put descriptive linguistic information about the relative frequency of two spellings of the word "aluminium" than in a section called "spelling" of the article called "aluminium"? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 20:16, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"If you want this article dispute to go away, then you should stop being so incredibly obstinate" - I'm being obstinate? You are in a minority of two and I am being obstinate!? Get real. I agree with you the details regarding Estonian spelling etc should be trimmed. It's not useful or interesting to list these languages, some will inevitably be left out and some readers will inevitably feel aggreived that their language isn't included and add it to the list. Where would we be then if this page listed the speeling in "all known languages in the galaxy (including <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a>) [that's a reference to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_5cc5.html" title="Red Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a> in case you didn't get it]. You think Google hit counts are relevant, I don't think they are, I have explained why I think they are not relevant and all you have done is quote the hit count, and not tried to offer any kind of explanation defending the relevance of the hit count other than "it must be significant because it is so big" or words to that effect. I repeat - statistics (in this case the hit count) are meaningless without context and in this case the context is that the hit count reflects the nature of the Internet, nothing more. Put this information on a page about the Internet and spellings where the context is meaningful, otherwise you should set about initiating a campaign to add the same bogus statistical information to all of the Wikipedia articles that use an American spelling rather than a British spelling or vice versa. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 22:02, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More sophistry. You keep retreading the same tired arguments. Again you seem to be claiming that the Google statistics have no context, which if course is a statement that couldn't be further from the truth. The context is that this is a section "spelling" of an article called "aluminum". The context is that there is a heap of prescriptive information about English-language usage without any descriptive information to counterbalance it. I can't imagine a situation in which these statistics could have <i>more</i> context.</dd>

<dd>Quoting Google search results for the two terms would be both original research and misleadingly unscientific. For example, the Google results could be heavily skewed to North American Internet references in English. The internationally recognized name of this element, in English texts, is <i>aluminium</i>.

<dd>Thank you for your comments. However, I believe there is some misunderstanding. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> explicitly states "... research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." Google is a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> and including statistics from Google is simply "collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources". Had I attempted to count the usage of the different spellings on the internet myself, then <i>that</i> would be original research. Simply consulting an established primary source for usage statistics does not constitute original research.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is already a multiple-years-old tradition of using Google statistics for scientific inquiry among professional linguists. Your speculation that Google results are heavily skewed to American sources is unsubstantiated and likely false. Google indexes web sites from every country and every language and it has been a long time since American interests have held a majority on the internet.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, the English language is not legislated by any body, and there is no such thing as an "internationally recognized name" for anything. However, if there were, such a name would be recognized by all countries. Seeing as how the United States is a nation in the international community like any other, and the spelling "aluminium" is not recognized in the United States, either popularly or officially, even if there were such a thing as an "internationally recognized name", it couldn't possibly be "aluminium", which is not used by a majority of native English speakers. The suggestion that the title of this article should be based on an "internationally recognized name", which doesn't exist, is not a particularly helpful or well-informed one.</dd>

<p>First, I read the discussion and responded to it. Did you read my post? Second, if linguists have used Google searches for statistical research, It's highly likely their studies had strong controls and were peer reviewed. Your quick and dirty keyword search on Google doesn't compare. Third, I never said the English language was legislated by anyone. Please re-read my post if you have any questions about what I said. Fourth, I think you are being needlessly confrontational and certainly unscholarly about this whole discussion. I was amazed to find the article protected over something so trivial. So...</p>

<dd>Thank you again for your comments. However, your points are neither valid nor germane. The proposal is only to report the facts of how many results Google reports for two searches. There is nothing unscientific about reporting facts. Nevertheless, there is no reason to believe that conclusions about English usage on the internet drawn from Google search results, especially when those results number into the millions, are in any way unscientific or biased. Google indexes all of the internet. However, if there is substantial concern that Google may be biased, we can certainly collect and organize information from other search engines. Furthermore, <b>it is not original research to report facts collected elsewhere</b>. As <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> says, "it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."

<dd>The difference is not stark. It's quite muddled, actually. Organizing data is a form of interpretation, is it not? And yet, organizing data is explicitly <i>encouraged</i> in the no original research policy. However, the proposal to include information about Google results is quite <i>starkly</i> on the "collecting and organizing" side of the line. Where's the interpretation of data in "As of September 2005, a Google search reports 13,200,000 results for <i>aluminum</i> and 6,320,000 for <i>aluminium</i>"? I don't see any interpretation; all I see is facts. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:33, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One indication showing how interpretive it is, in presentation and inference (and hence original research), is that such an unqualified statement could lead the reader into thinking such a Google search has any meaning or sway as to the scientifically, industrially and commercially recognized name for this element, which is <i>aluminium</i>. Google keyword searches in themselves are entirely unscientific, and any conclusion or inference drawn directly from them <i>and cited or included in an article</i> would be original research. This differs from the rough "Google tests" we might run to help reach consensus on an article's status on VfD or whatever. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:50, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Readers make all kinds of conclusions and beliefs based on things included in Wikipedia. If it is believed that the inclusion of some fact will mislead (and there is absolutely zero <i>evidence</i> at all whatsoever that Google results are in any way misleading), then a caveat can be included with the statement of fact. It is <i>possible</i>, sure, that the Google results are biased, but no one has shown even the tiniest scrap of evidence that they are, and what is known about how the Google search engine works strongly indicates that it is not. The mere possibility of being misleading is insufficient cause to not include a fact. At most, the fact should be noted with a caveat. Wouldn't it be better for readers to get <i>all</i> of the available evidence and allow them to draw their own conclusions, rather than withhold information because you think it <i>might</i> be misinterpreted? To do otherwise is simple censorship, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_censored_a7cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored</a>.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, being "scientific" is not a criterion for inclusion of information at Wikipdia, not only because only including so-called "scientific" information would be a blatant violation of NPOV, but for the simple reason that we would never be able to come to an agreement on what is and is not scientific. The argument that the Google searches are "unscientific" is inapplicable. However, the fact remains that Google searches are the only descriptive linguistic information we have concerning spelling of the word "aluminum", and including descriptive information is important for maintaining a NPOV balance from all the prescriptive information already included in the article.</dd>
<dd>If readers draw conclusions based on information presented to them on Wikipedia, then that is their business, and it's not our responsibility to withhold information from readers in the fear that if, God forbid, they find out a piece of factual, verifiable, and relevant information, they might draw a conclusion from it. The "no original research" policy only applies to editors, not to readers. Our duty as editors is to present <i>all</i> of the facts and let the readers decide for themselves. The exclusion and suppression of this valuable, factual, and verifiable information is a flagrant violation of the NPOV policy. The claim that Google keyword searches constitute original research is laughably false. The "no original research" policy does not apply here, and this is made clear by the explicit mention in the policy that it is highly encouraged to collect and organize facts for inclusion on Wikipedia. Your bizarrely twisted interpretation of the policy is plainly sophistry devised to suppress valid, verifiable, and relevant facts from the article.<a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 20:49, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest that American users, who spell it <i>aluminum</i>, follow the example of the United States Government in arms control treaties. One of the categories of equipment subject to reporting in these treaties consists of fighting vehicles having a heavy protective covering. In the United States, they are known as "armored combat vehicles", except for treaty purposes. In the United Kingdom, they are known as "armoured combat vehicles". The English text of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, which is ratified by the United Kingdom and the United States (as well as Canada), refers to "armoured combat vehicles". The reason is, simply that the United Kingdom is the mother country of the English language.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is international, and the English Wikipedia has editors from various English-speaking countries. Why can't Americans simply compromise by recognizing the British spelling on articles of international interest? Wikipedia guidelines say to use American spellings in articles about American places or people, and British spellings in articles about British places and people, and to be consistent within each article. Wikipedia guidelines also say to try to reach agreement by consensus and compromise. The compromise appears to this American editor to be either, first, to accept IUPAC, or, second, to recognize that the United Kingdom is the mother country of the English language. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 22:43, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't go quite that far; I don't think we need to go that far.

<dd>You wrote: "Why can't Americans simply compromise by recognizing the British spelling on articles of international interest?" Your idea of a compromise asserts British hegemony of the English language. Why should British spelling be considered more international? As far as I'm concerned, we already came to a compromise, to use the IUPAC preferred spelling of "aluminium". The current discussion is about whether to include a mention of the Google results as a measure of popular usage that appears to contradict the IUPAC 'standard'. It is unfortunate this discussion is taking place in a section started under different intentions. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 20:40, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Not only is British English used in nearly all of the countries of the Commonwealth, it is an official language of the European Commision - see <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://europa.eu.int/comm/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>It is natural that British conventions of English usage tend to be dominant in its sphere of influence (chiefly, the EU and the Commonwealth) and likewise, U.S. conventions tend to be dominant in its sphere of influence (chiefly the Americas, its former colonies and protectorates, and countries with close economic or academic ties). This does not make one more international than the other. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 07:06, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm impressed. This 'Put down the I' section and the immediately following one has rumbled on for quite a while. With this comment I should be able to push the total word count over the 10,000 word barrier. That's 10,000 words of effort arguing about whether the letter 'i' and associated Google tests should be included or not — over twice the number of words contained in the whole main article on <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>.</p>
<p>I should think that is quite a bit more time and effort than I spent re-writing the history/etymology section. I should think it is far less likely to ever be read in full by anyone and almost certainly a lot less interesting to research.</p>
<p>It is important that these things get thrashed out on talk pages, but given that this has been discussed a couple of times before, I can't help think that all this effort is misplaced.

<dd>It's obviously a sticking point. Also, some recent visitors have got confused. I believe there is consensus over the article naming. The issue here now is that one editor believes we should have the results of his Google test on the page as it shows a prevalence of the use of the <i>aluminum</i> spelling on the internet. Other editors think the test is biased and constitutes original research. Although I agree that Google is not accurate and the test results are not representative, the test itself is not. A basic non-filtered search on any engine will confirm these proportions. The etymology is actually quite interesting and if we block the bit about the internet we would probably have to remove the material about the other languages too. As a compromise I propose we allow a single sentence that does not use figures (since they'll change daily) and does not attempt to infer anything from the "results". What would people say if we inserted something like this at the end of the paragraph?</dd>
<dd><i>Unfiltered internet search engine results show the "aluminum" variant is currently used more frequently on webpages.</i></dd>
<dd>It's doesn't take up masses of space, doesn't infer anything about the real world and is actually true.

<dd>No one has&#160;:
<ul>
<li>Presented any <i>evidence</i> that search engine results are in any way biased or false, other than unsupported speculation</li>
<li>Shown how any part of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy applies to this information in any way other than its inclusion should be strongly encouraged</li>
<li>Provided any reason why this information should be supressed from readers rather then letting them decide for themselves whether it is useful, interesting, or relevant</li>
<li>Provided any other compelling argument for why information which is directly concerned with the topic in question should be deleted</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I will not accept the censorship of this valid information unless substantially compelling argument for the points above can be presented. Unless these points can be convincingly answered, in my estimation the argument has been lost by those who wish to remove the information.</dd>
<dd>Answer my points in a compelling way, and then we can come to a consensus. Wiki-Ed has made a reasonable proposal that I accept. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 20:37, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Unfiltered internet search engine results show the "aluminum" variant is currently used more frequently on web pages"
<ul>
<li>So what? Why is that important to the study of aluminium? Who cares?</li>
<li>What value are unfiltered internet search engine results?</li>
<li>Does any official body consider that the use of such 'unfiltered' results have any <b>real</b> statistical value?</li>
<li>What is the actual context of the suggested 'unfiltered' search result?</li>
<li>It it influenced by the way that the search engine caches, or catalogues web pages?</li>
<li>Do web pages reflect usage in general or or is it skewed to those who possess the technology?</li>
<li>Is this technological advantage skewed in favour of particular nations?</li>
<li>Does the search engine in question favour pages generated by certain institutions?</li>
<li>Does the fact a high proportion of the English language pages on the Internet are written by Americans have any influence on this?</li>
<li>Does the fact that there are a very large number of academic and scientific establishments in the United States influence the number?</li>
<li>Does the fact that these institutions generally have a larger IT budget than institutions outside of the USA influence the results?</li>
<li>Does the fact the products used to produce electronic texts are mostly produced by companies from the United States influence the results?</li>
<li>Does the fact the product like Microsoft Word default to installing in English (U.S.) rather than English (British) affect the results?</li>
<li>Does the fact that Americans are less aware of non-American spellings, whilst Britons and others are generally more aware of American spellings mean that people who would naturally write using British spellings find that in order for their page to obtain a larger number of hits they must resort to using American spellings to attract American customers?</li>
<li>Why do we get 509,000 hit counts on pages with a .uk domain when <i>aluminum</i> is not used by Brits?</li>
<li>Why do we get 47,000 hits on pages with with a .fr domain?</li>
<li>Is it significant that when you filter those 47,000 hits on site:fr to restrict to English language pages, half of the hits go away?</li>
<li>Is it significant that of the remaining half (the French half) most of the pages still seem to be written in English? How many were written by Canadians?</li>
<li>How many pages are written by Chinese authors using their default MS Word installation, which the spellchecker corrected for them?</li>
<li>How many of the hits are pages saying things like "Americans spell it <i>aluminum</i>, but I prefer to spell it <i>aluminium</i> and so I won't use <i>aluminum</i> on the rest of this page"?</li>
<li>Are the results of a web search any more significant than going onto the street somewhere in California (where a large fraction of the websites on the Internet are actually produced) and randomly asking 100 people how they spell a word?</li>

<dd>Even if I were to answer these inane questions (which I could, but won't because they're irrelevant and inane), they still fail to address my points above, and as I explained earlier, are all speculation based on not a shred of evidence. When you're talking about corpora in the billions of words, biases such as the ones you speculate aren't sufficient to change the results of simple searches. Also, you vastly underestimate the diversity of the internet. Even if it were true that a "large fraction" of web sites are produced in California (which is completely untrue), the reality is that the vast majority of content on the internet is not "produced", but is the result of people all over the world communicating with each other. Messaging boards and wikis and so forth contribute many orders of magnitude more content to the archived web than "produced content".</dd>
<dd>Secondly, even if any of your alleged biases are significant, that's still not a sufficient reason to exclude the information. If there were better information, we would use that. But we don't have better information, and it is better to provide <i>some</i> statistical information about usage, with any relevant caveats explained, than to provide no information at all. Do you <i>really</i> think that "aluminium" is actually the more commonly-used spelling on the internet and that Google is simply wrong? Or do you think that the search engine results are too affected by bias and that in some unmeasurable ideal consideration of the world, "aluminium" is in fact more commonly used? I think it's really actually the case that "aluminum" is more common on the internet, and I think that it fits in quite well with all the other vaguely-relevant pieces of information about usage. In general, more information is better than less, and since we can't agree that this information is valid and relevant, we should let our readers decide for themselves, rather than having you decide for them. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 05:40, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Google is not a primary source, it's a search engine. Anything you infer statistically from a keyword search of Google is your own original research, never mind the raw comparison you've discussed above is unscientific, for the reasons outlined above. As for scientific publications, because they're peer reviewed their reliability tends to be rather high. Since we're dealing with a basic article about an elemental metal whose definition depends wholly on peer reviewed science, I'd suggest that peer reviewed scientific publications can be reasonably asserted as the only acceptable sources for this article. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:51, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Google most certainly is a primary source. I ask it how many internet pages that it has indexed have a particular word, and it tells me. I can't imagine a more prototypical primary source of usage information than Google. There's no original research going on when directly comparing two numbers. 16 million <i>is</i> a larger number than 6 million. That's not original research; that's a fact. If doing a comparison using these methods were some idea that I just dreamed up, then I could understand calling it original research. But the method itself does not constitute original research; it has long been established by linguists and also on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a>. Neither does the particular data constitute original research—it's just collected information from a primary source. Of course, other information has to be taken into account when making decisions about usage, but there is no reason not to report the data as collected in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, we're not talking about the element per se; we're talking about English usage of the name of the element. The criteria for information about English usage is not the same as the criteria for the information about the element itself, for the obvious reason that linguists are the experts on usage, not chemists. When discussing English usage, the methods used by usage commentators are appropriate, which in this case means consulting large corpora for statistical information. Seeing as how Google is <i>the</i> largest corpus of English text available for general searching, it necessarily is the most precise source of such information. Accusations that Google is somehow biased are unsubstantiated and irrelevant, as the proposed information specifically indicates that this is information from Google searches. The idea that this information could only be included if it were part of some scientific study is laughable. It would be like saying that you have to cite a scientific study that says broccoli is green. You look at broccoli—you see it's green. You consult the largest corpus in the world of English text, and you see that "aluminum" is more common. There is no scientific study that will say that aluminum is more commonly used on the internet and there never will be, because scientists don't fill their publications with such trivialities—it's just a given that the information is trivial to glean from the corpus if it is desired. The fact that the people here have been unwilling to accept statistical information from Google is just an example of the masses being slow to catch up with the paradigm that professionals have already been using for years. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 02:47, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I just want to state my viewpoint on this mess. Aluminium is the official IUPAC spelling. I am British and I feel a certain pride in seeing it spelled that way. I also find the spelling of sulfur vulgar but i'm not going to go changing that. When or If the IUPAC ever decides that Aluminum is the correct spelling, I'm sure every sensible Brit (and other fighting for the IUPAC spelling) will happily drop the i. i also found this page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28chemistry%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28chemistry%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28chemistry%29</a> that i havent seen listed in theis discussion.

<p>This is a fine mess. The discussion above appears deadlocked and the participants have resorted to a revert war leading to this. By my count two editors feel the Google statistics on spelling are important and deserve a spot in the page. Another seven or eight editors feel the info is either irrelevant or original research (that count includes me) and inapropriate for the page. Perhaps the matter needs to be referred to an RFC concerning the <i>original research</i> bit, or concerning the rudeness and name-calling indulged in by one of the editors involved.

<dd>While it may seem like a silly edit war, there are valid points being discussed here that could serve to the betterment of Wikipedia. Let me give some credit to Jooler and the others for bringing up some (but not all) valid criticisms of the Google test. I think they may be valuable additions to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a> (which I suggest be linked from this article once a compromise is reached). However, I strongly disagree it is completely 'bollox' (to use the word Jooler once wrote) or that it is original research. Google, in practice, falls something between a reference work (albeit vast) and a search tool. Further, I don't think rules of thumb like comparing Google-supplied page counts should be considered original research, just as patents are not granted to obvious methods. Note there are many, many references of this method here in Wikipedia and elsewhere on the Internet, some of which reference this exact comparison. Also, let me say I disagree with the vandalism accusations; as I personally think Jooler was acting in good faith, though I do take offense at his (and others') jabs on Americans. But I can take them in good humo(u)r so long as we can come to a suitable compromise. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 05:21, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think "bollox" must have been used in some other debate. I can't see it here. What jabs do you mean? The reference to Internet porn? That's not a jab at Americans it's a jab (and even a joke) at the expense of Internet itself and what the majority of people use it for, but I'm not suprised that you take offence. On Wikipedia I consistently see accustations of "Anti-Americanism" been thrust at editors who expresses apoint of view that disagrees with an American one. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 16:01, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Reading the discussion on this page, I just have to wonder one thing... Why is everyone arguing over aluminium? Not only have you stopped other people being able to access the edit function on the actual artical, but you're also wasting your breath trying to get your point across. So stop ruining it for everyone else &amp; stop bickering so we can edit what ever page we want to...</p>

I used it as an example of the unreliability of Google keyword searches, which I copied directly from the AH talk page.

<dd>The point is not that anyone was offended, but that you regressed the conversation to a comparison using Hitler. If you actually read <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>, you would have seen that it says "The law states that: <i>As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.</i> There is a tradition in many Usenet newsgroups that once such a comparison is made, the thread is over, and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever argument was in progress." That's all I was referring to, and really only in jest. However, you should know better than to involve Nazis in a coversation that has nothing to do with them. Even if you didn't think it would actually offend anyone, it was certainly in poor taste. Furthermore, as was explained elsewhere, it's a disingenuous point to make: our proposal is not to use Google as a method of fact-verification, but as a method of revealing patterns of usage. There's a big difference, and the two are not comparable. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 15:13, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One way or another, you're wholly mistaken. As I've previously explained, I created the comparison earlier that same day on the AH talk page (see the page's history if you like), was struck by the similarity of issues and pasted it over. You then opportunistically attacked it as a debating point (which by the bye is a rather telling example of what <i>I'd</i> call sophistry but that's so wonted on WP, never mind), ignoring the content and intent. I did not involve Nazis in the conversation, I did not use the word, I did not compare them to any editors or aluminium or anything else (and I think you know that, although perhaps you don't, in which case I'm at a loss). As I have lengthily explained, your proposal to use Google as a method of revealing patterns of usage is deeply flawed and unscientific, aside from requiring original research. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:05, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fallacy. When I search for those phrases I get a 20x relationship in favor of the latter.</p>

</dl>
<p>Surely you are aware that by conspicuous omission of quotation marks, you are not searching for the <i>phrase</i>, but for <i>the relative frequency of the individual words</i>. Similar to your queries, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=loved" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=loved" rel="nofollow">loved</a> gets more hits than <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=hated" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=hated" rel="nofollow">hated</a>. (about 5x at present)</p>
<p>Further, it is completely different to search spelling variants to compare their <i>relative use</i> and to search phrases to compare their <i>truthfulness</i>. Google is not a measure of truthfulness, but it is a good measure of relative use. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 00:33, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That rather proves my point. Extensive qualification is involved, which quickly seeps into original research, never mind if there's any truth to its results. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:34, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This line of reasoning is not only unnecessarily inflammatory by involving Hitler, but is also complete sophistry. The question is not "which is more true: <i>aluminum</i> or <i>aluminium</i>?". The question is "which spelling appears more frequently on the web?". <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 01:55, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, you're further proving my point: 1) How often either spelling appears on the web is irrelevant to either the naming of the article or its content, 2) raw data from a Google search doesn't tell us how frequently a spelling appears on the web, it tells us how many <i>pages</i> on the web it has indexed with one <i>or more</i> occurences of that word. Opportunities for skewed results and misinterpretive original research abound.</p>
<p>As for the example I used, I originally came up with it on the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> talk page and thought it would be helpful here since it so clearly shows the pitfalls of raw Google word counts, so I copied it over. If you think it's inflammatory I apologize. Most readers have at least a fuzzy idea who that person was, so the example is rather stark and plain to understand.</p>
<p>Lastly, please do try to be more polite. Luzzing around the word "sophistry" the way you wontedly do sounds more and more like a personal attack to me and truth be told, is not helpful towards swaying me. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:28, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seeing as the discussion has been Godwinned, can the article be unlocked? Seriously, though, I don't even see the point of including original research usage statistics - are we going to dedicate half of every article which has different spellings in US and Commonwealth English to mindless bickering about which version is more popular? Why not have different statistics for each relevant country, then adjusted for race, educational status and age? The very first link in the article is to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_English_d64d.html" title="North American English">North American English</a>, hyperlinks are extensively used in Wikipedia for a reason - so that users can easily jump through to related topics without cluttering the main page with irrelevant information.</dd>
<dd>If someone is really insecure enough to think that the French have suppressed their word for a metal, they can just click through one or two pages and reassure themselves that the U.S. makes up the largest proportion of English speakers, and by extension, the U.S word for aluminium is more common. I wouldn't worry about Nohat's overuse of the word "sophistry", he probably just learnt what it means and thinks it's a general purpose "your argument is convincing, so you're trying to trick me and I'm still right". That and, ironically, to use smart words to distract from his argument (you can't really blame him for trying to distance himself from his argument, do you?). <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartH_a780.html" title="User:StuartH">StuartH</a> 06:46, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't of much relevance to a U.S. vs. Commonwealth English discussion in other articles, and not just because Canada is part of the Commonwealth. It is because of the oft-repeated claims that this doesn't deal with U.S./Commonwealth differences, but rather with an "official" international spelling.</dd>
<dd>The Google statistics should be included in the spelling section, because of their highly probative value in explaining why the IUPAC isn't willing to hinge its reputation on its ability to enforce this spelling rule. That's a damn good indication why they have officially accepted the aluminum spelling, something which should also be included in the first paragraph in the spelling section.</dd>
<dd>I'd also like to note that there is a huge difference in single-word Google searches compared to the multiple word searches (with many possibilities in the Boolean operators and other limitations applied to them) which we saw in the Hitler nonsense on this talk page. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:54, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jooler—I wasn't making that assumption. But regardless, according to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> we are <b>not</b> supposed to represent only the majority point of view:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Articles should be written without bias, representing all majority and significant minority views fairly. This is the <b>neutral point of view policy</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The policy is easily misunderstood. It doesn't assume that writing an article from a single, unbiased, objective point of view is possible. Instead it says to <i>fairly represent</i> all sides of a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispute.html" title="Dispute">dispute</a> by not making articles state, imply, or insinuate that only one side is correct. Crucially, a great merit of Wikipedia is that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> work together to make articles unbiased.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So let's work together, shall we? I think it's time we stop bickering and settle on a compromise. Wiki-Ed's proposal sounds reasonable--what do you think about it? --<a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 08:21, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This isn't an NPOV issue about how to balance one opinion against another. This a matter of the inclusion or exclusion of unfiltered stastistics. In article disputes of this nature having a vote to decide on inclusion is far from uncommon. Wiki-Ed proposal is not acceptable. If any kind of reference to Internet search engine hit counts enteres this article it must be qualified by a great deal of text explaing the context and in all honesty I would rather not do this or I would be accused of disrupting wikipedia to make a point. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 21:40, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is completely an NPOV issue. There is a dispute concerning whether this information is accurate. Furthermore, there is no information already existing in the article about the actual distribution of usage to explain and/or contrast with all the prescriptive information about who says which spelling is "preferred". We'd like to include the information; you'd like to not include the information. It seems like the compromise would be to include the information, but include any relevant and non-speculative caveats. This is what we have suggested from the beginning, but have been continually rebuffed. I still haven't seen a good reason why it is of paramount importance that this information be excluded from the article rather than included so that readers can decide for themselves whether or not it's valid or relevant. Obviously there are some people that think the information is interesting and relevant, and there are likely readers who would agree. We should have enough respect for our readers that we give them information that they may find useful. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 23:36, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point, which some people got and had some fun with, and others didn't (or didn't want to or whatever) is that this would be "non-information." Why can't one mention that <i>aluminum</i> is a spelling widely used in North America and leave it at that? The rest of the world (and the professional community in the US for the most part) calls it aluminium. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 07:53, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's <i>not</i> "non-information". The Google results are valid, verifiable facts. The facts are related to the topic in question, and inclusion of these facts is necessary to maintain a neutral balance in POV. Furthermore, given that the relevance of the facts is disputed, I have yet to see a good argument for why we should repress this information rather than give it and let readers decide for themselves if they think it's useful. Several people in this discussion have said that they think the information is useful. Why is it so important that we infantalize our readers and withhold the information on the mere possibility that they <i>might</i> be misled on the unproven speculation that the information is "biased" in some vague and unconvincing way? On the one hand, we have valid, verifiable facts. On the other hand, all you have is unproven speculation. I don't see that conjecture that there <i>might</i> be a problem with the information is a valid reason to suppress the inclusion of actual facts. Why can't we respect our readers enough to include the information and let them decide for themselves if they think it is interesting and relevant? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 15:13, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These results only demonstrate that the citing of Google <b>to verify the truth of statements</b> is a false heuristic, for obvious reasons. No one was arguing Google should be used in this way. This does nothing to invalidate the use of Google <b>to compare the usage of spelling variants</b> in the searchable web. If you base your hypothesis on nonsense, it only follows you will get nonsensical results. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 01:15, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Untrue, they could be quoting another person saying "The world is Flat". The Google search is only for sites which have that sentence (or part of it) in the web site.

<dd>Google indexes public web pages on the Internet. This is an inherently limited and skewed sample (mirrors, no access to private sources, libraries, books, on and on and on). Reliable comparisons between usage of UK and US spellings are not possible with raw keyword searches. Finally, it's not relevant, since <i>aluminium</i> is the internationally recognized and professionally preferred term (even in the US).

<dd>I think we can agree that search engines are not reliable. This is not in dispute. However, someone using an <b>unqualified</b> search would find more "aluminums" than "aluminiums". This is not in dispute either. Given that this Wikipedia article asserts that the standard spelling has an 'i' we ought to acknowledge the discrepency or certain visitors will continually question whether the article is complete and accurate. Hence my suggestion for a short neutrally worded sentence. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 08:45, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Well just cause I wanted to, I conducted my own Raw Google Experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spawn Man= 3,500 hits.</li>
<li>Jooler= 586 hits.</li>
<li>Cheese= 43,800,000 hits.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can assume that I'm more popular than Jooler &amp; that Jooler is less popular than cheese?</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguing is stupid= 1,240 hits.</li>
<li>Arguing is good= 2,070 hits.</li>
<li>Arguing is not good= 269 hits.</li>
<li>Arguing is bad= 708 hits.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can judge that people want to have early heart predicaments in their life?</p>
<ul>
<li>My buttocks hurt= 291 hits.</li>
<li>My buttocks don't hurt= 1 hit.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can gather that more or less most of the world's population struggles with silent gluteus maximus maximus problimius?</p>
<ul>
<li>My dog ate my homework= 15,400 hits.</li>
<li>My cat ate my homework= 206 hits.</li>
<li>My fish ate my homework= 143 hits.</li>
<li>My bird ate my homework= 70 hits.</li>
<li>My ferret ate my homework= 11 hits.</li>
<li>My chinchilla ate my homework= 35 hits.</li>
<li>My bed ate my homework= 1 hit.</li>
<li>My dad ate my homework= 13 hits.</li>
<li>My grandma ate my homework= 14 hits.</li>
<li>My grandfather ate my homework= 3 hits.</li>
<li>My mom ate my homework= 134 hits.</li>
<li>My mum ate my homework= 2 hits.</li>
<li>I ate my homework= 625 hits.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can verify many things; We could say that children should throw away the old "My dog ate it" excuse &amp; instead turn to "My dad was hungry" or "My fish ate it over the weekend". Or in extreme cases, the student should simply eat the homework in front of the teacher. Another thing we can say is, that American mothers eat more homework than British mothers do? Or that only on very rare occasions has a bed actually eaten homework (I believe it was an essay on Hamlet).</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aluminum= 36,200,000 hits.</li>
<li>Aluminium= 13,600,000 hits.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all very irrelavent, but if you guys can do it I wanted to do it to (with a splash more humour). Thanks for reading my results. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 10:49, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>All of the examples given here are completely inapplicable. I guess this is difficult for some people to understand, but there is an essential difference between using search engine results to gather information about <i>usage</i> and using search engine results to evaluate the truth of various claims. <i>Usage</i> is by definition a descriptive measure. There is no such thing as a "false" or "true" spelling. So, making comparisons to searches for false statements are completely inapplicable, and a straw man for what is actually being proposed.</p>
<p>I ask again: please give a good reason, given that there is dispute as to whether this information is useful, why we shouldn't allow our readers to decide for themselves whether or not it is interesting or useful information. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:46, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I work for the UK Aerospace industry (what's left of it), and have worked with Aluminium every day for the past 10 years, and i can assure you that the card it comes wrapped in, is labelled Alumin<b>i</b>um Alloy - and the metal itself (depending upon manufacturer) is often marked in the same manner. IUPAC states that the British spelling is <i>official</i>, with the US spelling as an <i>acceptable alternative</i>. Can we please have an end to this? Just accept the 'ium' and acknowledge the 'num'.</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, I do think consensus has spoken on both the spelling and including raw Google keyword search data in an article. I do apologize again to anyone who was actually upset by the AH example I used. I'll make it up to anyone by doing some chore on an article if they like... leave a note on my talk page. Now, on the AH talk page, someone had brought up Google search results with a similarly mistaken notion, I did some comparative searches on that topic and thought to myself it was such a clear (general) example of the pitfalls, I copied it here too. Maybe my familiarity with 20th century western European history does desensitize me to some topics others find incendiary. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 10:19, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The real problems are that insistence of an "internationally recognized way of spelling the word" as if the spelling "aluminum" were not also recognized by the same body, and as if IUPAC has some general language-police authority over the English language like the French language police have.</dd>
<dd>Then there is the presentation of that in a way that implies that this so-called "internationally accepted spelling" is really and universally accepted, except for possibly some small and insignificant minority who don't follow the rules. In fact, the "aluminum" spelling is not only overwhelmingly the most common spelling in North America, but the most common spelling in actual use in the English language worldwide in almost any way you could possibly figure out to measure it. In North America, aluminum is also the preferred spelling by most professionals in any profession you choose (and, of course, the use of either the metal aluminum or the various names for it are not limited to any particular profession, and in fact is most often used by those outside what would normally be classified as a "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Profession.html" title="Profession">profession</a>", however broadly you define that, rather than whatever you call everything else).</dd>
<dd>It is that overreaching on the part of the "aluminium" advocates that causes most of the problems here. I don't much care which is used in the title here; I do object to misleading claims about usage, and to claims that whatever we use here determines what we use in the rest of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 12:53, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I've said, this dispute over the spelling of things is getting out of hand! Instead making pages 'locked', we should just accept that not everyone is going to say everything or spell everything the same. For example, the word Herb. In most countries we pronounce it herb. But it seems in America they all pronounce it as 'Erb. What happened to the 'h'? Another example is Mom/mum. British spell it mum, Americans mom. Just because of that do we have to create a dispute &amp; lock a page away so the public can't use it? If we do, I think we really have to ask ourselves if it's really worth it? Most people are going to notice the different spelling &amp; alter the word when their making notes or printing it out etc. But then again, most people don't really care if one letter is missing! I personally spell it aluminium. But just because of this I'm not going to detract from other's fun &amp; making this the best site ever. Honestly, if we spent half our time working on the dead ends &amp; stubs on this site, this site would be better than ever before. But that's just my opinion. P.S: (I didn't find your comment about Adolf Hitler offensive, just highly irrelevant to the topic).</p>

<p>I can't believe the underlying argument has anything to do with helping readers learn about aluminium (which because of an historical fluke- likely a "typo"- is called aluminum by the general population in North America). If this has been about creating some sort of a precedent for using Google keyword searches as cites of word usage in future articles then...</p>

<p>Currently, there has still been no compelling proof or reasons to explain why information about web search results shouldn't be included in the spelling section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the proof that Google statistics regarding English usage are in any way biased or false? I have seen a lot of irrelevant dithering about how Google shows that there are false statements on the web, but I have <i>not</i> seen even a scrap of hard evidence that Google statistics on <i>usage</i> are in any way necessarily flawed, false, or irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is the compelling reason that, given that the relevance of this information is disputed, that it should therefore be excluded from the article? Don't we owe it to our readers to acknowledge that there is information, the information is disputed, but we respect them enough to make up their own minds about how useful is. Why do need to infantilize them by excluding verifiable, factual, and relevant information on the grounds that one can conjecture a situation in which this information might not be completely unbiased.</li>
</ul>
<p>But yet, my latest attempt at a very weak statement about search engine results has been reverted under the guise that there is some kind of consensus that this information needs to be suppressed. I don't see any such consensus. Those of use who are in favor of including this information have been willing to compromise and alter the wording and add caveats, but those opposing it have been obstinate and completely unreasonable. Where is the spirit of compromise? What happened to the spirit of working together to find common ground? Blanket, instantaneous reverts are a violation of both the spirit and letter of Wikipedia policy. Please let's just try to work together to find a compromise solution that will satisfy everyone. Otherwise, we're just going to get into more revert wars and the page will get locked again.

Google is not a reputable publication - it is a search engine. It is uncitable because it is completely dynamic, and you can only take a snapshot at a given instant and infer yourself that one is more popular than the other. You could say the tallies are 15,200,000 and 6,420,000 (as mentioned in this talk page), and cite Google. I could then check for myself and see that the results are 35,400,000 and 13,300,000 (as I just did). If no-one can even get the same results from the same source, the source is not a valid reference. I have no problems with including a valid reference (although I fail to see the relevance), but Google is not one. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartH_a780.html" title="User:StuartH">StuartH</a> 03:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The numbers change but the proportions do not. Search for "aluminium" and "aluminum" on any general web search engine and compare the results. You will invariably find that results for "aluminum" outnumber those for "aluminium" by at least 2 to 1. The idea that somehow this data is a fluke and does not represent the reality of proportion of usage on the web does not really have any evidence to support it. I would think that the fact that "aluminum" results outnumber "aluminium" results on the web would not be subject to debate on its factual accuracy at this point.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, a popular search engine is by its very nature a <i>reputable publication</i> and a primary source. The fact that it's the most popular search engine in the world makes it <i>reputable</i> in the most basic way: it is held in high regard by a large number of people. If it weren't, it wouldn't be the most popular search engine in the world. And it's quite obviously a <i>publication</i> in the most essential meaning of the word: information disseminated to the public. The collection of search result quantities from Google quite clearly falls under the "research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources" which is "strongly encouraged". <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 04:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it's really that relevant to say that 'aluminium' is less popular than 'aluminum', it should be easy to find a citable reference for it. I have never seen, and do not ever expect to see "Google" appear in a list of citations, and any reputable publication which addresses usage would perform a much more scientific test than a simple Googling. It is clear from this article that 'aluminum' is the usage preferred in North America, and 'aluminium' is the usage preferred by IUPAC and most of the rest of the world. Anyone concerned about usage can just read about U.S. English or other topics on the English language, but a decision has been made to stick to IUPAC conventions so there is no reason to throw in half-arsed statistics on usage to prove a point. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartH_a780.html" title="User:StuartH">StuartH</a> 05:58, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Google is a helpful search engine, an index of publicly viewable web pages. Google doesn't offer its keyword search service as a scientifically rigorous or linguistically helpful guide or reference to word usage patterns in any population and there is no evidence Google was ever designed to do this. Any similarity between two such services is at most a fleeting illusion. Relative to web pages with content containing keywords indexed by Google, it is not a primary source, but a secondary index. Its raw search data is not a peer-reviewed secondary source.</p>
<p>Since Google is neither offered nor designed as a usage reference or guide to comparative linguistics (it's a web keyword index), including any raw Google keyword "hit" data in a WP article's text about comparative, linguistic word usage requires original research, so it's not citable under WP policy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a linguist's published (and perhaps peer-reviewed) commentary on specific Google keyword statistical output as it might relate to some particular usage would be an acceptable citation, whether or not that linguist's interpretation was meaningful. Finally, as most of us know, Google is invaluable as a pointer for finding citable sources and raw content for articles. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a>'s notions of encyclopedic sources along with scholarly methodologies for identifying and describing linguistic usage metrics, as he has expressed them on this talk page, are deeply flawed. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 07:02, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You claimed it was misleading; it wasn't at all. The only reason you think it's misleading is because you would judge it as the wrong answer. It's entirely possible that people who write on Harry Potter refer to it, when they do so in the long form, as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone". I think that abbreviated names are a most relevant example; there is no right way to abbreviate a title, and hence popular consensus, as can be indicated by a Google search, is the only guide to correctness, just like for the spelling of aluminum.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 12:03, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erm... I think you are confused. Firstly we are not talking about abbreviations. The book and film are ONLY known as <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> in the United States. In every other country in the world (including Canada) it is known as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> as the authour intended, even when translated (e.g. <i>Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal</i> in Spanish) it is the former. - However what we find when we do a raw Google hit count is that the former outnumbers the latter by 5:1. You are correct this ONLY proves <b>these specific words, in this order</b> are more common on the Internet. Nothing else can be determined from the hit count because the context cannot be judged. For instance how many times do authors write about the book say something like "... <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> (also known as <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> in the United States ...". Now the point is that the context of the use of these words cannot be judged from merely doing a hit count. Some naive observers may conclude because the former occurs more frequently than the latter on the Internet that it is more common genrrally throughout the world, and indeed this is what some people were trying to prove with the Google hit counts for aluminium/aluminum. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 12:41, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not known as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> in Spain; it's known as <i>Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal</i>. Whatever that translates to is irrelevant to the normal English name. If it says "... <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> (also known as <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> in the United States ...", then both hits should show up, but there are at least 1.5 million pages that say <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> and never <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>. This is even less ambiguous in the aluminum situation. There are serious context issues in saying that there are 300 million speakers of English in India; why are you so quick to toss that number out (and assume they all support Aluminium over Aluminum), but unwilling to let a citied provable fact into the article; put a caveat on it, but let the readers decide for themselves. (I seriously doubt context is much of an issue for words like Aluminum; 95% of the hits are going to be for actual uses of the word.)--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 13:03, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The Google test applied to Harry Potter doesn't go far to prove whether or how far the Google test is biased in favour of American spellings without evidence of the books sales under different names. If we knew under what English title the book was actually sold in India etc and had some idea of the sales figures, you could then compare the sales ratio to the Google ratio and this comparison would provide some evidence of the Google bias (or lack thereof). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanward_c6b7.html" title="User:Danward">Danward</a> 18:38, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes you are definitely confused. Again - it is ONLY known as <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> in the USA and so when people who are not from the USA use those words they are either appealing to an American audience in some way or making a point about the American usage (as per the Wikipedia article at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_619d.html" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a> for instance). This Google stat is an even clearer demonstration of the very points I was making. Firstly that contextually ambiguous hit counts of themselves have no value and secondly that the American dominance of the Internet skews the figures. Of the 300 million or so converstational English speakers in India few of them produce websites that you might read, but they learn British English (<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_English_ff92.html#Influences:_British_and_American" title="Indian English">Indian_English#Influences:_British_and_American</a>) which uses <i>aluminium</i> exclusively, despite what the 1 million google hit count for [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=aluminum+site:uk" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=aluminum+site:uk" rel="nofollow">"aluminum" site:uk</a>] might suggest. Can you explain 1 million hit counts for a word we don't normally use? I have explained it above and can't be bothered to repeat myself.

<dd>According to <a href="http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=eng" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=eng" rel="nofollow">ethnologue</a> there are 309,352,280 English speakers as a first language. Offline The World Almanac 2004 lists 341 million. The total for Canada and the US combined is 227 million. North America has a two-thirds majority then so on English language Wiki I'd think it should either be title "Aluminum or Aluminium" or even just "Aluminum." This is not an argument from Google or even solely the Internet really.</dd>

<dd>I did become aware of this through "stupid edit wars", but I find their characterization dismissive. Being annoyed by having to use a form of English that is not standard for the majority of the world's English speakers is not "silly" or "stupid." Wikipedia has articles for <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billionaire.html" title="Billionaire">billionaires</a>, or so I presume, yet most of the world I believe considers a billion to be 10 to the power of 12. Hence there are no billionaires and Wiki should never use the term again. However that's ridiculous. Because billionaire, rather than milliardaire, is a real word that's by most English speakers. Aluminum is also a real word used by most English speakers.(66.5% is dominant enough to be most. That said "aluminium" would likely be correct for Wiki outside English)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>Most people outside the US don't speak English. Also this case Canada and the Philippines were also relevant. Unless you can show me the Philippines, who was never ruled by Britain AFAIK, uses the British spelling. And as can be clearly shown in several ways the majority of English speakers use North American forms on this issue. The only way you defended otherwise was to say "200 million Indians" speak English, but this is not what most evidence indicates. Nor is "aluminium" universally used in Indian English I've found. Anyway Britain ruled India, but the vast majority of Asian Indians stuck with their own languages. Further as mentioned a search I did at IUPAC itself had "aluminum" as predominant. This was not Google, this was the site you were using as support. All that said I accept the ruling y'all made in this manner. I don't like it and I feel, for an English speaking article, it is a poorly conceived compromise. Still I recognize that calling it "Aluminium or Aluminum" is awkward or upsetting. Also that I just came here a couple days ago so have no right to judge....Now then to get to what matters can anyone find back up for <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Needham_da69.html" title="Joseph Needham">Joseph Needham</a> saying the early Chinese used aluminium? All I could find was that find article already linked to, but I know I've heard the story before.

<p>Ethnologue listed 508 million English speakers overall when including second-language. This figure was for 1999. In that group it states that 52% of Philipinos know English as a second language and considering who ruled them that would likely be US English. Checking only Philippino news sites on Google News I find no entry mentioning "aluminium", but a few for "aluminum." So that plausibly adds in least 40 million, it would be more than that but I'll agree some Filippinos may use aluminium, to the 227 million. That totals 262 million and so remains a majority, albeit a radically reduced one. I hope this isn't too irritating or snotty. I did mostly try to use academic sources. Added to that I think <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfur.html" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> really should be <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulphur.html" title="Sulphur">sulphur</a>, as it's not unusual to see that spelling in North America, so I can be contrarian in everything:)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>I guess you're right. Many things at Wikipedia are always going to be biased or outright silly. It's a big community so that's unavoidable.

<dd>Sorry, but I couldn't resist. I tried to make sure to spell it the official IUPAC way in the article. Also on reading it it turned out there other issues I was interested in. Alas I couldn't find much on the discoveries in 1974 that Needham indicated were possibly linked to Chinese aluminum, but it was discussed in books I've read. Also I think Oersted was getting short shrift in this entry so played him up a bit. Even if it's false he is generally recognized as the discoverer of aluminum/aluminium/muinimula/munimula so it seemed worth mentioning.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>At this point I'm satisfied I guess. The changes I made with both spellings capitalized and the IUPAC table, which has both listed with neither in parenthesis or asterixes, didn't get reverted. Only thing I'd add is for it to be, or stay, "aluminum" in articles dealing with use in North American industry or fiction. (Like the recent edit with the Star Trek movie, Doohan played a Scottish character but he's Canadian, and maybe some others.) I doubt I'll see the word used much in articles I edit, but if I see it spelled "aluminium" in North-American articles I'll remember to correct it for appropriateness. Although I'll try to avoid any rancorousness about that as I'd imagine it's generally done in innocence. If it comes up in any British, French(or former colony of either) article I'll switch it to aluminium. Whichever switch is appropriate. I'm not expecting this to come up much though.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 07:09, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And I'm not some arrogant pro-American caricature. If this were an article about a British or Australian topic I wouldn't dream of changing it. I'll try to remember to spell it, or change it, to "aluminium" if the issue comes up in any Europe or Australasian related topic. I said I would not alter anything else at this point, even stating I was satisfied. However you can't handle that the majority of English speakers getting much of any recognition. (If you doubt that make the effort I did to prove the case) So you whine even though I've accepted a compromise I actually find slightly silly for the English language version. Because it came with even accepting I can't mention the Philippines where the majority speak English and it's an official. This compromise I've come to accept, but you can't. Yeah you're petty. All you've really accomplished is the ability to bully some people here into giving up, but I'm not such a person.

There it's like at the IUPAC chart now and there's no capitalization problems either. I also made sure to be consistent in calling them former US colonies or possessions. "Dependencies" was maybe too benign. It's not an entirely satisfying compromise, but it's okay. I know some are likely annoyed with me getting in on this or consider the whole thing silly. However it's not really. The compromise before I came was largely based on the idea North American English was bad or wrong and that's why it got so heated. Ultimately all English we speak is some descendant from the seventeenth century model. Still I learned some and toward the end I think I've tried to simply be factual and based on IUPAC procedures. I'm pretty glad if I made some alterations that improved matters. Especially on mentioning the story of the Chinese possibly having Aluminium,aluminum as I think no other Wiki has that. (Sadly no one could add anything on it) Hopefully nothing further will draw my attention here.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>Unless we refer to every single other element by their symbols, I don't see the need for such an extreme approach.

<dd>Actually I'm personally rather inconsistent on the spelling issue. There are times, like the case of aluminum, where the American useage somehow feels more "right" to me. Or in least I don't see how either is any more correct than the other. However in other things I think the British way does make more sense. For example "petrol" makes more sense to me as it is petroleum. "Gas" is something else entirely. Likewise "sulphur" looks more right to me than "sulfur." Likewise "humour" kind of fits to me. However I prefer the Americanized "gray" to "grey", even though many American writers prefer the British spelling.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<p>Sigh. This is getting very tiresome. If you insist on maintaining pointless statements then they will have to be qualified. English has many sub-dialects, all of which are different. In the US/Canada people are brought up with the American-English sub-dialect. This is different to other sub-dialects. People in the US/Canada are, therefore, native speakers of <i>American-English</i>, not some kind of unqualified "English". The only people who could possibly regard themselves as natively speaking "English" (without qualification) would be those brought up in England (NB, not Scotland or Wales) where you would have to say "English English" (which is clearly a nonsense) to describe their dialect. Personally I regard the whole concept of "native" speakers as contrived twaddle. However, the statement, as I put it, is accurate. Any other variation is not. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 12:20, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your edits were a non sequitur because Canadians do not speak <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>. Furhermore, it is when you consider English as a whole that the combination of native speakers of English in the United States and Canada, excluding sizable portions whose native language is French or Spanish plus a whole lot of other languages, that form a majority of all the native speakers of English in all its varieties. Sure, lots of other people have English as a second language; they generally are not very influential in the development of the language, however.</dd>
<dd>The statement only needs to be there at all because of the "most English-speaking nations" statement in the same paragraph.

<dd>Exactly, it shouldn't be there - any of it. You can't have your cake and eat it. As you have pointed out, different people in different parts of North America speak differently. There is no uniform "majority" of <i>x</i> million that somehow outnumbers any other uniform group in another part of the world. The phrase "wherein reside the majority native speakers of English" is contentious (and offensive to a certain extent) because the word "native" is impossible to qualify/quantify. The sentence would make sense without that contention and would still explain that there is a difference between certain versions of English.

<dd>What is "English"? It is inaccurate to portray English as having an "average" or a "standard" form. All but one dialect of English has a qualifying adjective (eg. "American English", "Australian English" etc). You could perhaps say that <i>American-English native speakers</i> form the largest bloc of the English sub-dialects. But you cannot say that they are native speakers of (unqualified) "standard" English. Only English people can be native speakers of -English- (although that does not mean it is the "standard" form) and what they speak is different to the American variant. I've ignored the pie chart... the source itself discusses the fallibility of the method so it should not be referred to as gospel. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 01:13, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The variety of English spoken in England is called "British English", or when it is necessary to distinguish it from Welsh and Scottish English, "English English" or "English as spoken in England", or any of various admittedly awkward but specific terms. "English" without a qualifying adjective means any form of English—people who use the word "English" to mean only English English are being laughably provincial. Synchronically speaking, there is nothing special about English English: it is just a minority dialect of the language called English. The idea that that only people from England can be called native speakers of English is a ridiculous assertion that runs counter to both logic and the reality of how the term "native speaker of English" is used by both laypeople and experts in the field. I have never been to England but anyone who tries to tell me I a not a native speaker of English is mistaken. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 02:04, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This brings up another question. Which "pure" form of English english is the purest? English as spoken in London? What part of London? What's wrong with Liverpool? Is it Shakespearean English? If the answer is Shakespearean, the purest form of that English is undoubtedly spoken in the isolated communities on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, in the United States. As for me, I say the English that endures is the only true test--and as anyone who has ever watched the Star Trek movies knows, in the twenty-fifth century, the metal is pronounced "aluminum". <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 03:30, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no such thing as "English English", that is a completely absurd misnomer. You don't describe a red object as "red red" to distinguish it from a slightly orange-red object. Having to use the same adjective twice to describe something is illogical in any academic field. And I am afraid you are wrong to suggest that it runs counter to the reality of how the term is used, at least outside the US. As for what is "pure"... surely a form that could be understood by everyone else speaking various <i>minority</i> variants and one that encompassed the entire lexicon of all dialects put together? If so I would posit that only English spoken with received pronounciation and based on a full Oxford English dictionary would fit. Other variants often cannot be understood by other English speakers in other parts of the world. An (anecdotal) example of this problem is the US screening of the film <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trainspotting_%28film%29.html" title="Trainspotting (film)">Trainspotting</a> which was edited because the American-English speaking audience could not understand the Scottish-English speaking actors.

<dd>Perhaps you don't have a good dictionary?&#160;:p "Provincial" means "of the province(s)", i.e. a part of a nation distant from the capital/homeland. As the source nation of the language the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a> cannot use a "provincial" variant of their own language (although they can/do have regional dialects of their own). Its secondary meaning of "unsophisticated" would apply to dialects which do not share a completely inclusive vocabulary (as per the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>) and have unusual pronounciation (eg. Southern US American English). What I think you mean is defined here: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_English_dc24.html" title="Standard English">Standard English</a>. Thus I think you could say <i>"wherein reside the majority native speakers of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_English_dc24.html" title="Standard English">Standard English</a>"</i> and still be reasonably accurate.

<dd>Well, "of the provinces" is open to interpretation, too. Who determines what is a province? The Romans considered England one of the provinces, and the babbling ("bar-bar-bar") of the natives ("barbarians") not even a language at all. Personally, using the same standards as the Romans, I think England is an American province, seeing as so many Americans have settled there, so "Standard English" is, therefore, what is spoken where I live, in the American South, where what I consider to be the first speakers of what is now my own Standard English settled. I therefore say that "English English" is an unusual pronunciation of my own Standard English, as witness the thousands more movies and TV programs which are in American English shown all over the world, and therefore English English, or British English, is variant. Please explain to me why I should think otherwise. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 02:08, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing illogical about "English English". There are two completely separate entries for the word "English" in a dictionary: one as a noun meaning the language and one as an adjective meaning of or related to England. It is true the two words are historically related, but that is no reason why one can't be used to modify the other, especially in a case such as the one at hand, where just "English" alone is clearly insufficient to disambiguate. The situation isn't unique to the word "English" either: one can easily imagine a situation where "orange orange" makes perfect sense. Nevertheless, the point is effectively mooted by the reality that "English English" is actually a term that is actually used by experts in the field. The term "English English" is used extensively by sociolinguists and dialectologists of all national stripes. For example, David Crystal, a British linguist, uses the term in his reference book <i>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language</i>.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry you have been trolled into responding to claims about language "purity", but your reply is just is as nonsensical as the original claims. First of all, arguments about what is "pure" are completely nonsensical. There is nothing pure or impure about the English language: the unqualified characterization does not apply to languages. Second, your claims about received pronunciation are not based on any evidence. What's so special about received pronunciation? It doesn't maintain more distinctions than other dialects: indeed it certainly levels some distinctions that other dialects maintain: for example "court" and "caught" are homophones in RP, but not in American English. As for the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, although it is respected for being encyclopedic, it is by no means an exhaustive list of the words of English. For example, page 119 of the aforementioned <i>Cambridge Encyclopedia</i>, lists 12 words between "saba" and "sabbaticalness" that <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i> has that the OED lacks. Finally, ignoring the fact that RP and the OED do not meet your own crieteria of being understood by everyone else and encompassing the entire lexicon of all dialects put together, the proposition is a ridiculous one: no one knows all the words in a dictionary, and there are plenty of words used in other dialects that are not used in British English, including in English English. See for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_English_words_not_used_in_British_English_fcbb.html" title="List of American English words not used in British English">List of American English words not used in British English</a>.</dd>

Even the people who make it wouldn't argue that. English English is just as flawed, incomplete, illogical, and difficult to understand as any other dialect.

<dd>I explored both meanings of the word "provincial" because both could be applicable given your general derogatory tone. You may have meant only one, but I find your reasoning provincial in both respects. Eg. <i>"...it is well-known that with the ubiquity of American cultural and media exports, American English is just as well understood around the world"</i> Is that so?!</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am sure the term you use is very useful in the linguistic academic community. However, it is offensive to lay people in England. You are right that English is not "defined" or delimited by the OED. As you say language evolves and a dictionary cannot be synchronic when it has a policy of letting words "bed-down" for a time. (I imagine www.urbandictionary.com must be really depressing for dictionary compilers.) I do not think dictionaries are made with the intention that everyone will know all the words. However, they are supposed to be written in such a way that anyone speaking the basics of the language can learn other bits of the language. Without a baseline source we might as well be speaking babble.</dd>
<dd><i>The fact that England is the source nation of the English language does not bestow any special status on the English spoken there.</i> And there I think we will have to agree to disagree. The roots are important to the branches for as long as the tree is alive.</dd>
<dd>Further, my use of the film Trainspotting as an anecdote was supposed to illustrate that the branches sometimes cannot understand one-another, but the root always can. Unfortunately I can only substantiate this with my own experience - I can understand both Scottish and American dialects and they can understand mine.</dd>
<dd><i>"English" by itself means any form of English, "Standard" or otherwise.</i> In which case it would not just be "native speakers" - which is contrived (I think that's why <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> was mentioned) - and would require qualification. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 12:40, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument isn't based on relevance. Like I said in my edit summary, there may well be good reasons for including both of those statements, but of the two of them, the <i>native speakers</i> one is clearly much more relevant than the <i>most nations</i> argument.</dd>

<dd><i>Al-uhm-in-yum</i>. Because the last two are so short I think its four syllables not five. American English - to my ears - sounds like <i>Ah-LOO-mi-num</i>. Quite distinct.

<p>I'm not so sure of this. I grew up in Ontario and never once heard the world "aluminium". Does it vary from province to province?</p>

<dd>I think the US spelling is probably much more common - in my experience, we use mainly US scientific texts at Canadian universities. In my 3 yrs of chemistry at the University of Victoria, it was only referred to as aluminum in spelling (although one British prof I had referred to it as aluminium in speech). None of the supplementary texts published by the university (lab texts, etc) used the spelling aluminum. My highschool science texts used "aluminum" although my Grade 12 chem teacher felt that the Brits used "aluminium" b/c the word "aluminum" is trade-marked in Britian (which I believe it is, by Alcan) - although the article would tend to indicate that is not the reason aluminium is used in Britain. So in my personal experience, I think it is safe to say Canadians spell it (and generally say it) as "aluminum."<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 05:12, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, everybody:</p>
<p>I have put quite a bit of care and attention in trying to simplify the following two sentences, sticking to the facts:</p>
<p><i>In the United States and English-speaking Canada, the spelling aluminium is largely unknown[citation needed], and the spelling aluminum predominates[citation needed]. Elsewhere in other English-speaking countries the spelling aluminium predominates.</i></p>
<p><i>The -ium spelling is the most widespread version around the world. The word is aluminium in French, Aluminium in German, and identical or similar forms are used in many other languages. Consequently it is the more common of the two spelling methods, as shown by the enclosed list of other-language Wikipedia articles.</i></p>
<p>This is what I came up with as a substitute:</p>
<p><i>In the United States and English-speaking Canada, the spelling aluminum predominates. The word is aluminium in British English and French and Aluminium in German.</i></p>
<p>My changes were reverted, so I'd like to find out why, since some of the statements in the longer excerpt above seem not to be valid or at least unsourced, or at least controversial.</p>
<p>Any comments?</p>
<p>Sincerely, your friend, <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeLouis_ac0a.html" title="User:GeorgeLouis">GeorgeLouis</a> 15:40, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This section has been reworked several times so, like it says at the top of the page, tread lightly. In the first paragraph you removed the [citation needed] tag for an unproven statement, which you kept. You then deleted a statement which was sourced in the next paragraph, most of which you then went on to remove. Your substitute has two unsourced statements the second of which, by omission, is misleading. As I said in the edit comment, check the edit box when editing and look at the list of other-language versions of this article. Look at the proportion using the <b>-ium</b> ending.

<dd>Wiki-Ed seems to be confused about what statement I was saying was unreferenced. I’m not disputing use in other languages at all. I am only talking about use in International English, something which the above statement does not touch on. Beetstra on my talk page asked where I would suggest finding a citation for this. This claim is actually easy to substantiate for British English via the <a href="http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">British National Corpus</a> <a href="http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=aluminium" class="external autonumber" title="http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=aluminium" rel="nofollow">[17]</a><a href="http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=aluminum" class="external autonumber" title="http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=aluminum" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. The other countries are less easy. Results from the International Corpus of English for Hong Kong, East Africa, India, and Singapore are slightly harder at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice/avail.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice/avail.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>--they are downloadable but there is no on-web search interface. The New Zealand corpus is available only on CD-ROM and the ICE corpora for Australia, Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Malaysia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the USA are not yet available. The <a href="http://americannationalcorpus.org/" class="external text" title="http://americannationalcorpus.org/" rel="nofollow">American National Corpus</a> is available only for a $75 fee. There may be easier ways to get a citation, but I haven't found one yet. I doubt there'd even be an entry in the English Usage book I have at work, but I'll check later in the day. —<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 14:13, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Edgar181 added references, but his source does not address Canada and is not sufficient on the others—it just says 'aluminium' is "in use elsewhere in the world" and does not explain the usage in the U.S. other than by the American Chemical Society, information which was already included in the article (at one point if not now). —<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 14:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you that it doesn't address Canada. But it does address usage in the rest of the world, and though it doesn't explicitly state the US usage (aside from the ACS) it's certainly implied. But anyway, I've added a separate reference that specifically addresses the US use. --<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgar181_7e9b.html" title="User:Edgar181">Ed</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User_talk%7EEdgar181_fd91.html" title="User talk:Edgar181">Edgar181</a>) 16:18, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ah, I think I see where <i>you</i> have got confused. This is not about "international English"; at no point does the article say that it is. Your argument seems to be based on verification of usage in countries in which English is the first/official language. I think that is somewhat contrived and, as you will see from the discussions above (all 15 pages), this debate is not just about first-language English-speaking countries. In any case, Edgar181's source is quite unambiguous: "elsewhere" means everywhere. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 15:22, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"at no point does the article say that it is"...? But what the exact sentence I said was unsourced says is: "Elsewhere in other English-speaking countries the spelling 'aluminium' predominates." That sentence <i>is</i> talking about English-speaking countries, and that is the reference which was unsourced. (Though I see no reason to rule out other countries where English is widely spoken as an additional language or as a first language by a minority of the population.) The Los Alamos reference is not specific enough to use as primary evidence, because it would incorrectly imply that Canada also uses the <i>aluminium</i> spelling, and the World Wide Words article is itself unsourced. Now, the question is: Can the sentences in this paragraph be backed up with specific evidence? The answer: <i>yes they can.</i> I already did it for British English, and backing it up for the other countries only requires access to the right datasets. The above reference I provided also gives evidence for the sentence you deleted a month ago (or whenever it was) which you said was improve: that <i>aluminum</i> is almost unattested (in Great Britain, at least; I am unsure whether Northern Ireland is included in the corpus study).</dd>
<dd>Now, are the sentences in the paragraph phrased in the most suitable manner, and are corpora the best way to back up their statements? Perhaps not. It might be better to simply expand upon (and source) the <i>previous</i> paragraph to say something like that in dictionaries following American<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/52/A0235200.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/52/A0235200.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/aluminum" class="external autonumber" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/aluminum" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> or Canadian<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> usage give only the spelling <i>aluminum</i> in the root entry and that <i>aluminium</i> is present only in a separate entry stating it is a "chiefly British" variant<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/A0234900.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/A0234900.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a><a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/aluminium" class="external autonumber" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/aluminium" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, and that dictionaries following non-U.S./Canadian usage similarly mark <i>aluminum</i> as "chiefly U.S."<a href="http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dev_dict&amp;field-12668446=aluminium&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dev_dict&amp;field-12668446=aluminium&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. A statement such as that is quite easy to reference.</dd>
<dd>The only reason I see to offer corpora as evidence is that they would be a legitimate academic source that would fulfill the same role as the Google Test that has been so disparaged. And unless I am reading the history wrong, the desire to use the Google Test seems to be the only reason the statement about dictionaries isn't enough and why this paragraph is even in the article currently at all. —<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 16:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I saw a reference like that elsewhere which was problematic—it said <i>aluminium</i> was "Brit/Cdn" and <i>aluminum</i> was "Nor Am." Confusion! I'm not an expert on Canadian English and don't have handy access to a Canadian English dictionary which is proven to be reliable; I see rather unofficial sites like <a href="http://www.petebevin.com/archives/2004/07/22/canadian_spelling_quiz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.petebevin.com/archives/2004/07/22/canadian_spelling_quiz.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a><a href="http://www3.telus.net/linguisticsissues/BritishCanadianAmerican.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.telus.net/linguisticsissues/BritishCanadianAmerican.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>; comments from Canadians on this page indicate <i>aluminum</i> is favored, but it would be nice to have an official-ish source like the Oxford Dictionary of Canadian English--assuming it's correct; I've read criticisms by Canadians of Canadian dictionaries.—<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I like the compromise you have suggested, there would still be a problem determining how many references to include for countries other than the US and Canada. Trying to differentiate between "English speaking countries" and countries in which English is spoken as an additional language is rather imprecise. Should we include countries where it is "official" but only spoken by a minority, like India? Or should we include countries where it is not official and there are a lot of second-language speakers, like the US? Up until now we were assuming Commonwealth English countries (aside from Canada) used the <i>-ium</i> spelling and other countries where English was spoken (one way or another) also used that spelling. This was illustrated by the prevalence of that spelling in the other languages spoken in those countries (as per the list above).
<dl>
<dd>Not sure the spelling in the other languages is the best guideline—the country we're pretty sure about this on, Canada, has French speakers who use <i>aluminium</i> but not English speakers. So while I do believe most/all other Commonwealth countries use <i>aluminium</i>, the spelling in other local languages is weak evidence at best. —<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would indeed suggest to get it all referenced while we are at it, it would indeed keep people from having conflicts with what is written on the page. The only trouble is to find good references (is there a language-wikiproject that could help us here?).

<dd>The World Wide Words article seemed to <i>use</i> good sources, but didn't identify them all (such as when it says "a database of newspapers"—which database?). Anyway, it might work just to find US, Canadian, and UK sources (such as the corpora I linked above), and then link to some source which just generally says Commonwealth countries tend to follow UK spellings. —<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what I have read, they are both common spellings. "Aluminium" seems to be used more in the sciences while "aluminum" seems to be used more in general/overall use. "Aluminum" seems to be used by American science associations such as NASA and the AAAS and turns up 89.6 million sites on Google, "aluminium" turns up 72 million. American Heritage dictionary says "aluminium" is 'chiefly' a 'British' term <a href="http://www.answers.com/aluminium&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/aluminium&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, but McGraw Hill, Houghton Mifflin, and some other publications <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/aluminium" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/aluminium" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> seem to call it "aluminum". Overall, aluminium seems to be the more British spelling used by some American English companies/orginizations/people/publications, while "aluminum" seems to be the American spelling that has become more widespread especially as the spelling for the element (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=aluminum+element&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=aluminum+element&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> v. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=aluminium+element&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=aluminium+element&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> in site numbers). Considering even some British organizations seem to use "aluminum", this is one of the few cases that I personally think that we should use the non-British English spelling. ~ <a href="../../../c/a/f/User%7ECafzal_2115.html" title="User:Cafzal">clearthought</a> 01:53, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aluminium is the spelling preferred in other languages. As this is English-language Wikipedia that shouldn't matter, but we get a fair amount of "English as a second language" editors. Also the "ium" spelling is accepted by the British and when controversy arises on spelling Wikipedia usually goes by British spelling, in my experience, as a way to "make up" for the fact it most often uses American spelling. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color.html" title="Color">Color</a> and <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">Skepticism</a> being notable exceptions as there has been debate, but no switching to the British Commonwealth standard at present.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>I don't get it... Why do some people have to make it a US English vs. UK English issue (by the way, it's not exlusively UK's English, but also "Queen's English" or "Commonwealth English" or "Oxford English". It's not as if it "belonged" only to the British), or even a "spelling" issue??? The original word (regardless of geography, long before there was English, and waaaaaaaay longer before there were any USA with people to change spellings) is Aluminium, from the Latin name of the same element. So, there is NO "extra i", because it is supposed to BE there. Period. Also, the correctness of any one spelling is not determined by something as trivial and nonsensical as the number of occurences of it that a Google search returns. Say, if suddenly we were to find that "cuz" appears in more websites than "because" (or "Gawd" over "God", for that matter), does that mean we should change the way we spell these words? I believe the English Wikipedia should reflect English spelling (as in "World's English") and not be determined only in terms of exclusively US cosiderations, spelling or otherwise. Thank you.</p>

<dd>You must not have read the actual article "By 1812, Davy had settled on <b>aluminum</b>, which, as other sources note, matches its Latin root." Although <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm" rel="nofollow">another source</a> says "Sir Humphry made a bit of a mess of naming this new element, at first spelling it alumium (this was in 1807) then changing it to aluminum, and finally settling on aluminium in 1812." An "aluminium" company agrees stating "Davy called the metal alumium which has the -ium ending adopted for most metallic elements. But later he decided to change the name to aluminum, and this name was picked up by Americans."<a href="http://www.alpema.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alpema.org/" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> Either way your statement "the original is Aluminium" is incorrect.

<p>The reasons why the page is here is that according to the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28chemistry%29_031e.html#Element_names" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)">naming conventions</a>, names of elements should follow the <s>IUPAC</s> international spelling, so the page is at Aluminium, not Aluminum. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomic1609_371b.html" title="User:Atomic1609">Atomic1609</a> 01:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe this shouldn't go here, but I've noticed a huge number of erroneous pages. I'm staying out of the debate, but since wikipedia for the moment has decided on -ium, shouldn't all pages with aluminium alloys and alluminium based products be corrected? eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=aluminum&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=aluminum&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangl_9f4f.html" title="User:Triangl">Triangl</a> 13:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not necessarily. American corporations use the word "aluminum" and there was even an American car called <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminum_%28automobile%29.html" title="Aluminum (automobile)">Aluminum</a>. It is <b>not</b> a misspelling, I'm maybe willing to accept that it is merely an optional spelling used in North America and former US dependencies. To switch to "ium" in articles of US/US-dependency concerns would be a mistake and I feel a form of cultural imperialism. However I see many articles there where the "aluminum" spelling is being used inappropriately so good call. I used to try to change to the "ium" spelling in all articles where it was appropriate.

<dd>Bear in mind that a decision on the title of this article/spelling in this article does not dictate how the word should be spelled throughout Wikipedia. If the article is primarily about an American subject, it should be spelled the American way. Likewise for British or other country focuses. Where the article is neutral, go for consistency and in line with the original author.</dd>
<dd>Example - an article about Hershey's chocolate might say "The bars are wrapped in aluminum foil", whereas one about Cadbury's chocolate might say "The bars are wrapped in aluminium foil" - both are the correct spelling for that particular article, regardless of how <i>this</i> article is spelled. An article about alumin(i)um cans might have either spelling, depending on the prevalent style and/or the original major contributor's preference - and that's ok too.</dd>
<dd>All in all, though, it might be easier to call it tin foil and tin cans&#160;;)</dd>

<dd>Yes yes, quite right all! Just checking! Oh but you couldn't call them tin. Tin is an element in itself. therefor calling them tin cans when theyre made of aluminium would be like saying "magnesium bars" instead of "iron bars"! <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangl_9f4f.html" title="User:Triangl">Triangl</a> 16:16, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article reads:<br />
<i>In the United States, the spelling aluminium is largely unknown, and the spelling aluminum predominates.</i><br />
As an American, I can tell you that the spelling of "aluminium" is well know, just not well liked. Like "centre." It grates on the nerves, but everyone knows what it means, and doesn't interpret it as a misspelling, just the way the discoverer wanted to call it in the end.<br />
