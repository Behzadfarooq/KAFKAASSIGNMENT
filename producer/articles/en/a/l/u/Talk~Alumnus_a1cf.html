<p>The OED claims that Alumn is a "slangy casualism" and recommends the use of <i>Alum</i> instead, also claiming that this spelling is more common. Google seems to confirm this, although I haven't checked whether the results for <i>Alum</i> and <i>Alumn</i> refer to what the article is about. If they do, we should move the article. <a href="../../../k/o/k/User%7EKokiri_6058.html" title="User:Kokiri">Kokiri</a> 21:34, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Alumnus" gets significantly more Google hits than "Alumn". "Alum" gets far more than either, but most seem to be other meanings (to do with <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">Aluminium</a>, for instance), and not this meaning. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 11:28, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>For this meaning, "alum" is definitely more common than "alumn." However, there's already an article on <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alum.html" title="Alum">alum</a>. Why not move this article to "alumnus"?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> 21:10, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Both "alum" and "alumn" are informal. But "alumnus" and "alumna" are sex-specific. So I have moved the article to "alumnus/a". As for "alum" <i>vs.</i> "alumn", I get alumni newsletters from several schools and colleges, and I've never seen the term "alumn". Google searches on the phrases "college alum" and "college alumn" give 6170 <i>vs.</i> 134 hits, so I think it's fair to say that the usage "alumn" is rare -- which makes it bizarre that it was used as the article title. By far the most common term of all is "alumni", but (a) this is a plural (which Wikipedia articles names are not supposed to be) and (b) it is not sex-neutral. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 21:34, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Alumnus" <i>is</i> sex-neutral.

<dd>Yes, I understand your point. However, it seems to me clearer and less contentious to make it explicit that the article is talking about both male and female alumni by calling it "alumnus/i". In fact, I suspect that the reason it used to be entitled "alumn" was precisely to avoid the suffixes... at the cost of using a form which is quite rare in actual usage. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 01:14, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Alumni" is frequently pronounced as "alumnae," thus making no distinction to the casual listener. It's problematic.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The page's title should be changed to <b>alumnnus/a</b> - one user stated that alumnus was gender neutral because the masculine form is used to refer to both men and women, and while this is true in a sense, it is a very sexist tradition. It is the same as using "man" or "men" to refer to men and women. See a standard <a href="../../../m/l/a/MLA_Style_Manual_5d5e.html" title="MLA Style Manual">MLA Style Manual</a> for more information on removing sexist language from reputable publications, etc. It is not considered acceptable in many areas to use the pronoun he to refer to men and women, etc. - changing the title to alumnus/a avoids offending anyone and thus seems to me to be the most logical fix. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 22:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also see my referenced inclusion on the page about using alumnus/a and alumnae/i to remove sexist language.

AND also on the <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alum.html" title="Alum">alum</a> page I changed the disambiguation at the top to say <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumnus_a_4064.html" title="Alumnus/a">alumnus/a</a> (to reflect the new page name). Please respond here on the talk page before reverting! I made sure that I edited responsibly so there are no double redirects and thus the change will not cause a problem or inconvenience for anyone, instead it merely reflects <a href="../../../m/l/a/MLA_Style_Manual_5d5e.html" title="MLA Style Manual">MLA guidelines</a> etc. for removing previously accepted sexist language. It especially makes sense since the first sentence of the page references both the term alumnus and the term alumna.

<p>The article was recently moved back to "alumn" despite the above discussion, so I thought I'd update the Google figures to make sure they're still valid. In all cases, I searched for the <i>phrase</i> "college alumXX" and its plural, not just the word, e.g. [college-alumn | college-alumns]. Alumnus/i has 2700k hits; alumna/ae has 125k; alum/s has 37k; alumn/s has 0.5k. So alumn remains <i>very rare</i> compared to the alternatives, and the forms alumnus/i/a/ae are <i>83 times</i> more common than all the other forms combined. So it seems clear that the article should be named using that form. Using alumnus alone seems inappropriate because it is masculine; hence alumnus/a. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:31, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well first of all alumnus is the "masculine form" and typically does refer to a male graduate. The sentences "the plural is alumni" and "the plural is alumnae" are sloppy, choppy, and not very clear. I would like to know the exact issues you have with this intro:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An <b>alumnus</b> (masculine) or <b>alumna</b> (feminine) is a person who has attended or is a graduate of an educational institution. The masculine plural, <b>alumni</b>, is often used for mixed groups and the masculine singular is sometimes used generically. The feminine plural is <b>alumnae</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's what I am mainly curious about -- why do you not like this. I think this is more correct because it is true that in Latin, alumnus is the masculine form and alumna is the feminine form. This intro goes on to describe the words in terms of their Latin forms which makes sense. Instead, your version of the intro assumes that the masculine form must be applied to someone who qualifies as a "boy or man" and the feminine form must be applied to someone who qualifies as a "girl or woman." Also what is the difference between girl or woman and boy or man? When does one switch from a girl to a woman and a boy to a man? It seems a bit vague and arbitrary to describe it as such. Also the term especially seems favoring. It seems (moreover since these words come from Latin) that it makes more sense to discuss the words in terms of their word forms, not in terms of who the terms are used to address -- at least in the opening. The usage section of the article goes on to discuss the actual common usages of the terms. Please respond to the questions and further explain. Your above explanation was a bit vague.

<p>It says an alumnus is a person which means it can be a man, woman, or child but it is especially for a boy or man. A girl that graduated or attended elemntary school would be an alumnus. A boy that graduated or attended elementary school would be an alumnus. A man that graduated or attended college would also be an alumnus. An alumna is strictly for a girl or woman alumnus. I'm using a school computer if you are curious why my IP address is different.(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.156.197.1_5f30.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.156.197.1">207.156.197.1</a>) - <small><b><a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.156.197.1.html" title="User talk:207.156.197.1">Talk</a></b></small>)</p>

<dd>Still, it seems much more logical to talk about these words in terms of their forms i.e. masculine or feminine - and the USAGE should go under the usage section. See? This is only the intro of the page, the words have certain masculine or feminine forms but technically if a "man" wanted to call himself an alumna he could couldn't he? He would be using the "feminine" form but he COULD call himself an alumna. Thus, your version of the intro is very vague. Why don't you find references and add the discussion of the usage of the masculine/feminine word forms to the USAGE section. That seems more logical doesn't it? Also, as previously stated: The sentences "the plural is alumni" and "the plural is alumnae" are sloppy, choppy, and not very clear. N.B. - I relocated your response so that it is below my response and above my new response so we can keep the posts in chronological order.

<p>A user made a suggestion in the midst of an ancient thread, not even in the most recent "The Recent Move" section, and then moved the page a few hours later to <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumnus_a_4064.html" title="Alumnus/a">Alumnus/a</a> claiming there had been discussion. I've moved the page back and reverted the redirects.</p>
<p>Such a compound form is virtually never used and the use of a / in the title creates style problems. Using compound forms have been widely deplored in numerous proposed page moves and the like - can anyone cite another page that basically has two names combined in the title to produce a term never used?</p>
<p>My personal preference would be for the plural "alumni", although in my experience "alumnus" is often used regardless of gender - many seem willing to abandon the rules of Latin when using words in English. (And why not? That is how a language evolves and absorbs other words.)

YET, if you were thorough, you would have seen on my explanation of my edit I wrote "m (moved Alumnus to Alumnus/a: removing sexist language - see my comment on the talk page about it)" - So I instructed you to look on the talk page for my comments. Also, I am not sure if the "compound form" is used on any other pages, I will research that but it may take me awhile to gather a list, but this is almost a moot point anyway (*explanation in following sentences for this conclusion). Also typically the masculine forms and feminine forms have their own pages. "Man" has a page that refers to people with male gonads and "woman" refers to people with female gonads. Etc. Also, just because the majority of wikipedia has uncited material and material with no sources doesn't mean we should follow that trend. I think there is a strong case to be made that the use of the term "alumnus" for a page that talks about alumna and alumnae is illogical and not a good idea, just like uncited information. I believe this analogy makes sense because it illustrates that just because one circumstance is more prevalent, does not mean this circumstance is the right circumstance, that it should occur, or that we should be assume culpability for making it reoccur. Also, please see the <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumnus.html" title="Alumnus">alumnus</a> article and the ONLY REFERENCE on the page which I added when I added the information and follow the link for the dicussion on the usage of alumnae/i and alumnus/a. Feel free to visit these links I found within seconds of using Google. For uses of alumnus/a: <a href="http://law.niu.edu/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;ID=184" class="external autonumber" title="http://law.niu.edu/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;ID=184" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.united.edu/alums/nomination.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.united.edu/alums/nomination.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/admissions/tag/people/alumnusa/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/admissions/tag/people/alumnusa/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/x461.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/x461.xml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> AND for uses of alumni/ae: <a href="http://www.bamit.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bamit.org/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/info_alum.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/info_alum.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/thayer/alumni-ae/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/thayer/alumni-ae/index.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>,<a href="http://www.whoi.edu/home/education/alum_main.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whoi.edu/home/education/alum_main.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. These are just a few. Many of these links are from presitgious Ivy League colleges, instituations and nationally acclaimed boarding schools. Look, it's a compromise anyway - and a valid one at that. I could say use "alumna" as the title but that would be "counterproductive, counterintuitive, and illogical" as well. Even the a is just a "/a" here. Really, "alumnus/a" and "alumni/ae" are well established and respected. As I urged you before pick up a <a href="../../../m/l/a/MLA_Style_Manual_5d5e.html" title="MLA Style Manual">MLA Style Manual</a> and check out what they deem "removing sexist language." I see no need to call it sexist (personally) or point fingers, language has faults, and they have been fixed. In the academic world and grammatical circles this usage is really preferred. Hope to hear from you soon. PS. (I don't want my tone to sound mean, I don't mean to be rude for the sake of being rude - just passionately logical, please read it as such). <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 21:48, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, in case I didn't make it clear in my previous post - the above links should illustrate that the forms alumnus/a and alumni/ae (or alumna/us and alumnae/i) are not only used, but used quite frequently, since in your explanation of your revert of my edit, you stated that the form I used (alumnus/a) is not used, which is obviously incorrect. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 01:48, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure about the usage internationally, but I'm a bit concerned that graduate directs here. I think the two words have slightly distinctive meanings. In the UK, alumnus refers to people who have formerly been students at a particular institution. However, graduate as a general noun refers to any person who has qualified at any institution with an award at bachelors level or higher <a href="../../../t/a/f/User%7ETafkam_3c4d.html" title="User:Tafkam">Tafkam</a> 00:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
