<p>"Aluminium is one of the most plentiful materials on earth with a low cost and has the highest electrical charge storage per unit weight except for alkali metals. It has already proved itself to be a viable material in battery application: The Zaromb cell produced in 1960 stored 15 times the energy of a comparable lead acid battery and achieved 500 Wh/Kg with a plate density current of 1A/sq.cm. Salomon Zaromb working for US Philco Company and in this concept for an aluminium air cell, the anode was aluminium partnered with potassium hydroxide with air as the cathode. The main drawback was corrosion in the off condition which resulted in the production of jelly of aluminium hydroxide and the evolution of hydrogen gas. To overcome this problem Philco added inhibitors to avoid the corrosion and had a space below the cell for the aluminium hydroxide to collect. The battery had replaceable aluminium electrode plates.</p>
<p>"Another more recent attempt was made in 1985 by DESPIC using saline electrolyte. Additions of small quantities of tin, titanium, iridium or gallium move the corrosion potential in the negative direction. DESPIC built this cell with wedge shaped anodes which permitted mechanical recharging using sea water as electrolyte in some cases. The battery was commercially developed by ALUPOWER.</p>
<p>"Other attempts have involved aluminium chloride (Chloroaluminate) which is molten salt at room temperature with chlorine held in a graphite electrode. This attempt in 1988 by Gifford and Palmison gives limited capacity due to high ohmic resistance of the graphite.</p>
<p>"Equally significant is work by Gileardi and his team who have succeeded in depositing aluminium from organic solvents though the mechanisms of the reactions are not well understood at this time.</p>
<p>"Between 1990 and 1995 Eltech Research (Fairport Habour, Ohio, U.S.A.) built a mechanically recharge Aluminium battery for the PNGV program. It had 280 cells and stored 190 kWh with a peak power of 55 kW and weighed 195 kg. This battery used a pumped electrolyte system with a separate filter/precipitator to remove the Aluminium Hydroxide jelly.</p>
<p>"Since then, even higher ratings have been achieved but only in primary batteries i.e. where [only] a single use is applicable. Examples of this are emergency stand-by power or torpedoes. The reason for this is that there has been no way up to overcome the problem of aluminium hydroxide 'sludge' building up during the generation of electro- chemical energy. This has meant either disposal of the battery, or complete rebuilding and replenishing the active materials with no possibility of recharging the battery. The Partanen technology has overcome this barrier which means that the energy potential of an aluminium based battery can be utilised to a degree never before attainable and, radically can be recharged to over 3000 cycles.</p>
<p>"In all attempts to benefit the energy of aluminium is that no one has succeeded in solving the recharging except mechanically (by replacing the aluminium plate with a new one). As the right solution was not found the results were such drawbacks as aluminium hydroxide jelly, too big current resistance, corrosion problems etc.</p>
<p>"Europositron's Aluminum technology</p>
<p>"Partanen Europositron technology overcomes the existing difficulty and electropositive metal ions are reduced to metal through analytic and catalytic reactions in normal temperature and with a calculated electrical current. The flow resistance of the solution and the required excess voltage are taken into account.</p>
<p>"The creation of aluminium hydroxide is eliminated and recharging for large number of cycles is possible. The technology applies to all existing methods of battery production including spiral wound sandwich examples. Another advantage of the Partanen Technology is that there is no 'memory' effect as is found with many existing versions of today's batteries."</p>

<p>Zaromb, S. (1962) "The use and behavior of aluminum anodes in alkaline primary batteries" <i>Journal of the Electrochemical Society</i> <b>109</b>(12):1125-1130. Abstract: "The two- to threefold reduction in over-all theoretical reactant weight (and usually also volume) which results from replacing Zn by Al in alkaline primary batteries could best be preserved in practice with 3M KOH "self-regenerating" electrolyte in large (&gt; 1 kw) Al-air (or-O2) power sources, whereas small Al-air (or-O2 of -AgO) reserve cells should function best with a consumable 10M KOH solution. Special attention is given to the use of Al in Al-air cells with porous C or, preferably, porous Ni air cathodes. Anode polarization and current efficiency data are presented for both the self-regenerating and the consumable electrolytes with and without several effective corrosion inhibitors consisting of alkyl-dimethylbenzylammonium salts and/or Hg with or without ZNo. It is concluded that optimum battery performance would result from the use of some of these inhibitors, as well as from elimination of sulphides and other corrosion accelerators, use of highly pure Al or specially resistant Al-Mg, Al-Zn, or Al-Hg alloys, effective heat removal, operation at high current densities (preferably î‹¶ [sic] 10 mA/cm2), and anode-electrolyte separation during periods of inaction."

Abstract: "The addition of a small amount of metallic elements in pure aluminium would change its electrochemical activity, enhance its anticorrosive performance and decrease its negative differential effect. Electrochemical performance of binary (Al-Mn, Al-Ga, Al-In, Al-Sn), ternary (Al-Sn-Ga, Al-Mn-Mg, Al-Zn-Sn) and quaternary aluminium alloys (Al-Mg-In-Mn) in neutral solution of salts or alkaline solution, the mechanism of the effect of the elements added on electrochemical properties of aluminium, the effect of corrosion inhibitors in electrolyte solution on the electrochemical performance of aluminium alloy anode and their optimum content in certain conditions had been reviewed."

Abstract: "Aluminium thin film is ductile with good electrical and thermal conductivities. Particularly, it can be oxidized easily by artificial oxidation or anodizing process to provide an advantageous combination of a good conducting layer and a completely insulating layer which can be applied in integrated circuit technology, micromachining, optical devices and for the development of a rechargeable aluminium battery system. There are several processes available for coating aluminium on work pieces such as (1) thermal spraying coating; (2) hot dipping or galvano-forming; (3) roll binding; (4) PVD/CVD process, for example, sputter and plasma processes and (4) electrodeposition of aluminium. Except for electrodeposition process, any other techniques are rather expensive or run at high temperature or are limited by the arbitrary shape of work pieces. Aluminium coating obtained by electrodeposition has very good quality. However, the electrodeposition process of aluminium is much more complicated than many other metals from aqueous electrolyte as it is less noble than hydrogen, so it cannot be deposited from aqueous solution. In this paper, an organic nonaqueous electrolyte based on tetrahydrofuran with AlCl3 and LiAlH4 dissolved in is employed for electrodeposition of aluminium thin film on stainless steel at room temperature and its texture and microstructure on stainless steel substrate is characterized in details. The measured texture results show that the aluminium thin film has weak (210) and (111) fibre textures and their intensity maximum is 1.7. The observation of the microstructures under different current densities and coated time illustrates that nano-size aluminium particles (10-50nm) are packed together after initial nucleation and the obtained homogenous aluminium thin film is attached to the stainless steel substrate well and no cracks were observed in the film."

Abstract: "The objective of this paper is to create a method to size battery subsystems for an electric vehicle to optimize battery performance. Optimization of performance includes minimizing corrosion by operating at a constant current density. These subsystems will allow for easy mechanical recharging. A proper choice of battery subsystem will allow for longer battery life, greater range and performance. For longer life, the current density and reaction rate should be nearly constant. The control method requires control of power by controlling electrolyte flow in battery sub modules. As power is increased more sub modules come on line and more electrolyte is needed. Solenoid valves open in a sequence to provide the required power. Corrosion is limited because there is no electrolyte in the modules not being used."

<p>ROBERT F. SERVICE'S ARTICLE ON PROGRESS in developing miniature fuel cells for powering small electronic devices ("Shrinking fuel cells promise power in your pocket," News Focus, 17 May, p. 1222) is interesting and encouraging from the point of view of alternate energy strategies, but I wonder if the technology described is not already obsolete. Workable miniature fuel cells are coming on the market (1). The definition of a "fuel cell" should include not only cells using hydrogen and methanol, but also metal air cells. These are often called batteries, but they are not merely electricity-storing devices. Aluminum is especially interesting because the oxidation of aluminum produces enormous amounts of energy. To extract this energy in the usable form of electricity, aluminum is oxidized in an alkaline environment to aluminum hydroxide (2). Some of the more difficult problems of miniaturizing this technology have now been overcome (3). The Trimol Group is bringing out a unit 60 mm by 35 mm by 8 mm in size, which can power a wireless telephone for 25 hours of continuous talk (1). However depressing that prospect may be for the parents of teenagers, the problem of miniaturization of fuel cells has been solved.</p>

Abstract: "The corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3 (AA2024-T3) under thin electrolyte layers was studied in 3.0 wt% sodium chloride solutions by cathodic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. The cathodic polarization measurements show that, when the electrolyte layer is thicker than 200 mu m, the oxygen reduction current is close to that of the bulk solution. But in the range of 200-100 mu m, the oxygen reduction current is inversely proportional to the layer thickness, which shows that the oxygen diffusion through the electrolyte layer is the rate-determining step for the oxygen reduction process. In the range of 100 mu m to about 58 mu m, the oxygen reduction current is slightly decreased probably due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide or the change of the diffusion pattern from 2-dimensional diffusion to one-dimensional diffusion. The further decrease in electrolyte layer thickness increase the oxygen reduction current to some extent again, because the diffusion of oxygen plays more important role in thin electrolyte layers. The EIS measurements show that the corrosion is controlled by the cathodic oxygen reduction at the initial stage, showing the largest corrosion rate at the electrolyte layer thickness of 105 mu m. But at the later stage of corrosion, the anodic process begin to affect the corrosion rates and the corrosion rates show a maximum at 170 mu m, which may be the thickness where the corrosion changes from cathodic control to anodic control. The corrosion rate under the very thin electrolyte layer (62 mu m in this study) is even smaller than that in bulk solution, this is due to that the anodic process is strongly inhibited."

<p>However, when I looked at its citators, none of them had "batter" in their descriptors, and one said this: "... corrosion protection is formation of hydroxide deposits ..." which actually seems to be the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>However, this little excursion with the S.C.I. makes me think that Rainer Partanen is indeed on the right track. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 04:03, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some information from an engineer that was present at Europositron's roadshow.</p>
<hr />
<p>Björn, Ingenjör (engineer) | 2004-09-22 | 15:19</p>
<p>Answer: new issue of shares Europositron</p>
<p>I to visited their road-show and I was NOT impressed! I can hardy tell what to start carping about, but I had a hundred objections when I went from there. To begin with, the inventor did not seem to fully grasp all electrical concepts, something he really should do if he had come with something as fantastic as this superbattery. Then all the bullshit about macromolecules and nanochemistry (haha!!). The description about how the battery worked was the most muddled popular "science" I have ever heard. Furthermore, the man gave strange answers to simple questions of general nature. For example, when asked about the voltage of the battery, he answered "the same as in the wall socket, about 200 volts in Europe and about a 100 in the USA. If the man had been a serious person, he had instead spoken about the cell voltage and that the battery consists of cells in serial connection to make a battery with a suitable voltage (any) for the application in which you may want to use it. Furthermore, the economist character from Delecta seemed to have no idea at all of what he was talking about (the inventor did not object when the man bursted into folly), but he was of course an economist...........mostly reminded me of Percy Nilegård (well-known domestic swedish comedian). I haven´t investigated how much energy it is possible to store in a certain amount of 100% ionized aluminium, but consider the following: If the man has succeded in making each of the parts work individually, why not assemble them into a prototype? Batteries are not complicated constructions and clean rooms should really not be needed to test whether the battery is working or not (even with a fraction of the performance they claim). The battery scaleable and could be built in all sizes as cheaply as todays lead-acid batteries. Therefore a prototype the size of a matchbox should hardly cost anything to make, even if it was 500 times more expensive than a battery in serial production. The least you could ask before spending several millions on this abortive enterprize is a simple test to make sure it is working.

<p>ELECTROCATALYSER SOLUTION The present invention relates to an electrocatalyser solution for use in physical and/or organic electrochemistry, whose applications producing and/or consuming electric energy include e.g. new fusion energy and/or the generation and/or storage and/or use and/or liquid crystal use of galvanic electric current.</p>
<p>Prior-art electrochemical solutions and their solution technique are represented e.g. by electrolytes and patent classes B 01J 031/00 and C 25B 001/02 - 001/04 etc.</p>
<p>Prior-art electrolytes and solution technique are represented e.g. by potash water electrolyte which is in ground state and is a 1:1 electrolyte, which has dissociated into ionic state, a drawback of which is said ground state, by reason of which the activation of solution reactions requires a high electric voltage, which is due to high polarisation overvoltages, a consequence of which is that the solution has a low conductance and the reactions are slow.</p>
<p>As compared with the prior-art solution and the solution technique involved, the object of the invention is to achieve a solution which eliminates the drawbacks described above and is based on improved solution technique.</p>
<p>A special advantage achieved by the invention and the solution technique of the invention is that the solution reactions take place with a di/de polarisation undervoltage, which catalyses the reaction of water ("electrolysis") and its inverse reaction as well as other reactions in which the solution is used, resulting in a higher reaction speed and a better conductance.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the effect described above, the invention is mainly characterized by the facts presented in claim 1.</p>
<p>In the following, the invention is described in detail.</p>
<p>The electrocatalyser solution of the invention represents a new and original solution and solution technique in electrochemistry. It is characterized by the working substances and solution technique presented in the following example. In the example, in which the structural hydrogen in the solution compounds is protonium hydrogen, deuterium and tritium hydrogen is used when more slowness is desired and/or for hydrogenation, especially for fusion reaction applications.</p>
<p>Example 1. An electrocatalyser solution, which has been prepared as follows and 25% ammonia-water solution has been used, the amount of which is 68 g, which is mixed with water and 208 g of aluminium hydroxides and the required quantity of water is used to obtain a total volume of 1 dm3, the substances used form an ammonia hydroxide - aluminium trihydroxide - hydrate water solution, the solution is balanced and the above-mentioned molecule group/groups have catalyser properties when exposed to an electric voltage, the properties also extend to the electrodes used, so these function at a di/de polarisation undervoltage, which is a result of the solution technique, the molecule group is bidirectional, in the direction of the electric field.</p>
<p>In this application, part of the solution technique is the fact that the solution is not in ground state and that the relationship between solution substances in moles is as follows, NH3 1: 2.67Al (OH)3 , which is the basis for the unique catalytic effect of the substances occurring in water solution, the relationship between the substances can also be different, but still the so lution must not be in ground state. Part of the solution technique is also the fact that water and water reactions are used as means for energy transfer, as yield and/or working substances, the solution reactions consume and/or produce water, depending on the practical application and on whether a water, oxide, hydroxide or hydrogen reaction is used, catalysed reactions are in all applications H+ and/orOW reactions.</p>
<p>The catalysers which produce catalysis reactions when exposed to a voltage are presented below in an outspread form, for the sake of clarity and multi-function orientation, there are no requirements as to the direction of the electric field, the solution can function in all directions. EMI3.1</p>
<p><br />
&lt;tb&gt;</p>
<p>+ &lt;SEP&gt; A1(OH)3 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; 3 &lt;SEP&gt; H20 &lt;tb&gt; or &lt;SEP&gt; .H20 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; NH3 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; H &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; OW &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; Al &lt;SEP&gt; (OH)3 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; 3 &lt;SEP&gt; H20 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; .H20 &lt;SEP&gt; or &lt;tb&gt;- &lt;SEP&gt; eo &lt;SEP&gt; &lt;SEP&gt; ve &lt;SEP&gt; &lt;SEP&gt; Al &lt;SEP&gt; (OH)3 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;SEP&gt; 3 &lt;SEP&gt; H20 &lt;SEP&gt; + &lt;tb&gt; catalysers are not subject to wear or change, the balance is always the same before and after reactions, the solution exposed to voltage can be divided into anions and/or cations, all possible forms of molecules can participate in the reactions and be temporarily changed, being then restored, different forms are ammonia, ammonia hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, hydrates, aluminates, aluminium ion, hydroxide ion and water ammonia dimer.</p>
<p>The below water reaction and its inverse version are special reactions of the invention and the catalytic properties of the solution substances is tested using the best and most reliable method, hydrogen electrode and electrolysis reaction of water, 2 H20 + 2 e--, 2 OH- + H2 the known value of the reaction is -08277 V with a potash water electrolyte the value is over -0.828 V in practical applications -0.95 ... -1.20 V.</p>
<p>Below is an application of a functional test of example 1,solution, Pt(plat) I H2(1 atm.) I example 1,solution I Pt(plat) in this test a sufficiently high voltage guaranteed to ensure a good result has been used, which is -0.726 V the theoretic limit value for the reaction and catalysis is -0626 V. catalysed results concerned are all results that are below -0.8277 V.</p>
<p>When the invention is compared with the prior-art potash water electrolyte, it can be state that the invention eliminates all the known drawbacks. As for the things that are outside the sphere of the invention, such as electrodes, it can be stated that there are no known electrodes that are not applicable for use with a solution as provided by the invention, only the purpose of use may form an obstacle, examples of electrodes that work particularly well are aluminium and copper electrodes, it is also possible to use oxide/hydroxide/liquid crystal reactant water solutions together with the solution.</p>
<p>Investigations have not revealed any bar of novelty or inventive level, and the solution can be industrially exploited and has special properties for many purposes.</p>
<p>It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the solution substances and solution technique are an invention which is not restricted to the example and its functionality test, but it can be widely used and applied for various purposes within the scope of the claims.</p>
