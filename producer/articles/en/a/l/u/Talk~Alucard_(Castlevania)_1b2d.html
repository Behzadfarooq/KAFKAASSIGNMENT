<p>I never understood this, but why do people even consider Kid Dracula to be a game in the series' canon, and more importantly, consider the character to be a childhood incarnation of Alucard? I doubt the original designers meant to have the game taken seriously in the first place.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is because <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/heroes.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/heroes.htm" rel="nofollow">The Castlevania Dungeon</a> claims it to be so. Just scroll down until you find Kid Dracula.</dd>

<dd>Even if that's the case, just because a popular website claims (more like theorize, since it doesn't state that they're the same character), doesnt make it neccesarily true. There's alot of fanon stuff in there that aren't supported by the original Japanese titles. Jonny2x4 05:47, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I never implied it justified it, all I said was, if it were not for the fact that Alucard is considered to be Kid Dracula according to the Castlevania Dungeon, then he most likely wouldn't have been considered Kid Dracula in this article either.</dd>

<p>Look, <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a>, I'm getting really tired and pissed off at your behaviour. This Alucard is the most common user of this name. This article should be named simply Alucard. The rest will be linked on the disambiguation page. This is according to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia's policy</a>. Stop reverting, or I'll file another 3RR on you. No one calls Dracula "Alucard." As much as you think Alucard isn't used often, it's even less used for Dracula. And of all the fictional people called Alucard, this one is the most famous one. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 04:21, 09 Aug, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but Naming Conventions policy is for most common usage of all people, not just kids playing a certain video game. Alucard being an alias for Dracula and his minions is well-established in movies and clearly has precendence over a single videogame series. Just because you wrote this article doesn;t mean it's the most important. Rather it is quite trivial. And your stubborn insistence of only allowing your way on articles you contribute to is horribly bad faith agains Wikipedia standards. You just violated 3RR on <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhampir.html" title="Dhampir">Dhampir</a> and you obviously intend to do so on every article just blind undoing whatever I did to get it back to your preferred version. You are a problem editor and you need to knock it off. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:00, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"You are a problem editor and you need to knock it off."</i> I can say the exact same thing about you, and I know that a lot more editors will agree with me than vice versa. For the record, I didn't write this article. Sure, this name has been used before this fictional character came to existence. But the fact is, people will not associate this name with a movie from the 70s, or something else of minor prominence. And they will certainly not associate it with Dracula. Alucard in this game, is the most famous bearer of this name today. Next to him, it's Alucard from the hellsing series. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 05:15, 09 Aug, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoever said Alucard is Dracula? That makes no sense. Several characters from several different works share the name Alucard (the most famous ones, in my opinion, are from <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castlevania.html" title="Castlevania">Castlevania</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellsing.html" title="Hellsing">Hellsing</a>, but not all of them end up being Dracula. Saying Alucard is Dracula is a personal opinion. It makes no sense to do this. About Dreamguy, yes, he is a problem user. I've seen him pushing his ideas on people on the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succubus.html" title="Succubus">Succubus</a> article. I also see his name constantly popping up on my watchlist. I guess the biggest case right now is <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">Vampire</a>. He only brings chaos, and only goes against other people. I advise you to stop this revert war here, or you will have problems. More than you already do, actually.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Kaonashi</a> 04:37, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, no. Not all of them have to be Dracula, it's just most common that they are, or are a minion of his, hence the redirect to <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a>. And I am not a problem user, at all, and if you knew what you were talking about you'd know that. My biggest problem here is I go head to head with problem users who complain a lot and do bad things. I STOP problem users, get sockpuppets identified, track down anonymous users, and prevent people from trying to hold articles hostage to the exact version they want. I'm sorry you only glanced at what was going on and didn;t take the time to investigate it. Please do take the time to look into it further. Lots of people complain to admins, but admins routinely ignore them as having no case and then turn around and discover the people complaining were in the wrong. Much like EliasAlucard here. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 06:01, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but admins don't have any special powers over content here. I'm sorry you feel the way you do, but then your conclusion doesn't mean anything more than anyone else jumping in without looking at the situation fairly and accurately. If you would look at EliasAlucard's history here you'd find him doing far worse than anything I've done... ever. He's currently doing the very things you falsely claim I am doing, but for real instead of just in your mind. He also has made multiple violations of 3RR in the last 24 hours. You say you are an admin... aren;t you supposed to block peopple for that? Or do you only pull out the "I'm an admin" talk when you want to use it to ignore what someone else is saying and just declare yourself right without having to justify it? You call me a problem editor, but as you have not blocked the other guy here it's looking like you may be a problem admin (and before you try to claim that was uncivil, I am saying the exact same thing about yuo that you claim about me, so if you think it wasn't right then you shouldn;t have done it yourself). <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 12:08, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OH, and I went back to look at the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succubus.html" title="Succubus">Succubus</a> history... I remember you! You kept putting a factual dispute tag on the article when there was no factual dispute at all... And you still are mad at me over that? Have you read up on what the tags mean since then? You might want to. It might help you to admit you were wrong so you can learn to work with people who are doing things the right way instead of justifying yourself against the evidence. And, again, I mean that in only the most objective and factual civil way, you were clearly wrong there, and in order to get past personal conflicts you need to be able to admit it when you make errors instead of blaming the guy who pointed them out. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 12:22, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Kaonashi</a>, well spoken. I rest my case. That's all I have to say, really. But to further prove my point, I'll say some more. DreamGuy is constantly getting into revert wars and stuff with people. And over extremely lame and silly issues; if that's not a problem user, then I don't know what is. Alucard is like you said, as of now, most famous for his Castlevania character. The Hellsing character has gained quite some notability too, but to my knowledge, this character is more associated with the name. Therefore, this article should be named <i>Alucard</i> and nothing more. And redirecting Alucard to Dracula is completely ridiculous; it's not like Dracula needs more attention than he already has gotten. Since Wikipedia was created, until now, never has Alucard redirected to Dracula, and there's a very good reason for that: it is not supposed to! A search on Google for <a href="http://www.google.se/search?q=Alucard+Dracula&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.se/search?q=Alucard+Dracula&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">Alucard Dracula</a>, and the first hit (and most hits) is Alucard from Castlevania. That proves my point completely.</dd>

<dd>DreamGuy, what good reason do you have for me not to block you right now, instead of anyone else? You are always involved in a billion zillion disputes, always going against everyone's opinion, and always breaking the stability of several articles? Who are you to tell me how I should do my job? I said I'm an admin because you went like "Oh, admins blah blah", so I just wanted to make sure you are talking to one of them, and not at the back of them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't hold a "personal grudgue" against you, like you're letting everybody know on your very friendly edit summaries. What I am saying here is just what is happening. I am a fan of Castlevania and Hellsing. As soon as I saw stuff going on this article via my watchlist, I noticed something was going on. I wasn't tracking you down, or anything you might be thinking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the Succubus article, on that case, you brought up something that didn't make much sense, everybody disagreed with you, the page was protected, a consensus was reached, and when you noticed what happened, you ran away. Plain and simple. I guess that if I were "clearly wrong" there, I wouldn't have every other person involved in the dispute disagreeing with you, instead of me, the wrong guy. I think it's about time for you to understand you are minority, and most importantly, to understand you should be trying to be more constructive instead of trying to transform this site into your personal utopia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the problem itself, I'm not understanding. I think there used to be a disambiguation page mentioning several Alucards, some time ago. Where is it, or am I getting confused? Anyway, what I think that shouldn't be happening is having <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alucard.html" title="Alucard">Alucard</a> redirected to <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a>. That's all. There are other Alucards around, and that is sure different from Dracula. People must keep those two things in mind. I think it should be some kind of disambiguation page. I'm pretty sure I've seen that in the past, but there is nothing in the histories. I don't think anyone deleted that. It makes no sense to me.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Kaonashi</a> 13:06, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if nothing else, the fact that I didn't do anything wrong and from that statement and your actions it's clear you are continuing your own personal grudge, and if you did just decide to block me you'd only be proving my point about you and likely have another admin overturn it while we went to some sort of mediation or something.</dd>

<dd>That's your opinion, but again, if you'd bother to research the controversies I get into are clearly with people who are themselves breaking the rules and the conflict comes from me trying to bring some sanity back. For example, while you were all pissed off at me, EliasAlucard violated the 3RR <b>three times</b>! Someone finally did come in and block him for 24 hours, not that you lifted a finger to do anything about it. The people I have gotten into wars with are ones who simply blind revert any changes they deem to radical and who don't discuss it fairly. I do what a lot of other people are afraid to do: When someone is being ultra protective of an article, especially one that really needs some major improvements, I follow the <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> guidelines and try to fix it. <b>Of course</b> people who are ultraprotective of their edits are gong to be upset. Of course problem users are going to complain and try to escalate things. That doesn't mean that I'm doing something wrong, that just means I'm not afraid of doing the right thing when people are stubbornly trying to do the wrong thing. About the only thing I would say I should improve on there (as many admins have told me) is to get other editors involved in the process earlier and helping out against these people instead of doing it myself so it doesn't look so much like I'm the bad one. IF you hop around and take a look at the other conflicts I've been in and actually read them, you will see that in the end when experienced editors come in, the abusers are blocked and the sockpuppets are cleared out, I am standing quite pretty with a lot of support. It's just my nature though to go ahead and do what I can by myself without calling for help when I hink I have something well under control.</dd>

<dd>Everybody who showed up on that one article... mainly because EliasAlucard used it as a rallying point to get all the people who stuffed articles about nonfiction topics with nonnotable subcruft fictional details so much that they were about to burst and so they could argue for their right to push fiction over nonfiction on the nonfiction articles. If you take a look at the other articles with a number of experienced and respected editors you'd see that those things are typically very abbreviated or moved to their own page. Certainly when it moves away from being a discussion about information and becomes a long list it should be moved to a page for the list instead of taking over the article. That was my argument. That's how things are done elsewhere. That's the right way for an encyclopedia to work. My problem was that I didn't go and bother editors everywhere else and drag them in and instead the fictioncruft kiddies took over.</dd>

<dd>See, and look at your negative wording here. What about your civility... Or what about acknowledging the simply fact that I could see that some bad editors were rallied and they had managed to find an admin who would place the incorrect tag on an article simply to be contrary and not follow policy and I realized that I couldn't prevail even if I did go and gather a bunch of editors at that point. So I gave that article up. I had lots on my list.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And the other way to look at that is that if people like <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">USer:EliasAlucard</a> and others like him were the ones supporting you, you happened to luck out in having a group of very bad editors there all at once.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I suggest you realize that being in the minority among certain editors is actually a good thing, as it shows class, and that whose in a minority or not can change quite rapidly. And, actually, I would say that I was and am being quite constructiv, giving peoplpe a clear compromise to do something to get their poorly written nonnotable sections about trivial fiction topics highlighted in an area of its own instead of mucking up main articles. OF course they couldn't agree to that either. They tried to argue that mythology is fiction. (It's not.) Or that video games that happened to come out recently but will likely be forgotten in another year or two are more important that the beliefs of topics that were around for thousands of years. (They are clearly not.)</dd>

<dd>You want <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alucard.html" title="Alucard">Alucard</a> to go to a disambiguation page? I can agree to that. What I mainly objected to was the idea that it'd go to the Castlevania page when that is so specific and so minor out of all the various versions. I thought Dracula made the most sense because that's what some of the most classic references in horror cinema use the name for, which would be more notable than some game system. But if we agree the game system shouldn't be there then we are most likely united in disagreeing with Elias there, as he was dead set breathing mad insisting that only the game system should go there.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I haven't dug back, but if Elias had the page moved the page histories would have moved with it and then he could have taken over the redirect and turned it into his video game article. I don't know. But if you want the disambig here I can redirect it to there and then go and add some of the more explicit Dracula Alucard references there when I have time. And then sometime later we can maybe file to have the disambig page moved here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's all cool and groovy. Wonder what Elias will have to say about it when he's unblocked 22 or so hours from now? He's always been completely unwilling to discuss things, and the only time he tries is when he thinks he has someone on his side so the "discussion" is him telling his way to do things and you either agree with him or he blind reverts everything you do. Check out his recent history on <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhampir.html" title="Dhampir">Dhampir</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/m/Talk%7EVampire_6fe5.html" title="Talk:Vampire">Talk:Vampire</a>, the 3RR noticeboard (both under sections with my name and his name, and note that I was not blocked), and so forth.

<p>I had an idea about what to do regarding the Romanian characters on Alucard's name. It's actually pretty simple, and it might work well. Take a look on the article about <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zangief.html" title="Zangief">Zangief</a>. Since he's a Russian character in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_888c.html" title="Street Fighter">Street Fighter</a> series, you can see his name in <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic_alphabet.html" title="Cyrillic alphabet">cyrillics</a> right there, between parentheses. I think we can do just the same with Alucard. That'd solve the problem.</p>
<p>Still on the topic of Street Fighter, we have other examples. Take <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chun-Li_45bc.html" title="Chun-Li">Chun-Li</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryu_%28Street_Fighter%29_2791.html" title="Ryu (Street Fighter)">Ryu</a>, for example. Those characters are Chinese and Japanese (respectively), yet you don't see Chinese and Japanese characters scattered all over their articles, replacing their names. It wouldn't even make sense, but those cases and this one are the same. Think about that. Instead, they have that kind of info inside parentheses.</p>
<p>I'll go ahead and fix the article. If anyone thinks that was a dumb idea, please tell us about it here. Before reverting the article again. Thanks.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Kaonashi</a> 03:23, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was just wondering about the comment that stated that, however unlikely, what Alucard says at the end of Dawn of Sorrow indicates that he would take on his father's role. Why does it suggest that? HayashiKun 9:44, 09 March, 2007 (UTC)</p>
