<p>Hi. I thought I should let you know that your project to add DMOZ links to dozens of location articles is somewhat controversial. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">Wikipedia's External links guidelines</a> call for avoiding commercial external links. DMOZ directories commonly contain links to commercial sites, so by extension, one would think that DMOZ links would be unwelcome. However, on the contrary, the guidelines say "Rather than creating a long list of external links, editors should consider linking to a related category in the Open Directory Project."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, DMOZ links have been discussed on before on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EExternal_links_4b9d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:External links">Wikipedia talk:External links</a>, drawing some comments such as "A Dmoz link should be a last resort, not a first...", and I have started a <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EExternal_links_4b9d.html#DMOZ_again" title="Wikipedia talk:External links">new discussion</a> based in part on your work.</p>
<p>Please understand I am not saying you're doing anything wrong-- it seems clear that your additions are being done in good faith, and they are certainly not in any obvious violation of present policy. I just thought you ought to be made aware of the discussion, as you might want to contribute to it; you also might want to slow down on this work for a bit, since there is <i>some</i> chance that the consensus will go against DMOZ links.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to drop this probably unsettling comment on your Talk page. Let me try to offset it by offering my <b>Welcome!</b></p>

<dd>Thanks for the note - I had read all those documents before I did any editing, and will keep referring to them as I learn more. I know that from the ODP Wikipedia article there are a lot of "haters" out there, and I obviously feel that the ODP can be a very useful resource, along side Wikipedia.

<dd>Hrm, tricky. Well, in this case, the editor is correct: there doesn't seem to be any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> or even <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> source to back up those statistics. You could replace it and add {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} to request a citation (probably starting a talk page thread, while you're at it), or you could go and try to find such a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citation</a> yourself. I might recommend the latter of the two, but it's your call. If you run into problems, don't forget <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>, probably starting at <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">requests for third opinion</a>, for now.

<dd>Content disputes are pretty much the bane of the wiki.&#160;;) Once we have magic solutions for those, we can fix about anything, I think. The stuff they're taking out does look unsourced, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has a few things to say about removing unsourced material. In recent months, especially, there's been a bit of a movement towards removing anything of the sort -- used to be, we'd tag it and wait, but the backlog on the "wait" part of that has been dragging pretty far behind. When all else fails, I try to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and do my best to nudge everyone over to the <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">talk page</a> to work out a solution. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 22:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I notice that you are adding cities to the category. What is the criteria for inclusion? I know of many small cities in Wisconsin &amp; Michigan that you have not added. You better put some criteria on the category page, or else it will fill up with every tiny hamlet/township/burg.

<dd>I didn't create the category, so I am adding localities that are designated as "City" in the WP article that are directly located on one of the Great Lakes.

<p>You don't know the status of Pennelville, and yet you want to add it to the County page. Maybe you should first find out what the status is, and then perhaps add it one of the TOWN pages in the county (hint: try <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schroeppel%2C_New_York_fa52.html" title="Schroeppel, New York">Schroeppel, New York</a>). What do you know! It is listed there as a hamlet! Perhaps that would be a good place to start a new link, not the county page. But then, why? Do you think this community merits its own page? What the heck, one more stub! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStepp-Wulf_60a1.html" title="User:Stepp-Wulf">Stepp-Wulf</a> 01:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree with what you say, which is why I created a county template which includes all the hamlets and have linked to it on the page, instead of the listing that was there before. This seems to bring it in line with what has been done on the various other counties. If a page is created down the road, this would be an ideal place to link to it. I hope that this compromise resolves the issue. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> 12:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am an editor at the Open Directory Project, also known as DMOZ. The WP policy on External Links in articles (<a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>) talks about the potential of using a link to the ODP category as an alternative to listing many ELs in an article. While I do not want to debate getting into the pros and cons of this issue here (there are plenty of other places for that) what I would like to do is to address one of the issues that I have heard brought up - that the corresponding category has many dead, redirected or otherwise broken links.</p>
<p>If you find a broken link, I would invite you to drop a note into this section, and I will deal with it as soon as I can. please let me know the category in the ODP (if you could give me a URL to it that would be much appreciated), and the name that the ODP uses for that site. Note that I will not list new sites in categories, nor will I enter into debates about sites. I also will not give the status on sites that have been suggested - this is purely for letting me know of a broken link.</p>
<p>If you add to here, I will remove the request once I have dealt with it.</p>

I will restore the link but please be sure not perform hasteful edits without researching the topic first. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_outdoors_82e1.html" title="User:Eric outdoors">Eric</a> 20:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi - check out my other edits to <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">Feminism</a>. Those nasty little IP vandals were messing up the page even as I reverted it!</p>

<dd>Andy, but you were reverting by adding other nonsense text, which is why I thought you were "in" in it - apologies. If they continue to vandalize, rather than edit-warring with them, I suggest you apply to get them blocked. By continuing to edit their changes, they are getting the attention they may be looking for.

<p>You are quite right, all those Alfreds should never have been on the dab page. Most accidental links to <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred.html" title="Alfred">Alfred</a> are likely to be for one of the places, rather than someone with the first name Alfred. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolGray_46ad.html" title="User:CarolGray">CarolGray</a> 17:49, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks very much for that clarification - I will use it as an example the next time I see something like that. -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 17:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A quiet word of advice - there has been a lot of debate on this issue and there are editors who feel the Manual of Style is too restrictive. Some people are working very hard creating lists of people who share the same name. Which is fine, but... "John Smith" and "William Smith" are not disambiguations of "Smith". The new page I created - <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_%28name%29.html" title="Alfred (name)">Alfred (name)</a> - is not a disambiguation page, it is an article about the name, including a list of people. If anyone queries your edits, I'd like to suggest you refer them to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html#Examples_of_individual_entries_that_should_not_be_created" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)#Examples of individual entries that should not be created</a>.

<dd>Again, that makes a ton of sense. And I completely agree - there is a page about the Name, which can include all notable people who have that name, and there is a disambiguation page that deals with pages that might only be referred to by that name. If you wouldn't mind, could you take a look at something I did, based on this advice, and see if it looks ok to you: <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabitha.html" title="Tabitha">Tabitha</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabitha_%28name%29.html" title="Tabitha (name)">Tabitha (name)</a>.

<p>Thank you for your vandalism revert on this article. I must rv there at least 3 or 4 times a day.
