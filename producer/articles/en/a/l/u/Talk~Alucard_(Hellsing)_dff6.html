	    <p>I removed the bit about conflicting evidence in the "Dracula connection" section. Besides the fact that Alucard's identity is no longer up for debate, the argument was flawed. Dark Horse omitted a very important detail in their translation: only females need to be virgin in order to be turned. Males don't have to be. I'm pretty sure they just need to be strong willed. Also, in the Hellsing universe, natural male vampires are called "Draculs" and natural female vampires are called "Draculinas". This is why, in volume 3, Alucard calls Seras "Draculina". This might seem like an insult or pet name, but he's actually referring to what she has become.</p>
<p>For some reason, Dark Horse omitted all of this. It's in the original Japanese material and also the Spanish edition.</p>
<p>I also think "the Dracula Connection" should simply contain a brief and concise explanation of Alucard's true identity, rather than presenting evidence, because the debate is over. Anybody who actually reads the manga knows who he is. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_F._T._Cashin_ce3f.html" title="User:John F. T. Cashin">Schrödinger</a> 04:35, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid I'm going to need more than your word on it about this issue regarding male vs. female vampires. To me, at the moment, it looks like you're blowing hot air. EVIDENCE. Give me page numbers or essays. I think if all it required was a strong will, you'd see more male ghouls becoming vampires instead. --Obsidian-fox 22:26, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not only is the debate over, but the last chapter released is all about his life as Vlad III, starting with him being held hostage by the Turks at age 13 (as well as being raped), then his adult life with conquests and impaling, and finally his execution (where he seems to renounce his trust in God and become an undead). <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_G%C3%BCnsche_5368.html" title="User:Captain Günsche">Captain Günsche</a> 22:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I think we need to get people's opinions on whether or not that section should be completely leveled and replaced with a concise explanation. It actually keeps growing; people are adding every little thing they can think of, and normally I don't mind that - I think the Hellsing articles on Wikipedia should be a cornucopia of information, regardless of whether or not cynical people think it's "fancruft" - but it is presented in a "this may or may not be true" manner. That's my problem with it. There is no uncertainty or ambiguosity left, for anybody who has been following the manga up to the very latest chapters. Presenting this info as "possibilities" is bogus and gives people the wrong impression. If there is a concern about spoiling the series, then we can use spoiler tags.</li>

<p>I think the Dracula Connection section should be removed. I mean, do we even need it anymore, since his identity as Dracula has long since been finalized in the Hellsing canon? --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod-Emperor_985d.html" title="User:God-Emperor">Hellspawn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been thinking that for a long, long time. It's unnecessary and redundant. All the relevant information regarding his mortal years as Vlad III Dracula and the events of the novel are in the History section. And I still think it's really misleading to the uninitiated to have a section with "evidence". We don't need to present it as "evidence" because it's blatantly, painfully, explicitly obvious in the manga. His identity has long been established, and as such, should be presented as fact like anything else in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_F._T._Cashin_ce3f.html" title="User:John F. T.

<p>I don't feel this little tidbit belongs in the main article. It has been moved to the talk section, where it belongs.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Controversially a date mentioned in Vol. 1 -- Wednesday, June 14 -- occurs in 2000 but not in 1999.</i></li>
<li><i>One possible explanation is that he hasn't reached his birthdate as the story is supposedly set in current month of September. Sporadic dates are given throughout the early volumes when fairly substantial amounts of time have past however it eventually stops skipping days.

The date is therefore estimated at somewhere in the middle of September, still some time before Alucard gains another year.</i></li>

<p>I was wondering if anyone had further information on the weapon. Lacking a visible slide, I've been personally coming to the conclusion that its using rifle-style blowback or gas operation. Does anyone have any further technical data on it, or did they just leave it open for everyone to guess? <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECABAL_6852.html" title="User:CABAL">CABAL</a> 15:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, by basic physics, if its charge is designed for the barrel length, and its alloy is top of the line at the time, then the gun is going to produce at least 45% more energy than the S&amp;W Model 500 (at the same power and bullet mass) and up to 75% more energy (at the same pressure, which probably requires a heavier bullet to take advantage of that extra length). That would be a range of 5-6kJ. If the barrel can handle higher pressures than the S&amp;W 500, then the energy can be a bit higher; there are a lot of advantages of a big gun. Anyhow, basic physics would say it's /at least/ twice as powerful as his Casull (2.7 kJ). --Obsidian-fox 09:54, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm more familiar with measuring ammunition strength by "feet/meters per second" at muzzle velocity than in joules. Given your estimations, it would definitely outpace the Model 500, which itself outpaces the 44 Magnum by about 37% using the heaviest-pressure load (CORBON Hunter 440-grain HC) and about 32% for the biggest load (CORBON Hunter 500-grain HC). <b>However</b>, someone showed me screencaps of the Jackal from the anime series and it seems that it does have a slide, it just moves very slightly, so I'm still suspecting gas operation like the Desert Eagle. If so, Alucard must have to clean out the gas ports very often (If I'm not wrong, DEs have a reputation of fouling up the gas tubes very quickly). <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECABAL_6852.html" title="User:CABAL">CABAL</a> 05:34, 2 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Velocity, mass, toughness, and cross-sectional area are the numbers that matter most for causing penetration and shock. (Toughness matters in preventing deformation of the bullet, and toughness of the material.) Tearing materials apart consumes -energy- (based on the toughness of the target material). Pushing through fluids (or solids that were recently torn up) consumes -momentum- based on the density of the medium and and dumps the relevant energy into a pressure/shock wave in the medium. (That happens because moving forward through a fluid requires moving the molecules that are directly in front of the bullet, too. This directly results in the square laws for air resistance.) Due to square-cube laws relating surface area to mass, bigger bullets will always be better against fluid resistance (which is very significant). Higher energy bullets do better at the "cutting" aspect. Both are better with a narrower front profile. This is seen in the difference between arrows and bullets. Due to how powder conflagrates in a gun, it's easier to get more energy into a higher-mass bullet... but velocity will drop. Anyhow, basic point is that you need much more than velocity to make a good estimate of bullet ability. Velocity gives a good upper limit for range in an environment without atmosphere, and it has significant ability on how well the bullet can be dodged or evaded, but other than that it isn't valuable. Supposing the bullet will reach the target with most of its velocity intact (which is true for short-range shooting), for soft points or hollow points (like Alucard uses), energy matters much more because it has a significant impact on how deeply the wider bullet can cut through material (and thus do things like tear off Alexander Anderson's arm).</dd>
<dd>Short lesson aside, yes, it seems the Jackal has a slide in the manga, too. It is seen in Volume 3, page 100, the first place he uses the gun. It also seems to have some sort of gas-operated blowback mechanism for the spent cartridges, but I'm not up on all the technical details of automatic pistols. --Obsidian-fox 08:53, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) Thanks for that, now I understand why the 500-grain CORBON loads have lesser velocity (A lot of that reminded me of <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrostatic_shock.html" title="Hydrostatic shock">hydrostatic shock</a>). 2) Gas-operated handguns like the DE are not really any different from a modern rifle in terms of operation. A <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas-operated.html" title="Gas-operated">gas-operated</a> <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotating_bolt.html" title="Rotating bolt">rotating bolt</a> mechanism, except minimized and inside of a handgun. Alucard's Jackal certainly would be able to accomodate a <i>short-stroke</i> gas-operation mechanism easily. 3) "Gas-operated blowback" isn't really a valid term to use, it would imply that the weapon was somehow managing to tap the gas simultaneously from the chamber and barrel, which would be best described as inefficient. 4) Shell removal and reloading is performed as the mechanism finishes travelling rearwards (AKA right after a shot), the extractor claw hooks onto the rim beforehand and slams it against another component during travel, causing it to tumble out of the weapon and allowing for the next round to go in. This may just be the angles on the Jackal, but the perceived slight movement of the slide seems rather insufficient to accomodate ejection, not to mention loading. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECABAL_6852.html" title="User:CABAL">CABAL</a> 12:38, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think that would be appropriate. I don't really feel having all these quotes is appropriate to the article itself. On the other hand, I'm not sure what Wikiquote policy is on fictional characters. Should they be attributed to Kohta Hirano through Alucard? Or just straight to Alucard_(Hellsing)?

There are also firestorm operating systems. Although they were very recently adapted to handguns the princables remain the same. Rather then using a hammer to punch a primer, electicle impulses are sent to a small charge behind the round cousing a simmiler effect of standered fire-arms. Although this is unliky do to time frames and that there is a hammer on the weapon. There still is the possiablity.</p>

<p>Currently the article states that the .454 Casull Auto Joshua is made completely of silver, from the cross at Lanchester Church. Yet in the dubbed version of the anime, Alucard specifically says, "A silver cross at Lanchester church was melted into the alloy for the <i>bullets</i>." I am assuming that the information about the gun being completely silver is taken from the manga (though I am not familiar with it), and supported by the gun's colour, but I want to draw attention to the fact that not all sources point to this. The anime states that only the bullets were made from the silver cross. This could be stated as a note, if necessary. Also, Seras was warned about touching silver objects, and when she did her fingertip was scorched. Assuming this applies to all vampires, it is unlikely Alucard would be holding a gun made of silver with obviouos ease, especially in his teeth as he does at one point in the first episode of the anime. Of course he may have some resistance to the effects of silver, though this is rather doubtful, considering Incognito's words "It's about time you had a taste of your own silver bullets" and the damage subsequently taken by Alucard. In any case, an ample amount of evidence in the anime points to the gun not being made entirely of silver, only the bullets. -<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHoborgXVII_c79e.html" title="User:LordHoborgXVII">LordHoborgXVII</a></p>

<li>Thus it seems all the manga information agrees that only the bullets are made from the silver cross. It's surprising that it is popularly believed that the entire gun is made from silver.

<dd>The gun might make it as a tank-killer if it was done from above and firing a heavy round like the PGU-14/B API, though its low rate of fire would greatly hold it back. I mentioned ROF as I seem to recall an autoloading version of the Harkonnen in the manga. A page depicting Celes holding one Harkonnen in each hand, and feeding belted ammo from a backpack dispenser.

<dl>
<dd>That sounds accurate from what I've /heard/, though I haven't actually read that section. The auto-Harkonnens should happen in either Volume 6 or 7 (which I don't have.)</dd>
<dd>It would take hits to vulnerable spots to work against modern MBTs, though a few hits to the same spot would have the same effect. The stronger 30mm rounds (circa 300 grams Uranium ball combined with enough charge to launch at 1400 m/s, total 300kJ and p=420 kg*m/s - enough to carry a 60kg cannon back at 7m/s per shot) are still far short of modern anti-tank weapons (which measure in Megajoules). However, they do match anti-tank weapons of ye' old crowd... which includes much of that to which Millennium would have access. --Obsidian-fox 11:26, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In other words, Hellsing doesn't really need anything more powerful since Millenium has access to nothing more modern. Though you wouldn't really need to penetrate armor to consider a tank dead; IIRC, the story goes that an Abrams way back in the first Gulf War met an anti-aircraft platform (probably one of the ZSU series). The quad-cannons pretty much tore all the external components and treads off, rendering the vehicle blind and immobile.

<p>Some of the info is inaccurate anyway; Vlad Tepes is not his original name (it's a postmortem nickname). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_F._T._Cashin_ce3f.html" title="User:John F. T. Cashin">Schrödinger</a> 21:15, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Eventhough he is clearly not a hero like any other superhero, he is the main 'good' guy in this plot. His methods may be unorthodox. On the other hand I do agree that Alucard does not really need a superhero template, but that is just me.--84.27.26.118 12:43, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't dispute that he's the main protagonist of <i>Hellsing</i> (he's portrayed as noble, knight-like man with honor and conviction, although he's somewhat twisted). I just think the template is unnecessary and inappropriate, since he's not a superhero in any sense of the word and <i>Hellsing</i> is not a superhero comic. For now, though, I've cleaned up the info in the template until we decide to remove it or not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_F._T._Cashin_ce3f.html" title="User:John F. T.

<p>Why is there little information about Alucard between being Vlad Tepes and his release by Integra? I'm curious as to why if he is such a badass he was locked up and had the control restrictions implaced on him. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 06:05, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nothing behind his imprisonment has been said in the story so far. The only things are guesses amongst fans. Arthur's dialogue in chapter 72 appears to give a motive for this imprisonment as being voluntary, to help Alucard achieve a state of rest, or "temporary death" (which he longs for), while still keeping him around. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_G%C3%BCnsche_5368.html" title="User:Captain Günsche">Captain Günsche</a> 16:42, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alucard is <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html#Immortality_in_fiction" title="Immortality">Immortal</a>, according to wikipedia's definition, in the sense that he is not a mortal being like a human. Immortal does not necessary mean unkillable, just that the character is unaging and will not die from normal causes. If you look on the category page for Fictional Immortals you will notice that there are 3 types of subcategories: Gods, vampires, and elves. Vampires and elves are both killable, but are considered immortal because they don't die naturally. So, Alucard is immortal, or at least possesses limited immortality. Also, according to hellsing, vampires's immortality is a major selling point with the people the nazis recruit, so vampires are considered immortal within the hellsing universe as well.</p>
<p>Ugh, that was horribly written. Hopefully you all understand what I'm saying though.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 05:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd also recommend reading chapter 72 for further confirmation. Integra's father calls Alucard immortal a few dozen times. --12.218.150.28 19:51, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's an assumption, although not an unreasonable one. Dracula manipulates weather in both the novel and the Coppola film (and as we know, Hellsing is an AU continuation of the novel/film).

<p>"There are shown to be six levels of restriction and six corresponding states." Alucard never shows us anything other than 3 release states in the manga (even though he never releases to anything other than one or zero,) so shouldn't this be changed to something like this?: "In the anime there are shown to be six levels of restriction and six corresponding states, whereas in the manga there appear to be three."

<p>I just felt like pointing out that in Chapter 80 after Walter reverts to his 14 year old self, which may be a side effect of the process Doc preformed on him, Alucard voluntarily shifted into "Girlycard". I believe this is relevant on the debate of it being a stage of the "Control Art Restriction System". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.33.9.99_2a20.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.33.9.99">68.33.9.99</a> (talk) 18:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I remember how in the manga Alucard commented he had difficulty regenerating from Alumbra's cards. Also, when Alcucard summoned his army of familiars Anderson commented that is why he was hard to kill, he had somehow absorbed and had access to the life essense of so many beings. Finally, considering how Millenium, or at least Walter, is trying to kill Alucard with prolonged attacks and they have commented how they can overcome him is it possible there is a limit to how much he can regenerate? I know so far the final transformation of Father Anderson was the only thing able to seemingly do serious injury to Alucard, but if he is limited in someway to the nuber of people he has killed and he can only survive so many times before he is reduced back to standard vampire immortality shoudn't this be mentioned, or am I reading to much into this and Alucard is not in any danger at all and can reform his hellhound at a moment's notice?</p>
<p><br />
If you pay close attention to the fight with Anderson after he impaled himself with Helena's nail, Anderson's domination of the fight from that point is not his own doing. As soon as Seras convinced Alucard to marshal himself Alucard effortlessly beat Anderson.</p>
<p>The same can be seen in his fight against Walter when he seemingly gets over Walter's betrayal.</p>
<p>It all seems to be tied to his current state of mind, not so much a limit to his power limits.</p>

<p>Anyone care to comment on the trailer to the Hellsing anime? And the words on Alucard's coffin?</p>
<p>"I am hermes, I because tame by eating my wings."</p>
<p>and their resemblance to a quote from the Ripley Scroll?</p>
<p>"The Bird of Hermes is my name, Eating my wings to make me tame."</p>
<p>And the similarities in their physical appearance and transformations?</p>
<p>"In the Sea withouten lesse, Standeth the Bird of Hermes: Eating his Wings variable, And thereby maketh himself more stable; When all his Fethers be agon, He standeth still there as a stone; Here is now both White and Red,"</p>
<p>Or if you don't want to talk about that, how about the fact that at the end of the series Alucard fights "Set" who is an Egyptian god. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.136.32.196_6103.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.136.32.196">71.136.32.196</a> (talk) 08:01, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
