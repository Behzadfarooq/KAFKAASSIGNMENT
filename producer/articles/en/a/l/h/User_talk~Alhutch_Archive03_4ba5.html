<p>I noticed you just rolled back a couple changes by this anon. I'm not sure about that; I don't necessarily prefer the changes (which are really just a couple words), but they also don't seem like vandalism... rather likegood-faith attempts at clarification. Obviously, an anoymous editor is a red-flag. I see the same anon just added some words to the lead. This addition seems a tad on the verbose side, but I can see the clarification it's trying to get at. So I'm not exactly agreeing with whatever edits this anon makes, but I also don't think you should treat them as POV-mongering or vandalism automatically. Maybe find intermediate wording, or accept those changes that look OK to you rather than rollback. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 03:50, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:MKiwanuka.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below).

<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hi Alhutch/Archive03, thanks for participating in my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Proto_17cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Proto">RfA</a> discussion. Unfortunately, my fellow Wikipedians have decided at this time that I am not suitable to take on this additional responsibility, as the RfA failed with a result of 66/27/5 (71.0% support). If you voted in support of my request, <b>thank you</b>! If you decided to oppose me at this time, then I hope that if I do choose to reapply in the future, the effort I will make in the meantime to improve and expand my contributions to Wikipedia may persuade you to reconsider your position.

<dd>Are you running Windows? If so, see <a href="http://accs-net.com/hosts/how_to_use_hosts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://accs-net.com/hosts/how_to_use_hosts.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for some information about where a Hosts file would be located, if you have one. It's a long shot; someone would certainly have to be out to get you for this to be the problem. If you do find a hosts file, open it up in a text editor and see if it has any lines like "127.0.0.1 en.wikipedia.org". If so, remove those lines (or delete or rename the whole file.) If not, hmm... What else could it be? Are you running a personal firewall of any sort? Someone could have fiddled with that, I suppose. One idea to get more data would be to try going to a command line and typing "ping en.wikipedia.org", see what that gives you. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 20:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Found it, information on his surname "Randle El" <a href="http://media3.steelers.com/article/42086/" class="external free" title="http://media3.steelers.com/article/42086/" rel="nofollow">http://media3.steelers.com/article/42086/</a> and here <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moorish_science_temple.html#The_church.27s_practices" title="Moorish science temple">Moorish_science_temple#The_church.27s_practices</a>. Judging by this, I do believe his family obtained their surname through association with the Moorish Science Temple, a precursor to the Nation of Islam. And yes Randle El states in the interview that he is not a Muslim although some of his family members are.

<p>After much thinking (and reading) after the {{subst:user:no Rand}} discussion, I'm with you. Userboxes seem out of control. I have a few on my user page still, but not many, and I think the more divisive ones really are wrong for Wikipedia. I've initiated request for speedy deletion of Template:User_anti-fascism, which is just as divisive as the others (for example, I see that "no Marxism" was deleted today.) Please assist me in this first attempt. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_12#.5B.5BTemplate:User_anti-fascism.5D.5D" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_12#.5B.5BTemplate:User_anti-fascism.5D.5D" rel="nofollow">here</a> I know that you will because you seem to be a fair-minded person. Being a believer in fairness, I do, however, fully expect this one to be speedy deleted just as quickly as the others.

<p>Anti-fascism was meant for speedy deletion, but Zzyzx11 and the Aardvark reverted that tag a couple of times, noting that they simply don't want it to be speedy deleted. Is what's there now (a simple deletion tag) sufficient to ensure speedy deletion? I'm admitedly new at this process, but feel strongly about it, and need advice. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 23:37, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know, I had my heart set on speedy delete, in part, because in fairness, if other belief-boxes were deleted, so should this one - even if in mid-vote (as the others were.) I was going to point out ZZyzx11's comments to you. He seems like he's "in the loop" about the discussion and wasn't slanted one way or anothr on the issue. Glad you like the User List idea! I'm perfecting it now and will come up with a template soon and put it up for comment. Something like that could change the debate a bit, I think. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 00:15, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Indeed. Oregon is heaven on earth, apart from the occasional encounter with skinhead types. Mt. Hood takes one's breath away. I have yet to see any photo that does its beauty justice. Likewise with the countless waterfalls. I just wish there was a way to get to Lower Oneonta Falls without wading through chest-deep water. OK, since you're at B.U., I must ask about Nickerson Field, never having seen it in person. How much of it, if any, "feels" like the remnant of a 90-year-old baseball park (Braves Field)? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wondered if you could tell that the concrete is 9 decades old. Maybe they have it painted? I think Nickerson Field was one of the first outdoor stadiums, maybe <i>the</i> first, to get AstroTurf. So who was this cat Nickerson, and why did they name the stadium after him? Also, is it true that the old ticket office, with its Spanish-style tile roof and arched doorways, is the university police station?
<ul>
<li>Thank you. I wanted to add something to the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickerson_Field_65a8.html" title="Nickerson Field">Nickerson Field</a> article about where the name came from, and had been unable to find anything for some reason. Now that I know the name, I can do so (with confirmation first, of course). I gather the Spanish architecture is not a good fit with the rest of the campus? They did something similar with League Park in Cleveland, and it's in rather worse shape than the remnants of Braves Field. I'm of the belief that they should totally send old ballparks to baseball heaven, and not leave bits and pieces of them on earth to rust and ruin. Not only is the latter an undignified end, it's also often, as you say, an eyesore. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:13, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Now that I know the guy's full name and connection to Gillette, he's all over Google. I went ahead and added the info to the article. Now all I need is a photo of the joint. What are <i>you</i> doing today? Taking a stroll with your digital camera to take pictures of odd things requested by remote users, maybe? But maybe it also wouldn't be the ideal time for walking around outside. Maybe sometime later.

<li>That would be awesome. Thank you again. I wonder how "open" the stadium is on days where there are no events? Can someone just "wander around" without Security having a cow? Here's the minutia (sp?) I'm getting at, which might cause you to rethink your offer: The one remaining old bleacher section, i.e. the main south stand, looks pretty much normal from what I've seen. However, at one point there was a "notch" or "triangle" in it which the Braves had cut when they repositioned the foul lines a tad, right about where the 318 appears on this website's diagram <a href="http://www.andrewclem.com/Baseball/BravesField.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.andrewclem.com/Baseball/BravesField.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. That "triangle" was later filled in by B.U., and if I were there, one thing I would want to find out is how they did it... by checking it out from underneath. The reason is that I had heard some story that there were bolts under the stands holding that triangular piece together with the rest of the structure. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:05, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow, quick work! I suspect you're right, that the underpinnings are solid, or at least inaccessible to the general public. If you look at the diagram on the web page in the previous note, you'll see a right-triangular cut in the main bleacher section where that 318 indicator is. That triangle was apparently filled in soon after B.U. bought the property, and it's really a minor issue. I'm curious to know what's past those little arches. Does it take you right into the stadium property, or what? The photos I've seen always seem to be at the side (to show its location relative to the bleachers) rather than head-on, if you get my drift.

<li>Yes, those arches. From that website photo, it looks like they are "filled in", so never mind about that. That's a nifty web page. I had seen some even larger photos once, from similar angles, but the page they were on is evidently gone now. I'm guessing a number of folks have photo'd the old park for similar reasons. It's just another bit of vanishing Americana. The vibe you felt from standing on once-"hallowed" ground is similar to what I have felt in similar situations. We do idolize our sports in this country, even though it makes little rational sense. However, it's always interesting to stand in *any* historic place, and try to connect oneself with the past. About 12 1/2 years ago I was passing through Pittsburgh and took some photos of the remnants of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes_Field_090c.html" title="Forbes Field">Forbes Field</a> and also of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honus_Wagner_4380.html" title="Honus Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> statue at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Rivers_Stadium_8d1e.html" title="Three Rivers Stadium">Three Rivers Stadium</a>. The stadium was wide open, as they were prepping for a Billy Graham bash that night. Nobody stopped me from walking out into right field and standing where the great <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Clemente_e61c.html" title="Roberto Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a> stood. I think I'm missing spring as much as anything right now. It is roughly 15 degrees here in Minneapolis, up from about minus-8 on Friday night. d:( <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:52, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Looking at it again, that building is rather peculiar, isn't it? I'm thinking Spanish architecture must have been a fad in the 1910s. The original entryways to Wrigley Field also had a touch of Spanish architecutre to them. But this building looks like it belongs in Los Angeles or Houston or Miami or some such. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I follow your description OK. This definitely calls for a followup, except in warmer weather. That website is one I had not found before. It is similar to one called "ballpark project" or some such. The writer asserts that Fenway is a better place to watch a game than Wrigley. My brother, who got stick in seats in the shallow right field area a couple of summers ago, would beg to disagree. Fenway has a good chunk of seats that face the outfield. The sight lines at almost everyplace in Wrigley are good, near as I can tell. And I would guess that Fenway's seats are fairly cramped, like they were at the old Comiskey Park. One seldom-commented on fact about Wrigley is that it has exceptional leg room. If they squeezed as many seats and aisles into the available space as many of both old and new parks did and do, they could fit 50,000 onto the Clark and Addison property, easily. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:04, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for having my back on the whole Matt Leinart block thing; I guess we're even now. And I want to apologize for my crazy edit summaries as well... when it became clear that the guy was re-adding the "out of the closet" thing every 30 seconds, I guess I decided to spark an edit war and feed a troll, two things Wikipedians should never do. Maybe somewhere, somehow, someone will figure out a way to put an end to this thing. It passed "annoying" a mile back, sped right past "weird", and is now just flat-out "messed up". He "hasn't had time to post sources"? I scoff. Anyway, thanks again buddy. - Davis21Wylie 05:21, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Alhutch,</p>
<p>A short while ago I contributed an article to Wikipedia on the Canadian classical composer Nick Peros (it is my first contribution to Wikipedia). I recently noticed that someone had put a “notability notice” at the start of the article, and in the history section of the article had noted that there was a question of notability and that a third party should verify the notability of the subject.</p>
<p>I noticed that soon after the article was posted, you had visited the article and had done some minor editorial work on it, and I would like to ask if you could act as a third party to verify the notability of the subject, Nick Peros, as per the information and links below. I have sent a response to the editor (Pavel) who questioned the notability of the article, but it was my first time using the “discussion” feature and I want to make sure that my response is read and checked out by a Wikipedia editor (i.e. doesn’t get “lost” somewhere in cyberspace) so I am also sending this response to you and asking if you can help me out.</p>
<p>In the notability guidelines for music, Wikipedia states that any artist that has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country meets notability requirements. CRIA is the Canadian Recording Industry Association and is the body that giverns Record Certifictaion in Canada. If you go to the following link on the CRIA website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cria.ca/gold/0903_g.php" class="external free" title="http://www.cria.ca/gold/0903_g.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cria.ca/gold/0903_g.php</a></p>
<p>you can verify that O Canada- A Canadian Celebration is certified Platinum, as stated in the last paragraph of the Wikipedia Nick Peros article. Platinum Certification is a higher certifictaion than Gold, and as such meets that notability guideline.</p>
<p>The editor who has posted the notability notice referred to “claims of positive criticism”, implying that the positive criticisms listed in the article may not be accurate. For each critique listed in the article I have included a citation reference noting the name of the publication, the name of the reviewer and the date of publication. Most of these critiques/reviews are from hard copy newspaper reviews, however one of these critiques is from Classics Today. Classics Today is an internationally recognized and peer reviewed classical music site that focuses on critique and review of classical CD’s, and is often cited as a source for reliable and professional classical music critique by artists and major labels alike. If you go to the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.classicstoday.com/review.asp?ReviewNum=3538" class="external free" title="http://www.classicstoday.com/review.asp?ReviewNum=3538" rel="nofollow">http://www.classicstoday.com/review.asp?ReviewNum=3538</a></p>
<p>you can read the entire Classics Today review of the Nick Peros Motets CD which is excerpted in the Nick Peros Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>Wikipedia’s notability guidelines for Music also state that for composers, the composer has been the subject of a biography published as a book, or has several articles by at least 2 different authors in the peer reviewed publications.</p>
<p>As a composer, Nick Peros is the subject of a number of major articles in peer reveiwed and recognized music and arts publications. One such article was published in the national Canadian Arts Magazine Perfroming Arts Magazine – the Nick Peros article was in fact the cover story for that issue. You can read the article in full at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.looksmartclassical.com/p/articles/mi_m1319/is_n3_v31/ai_20931302" class="external free" title="http://www.looksmartclassical.com/p/articles/mi_m1319/is_n3_v31/ai_20931302" rel="nofollow">http://www.looksmartclassical.com/p/articles/mi_m1319/is_n3_v31/ai_20931302</a></p>
<p>Nick Peros was also the cover story for Wholenote Magazine’s September 1999 issue- I was unable to find a link to the article itself, however, if you visit the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thewholenote.com/wholenote_sep_99/musician_midst.html" class="external free" title="http://www.thewholenote.com/wholenote_sep_99/musician_midst.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewholenote.com/wholenote_sep_99/musician_midst.html</a></p>
<p>you will see that the Nick Peros Wholenote cover story is affirmed in this article which appeared in the same September 1999 issue as the Nick Peros cover story (see last sentence of second last paragraph of that article as listed on the above link: She thinks composers should present their own concerts, both as a practical way of getting performed and as a way of developing an audience for their work. (Interestingly, this is exactly what Nick Peros, our cover story, is doing this month). The article confirms that the cover story for Wholenote for that month- September 1999- is Nick Peros. Along with Opus Magazine and La Scena Musicale, the Toronto based Wholenote is one of Canada’s three main classical music magazines – peer reveiewed and recognized.</p>
<p>Nick Peros has also had a number of feature newspaper articles written on him and his work and published in various major newspapers, including The Toronto Star, Canada’s largest newspaper by circulation – if you go to the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422039631.html?did=422039631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Sep+7%2C+2002&amp;author=Geoff+Chapman&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Toronto+composer+creates+Sept.+11+work+%3B+Choral+memorial+to+debut+at+Washington%27s+National+Cathedral+at+Sept.+10+ceremony" class="external free" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422039631.html?did=422039631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Sep+7%2C+2002&amp;author=Geoff+Chapman&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Toronto+composer+creates+Sept.+11+work+%3B+Choral+memorial+to+debut+at+Washington%27s+National+Cathedral+at+Sept.+10+ceremony" rel="nofollow">http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422039631.html?did=422039631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Sep+7%2C+2002&amp;author=Geoff+Chapman&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Toronto+composer+creates+Sept.+11+work+%3B+Choral+memorial+to+debut+at+Washington%27s+National+Cathedral+at+Sept.+10+ceremony</a></p>
<p>you will find a feature Toronto Star article on Nick Peros’ composition and World Premiere concert of Prayer of Consolation, composed to commemorate the First Anniversary of September 11 and premiered in Washington National Cathedral, Washington DC.</p>
<p>Nick Peros has also been the subject of many shorter articles as well, but these two (Performaing Arts Magazine and Wholenote Magazine) are included as examples since they were both cover stories, and the Toronto Star link is included as The Star is Canada’s highest profile newspaper.</p>
<p>I would like to ask if you, as a Wikipedia editor, could visit the above links to verify the notability of Nick Peros for inclusion in Wikipedia- based on the above information and links, the notability of Nick Peros for inclusion in Wikipedia is verified and affirmed as Nick Peros meets the criteria of Platinum certifictaion (which is a higher certifictaion than Gold, and Gold certification or higher is listed as a music notability guideline); he has been the subject of a number of feature articles (magazines and newspapers) by different authors in peer reveiwed publications (also listed as a music notability guideline); the critical review notes listed in the Nick Peros Wikipedia article are accurate and verifiable, as per the Classics Today example. I would like to ask if, upon your review/verifictaion of the above information/links, you could remove the notability notice from the Nick Peros Wikipedia article and, in the history section for your edit/removal of that notice, state that you have verified the content/accuracy of the article.</p>
<p>Thanks Alhutch for your help in this – I understand that upholding the integrity of the editorial content of Wikipedia is of prime importance and I appreciate and respect the editorial/notability process. If you could reply to this note, I would appreciate it. Thanks again.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Hi Alhutch,</p>
<p>Thanks for your message in my Talk/discussion page, and thanks for verifying the notability of Nick Peros for my article, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I just had two other questions to ask you – currently a tag for “cleanup” remains on the article (it was inserted there by the earlier editor as a result of his concerns re. notability). In reading through the article, though, I believe that it does have the formal tone of an encyclopedia- I’ve tried very carefully to keep subjectivity out of the article and keep it strictly factual with proper grammar, article structure, etc- and I believe that it fulfills these goals (I saw the minor edit that you did on the term “great expressiveness” and I would agree with you that your edit does read more objectively, so thanks for that). I’ve read through many Wikipedia articles to compare style, form, etc, and I believe that the Nick Peros article meets a professional standard of writing. Do you have any suggestions to make? I would expect that in your recent reading/editing of the article that if you had spotted any other points that needed editing/clean-up you would have addressed those, so if the article is not in need of any further clean-up, would you able to remove the cleanup tag? (I don’t know if I’m allowed to do that since I wrote the article and I don’t want to give an appearance of vanity editing, so if removal of the clean-up tag came from you or another editor I think it would help uphold Wikipedia integrity).</p>
<p>Secondly, the previous editor, who had a concern about the notability, also removed all of the internal WIKI links that I had made for Nick Peros in other articles – i.e. “List of 20th Century Composers”; “List of 21st Century Composers”; “List of Composers for the Classical Guitar”; “List of Solo Piano Pieces by Composer P”; “List of Contemporary Solo Piano Pieces”; “List of Croats” (although Nick Peros is Canadian, his ethnicity is Croatian). As I understand it, I do not believe that adding a notable name to lists such as these would constitute spam – I checked out the WIKI guide on spam and it states that editors should be careful about removing material that is included as a statement of fact – the internal WIKI links/edits that I made were factual, objective and, I believe, appropriate. Would you be able to check my original Nick Peros links/edits to the above articles and, if you felt they were warranted, would it be possible to reinstate those link entries? (I had also included a few Peros links to other WIKI articles on related subjects - i.e. poetry and song, motet- that I believed were appropriate, but that were also removed – in retrospect, though, I can see how those particular internal links may have had an appearance of “promotion” so I will defer to Pavel’s editorial judgment on those particular links, but I think the Peros links/edits/inclusions on the List articles noted above should be fine and would not constitute spam).</p>
<p>Also, thanks for your encouraging words! This is my first Wikipedia article and the whole process is new to me, so thanks for all the help- I really appreciate it. My own interest lies in classical music and poetry, so I may be slowly ramping up for some further contributions (however I take the issue of factual verifiability very seriously and so I want to be careful that anything included in an article has verifiable sources, so I’ll be taking my time with future contributions; I’m also looking at adding a pic to the Peros article, so that will be another first for me). I read that you have written/ edited/contributed to over 1,000 Wikipedia articles – that’s pretty phenomenal! How long have you been involved with Wiki? Thanks again for all your help – have a great day!</p>

<p>Thanks for looking into this and removing the clean-up tag, and for everything else. I'll reinstate the Peros links/edits to those List articles.</p>
<p>You have been so very helpful - a lot of this online stuff can be pretty daunting sometimes, especially to a novice like myself, so your guidance &amp; help has been invaluable - take are &amp; have a great day!</p>

<p>Just a quick msg, I note you just deleted Image:Wendy and Lucy.jpg with explanation <i>(no license data, been 7 days)</i>. The image had, in fact, only been uploaded less than an hour ago at 16:52 today. I'd therefore added a {{<a href="../../../n/l/d/Template%7ENld_3ee8.html" title="Template:Nld">nld</a>}} tag, and notified the uploader, and they should have been given seven days before the image was deleted. Just thought I'd let you know, I'm not too concerned since it was most likely a copyvio. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 17:17, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alhutch.

I should have just tagged them all <i>no license</i> to start with, but I wanted to give the uploader a forum (which apparently they didn't want). Anyway, would you consider deleting them now? Quadell is on a semi-wikibreak, I'd rather not do it myself, and it seems like <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> to tag them now and wait another 7 days.

<p>Excuse me! I have no idea how to use your program yet, so it takes a little time to figure it out. There was NO copyright violation. The Roland Morris page was printed WITH permission. You gave no chance for me to state that fact. This is a little agravating when a person doesn't want to spend all day messing with this.</p>
<p>WE are the Morris Family. Roland Morris was the subject. WE wrote the articles on both pages. There is NO copyright problem. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Morris Family (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorris_Family_8a2c.html" title="User talk:Morris Family">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morris_Family_16ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morris Family">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Hello - I've attempted to go to the history of the Roland John Morris, Sr. article to obtain it's early, good version; the one just before the speed delete message occured. However, what appears in the history is not the name "Roland John Morris, Sr." but "Morris Family". As a result, the program reports that there is no history of a "Morris Family" article. And nothing shows me the original Roland Morris article. Was there an error somewhere, or am I confused as to where I am to be looking? Thanks Morris Family 21:39, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe you are correct about unblocking "repaired" open proxies but lately there's been a rash of open-proxy attacks on the Jyllands cartoons article and this IP is probably a part of that parttern. My recommendation would be to review <a href="../../../n/o/p/WP%7ENOP_fa61.html" title="WP:NOP">WP:NOP</a> and also <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WM:NOP" class="extiw" title="m:WM:NOP">m:WM:NOP</a>.
