<p><br />

<p><br />

He also holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) Degree from University of Pittsburgh (1982) where he was invited to the Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Fraternity. He also proceeded to the famous Harvard Business School to earn a Certificate in the Advanced Management Program (AMP) in 1990.</p>
<p><br />
<b>A Career in Banking</b></p>
<p>An accomplished banker, Mallam Bello started his career in 1976 as an Investment Executive with the New Nigerian Development Company (NNDC). Between 1976 and 1981, he rose to become the General Manager of New-Devco Finance, a subsidiary of NNDC. In 1983, Mallam Bello joined Habib Bank as Deputy Managing Director and rose to become Managing Director and Chief Executive in 1988. He held the position until 1994. During his time at Habib Bank, the bank rose to become the best rated private bank in the country and ninth overall. He then proceeded to become a financial adviser, a real estate mogul and major shareholder in numerous ventures until his nomination as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Intercity Bank Plc in 1998. This was then followed by his appointment as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Habib Nigeria Bank Ltd in 1999. Having been the first indigenous Chief Executive Officer of the company, he knew the direction of the bank and served to his full capacity. It was from this position that he received his nomination as the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo in January 2001. Having reached the pinnacle of his banking career, he accepted the national assignment. Habib Bank merged with Platinum Bank in December 2005 to form Bank PHB. Intercity Bank also merged to become Unity Bank Plc under the banking industry consolidation exercise.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development</b></p>
<p>Mallam Adamu Bello became the honourable minister of agriculture and rural development in February 2001. During Mallam Bello’s tenure, the Ministry become a true force in regulating and ensuring the attractiveness of the Nigerian agricultural sector. There has also been the invitation of numerous agricultural experts to improve the operation of the sector in general. The general positive direction of the agricultural sector reinforced President Obasanjo’s renomination of Mallam Bello to retain his position after being re-elected in May 2003. With the support of the president, also a farmer, Mallam Bello has been able to accomplish many initiatives to better the conditions of the Nigerian farmer. They include cassava, cocoa and many others. The growth rate of the agriculture sector has moved from 4% in 2001 to 14% in 2006. In the area of rural development, the ministry has been able to improve conditions of rural areas, where most of the agriculture occurs. This is through improving their road network to urban markets and also through the provision of water facilities to aid the irrigation of farmlands. This was done independently or sometimes, in conjunction with the Ministry of Water Resources and also with the United Nations. His effectiveness in his portfolio has made him the longest serving Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria ever. It has also seen him become the longest serving member of the Federal Cabinet along with Chief Babalola Borishade and Prof. Turner Isoun.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Water Resources Portfolio</b></p>
<p>In January 2007, the number of ministries was decreased to 19 from the previous number of 34. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development AND the Ministry of Water Resources were merged to become the largest project ministry. Mallam Adamu Bello now became the substantive minister of Agriculture and Water Resources with two Ministers of State.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Controversy</b></p>
<p>With every position comes its controversy. Mallam Adamu Bello is more a technocrat than politician but he has handled well in controversial situations. One of such occurred barely four months after his assumption of office when he decided along with the Federal Cabinet that Nigeria must import a few million tons of Beans from the country of Burkina Faso. The reasons were well founded but were harshly taken by the media who called for his resignation. Reasons for Beans import from Burkina Faso <a href="http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/oarticles/obasanjo_declares_a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/oarticles/obasanjo_declares_a.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Another controversy was faced when the former Chariman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Senator Bode Olowoporoku alleged that the minister connived with foreigners to dupe the country in a 3.4 Billion Naira scandal over fertilizer imports. A bag of fertilizer was said to cost N1500 in Ukraine, the main import country and was said to be sold by the ministry for N2800 with a margin on each taken by the minister. He explained to the Federal Cabinet the reasons for the disparity to include transport and duties cost of the process of moving fertilizer from the Ukraine to Nigeria. They accepted his explanation with his presentation of documentation to that effect. The case was dismissed by both the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) and ICPC (Independent Corrupt Practices Commision). Senator Olowoporoku still continued with his proceedings against the minister even walking out the Minister of State of Agriculture, Chief Bamidele Dada from the Senate chambers when he came to explain. Mallam Bello expressed that Olowoporoku must has a vendetta against him over not being awarded fertilizer contracts during the process that may have earned him N200 million. The senator denied this saying “I have never requested contracts from the Ministry in my position as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria”. Evidence was presented of his two letter-headed requests with his signature. He dismissed the evidence as his attempt of helping some of associates of his. The Corporate Affairs Commission however disclosed that he registered both companies and his wife was listed as the CEO and Managing Director. This exposed the vendetta. The Senate relieved Chief Olowoporoku of his position as the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. He was also excluded from membership in all committees. This was subsequent to his eventual dismissal from the ruling political party, the Peoples Democratic Party. The media capitalized on making an opera of the situation. Details of the alleged scandal: <a href="http://www.gamji.com/article4000/NEWS4715.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamji.com/article4000/NEWS4715.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p><br />
<b>Titles and Conferment</b></p>
<p>Mallam Adamu Bello was conferred with the chieftancy title of the “Dan Iyan Adamawa” in 1989 by the chieftancy council of his native Gongola State (Adamawa and Taraba States) at the time. In 2003, he also received another chieftancy title; “Otun Babalakin” in Ekiti State. Mallam Adamu Bello was made a fellow of the Chartered institute of Bankers of Nigeria (FCIB) in 1991. He was also conferred with an Honorary Doctorate (Honoris Causa) by the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (Lautech) of Oyo State.

Mallam Bello is a recipient of numerous leadership awards. He has also distinguished himself in receiving numerous nominations for Minister of the Year Awards by numerous media bodies in Nigeria.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Personal Qualities</b></p>
<p>Mallam (Dr.) Adamu Bello FCIB CFR (Dan Iyan Adamawa) has remained a very modest man despite having reached the pinnacle of everything he has set out to do. He threads softly and is not known to generate enemies. His substantial financial wealth before being appointed to the Federal Cabinet has been a guide for him expressing his true opinions to the president without the thought of a down side. Always a soft spoken humble man of considerable media shyness, he lets his actions do the talking. Dr. Bello has represented Nigeria in many conferences such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. He has also been known to sometimes receive the Presidents of other countries on behalf of President of Nigeria.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Elections 2007</b></p>
<p>Mallam Adamu Bello has resisted pressures to compete for any political office in the country for the next dispensation. He has however resolved to see to the continuation of the Obasanjo administration programs and policies to the next administration through the victory of the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. He is the representative member of the Federal Cabinet in the campaign organization. Mallam Bello can be expected to continue to make an impact in the governance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
