<p>Since its conquest by Louis XIV, Alsace has been more loyal to France than German, because Louis XIV freed the serfs thus allowing greater growth and freedom.

<dd>Alsace is a very good exemple for forced assimilation of minority populations. Maybe it's the best exemple of mass-brainwashing of an ethnical group in Europe. While the Alsatians where definitely German in speech, culture and language for more than a milenia, the French occupation wiped out them ethnical and national identity and forced them to become "good French citizens".</dd>
<dd>If we compare the situation of the German speking Alsatians with the situation of Transsylvanian Hungarians of Romania, we should ask very seriousely: Why the Latin Romanians have been so tolerant and democratic in manners of conduct with the minorities since centuries and why the Latin French have not?</dd>
<dd>In Transsylvania, since the XI-th century, the Hungarians settled among the large Romanian populations, as conquerors and privileged social strata. Before 1918, the "Transsylvanian-style apartheid" prevented the entering of the Romanian majoritary populations into the cities and into the profitable bussiness of Transsylvania. Even so, the Romanians constantly developed into a democratic and liberal minded community. The union of Transsylvania with Romania, after the WWI meant the introduction of Universal Vote for all citizens, the end of "Hungarian style apartheid" and cultural and national freedom for all the ethnical groups. The Romanians granted and ensured free State-sponsored Hungarian schools for all, cultural freedom, freedom of speech and freedom of settlement. The Hungarian speaking schools, theaters, cultural foundations and papers are largely sponsored by the Romanian State (1920-2006 - period). During the Communist regime, the Hungarians where largely over-represented into the Romanian Communist Party (20% of the membership, compared with abb. 7% of the total population).</dd>
<dd>After 1990, the Positive Discrimination Policies are favoring the Hungarians in school, university and job enrolement, even that the economical situation of the Hungarian minority was always slightly better than that of the Romanian majority. The official use of Hungarian language is granted in every community made of at least 20% Hungarians. The Hungarian language is used in justice, administration and culture; 15% of the actual Romanian Government personell (2006)is made of Hungarians (the Hungarians are 6.5% of the Romania's population as compared with 89.4% Romanians - data of 2006). Today, in 2006, the Hungarians are 19% of the Transsylvanian population (compared to 75% Romanians).</dd>
<dd>What is very strange is the fact that in France one can read and hire, among "intelectual and educated societies" complains about the "bad situation of the Hungarians in Romania" but not a single complain about the forced assimilation of the poor German-speaking Alsatians.

<p>Revisions for NPOV. I suggest the NPOV tag now be removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Alsace and Lorraine were reunited with Germany after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870" - corrected; Germany did not exist before 1870 so there was no question of reunification</li>
<li>"After World War I those Alsatian, who moved in from other parts of Germany, were expelled. The re-establishment of German identity was reversed following the German surrender in 1918." &gt; "After World War I the re-establishment of German identity in Alsace was reversed, while Alsatians who came originally from Germany were expelled." I.e., "other parts of" removed</li>
<li>"while putting a halt to the anti-German oppression" = "oppression" changed to "discrimination", a correct and less emotive term</li>
<li>"The war-torn area was given again in 1944 to France, which had then free hands to restore its policies." &gt; "..which restored its policy of promoting the French language."</li>

<p>The flaws run far deeper than a few offensive expressions. As I suggested at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Talk%7ELorraine_eb29.html" title="Talk:Lorraine">Talk:Lorraine</a>, we need a discussion of the Alsace-Lorraine issue. The problem is that the "two sisters" have immense potency as nationalist symbols on both sides of the border, and both sides try to paint the regions as "really French" or "really German", when in fact they were neither for most of the history, because nationalism hadn't been invented yet. And the "anti-German" policies were not anti-German, but standard French republican centralization and homogenizing -- the same process going on in Provence, Bretagne, etc. --<a href="../../../t/k/i/User%7ETkinias_6e4b.html" title="User:Tkinias">Tkinias</a> 14:09, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a silly argument, we're talking about anti-German culture, not anti-German government. German culture, despite your claims to the contrary, did indeed exist and has existed for a very long time. And because the French also executed the same policies in other areas does not mean that they are somehow not descriminitory. Indeed to this day the French government has been attempting to cleanse ("homogenize" if this is your preferred euphemism) minority languages throughout France. Unless you're a staunch nationalist I see it diffucult to say how you could honestly describe the specific banning of a language as not being discriminatory. It's as if a racist were to say "I don't hate black people, I just want to homogenize everyone so they are white" <a href="../../../h/v/a/User%7EHvatum_bc7c.html" title="User:Hvatum">Hvatum</a> 02:36, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. It is clearly a more complex issue than simply one of two colliding nationalisms. But as to the question of whether the article is even-handed, I can't find anything factually suspect. And the tone seems to me reasonably fair to both sides. Now it would seem to be just a question of adding a section to highlight the points you raise. --<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollo_93cc.html" title="User:Rollo">Rollo</a> 10:31, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/s/Talk%7EAlsace_9b66.html" title="Edit section: Alsace/Elsass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alsace/Elsass</span></h2>
<p>Alsace was part of the German-speaking territory of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when most of it was wrested from the Emperor by the King of France in the Treaty of Westphalia which concluded the Thirty Years' War. The Emperor ceded Alsace outright to avoid having the King of France as member of his estates. Later in the same century, Strasbourg was also seized by Louis XIV, who reinstated Catholicism.</p>
<p>Whilst Alsace is largely German-speaking (and, strictly speaking, most German speakers do not speak Standard German but Alsatian dialect, a dialect identifiable as German without any doubt whatsoever), it is difficult to say whether it is definitely 'German' or 'French'. The German-speaking Alsatians share a status similar to that of German-speaking Austrians in the Southern Tirol, i.e. they are part of a geographically continuous German speech community but find themselves located in a neighbouring state with an unrelated national language. One may ask to what extent German-speaking South Tiroleans look to Vienna rather than Rome, and in the same way the German-speaking Alsatians look to Berlin.</p>
<p>The following points may be of note.</p>
<p>1. The first-ever printed German Bible was published in Strasbourg in 1466 . During the 16th century, there were probably in excess of 3000 books printed in Strasbourg. Of those known, only three were in French. The rest were in German (the vast majority), Latin or other languages such as Greek. Strasbourg was a very important centre of German protestantism and many of Luther's works were published there during the sixteenth century. These facts, along with the existence of Albert Schweitzer, tend to be overlooked by histories written in French.</p>
<p>2. A German nationhood or even nationality was only just begining to emerge within the multi-ethnic and multi-lingual Holy Roman Empire in the 17th century. Therefore it would not be correct to say 'a part of Germany was siezed by the French', but that is not to say that Alsace could never have been described as 'German'. It was very firmly entrenched in German cultural influence. More important to the ordinary Alsatian in the 17th century were his freedoms.</p>
<p>3. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Austrian Emperor refused to let Alsace become part of Prussia for fear of Prussian strength. Through this most unlikely demonstration of generosity to the French, Alsace remained part of France.</p>
<p>4. Alsatian German was the main language of most people until the twentieth century; however, the ruling classes and wealthier middle classes tended to speak French in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>5. It may well be the case that German and French languages acquired a social connotation during the 19th century, and emerging social conflict therefore exacerbates the language and national question.</p>
<p>6. When Alsace-Lorraine was reunited with the German-speaking world in the German Reich under Bismark in 1871, its status was inferior to other German Länder. It had far less representation than others and it was a personal domain of the Kaiser. It was termed 'Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen'.</p>
<p>7. There were migrations from Alsace of wealthier French speakers at this time, and many German-speakers moved in from Germany proper. At this time, standard German became the official language, but it is not correct to say that French was banned or ignored. There was a (albeit unequal) dual lingualism.</p>
<p>8. Through its membership of the German Reich, the region developed and industrialised, and there are many monuments to this period (1871-1919), such as the railways, the Postal Service, the 'Ville Allemande' in Strasbourg, etc. The population grew and the region prospered. The University of Strasbourg was founded.</p>
<p>9. Where the sympathies of the Alsatians lay at the outbreak of the First World War is hard to say. They were enlisted to fight for the German Reich, of course, and did so often in the remote East (East Prussia). This may, or may not, be a token of the German Army's uncertainty about their loyalties. Often Alsatians were described unflatteringly by officers. It is hard to say whether the population of Alsace as a whole welcomed German defeat and its subsequent reincorporation into France or resented it. There was undoubtedly a mixture, and it depended largely who you were and what you had to gain or lose.</p>
<p>10. After the First World War, significantly, the French refused a plebiscite in the region and expelled all Germans who had settled there during 1871-1919. This was an early example of 'ethnic cleansing'.</p>
<p>11. The German language was suppressed in the period between the World Wars.</p>
<p>12. Undoubtedly, German rule 1940-44 was uncompromising. Again, no plebiscite was granted after the Second World War, unlike the Saar region.</p>
<p>13. It seems strange, at least to the eye, to imagine an historian as eminent as Phillipe Dollinger arguing for France with such a German name; it is odder to find Alsatian speakers with German names saying they are definitely French. During the Wilhelmine period, over 80% of the region described itself as German-speaking in the censuses.</p>
<p>14. There have been movements for autonomy since the 19th century.</p>
<p>15. In conclusion, it is possible to say, on balance, that Alsace, and Strasbourg, belong traditionally to the German Kulturkreis. However, it was never part of a German nation state except for the period 1871-1919. It is interesting to speculate how a plebiscite might have gone after the First World War. After the Second World War, German became 'unfashionable' as the language of dictatorship, and French was eagerly embraced by the inhabitants. This is now giving way to a cautious resurgence of interest in German roots and Alsatian dialect. Standard German is now being favoured in schools. However, this may undermine, rather than strengthen, dialect. In the cities, virtually all speak French and German is not heard that often. French people as a whole are far more sensitive about Alsace than Germans; e.g. a museum worker in the Museum of Alsatian Life in Strasbourg reacted indignantly when he was asked about the state of the German language in Strasbourg. His reply was 'ce n'est pas l'allemand, c'est l'alsacien!' The French never want really to use the word 'German' in connexion with Alsace. (The Germans are far more sentimental about the loss of their Eastern Territories (East Prussia, Danzig, Pomerania and Silesia) than they are about Alsace-Lorraine.)</p>
<p>16. Finally, it is worth noting that the French have always had a far more prescriptive and illiberal language policy when compared to the Germans. Native historians have always tended to be biased about the affiliation of Alsace. We need to remember, too, that language does not define nationality, contrary to what the French King Francois I proposed in the 16th century.</p>

<p>I have read that Alsace (and the northern part of Lorraine) is exempt from the 1905 French separation of church and state because it was part of the German Empire at that time. Instead, when it was retaken by France it continued to follow the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801, under which Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergy are paid by the state.</p>

<dd>Yes please do so, this article has too many weasel words for my taste. I removed the "felt obliged" phrase. A summary of German/French language dominance after a war does not need redundant and emotionally charged wordings such as "Felt Obliged (to speak French)" - Why or how did they "feel obliged"? Or "Were forced to speak German" - in what way were they "Forced" to speak German. We're dealing with facts here, not opinions.</dd>

<p>I'm an Alsacian and I'm living in this land for ever, all my ancestor since the year 1512 are alsacian... so I know more than you about Alsace's History. So trust me, Alsace righfuly belongs to France.</p>
<p>I totaly agree that Alsace used to be a part of the German Empire but <b>Alsacian don't feel and don't want to be german&#160;!!! That's all&#160;!!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Village's name are german, i agree, but there are thousands years old&#160;; and in the article, you are speaking about actual alsacian and on this last point, i'm at odds with you beacause actual alsacian are totally agree with the fact to be a part of France&#160;!!! no-one there want to be german!!!</b></p>

<dd>I agree that the above comment is very POV. But he is basically right. I'm also Alsatian and you guys simply don't understand the situation. The posted article provides information that does NOT reflect the reality of Alsace, because people fail to distinguish cultural, historical and political aspects of the question. Here's how I see it:</dd>
<dd>- Alsace's historical culture is Germanic. Please note that I use the word Germanic, not German. In French, the distinction is clear because the respective words are germanique and allemand. Lot of people here fail to grasp the nuance. Germanic relates to culture, German relates to the nation. Anyway, Alsace was culturally Germanic, as reflected by its gastronomy, its local language, a lot of its architecture, the names of villages and people... You will not find many people, in or out of Alsace, to disagree with this.</dd>
<dd>- Alsace is politically French. Here's why. Alsace has historically been populated by merchants, artisans and bourgeois, the people who were denied power by the aristocracy. There is no strong aristocratic tradition in Alsace. Thus, it flourished as a fairly independent state of the Holy Roman Empire. Louis XIV's efforts to impose customs were understandably rejected because the region had flourished through trade. Because of their situation, the Alsatians welcomed the fall of the monarchy 200 years later. Look at the military leaders they provided France under the revolution and Napoleon: Kléber, Lefèbvre, Kellerman... Thus, I would say that in terms of philosophical and political orientation, Alsace became closer to France. It's true that we have special legal status for quite a few things, but that doesn't change the fact that Alsace identifies more with the laws and political traditions of France than those of Germany.</dd>
<dd>So to answer the question of whether Alsace is "really" French or German, I would say that it is politically French, but has Germanic (NOT GERMAN) cultural roots. Let me add that the Germanic culture is waning and that just by dint of being a well-integrated French province for the last 60 years, all that remains of Germanic culture is historical. Alsatians today rarely consider themselves personally culturally Germanic.</dd>

<p>Here are a few minor changes i've made to the culture section: - saying Alsace is historically part of the Holy Roman Empire makes no sense, one could just as well say that Alsace and France were both historically Frankish/Germanic, but the region developped its own identity and culture, the HRE is only a part of it. I feel the rest of the article makes this clear. - Alsatian is not really most similar to Swiss German - "More often assumed to be bilingual": not really, not more so than Bretagne or Corsica. I'm changing it to "sometimes" - rephrased other stuff in language paragraph - rewrote paragraph on German Axel 19:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
