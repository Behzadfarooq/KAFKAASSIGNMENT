The churches despise the power of traditional <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_religion.html" title="African religion">African religion</a>, because they deem that power to be basically malign. Therefore they sometimes burn <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_image.html" title="Cult image">cult images</a> as "<a href="../../../i/d/o/Idolatry.html" title="Idolatry">idols</a>" and oppose both <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>.

Today, although most churches in Nigeria can be classified as "Aladura", especially the Pentecostals, there are four pioneering Churches, three of which are also called "White Garment" Churches. The four churches are:</p>

<p>The first Aladura Movement started at Ijebu-Ode, Nigeria in 1918 by Sophia Odunlami, a school teacher, and Joseph Sadare, a goldsmith. They both attended St. Saviour's Anglican Church. They rejected infant baptism and all forms of medicine, whether western or traditional. In consequence, they initiated the "Prayer Band", popularly called "Egbe Aladura". Mr Joseph Sadare was compelled to give up his post in the Synod and others were forced to resign their jobs and to withdraw their children from the Anglican School. The Aladura began as a renewal movement in search of true spirituality.</p>
<p>A revival took place in 1918 during the outbreak of influenza epidemic. The group filled with the Holy Ghost used prayer to save many lives affected by the Influenza epidemic. This consolidated the formation of the prayer group. This movement grew gradually and formed branches throughout Nigeria. Also, the name of the group went through several changes, such as Prayer Band, Precious Stone, Diamond Society, and Faith Tabernacle, in that order until 1930. A great revival started in July 1930 by the raising of a dead body by Apostle Joseph Ayo Babalola at Oke-Oye in Ilesa. People trooped from neighbouring cities and countries to receive healing at Ilesa. Several people were healed through the power of prayer and there were evidences of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The revival lasted about 60 days and it's still regarded as the greatest revival ever in Nigeria. Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria later invited the Apostolic Church of England in 1931 to form an Association which lasted till 1939. The Revival group went through several name changes until, after 24 years of its formation, it finally adopted the name Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) in 1942. Today, CAC has spread worldwide and definitely is the precursor of Aladura Pentecostal Churches in Nigeria. Visit [CAC website] at <a href="http://www.cacworldwide.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.cacworldwide.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cacworldwide.net/</a>. The Church has established several schools at all levels, including Joseph Ayo Babalola University.</p>

<p>Moses Orimolade, who was later called Baba Aladura, or Praying Father and Christiana Abiodun Akinsowan, called Captain Abiodun founded the Cherubim and Seraphim society in 1925, also as a prayer group within the Anglican Church. Christiana Abiodun fell into a trance from which Moses Orimolade, who was already an itinerant evangelist and teacher, was the only one who could awaken her. By 1928 they had left the Anglican church to become independent. Their most distinctive ministry was to openly ferret out and challenge witches on their long evangelistic journeys through the countryside. These long trips were typical of Seraphim (as they are most commonly called) evangelists and missionaries.</p>

<p>The Church was founded in 1930 by Josiah Ositelu, an Ijebu. Ositelu was an Anglican teacher and catechist who claimed to have received over 10,000 visions in the course of nine years. The content of his visions led to his being dismissed by the CMS mission which had hired him. He believed he was haunted by witches, but managed to overcome them by prayer and fasting. One of his visions instructed him and his followers not to eat pork or any other unclean thing. Ositelu also kept a journal in a secret script that God had revealed to him in a vision, and used a large number of Holy Names and Seals which he also claimed had been revealed to him by God. [This use of Holy Names and Seals may well reflect the influence of such occult texts as the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses. Each of these Holy Names began with his personal revealed name Arrabablalhhubab.</p>

<p>The Celestial Church of Christ (usually known as Cele) was founded in 1947 by a humble carpenter in Porto Novo, Samuel Oschoffa. It is the most popular, most attractive and most influential of the Aladura churches today, in part because of the winsome personality of Papa Oschoffa.</p>
