<p>Any chance I might persuade you to reconsider your opposition? Since I was nominated, I'd like it to pass. You seem to be principally concerned with the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> guideline, and indeed I think this guideline has been frequently misapplied. However, it <i>really is</i> a guideline, analogous to <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a> or the like, not a policy... the problem, to my mind, is that some editors act as if it is policy, and throw out rational judgement. For that matter, they refrain from <i>reading</i> the policy, which speaks of conditions where it's generally "wise to refrain" from autobiographical editing, but the guideline does not <i>prohibit</i> doing so (despite the widespread misreading or non-reading). Yeah... this is something I feel strongly about.</p>
<p>I certainly cannot in good faith make any recusal from editing <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mertz_f5c3.html" title="David Mertz">David Mertz</a>. I may well, in practice, not do so, since it doesn't look like there's going to be anything needing fixing, and it's watchlisted against vandalism by enough editors now. But the principle is just simply wrong, and winning adminship is not worth violating my principles, and more importantly, encyclopedic principles (though it seems pretty clear I could win some votes by telling an untrue sob story about how wrong I was to edit the page on me while conforming with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). That's not going to change with a couple months, or a year, or a decade: an unreflective ban on editors working on topics they are knowledgeable is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am <i>absolutely</i> and <i>completely</i> committed to upholding all of WP's <i>policies</i>, whether or not I am promoted to adminship. About half the oppose votes stem from my uncompromising insistence on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Insisting on this at controversial pages, frankly, wins "enemies" who wish to push particular POVs. If I only had an editing history at non-politicized topics, these complaints would not have occurred. But it happens that I am one of those editors who is "in the trenches" trying to obtain NPOV on "hot button" topics. I answer one of the nomination questions about this matter... it seems a bit wrong to me that editors who are experienced with resolving politicized articles to NPOV are <i>de facto</i> barred from adminship. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you're still of the view that the original deletion of the unused stub type is in want of "Some reason for speedy supplied", your "vote" would seem to be the telling one, and I'm wondering if I shouldn't just speedily undelete it, so that it can be very sloooowly re-deleted on SFD, otherwise the process is simply being drawn out yet longer. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 17:07, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I see this was a newly create (and never proposed) stub, rather than a formerly used one that was emptied via stub-sorting and/or expansion of stubs, I will withdraw my opposition at DRV and let this stay deelted, but I think we should be more carful and consistant in the future. I think that if a properly created and used stub type happens to become empty, it should not be subject to speedy deletion because of the possibility that more such stubs will come along.

<p>Sigh. Is there a name for it when someone loud and quasi-hysterical starts to agree with you? And does that mean that the initial concerns are, by definition, equally asinine? And<sup><small>2</small></sup> is it just me or is it becoming increasingly acceptable to do or say whatever you want as long as you are "right"? I'm going to go have a Becks and a lie-down before someone else insane agrees with me.<br />

<dd>Hi... thanks re the UB's; they are there partly for fun and partly to show my side in the UB wars. No complaints so far... I was in NZ recently, they don't much like stoats there, introduced specias and all&#160;:-(. Meanwhile... I've left a comment re block length for Gibby on the 3RR page. Question for you: policy is still up-to-24h for 3RR; you gave 48, based on 3RR+civility; but I think I've noticed some 48+ blocks for repeated 3RR. If you're watching that... is policy developing, informally?</dd>

<p>Wow, you live in Ireland. I've never been -- just to Italy, where I was mesmerized by Pompeii and, as you can see, Herculaneum.</p>
<p>Thank you very, very much for welcoming me. I've been reading ALOT about the Wikipedia. I came to it because of my guilty pleasure, a comic book called Daredevil, and I was reading about it here and thought, well, why not? There's a teenager over there called GodzillaWax, though, who uses a lot of really ugly, vulgar language -- Beavis and Butthead stuff about oral sex and "Virgin Brigade balls dropping". I don't even like typing these things. I'm a woman who lives in New York City so I'm not shocked, just surprised and disappointed. I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds; I'm new here and I have to read the Policies and Guidelines, but is that the kind of discussion the usual thing? Your kind politeness is the only thing that has made me think so far that the Wikipedia is welcoming to women.

<p>Why did you unblock user <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadbryant_f5a9.html" title="User:Chadbryant">Chadbryant</a>? As you can see from his history list, he has placed a sockpuppet accusation on well over 50 or more User accounts within a one-hour period. He has a suspected history of using sockpuppets over the last three days; however, when others have made their suspicions known on the accounts in question, he has erased them. Therefore he will place the sockpuppet accusation on User accounts at his whim, but others cannot do the same for him? At any rate, he does not have the authority to place the flag on ANY account, and it should be noted that he never places a warning of any kind on the talk pages of these users. He simply places the sockpuppet accusation. It clutters up the user page, is blatant vandalism, and he should not be allowed to get away with such devious and misanthropic behavior. --166.102.104.75 03:10, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Third parties often assume that whoever runs to them for help must be the victim. Some bullies, therefore, have learned to take advantage of this by bullying, then immediately running for help.</dd>
<dd>The reality, Loxley, is that you are the bully, and your sole purpose is to spread anti-Dennett POV wherever you go. In fact, you actually left an Edit Summary on your latest revert to Multiple drafts model, admitting that your goal was to insert an "explanation of why Multiple Drafts is not taught except as a curiosity". Of course, multiple drafts is taught as a viable theory, though hardly an uncontroversial one, not a curiousity. Calling it a curiosity is not only factually incorrect but reveals your bias. In short, you are admitting that STATED GOAL of your change was to insert POV. And when I fixed it, you immediately reverted your biased changes. Now who's the bully?</dd>

If you're going to act like an animal, I will treat you like one. In

we explain them in the Edit Summary comment. If you do not do so, I 
will not treat your changes as legitimate. If you change the text of 
an article, I will revert. If you speak in Talk, I will ignore. 
You will follow the rules or I will not deal with you. There is

<p>Alai: I am sure you can deduce from my comments that I KNOW that lists, categories and stubs should not be capitalized the same as titles since they are not proper nouns. However after recently spending about 50% of my online-wp-time involved in debating capitalization with others who seem to have much more vested interest in using incorrect capitalization than I have in using correct capitalization, I found it was leaving me little time to actually work on content. I would still vote for using correct capitalization as in the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article title: New York State Route 17</li>
<li>List: List of state routes in New York</li>
<li>Category: State routes in New York</li>
<li>Stub: New York State Route stub</li>
</ul>
<p>but I just don't have the time to waste debating the issue with people who are not interested in using correct capitalization rules and insist on everything being like a song title. Put it up for a vote and you know what I will come down in favor of. Also, if you <b>don't</b> agree with me, don't bother arguing with me on this because I don't have the time or interest. I am only replying to you on this topic as a courtesy. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECensorwolf_2a85.html" title="User:Censorwolf">Censorwolf</a> 14:17, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was concurring with your naming rules about capitalization in general. But I am not sure if I understand what the stub name should be now. Shouldn't the stub actually be "NewYork-stateroute-stub", just like "Baseballbio-stub"?</dd>
<dd>If, as I think you suggest, the stub somehow belongs to the category of "Category:New_York_state_routes" (aka highways), that is not apparent since there is nothing I see in WP to make it happen automagically.

<p>Closing the AfD didn't just consist of counting votes, I also look at the comments when they made the votes. Often, someone voting later has a good idea that the rest of the voters agree with. In this case, I applied my admin's discretion as the vote closer and closed it as a Redirect. Do you still think I should delete it, or do you think this redirect is relatively harmless? If not, I got no problems with deleting it, but I don't think the redirect is all that harmful. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 13:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC) Ah, yes, and reading my closing comments, it's because this particular term sees some usage (now I remember, I actually also did a bit of research), but because people kept trying to recreate the content, I fully agree that the article should be kept as a redirect, and anyone trying to recreate content should be reverted immediately. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 13:29, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think every user in Wikipedia can have their opinion; this time, you disagree with my opinion. I voted for change of template because the template had parameters, and I wouldn't mind if that was replaced. However, what I wanted to keep was 1900s category. Yes, it is a narrow category, but I think it should be categorized like all other stubs: by years. No, I'm not kidding either. -- <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWater_Bottle_595b.html" title="User:Water Bottle">WB</a> 06:49, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I gotta admit, I'm not particularily active in stub-sorting, and also, this category is small; nonetheless, I'd rather see this category stay and be filled with articles.

Regardless of which way this pans out (and it's fairly finely poised at present), can I suggest you consider joining a wikiproject as a "kinder, gentler" means of having more interactions with other users, and the project space? And/or one of the more neglected "process" pages – categories for deletion/renaming, or requested moves, if you're interested in naming convention matters, stub proposals/deletions, etc, etc. Not so painful as AFD, or as full-bore wikipolitics, I promise.</p>
</div>
<p>I had presumed that would be what it would take to get my Wikipedia namespace edits up. Initially that seemed to me to be a lot more artificial than actually getting myself stuck in with issues and the like. But I agree that it's a pretty fine line at the moment. I make it 44 votes, 30 supports, which is 64%. Not too great, but with so many neutrals, this balances it out. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobo192_c260.html" title="User:Bobo192">Bobo</a><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobo192_2f09.html" title="User talk:Bobo192">.</a> 06:40, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

(Notice that Ian13 was just promoted with barely 75% support, not counting the neutrals at all.) I don't suggest you take part in a WPJ or process page only to get your namespace edit count up, and I certainly don't suggest one you have no actual interest in: as I say, I think it would be worth considering regardless of the RfA outcome. But I'd think you'd have some interest in Wikipedia:WikiProject Football, Wikipedia:Typo and similar "cleanup" activities... And WP:WSS could always do with more slave^Wvolunteer labour, I can testify from personal experience.</p>
</div>
<p>Cool. I wasn't sure how the averages would be skewed with taking into account the Neutrals, but if the neutrals were discounted this may still be good news.</p>
<p>I'm certainly going to write on my userpage to plan to dive into the Cleanup by month series, and reattending to the few of the Wikiprojects that I've neglected over the months wouldn't go amiss either.</p>

<p>Alright I just left a message with kevinwelis. The list I was speaking about was the one on your userspace. I would appreciate it if 2 of the 3 are not deleated, (spec-sci-fict-stub) is useless, and was a bad idea(as I am thinking about it). If that can't be done, and they must be deleated, can you hold off recommending more.
