<dd>In regards to ancient Tamil Love Poetry, it can be found in the last ten chapters of the <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirukural.html" title="Tirukural">Thirukkural</a>. There are many English translations which can be found on this. One of the earliest English translators was <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Uglow_Pope_216a.html" title="George Uglow Pope">George Uglow Pope</a>. It shouldn't be a problem to find any copy of the Thirukkural in a library. Another good source would be the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purananuru.html" title="Purananuru">Purananuru</a>. It is composed of 400 poems by over 150 poets/ poetess. Here are a couple of books you can look up:</dd>

<dd>Tamils and Malayalees (people of Kerala) are the most closest two civilizations in South Asia. There languages are very close to each other too. As a matter of fact, Kerala was the domain of one of the three Tamil kingdoms known as the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheras.html" title="Cheras">Cheras</a>. Both Tamil and Malayalam also have similarities in their scripts. In regards to the multi religions of Kerala, it is the same in Tamil Nadu as well as in the Tamil dominated parts of Sri Lanka.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of the earliest faiths in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka was <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animism.html" title="Animism">animism</a> before the arrival of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism ideologies from the Northern part of the sub-continent. Hinduism amongst the people of Southern India and especially Tamil Nadu is a mixture of their indigenous dieties and some of the Hindu pantheon. The earliest time of Christianity on the Indian sub-continent was through <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Apostle_eb90.html" title="Thomas the Apostle">Thomas the Apostle</a>, one of the twelve disciples of Christ. He travelled by a merchant ship to Kerala during the 1st century C.E. and built 7 churches there. During Roman persecution in the Middle East, Judaism found its way along the sea-trade route to Kerala too. Between the 1400s and 1500s, Islam started making its way southward down the sub-continent, but met with a strong resistence. After Islam, Catholicism was introduced by the Portuguese who arrived Kerala and Sri Lanka during the early part of the 1500s. When the British arrived, they introduced Protestantism, Anglicanism, and other Christian denominations in Southern India and Sri Lanka.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, to note, the India we see today did not exist before the arrival of the British. The term India or Indian are not found in any of the indigenous literature of Sanskrit, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu and so forth. It was a word used by the British which was derived from the Greek word <i>Indica</i>. That term was translated by the Greeks from the Persian word Hindu or Sindhu also denoting the name of the river and valley of the Indus. One can also discover that many of the major cities in India are not of indigenous names either. For example, in Tamil Nadu the cities of Madras, Salem, and Travancore. Also the city of Tanjore was a British name that was changed from the original Tamil name Tanjavur. The was also a French colony in Tamil Nadu called Pondicherry meaning nice village. Bombay is of Portuguese which was called by them <i>Bom Bahia</i> meaning nice bay which was later changed to Bombay by the British. In Kerala, there is a seaport called Cochin, another Portuguese word. In China, there was also a Portuguese colony called Cochin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Indian subcontinent was composed of many smaller kingdoms and countries. Kerala was known as the Chera kingdom, while in Tamil Nadu and Northeastern Sri Lanka there were the Chola and Pandya kingdoms. In Northern Tamil Nadu and Andra Pradesh, there was the Pallava kingdom. Overall, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Northeastern Sri Lanka were known as <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamilakam.html" title="Tamilakam">Tamilakkam</a> or the Tamil country. <i>Akkam</i> meaning inner, inner core, or love in Tamil literature. This may sound like treason to many nationalists, but that is history. Also, due to the geographic location of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka one can find a multi-religious and secular society. There is also a high tolerance towards each other's faiths. Also, if one were to hear of conflicts in that part of the region, it is mainly due to differences of ethnicity, language, and caste. Not so much with religion. Anyways, I hope this info was helpful. Please drop me a message if you need anything else.

<dd>That's ok. I do not know much my self. Here is another word you can learn, <i>Vanakkam</i>, meaning greetings. It is kind of like the Hindi word <i>Namaste</i>.

<p>Hi! I noticed you've made a some edits to <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backgammon.html" title="Backgammon">Backgammon</a> and its talk page recently. It's currently nominated at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, and I think the majority of remaining concerns will be prose and style issues. After editing the thing extensively since August, I don't think I can be very useful in copy-editing the text anymore. If you have some time to look it over, I think it would benefit the article greatly.</p>
<p>(By the way, the sentence described as ambiguous in the talk page has been changed; it was a simple matter of clarifying that the checkers re-enter "through the hitting player's home board".)</p>
<p>If you have some time, then, thanks in advance. If not, no big deal. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 11:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Instant redirects ain't exactly difficult - see <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">wikipedia:redirect</a>.

<p>As an aside, I hate to tell anyone to save their work less often because it looks like one is being mean on disk space, but it does make for long edit histories, so ... Please try and use "Show preview" more.

<p>Above is the standard warning on spam. This article isn't clearly spam but I am unable to ascertain the actual notability of the book. Since the article is basically consists of content description with no citations, I don't think it meets Wikipedia notability guideline. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigman_d995.html" title="User:Pigman"><b>Pig</b></a><a href="../../../p/i/g/User_talk%7EPigman_f895.html" title="User talk:Pigman"><sup><font color="red"><i>man</i></font></sup></a> 18:51, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll take your word that he (Prof. Brown) is notable in the field although I have to say the meager text and citations make it difficult to see it. Also, I guess I'm unclear as to the importance of the book to warrant an article separate from his entry. Although one good side-effect is that I've found a number of links to Brown's entry that should be going to a different <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Brown_329c.html" title="Don Brown">Don Brown</a>. Unless you know whether Prof. Brown did voice work for Japanese Anime? Or if he's a notable Jazz pianist? I'm thinking it's not the Prof. in those cases.</dd>

<dd>I was obviously mistaken in labeling the article spam. It is not. My apologies. But I still have concerns about the notability (in Wikipedia terms) of the book as well as the Prof. I suggest taking a look <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> for some guidelines on this. I see from one of the external links that Prof. Brown's list of universals has apparently been published in two other places than his own book. This is excellent source info on notability. Would you mind adding these sources directly into the article? It would really help bolster the article. Cheers, <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigman_d995.html" title="User:Pigman"><b>Pig</b></a><a href="../../../p/i/g/User_talk%7EPigman_f895.html" title="User talk:Pigman"><sup><font color="red"><i>man</i></font></sup></a> 23:10, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great! Thanks so much for creating the disambiguation page! I was just about to do it when I saw your note on my page. Would you mind if I copied some of this exchange between us to the talk page of the book or Prof. Brown's article talk page? I think it would provide an bit of background to those interested in beefing up the article. Again my apologies for my overeager mistake with the template. I go through the "new pages" regularly and it's astonishing how many articles are started on people who are distinctly unnotable. I am grateful to have you clarify the subject for me. However, you should be aware that Wikipedia has been steadily moving to provide verifiable and reliable third party sources for its information. In other words, just saying a book or person is important in their field is not enough. It's necessary to have citations from other people and sources mentioning him and his work. I think both articles are fine as stubs for the moment. Obviously <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">Irishguy</a> thinks the same since he declined to speedy delete the page. Fortunately Wikipedia has a pretty good system of checks and balances at this level. My mistake didn't get past an admin who actually has the power to delete the page. Anyway, thanks for your contributions and not taking offense at my ignorance. Particularly since I've only just this moment noticed that you're not exactly a neophyte on Wikipedia. So apologies again for talking to you like you knew nothing about Wikipedia.

<p>Yep. I'm doing lots, but not much on psychiatry as there are laods of edit wars and most of teh articles are in pretty good shape.
