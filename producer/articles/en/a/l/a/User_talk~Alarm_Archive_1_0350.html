<p>I'm in, though less expert here than on African-American and Women's Studies. If you want to start something like a WikiProject -- and if we can get 4 or 5 people to do it -- I'd be up for this. If not, I suggest you create a tasklist (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProjectSeattleTasks_dc3e.html" title="Template:WikiProjectSeattleTasks">Template:WikiProjectSeattleTasks</a> for an example) and announce it on the Village Pump. That would at least help coordinate work in this area. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 18:02, Sep 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm expecting to blow over. They both really want to work on the area so I don't see how they can stay away. I think part of the problem is the Xed changes his mind very fast and rather dramatically, so you scarce know where he is; while Jmabel is very steady in his opinions. Its taken him a while to really lose patience with Xed; and it will take him a while to get his patience back.&#160;:<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisG_fb9b.html" title="User:ChrisG">ChrisG</a> 13:19, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The syntax in your recent edit at International Labour Organization is just confused enough that I'm not absolutely sure I understand what you are saying. You wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ILO hosts an annual conference to which every government may send two delegates and one delegate representing the employers and workers organizations in the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm guessing you mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ILO hosts an annual conference to which every government may send two government delegates, plus and one delegate representing the employers and one representing workers' organizations in the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But maybe you mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ILO hosts an annual conference to which every government may send two delegates, one each representing the employers and the workers' organizations in the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you please edit to one or the other of these? Thanks. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:21, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having listed this article at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias</a> (which, by the way, you might be interested in taking a look at) I have been planning to expanded the International Labour Organization for quite a while, and seeing something happening here made me adress the issue. I have rewritten and expanded this substantually, so you can consider the question above as taken care of. However, you are of course much welcome to review what I've written and further expand on the subject. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 19:46, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The meaning is as follows. A country, can send a total of three delegates. Two of them will represent government so they are chosen by the government. One more is a person who "represents" the workers and employers unions (basically all the unions) in the country. However the "representative" of the unions may also be a government person particularly in more autocratic countries&#160;:( While this should not be so, it does happen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming the system works perfectly when a convention is proposed it can be voted for-against-abstain. Hence the governments collectively always have more votes then the "unions" in the ILO. Hence the measures proposed has to be quite ok for most governments else it doesn't get voted in. The problem is, despite this barrier to conventions, some countries still do not pass these conventions.</dd>

<p>Hi, you are doing a fine job in adding biographies of the members of the present Swedish government. BTW, I notice you have the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">CSB</a> template on your user page. I have wondered where all the CSB people have been in the voting on deletion of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Mankuzhikary_6698.html" title="Matthew Mankuzhikary">Matthew Mankuzhikary</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Sebastian_Mankuzhikary_e161.html" title="Bishop Sebastian Mankuzhikary">Bishop Sebastian Mankuzhikary</a>. I have been trying to do whatever I can to establish their notability, but the English Wikipedia clearly lacks enough participants who know the relevant <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">area</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">language</a>. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 11:17, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have seen cases of two stubs on some pages. It's perhaps not the most aesthetic thing, but might be useful. OTOH, one could create special stubs to cover common intersections of stub-types. I have been considering creating a Sweden-history-stub or a Sweden-bio-stub. There is a lot to do on Swedish topics here. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 20:09, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS. There is a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChefs_by_nationality_c8c3.html" title="Category:Chefs by nationality">Category:Chefs by nationality</a>. Maybe you should create a <a href="../../../s/w/e/Category%7ESwedish_chefs_d7f9.html" title="Category:Swedish chefs">Category:Swedish chefs</a> for the ones you have made so far, and, obviously, <i>the</i> <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Chef_2a84.html" title="Swedish Chef">Swedish Chef</a>! / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 20:16, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I had been <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Samuelsson_8b11.html" title="Marcus Samuelsson">Marcus Samuelsson</a>, I would have taken such a categorization with humour, but then, I am not him. I guess the correct wikipedian way of doing it would be to create a subcategory Category:Fictional Swedish chefs, where the muppet would fit in, but I can't think of any other fictional Swedish chefs. Well Werner &amp; Werner, perhaps, but I don't think they would be considered notable enough for the English Wikipedia. I am sure there are others, but unless they figure in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> or a book by <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien.html" title="Tolkien">Tolkien</a>, they are unlikely to qualify for articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I made the category and solved the problem of including the most famous Swedish practitioner of the profession with a "see also" link above the actual categorized items. :-)</dd>

<dd>I can find no mistakes in your discussion of the Limburgish language (I know little linguistics, though). However, I don't quite understand the sentence "In this definition, a language is pitch-accented if the position of an accented syllable or mora determines the tonal pattern of the whole word (the pitch of each syllable or mora, usually high vs. low) according to a set of rules." in the section <i>Pitch-accented languages vs tonal languages</i>. At least for Norwegian and Limburgish, it is not only the position of the accented syllable but also the quality of the accent that determines the tonal pattern of the whole word. Finally, I'd like to urge you to move the article into the main space. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> 09:12, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Or if you can think of a better title for the article, maybe you can post it as a new article and make the present one a redirect, which can then be dealt with later.

A number of his articles have been deleted as non-notable genealogy and by all appearances were so. I nominated his article on Israel Israelsson Näslund III (1796-1858), an undistinguished Swedish clergyman, for deletion, but have abstained for nominating other articles he has written, even though the subjects appear to be of little general significance.

<dd>About the railways - here's my suggestion: Since there seems to be such a wide number of articles on the form "Rail transport in X", I'd say that consistency is a factor in favour of having a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Sweden_d80f.html" title="Rail transport in Sweden">Rail transport in Sweden</a> article. Linking to the "main lines" can be done anyway, by section links, e.g. [[Rail transport in Sweden#The Western Main Line|western main line railway]] or [[Rail transport in Sweden#The main line railways|western main line railway]].</dd>
<dd>If you're not happy with that, and believe that the individual main lines can grow into decent standalone articles, I'd suggest that you create stubs for them (I'd prefer to name them in English, using caps since they could be considered proper names, thus naming them Western Main Line Railway of Sweden etc.) and link from them all to a main article <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Sweden_d80f.html" title="Rail transport in Sweden">Rail transport in Sweden</a>, where the general concept of main lines could be expanded upon. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 09:28, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
