<p>Dear Administrator: I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are. The world owes you. I owe You.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>"The proliferation of good private schools is fine. It's great," Bucks says, "But I think there has been a deterioration in the quality of education in the public schools. There's been so much building up of the private school system.</p>
<p>"Our public school system has to be improved, I think. I don't know whether Bobby agrees. It is extremely important that there be better education for blacks and whites, because if we go along and they are not educated, we cannot support industry. And there will not be a better Montgomery 10 years from now. You agree with that, Bobby?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Bobby replies.</p>
<p>"About five years ago Bobby served on a long-range planning committee of the Montgomery Area United Way that recommended changes in the city's public schools. The effort failed when the Montgomery County Board of Education couldn't agree enough to adopt the recommendations.</p>
<p>The brothers themselves are well educated.</p>
<p>Bucks attended Barnes, an old Montgomery private school, then Culver Military Academy, Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>Skipping two grades along the way, Bobby attended public schools in Montgomery, including Bellinger Hill School and Sidney Lanier High School. He spent his senior year at Culver Military Academy, then went to Dartmouth, followed by Harvard Business School.</p>

<dd>For the record, I never said anything negative about Weil. In fact, during the discussion I stated that Weil "seems like an amazing person."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMontgomery_Academy&amp;diff=52503056&amp;oldid=52501203" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMontgomery_Academy&amp;diff=52503056&amp;oldid=52501203" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> During my research I read this very article and that is one of the reasons I made that statement. However, the article doesn't change historical fact that MA was started as a seg academy. One did not have to be a racist to found a segregation academy. You seem to think that anyone who supported the founding of a segregated school must be a racist or a horible person. That is not the case. By your reasoning anyone who ever voted for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wallace_0df8.html" title="George Wallace">George Wallace</a>, or even lived in Alabama during that time period, must have been a racist, which is totally wrong. Anyway, I'm not going to reopen debate on any of this. What I will do, though, is strongly suggest you keep reading up on <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia policies</a>. Your new articles apeshit and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownnoser.html" title="Brownnoser">brownnoser</a> are definitions, which are not allowed on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary</a>), while your article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_midterm_Congressional_elections_ed0e.html" title="2002 midterm Congressional elections">2002 midterm Congressional elections</a> already exists at <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_election%2C_2002_0299.html" title="United States House election, 2002">United States House election, 2002</a>.

<p>Hey,&#160;:) What happened to your Wikibreak? Do we have an addict on our hands. I guess we will always disagree. And we shouldn't debate this. It's only destructive. To me, starting a seg school is supporting segregation, which is racist behavior. One (or two) could go on ad nauseum about that. I'm sure there are plenty of people who see things your way as well. It concerns me though, that those with my frame of thought (or similar) would see Weil as a racist, when clearly he is not.</p>
<p>Apeshit and brownnoser are definitions and probably should go to Wiktionary. I have no idea how to move them. For the time being, a lot of editors are comfortable with lots of definitions on wikipedia, calling them vocabulary stubs.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">VandalProof 1.2 Now Available</span></h2>
<div style="border: 1px solid gray; background-color: #fdffe7;">
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVandalprooflock.jpg_b347.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/f/f4/Vandalprooflock.jpg/180px-Vandalprooflock.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" longdesc="../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVandalprooflock.jpg_b347.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

</dd>
<dd>Yes, that is the problem. For some unknown reason, using VandalProof requires you to have admin rights on the computer you use it on. AmiDaniel is looking into why this is, to try to fix it, but right now you need to have an admin account [on your computer] for it to work. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 19:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nuts. Thanks for letting me know, though. I'll just download it onto my other computer (which, unfortunately, has a much slower dial-up connection).

<dd>I am the one who is "uncivil?" By "uncivil," do you mean that I am in disagreeemnt with you, and you can't legitimately refute me? I understand that you may be frustrated because you are unable to justify your allegations, but I was perfectly civil until YOU started insulting me by way of harshly criticizing the site that I was suggesting. (Alabamaboy, I will be more than happy to show you exactly how and where ElKevbo started the insults.) When someone tells you "Hey, I like this site," and then you say, "It's just a poor website," and then you continue to purposely insult it, you and I both know that that is a backhanded insult to the person in support of the site. I can read between the lines, and so can everyone else reading the posts. And why is the onus on me? Civility goes BOTH ways. Alabamaboy, I don't think ElKevbo would be very happy if I were to publicly insult the sites that he has supported.</dd>

<dd>I hate to disagree but the UofGa Press was criticized by a number of commentators for their decision to revoke the award so I think it should be in their article.

Doing that would lessen the amount of space taken up by the Vice issue (which is only two sentences at the moment). Do you have info to expand the article?

<dd>Heck no, the article isn't worth keeping. But since it was a blatent copyvio, I could speedy delete it without messing with a vote for deletion or anything else. If the article is recreated with non-copyvio text, then I will bring it up for a vote for deletion. In my experience, though, most of the time editors who create articles like this will not attempt to recreate with non copyrighted text. That's why I like hunting down copyvios so much.

<p>I can then email back to confirm all is OK.</p>
<p>Will you be able to re-post my offering or is it deleted forever now?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Thanks for your questions about the Drinkstag article. In order to repost the article you will need to release it under the GFDL. Info on how to do this is at the top of my talk page. That said, the article does not appear to rise to the level of notability for inclusion in Wikipedia (for more on this, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>). You are, of course, welcome to go throught he process to have the text reposted. I just want to warn you that odds are once the article is back in existence it will be nominated for deletion and deleted as not notable. Just wanted you to know this. But if you want to give it a shot anyway, follow the directions in the green box at the top of my talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">References in hinduism</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I wanted to explain further my problem with the references in the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> article. I know you don't think that references is a problem but I do not think that you have spent the time to go through the references. Almost every statement, that might require a reference, is supported by referencing a website that would not be accepted even in a first year college level writing class. My main problem is that despite this problem being raised during the previous farc and in the talk page, none of the editors have been able to invest the time in getting quality references. Even currently, the citation needed tags are being replaced by low quality references. For example, "The Ṛgvedic deity Dyaus, regarded as the father of the other deities, is linguistically cognate with Zeus—the king of the gods in Greek mythology, Jovius (gen. of Jupiter)—the king of the gods in Roman mythology, and Ziu in Germanic mythology." is supported by this <a href="http://www.ancientsculpturegallery.com/038.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ancientsculpturegallery.com/038.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>. This really cements my main problem with the article - citations are provided just for the looks with a very small thought towards the quality of the reference. This is not a FA quality article and I do not believe any of the good editors are going to be motivated to work on the article as long as it is FA. If even <b>one</b> person that has a good track record of editing article steps up, I will withdraw my nomination immediately. I would personally work on it myself but I am not a religious expert and even though I spent over 100 hours last time reading articles and such - I mostly ended up offending one side or another and everything was mostly reverted. I cant spend that much time again. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 17:42, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Suggestion - how about a title like "Fallen Wikipedians"? "Deceased" sounds a bit crude.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It was no sweat, because the very idea had occured to me a couple of months ago. I had no idea, however, of how to ascertain a person's death or if it would be "acceptable" at all to do this. However, I feel that it is important for the community to preserve the memory of users who have made a difference for a long time to come, even as their edits will probably will over-written in a short time. Being a Wikipedian is being a student of millions, and a teacher to millions. It is a great activity for which we receive no reward except a personal satisfaction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That you found a way to do this is a magnificent contribution from you, because it reflects the sense of brotherhood and mutual respect that should connect Wikipedians. I'm sure the families of the fallen contributors of knowledge are touched and proud to see this dignified, respectful dedication.</dd>

<dd>I too have wondered about David91. I always assumed the 91 in his user name meant his age, so when he said on his talk page that he was being admitted to a hospital for "more tests", would be away for "some days", and then never edited again, I feared for the worst. I wish I could provide you with some information about him or contact information for his family, but I only know him from Wikipedia. Based solely on our interactions on Wikipedia, I consider David91 a friend, and a damn fine human being. I'm glad I made a few newbie mistakes when I first started editing so that I got to know him.<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockinRob_c77b.html" title="User:RockinRob"><font color="black">RockinRob</font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockinRob_ae6b.html" title="User talk:RockinRob"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a></sup> 23:28, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aww, thanks. =) I wouldn't have been able to pull any of that off, if not for your prior work and research. It's always easy enough to redraft just about anything, in my eyes the original creation is usually some of the hardest work. I haven't looked at the talk page, today, but so far I've mostly noticed that <i>holy crap he is long-winded,</i> heh.

<dd>Yeesh. For somebody who complains our obsession with the Exchange article, she sure writes a lot about it. I felt like I couldn't quite grasp what Root wanted, but with her I'm completely at a loss for understanding because a lot of her statements and desires seem to conflict (unless I'm misunderstanding). To be honest, I've never been to arbitration, but if that's what we have to do, then I guess that's what we have to do. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 07:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">International Peace Operations Association deleted</span></h2>
<p>Alabamaboy,</p>
<p>With all due respect, I disagree with your decision to delete International Peace Operations Association.</p>
<p>As far as I can understand, there were two reasons for the deletion: 1. Copyright violation of the IPOA Web site. Given that I, as Director of Programs and Operations of IPOA, am a senior officer of the organization and effectively own the copyright on behalf of IPOA, this is a moot point. 2. The article appears to be an advertisement. Fine. Then let the wiki community edit it. Given the content that WAS there detailed who we are, what we do, our history and our member companies, I'm not sure what is biased about stating those facts. Even our detractors do not disagree over who we are or what we do or who our paid members are.</p>
<p>IPOA is an important organization that represents the private peace operations and logistics industry worldwide. Our membership is worth billions of dollars and we are called upon to speak for the industry to the media and the governments of the world - in the past month, IPOA has testified before the US Congress and South African parliament.</p>
<p>Therefore, I respectfully ask that you reconsider your decision to delete.</p>
<p>Sincerely, J. J. Messner Director of Programs and Operations IPOA</p>

<dd>Since the article was deleted for a copyright violation but your organization wrote the material, then there are several ways that you can make sure it does not get deleted again. For example, you could put a notice on your main web site that says that you release the material under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, so it can be used here without infringing on anybody's copyright. Or you can use an email address associated with the website to file a confirmation of your release of the material under the GFDL with our permissions department at "permissions at wikimedia dot org". You can look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConfirmation_of_permission_ed89.html" title="Wikipedia:Confirmation of permission">Wikipedia:Confirmation of permission</a> for some more instructions.

<p>Yeah, there has been far too much unilateralism. I don't like bots making edits, in the first place, but then I loathe people deciding (usually on IRC) that X is bad and then bombing the whole Wikipedia with their changes. You know how we can tell this decision was reached without deliberation? The solution being enforced by Cyde and others is simply to delete, devil take the hindmost, without any concern for what's left afterward. If there were deliberation, there would be a very un-bot-like answer: delete, if there is a ruling, but <b>then fix the mess you make.</b> A bot can't do that, and the people who employ them won't.

He is not letting me add a link to the MessUnit (<a href="http://messunit.com" class="external free" title="http://messunit.com" rel="nofollow">http://messunit.com</a>) unnoficcial Windows Live Messenger blog to the Windows Live Messenger page, he claims that im "link spamming" but it's only one site and its much more relevant than several of the other external links, I asked that if he was going to remove my link he should atleast be consistent and remove the link to the Hypothetic MSN Protocol site, because I know for a fact that that site only covers the much older MSN Messenger protocols and hasn't been updated for about 2 years!!! There are also links to several other unofficial sites like Mess.be and MSNPiki - both of which are sites for MSN Messenger and not Windows Live Messenger. This is clearly a case of favoritism. He is enforcing rules that don't exist, and if they do exist hes only enforcing them on the sites he dosn't like.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for intervention on <a href="../../../i/q/b/Iqbal.html" title="Iqbal">Iqbal</a> article</span></h2>
<p>Hi, there has been an unnecessary conflict on language in the <a href="../../../i/q/b/Iqbal.html" title="Iqbal">Iqbal</a> article. Since you're interested in bias issues within Wikipedia, and since you seem to not have any connection to the subcontinent (is that true?), I request that you intervene and hear the legitimate concerns voiced by myself and others.</p>
<p>First off, Iqbal is being called an Indian when he was clearly not one since he was the one who advocated a separate homeland for Muslims in the first place. To put this in context, it is similar to calling someone who fought in the American Revolutionary War against Britain but died a British person. Theoretically, wasn't George Washington British, since he was born as a British subject? Yet it would seem extremely strange if someone called him a Great British leader even though in some sense it would be technically correct. I proposed that he should not be referred to as Indian or Pakistani but we should just mention that he is from the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. Users like Rama's Arrow say that that word does not mean anything, however, it is an extremely common word used in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Wikipedia has an article on it and the term returns 11 million hits on google. The Centers for Disease Control also uses that term (the second hit on google)...I'm sure they don't have an anti-India bias :-).</p>
<p>Second, this statement is troubling to me and it seems to incite unnecessary hatred of an extremely peaceful poet:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>'Iqbal's notion of a natural Muslim nation and of Islam as a political, unifying identity was inherently flawed and fanciful'</dd>

<p>I first proposed that this statement be taken out since it's basically a useless attack on a religion and has nothing to do with Iqbal. My gripe with this statement is:</p>
<ul>
<li>just because Pakistan has internal problems does not mean that it is the fault of Islam or the idea proposed by Iqbal.</li>
<li>Some might say that Iqbal proposed separation as a more peaceful solution yet it lead to violence. However, is that level of violence MORE than the level of violence between different religions WITHIN India (a country with more Muslims than Pakistan)? Absolutely not.</li>
<li>I think that if that statement is not taken out, it should at least be put into context by adding that inter-religious harmony in India is not much better either.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you'll join us and help us reach an accurate, unbiased article. Thanks. --<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinterested_cfdc.html" title="User:Disinterested">Disinterested</a> 17:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for asking me to mediate with regards to the Muhammad Iqbal article but I'm on vacation right now and have only limited internet access. As such, I must politely decline. However, if there are any issues I can help with in the future please do contact me.

<dd>Thank you for your reply. I understand that you're taking a break from Wikipedia, but I'd still really like to have your input once you get the time. Thank you. --<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinterested_cfdc.html" title="User:Disinterested">Disinterested</a> 17:25, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, could you recommend another unbiased person like yourself who could possibly aid us in mediating this matter. BTW, I currently live in Birmingham, AL. :-).--<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinterested_cfdc.html" title="User:Disinterested">Disinterested</a> 06:54, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statement is not POV, because it is a critical analysis of Iqbal's views. Its not a commentary on the religious situation in Pakistan or India, and Iqbal's biography is not a place for discussing religious issues in Pakistan or India. Wikipedia is not responsible for protecting people's feelings, and its important to make the criticism as lucid as praise, or else it is not NPOV. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>This Fire Burns Always</b></font></a> 02:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think I have argued about this with you long enough and its useless to continue the argument with the same people without having an unbiased person mediate this. Also, I take offense to your policing of my posts and next time please keep your sermons to yourself. --<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinterested_cfdc.html" title="User:Disinterested">Disinterested</a> 17:25, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Johnny Lee Clary</span></h2>
<p>Hello sir,</p>
<p>I have posted the following to about 20 admins.</p>
<p>To Wikipedia staff,</p>
<p>Hello there, my name is Nick, my username is Potters house and I have encountered a problem with trying to provide any information about Johnny Lee Clary. I have posted this post off to other staff members also. I am not sure if this is the best route to resolve this, but can think of no other way.</p>
<p>The article Johnny Lee Clary has been deleted. I have known Johnny through telephone conversations and email for a short time now (about 3-4 months). He recently came and shared his life story in for our church group for the first time just two weeks ago. Before I met Johnny I became interested in his story i.e. his conversion from the head of the KKK in the US, to being a Christian Minister who now teaches against race hate groups. I found the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> as it still is today, deleted, except for some small talk. If you read the talk you see what I have said at the time (notice I have gotten no reply, probable my fault as I don’t know heaps about WIKI policy). From my understanding Johnny Lee Clary was posting as The KingOfDixie and looks like he tried to change a few things on Wiki concerning the KKK. While this is a controversial subject, Johnny being the former leader of the KKK would probably know a thing or two and be able to contibute, but that’s another story. He eventually made an article about himself i.e. Johnny Lee Clary. Johnny being quite new to Wiki and ignorant of rules of conduct found himself at odds with some admins and had his site deleted.</p>
<p>Whilst observing Johnny over the last 3-4 months I have noticed that he is very outspoken against race hate groups such as the Neo Nazis, Skinheads, KKK etc. This, more often than not, lands Johnny in the hot seat. He has experienced persecution from racist groups for his departure from the KKK and voiced opinions against these racist organizations on his webpage, www.xkkk.org. Johnny has also received multiple death threats.</p>
<p>Because of his bold stance against these racist groups Johnny has become accustomed to hatred directed at him by those same groups. Johnny concluded that perhaps the guy who deleted the page <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> was a white supremist. I am hoping to clear this up. Before he told me this, I started to create J L Clary, after hearing nothing from posting in user talk on Johnny Lee Clary's article. I wasn't 10 minutes into the J L Clary article when it was issued a deletion notice, and then before I had time to reply (about 5 minutes) it was deleted! I was amazed. I told this to Johnny and he said the main reason he was told that he couldn't have an article was because he was not prominent enough.</p>
<p>Johnny has a very famous testimony and has been on multiple TV shows like Oprah, Donahue, Jerry Springer, etc, and even recently when he preached in our town he made front page news, a double spread on his life, and the local ABC interviewed him live, which is not bad for our town (LISMORE NSW Australia) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> .</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> came to our town hardly anyone knew or cared, yet <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> is allowed an article (and rightfully so), but more people know of Johnny. As to whether he is famous or not, just Google search him and see all the TV interviews and radio interviews he does. He hangs with some of the most prominent Christian leaders in Australia. Besides this, just being the former KKK leader should be enough for an article (he doesn't even get a mention in the KKK one, and would be deleted). He was also a Pro Wrestler. So he is prominent in Christian circles, he is prominent amongst race hate groups, and he is also prominent in the WWE wrestling.</p>
<p>Johnny asked me to test the waters for him to see if he was being persecuted by someone from a race hate group. So I created some sites, John Clary <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Watts_9977.html" title="Wade Watts">Wade Watts</a> and Operation Colorblind - the name of Johnny's Ministry. These have been fine until yesterday. I cannot understand why these sites are just issued a deletion notice? Just because they mention JLC? I was hoping to discuss these things but they are just deleted. The one on Wade Watts is about a black gospel preacher who was one of the leaders in the civil rights movement in the US and was good friends with Martin Luther King. He took Johnny Clary under his wing and even ordained Johnny as a minister (to this day Johnny is the only white man ordained in the All Black Baptist Church). But his article is up for deletion because I mentioned Clary and had a link.</p>
<p>That is why I am writing to you to see if you can help. It seems to me that the person(s) deleting all articles which even mention Johnny Lee Clary has an agenda. I thought that wikipedia admins had to keep a neutral stance on every article. It seems like this guy has a vendetta against JLC. Why delete the Wade Watts article. That is guilt by association and could be proof that all deletions are because of racial discrimination! I hope this is not the case and would think that it is politically motivated, as Johnny is a strong supporter of George Bush and Antaeus Feldspar of Kerry.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> This shows how Antaeus Feldspar supports Kerry, which is fine, but Johnny is a strong supporter of Bush.</p>
<p>My hope is that Johnny will be able to have an article like any other famous person, minister, former KKK leader, or pro wrestler, and that Johnny and anyone connected with him and his ministry will in future have certain rules set in place that do not allow the wholesale deletion of the articles associated with him, but that they will be at least discussed.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading this long winded post. I have only been using WIKI for about a year myself so I need your help, I don't really know what else to do. I hope you can help. I personally think that Johnny's story is one that is beneficial to the cause of reconciliation between races and to the3 unity of society as a whole. It would be a shame if WIKI became known for having covert racists. Of course I hope that this is a misunderstanding and that all will be cleared up soon.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p>Also note his contributions: Featured articles: · African American literature -- My first featured article. Thanks to everyone who gave feedback. While I didn't start the article, I obsessed on it for an entire month and wrote most of the copy. · Ku Klux Klan -- I began work on this article after it became a featured article. Since then I've mediated several editorial disputes on the article (including one of which kept the article from being delisted as a FA) and made a large number of edits.</p>
