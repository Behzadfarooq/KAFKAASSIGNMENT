<p>I think that is an excellent idea, however I don't think it should be called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Case_for_Israel_07b7.html" title="The Case for Israel">The Case for Israel</a> as the book is worth much more than the accusations against it. We should take the current info in the Dershowitz article on the matter, move it to a new article entitled <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dershowitz-Finkelstein_Affair_1783.html" title="Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair">Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair</a> and make a link to it from the Dershowitz page, so we can focus on other aspects of Dershowitz. What do you think?</p>

<dd>Er, but title it something like Allegations of plagiarism against Alan M. Dershowitz -- Finkelstein started the accusations, but others have since picked them up. --<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> 21:07, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not so sure that's necessary. After all, the accusations all basically use the same "evidence" provided by Finkelstein, don't they? One could say it is mainly an argument between Dershowitz and his supporters and Finkelstein and those that support him. How about...Plagiarism accusations by Norman Finkelstein? I don't believe Mr. Finkelstein has made any other allegations of that sort, so it still works. Before I write it up, what do you think?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe Dershowitz-Finkelstein plagiarism affair? Or Plagiarism accusations against Alan Dershowitz by Norman Finkelstein, or Plagiarism accusations by Norman Finkelstein against Alan Dershowitz (though the latter two are unwieldy and ugly). Perhaps <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dershowitz-Finkelstein_affair_ecfc.html" title="Dershowitz-Finkelstein affair">Dershowitz-Finkelstein affair</a> is best after all. --<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> 22:40, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yeah. Dershowitz-Finkelstein plagiarism affair would be good, but like the other two it's a bit too wordy. If you agree, I'm going to go with <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dershowitz-Finkelstein_Affair_1783.html" title="Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair">Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair</a></dd>

<p>Okay, I've created the article, and I'll work some more on it later. I think that we can open the page from protection now, as we've reached a compromise we can all hopefully accept. I want to remove the details of the Plagiarism matter and replace it with a shorter sentence linking to the new article, to avoid redundancy, as the new article is largely based on what was in here about it. All in favor of re-opening article for edit and ending reverting wars?</p>

<p>'Language neutral' advocate Leumi has named themselves after <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun_Tsvai-Leumi_a9ed.html" title="Irgun Tsvai-Leumi">Irgun</a>, the Israeli 'freedom fighters'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, if you took the time to research you would know that Leumi is the Hebrew word for National (i.e: First National Bank, National Sovereignty etc.) While the Irgun Z'vai Leumi has this word in their name, it is only because their name translates into National Military Organization. Take some time to verify your claims and stop resorting to name calling when you cannot prove your points in legitimate debate.</dd>

<p>I did not say I was named after the national bank, I said I was named after the word National! I used the national bank, and national sovereignty as an example. I am no more named after the Irgun than a person whose name is "Republican is named after the IRA! Furthermore, why is it your tactic to resort to personal attacks rather than substantive debate?</p>

May I suggest the compromise I just added. It's often only necessary to report all the facts to get NPOV. i.e. we record that fact of Dershowitz commendation for human rights, and his (much disputed) statements on torture. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 20:38, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the article, expanding the section about Dershowitz's controversial views about torture. I felt that: 1. The original text did not explain what Dershowitz's actual view was (he is not advocating torture per se, but saying that it will happen and that it is better that it happens under judicial review than "under the radar", and hence open to abuse); and 2. the text basically says "Dershowitz has been criticised for advocating torture. He says 'what about the ticking timebomb terrorist'. We say that is immoral". I think this is POV against Dershowitz. Hence in teh spirit (I thought) of NPOV I changed it (you can read my amendment in history). It has since been changed back, with a commenbt such as "this is not a forum, it is an encyclopaedia". I disagree that my edit was invalid. Am i alone?</p>

<dl>
<dd>There needs to be something to support the "left-wing" claim, otherwise it is POV/original research. This guy is a rightist who smears people on the left as racists, and is in favour of torture. I think we need to hear examples of quite a few progressive opinions coming out of his mouth before we can call him left-wing, or even a moderate centrist. Let's hear them. The article should say neither left not right until this is clarified. If the matter is still not clear, then we should resort to attribution (i.e. published source X says Dershowitz is left-wing, publish source Y says he is right-wing). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 13:15, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I've read reviews of those, and they seem to be simply partisan pro-Democrat, anti-Republican attacks. That doesn't quite put him on the Left.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Having read what he said, I'd say that he is in favour of states being able to use torture, which is something condemned by civilised people. Talk of ticking timebombs does not excuse this, as states will always say there are such threats. A part of his argument is that torture will occur anyway, but we do not apply such a reasoning to murder, electoral fraud, etc. You are either for torture or against it. He is for it, and this position has been condemned not only by the far left but also by mainstream groups such as Amnesty International.<a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/askamnesty/torture200112.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amnestyusa.org/askamnesty/torture200112.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Dershowitz's view is right-wing.</dd>

<dd>We would be perfectly justified in stating that he is right-wing. However, since there is for some bizarre reason disagreement on this issue, we cannot state anything categorically either way. NPOV policy requires us therefore to attribute views instead of stating our own. If you want the left-right-ness of his politics mentioned in the article, then quote someone lower down in the article, and be sure to give both opinions. The introduction must remain neutral. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 11:47, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">JillandJack's changes should be reverted</span></h2>
<p>I regard JillandJack's category change to be inappropriate. As I stated on the talk page for the Lynne Stewart article, JillandJack is apparently a user whose previous account was banned. This user is apparently moving to have the "Radical lawyers" category removed. Rather than letting the category status depend on that outcome, the user has chosen to empty out several articles in violation of the request on the deletion proposal flag.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Whether or not Jillandjack is a good or a bad wikipedian, Dershowitz is not a "radical" lawyer. He holds one of the, if not THE, top law chair in the world. He is not radical in his views of law; that is the mark of a radical lawyer. Argue as much as you like about whether or not his views on Israel are "radical", but he is NOT a radical lawyer.</dd>
