<p>Alan Dukes was born in south <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> in 1945. His father was a civil servant originally from <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry.html" title="Kerry">Kerry</a>, while his mother was from near <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballina.html" title="Ballina">Ballina</a>, Co. Mayo. Alan was educated by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers_037b.html" title="Congregation of Christian Brothers">Christian Brothers</a> at the O'Connell Schools and was offered a number of scholarships for third level on graduation, including one for the Irish language. His interest in the Irish language continues to this day, and he regularly appears on Irish language television programmes.</p>
<p>On leaving school, Alan attended <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_Dublin_8b39.html" title="University College Dublin">University College Dublin</a>.</p>

<p>In 1969 he became an economist with the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) in Dublin. After Ireland joined the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Community_18c5.html" title="European Economic Community">EEC</a> in 1973, he moved to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> where he was part of the IFA's delegation. In this role he was influential in framing Ireland's contribution to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Agriculture_Policy_074a.html" title="Common Agriculture Policy">Common Agriculture Policy</a>.</p>
<p>He moved on from this IFA position to become chief of staff to Ireland's EEC commissioner <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Burke_7247.html" title="Richard Burke">Dick Burke</a>, a former <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine_Gael_b9bc.html" title="Fine Gael">Fine Gael</a> politician.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Dukes_59f2.html" title="Edit section: Early Political Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Political Career</span></h2>
<p>In 1979 Dukes stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the European elections in the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> constituency. He was on course to be elected thanks to strong farming support until the entry of farming leader TJ Maher as an independent candidate. Maher subsequently topped the poll.</p>
<p>He stood again for Fine Gael in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_1981.html" title="Irish general election, 1981">1981 general election</a> in the expanded constituency of <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kildare.html" title="Kildare">Kildare</a> where he won a seat and was elected to <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/i/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_8259.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a>. On his first day in the Dáil he was appointed <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Agriculture_%26_Food_6c47.html" title="Irish Minister for Agriculture &amp; Food">Minister for Agriculture</a> by the new <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> - <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garret_FitzGerald_58c7.html" title="Garret FitzGerald">Garret FitzGerald</a>, becoming one of only five TD's so appointed. He held this seat for 21 years.</p>
<p>This minority Fine Gael\Labour coalition government collapsed in February 1982 over controversial budget reforms, but returned to power with a working majority in December of that year. Dukes was again called into the cabinet becoming <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Finance_2b23.html" title="Irish Minister for Finance">Minister for Finance</a> less than two years into his Dáil career.</p>
<p>He faced a difficult task as Finance Minister at this time. Ireland was heavily in debt while unemployment and emigration were high. Many of Fine Gael's ambitious plans had to be deferred while the Fine Gael/Labour coalition disagreed on how to solve the economic crisis. The challenge of addressing the national finances was made difficult by electoral arithmetic and a lack of support from the opposition Fianna Fáil party lead by Charles J. Haughey.</p>
<p>Dukes remained in the Department of Finance until the withdrawl of the Labour members from the government in 1986. As part of the subsequent reshuffle, he was appointed <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Justice%2C_Equality_%26_Law_Reform_eb65.html" title="Irish Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform">Minister for Justice</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Dukes_59f2.html" title="Edit section: Leadership of Fine Gael">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leadership of Fine Gael</span></h2>
<p>Fine Gael failed to win re-election in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_1987.html" title="Irish general election, 1987">1987 general election</a>, and lost 20 of their 70 seats, most to the new <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Democrats_3859.html" title="Progressive Democrats">Progressive Democrats</a> party. Outgoing Taoiseach and leader Garret FitzGerald stepped down and Dukes was elected leader of Fine Gael. He also became <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Leader_of_the_Opposition_9ae1.html" title="Irish Leader of the Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a>.</p>
<p>This was a difficult time for the country. Haughey's Fianna Fáil had fought the election on promises to increase spending and government services, and by attacking the cutbacks favoured by Fine Gael. The campaign produced the famous FF slogan that cuts in health spending affect the "old, the sick and the handicapped". However on taking office, the new Taoiseach and his Finance Minister <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_MacSharry_4d37.html" title="Ray MacSharry">Ray MacSharry</a> immediately drew up a drastic set of cutbacks including a spate of ward and hospital closures. This presented a political opportunity for the oppoisition to attack the government.</p>
<p>However addressing a meeting of the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce, Dukes announced that "When the Government is moving in the right direction, I will not oppose the central thrust of its policy. If it is going in the right direction, I do not believe that it should be deviated from its course, or tripped up on macro-economic issues". This bold step became known as the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallaght_Strategy_52ae.html" title="Tallaght Strategy">Tallaght Strategy</a>, and represented a major departure in Irish politics whereby Fine Gael would vote with the minority <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> Government if it adopted Fine Gael's economic policies for revitalising the economy.</p>
<p>The consequences of this statement were huge. The Haughey government was able to take severe corrective steps to restructure the economy and lay the foundations for the economic boom of the nineties. However, at a snap election in 1989 Dukes did not receive electoral credit for his statesmanlike approach, and the party only made minor gains, reclaiming 5 of the 20 lost seats. The outcome was the first ever coalition government for Fianna Fáil, whose junior partner were the Progressive Democrats lead by former FF TD Desmond O'Malley.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Dukes_59f2.html" title="Edit section: 1990 Presidential Election and loss of the leadership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1990 Presidential Election and loss of the leadership</span></h2>
<p>Dukes received little credit for the Tallaght Strategy, and the party's failure to make significant gains in 1989 left some Fine Gael TDs with a desire for a change at the top. Their opportunity came in the wake of the historic <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_presidential_election%2C_1990.html" title="Irish presidential election, 1990">1990 presidential election</a>. Fine Gael chose TD <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Currie_98c0.html" title="Austin Currie">Austin Currie</a> as their candidate. He had been a leading member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights movement in the 1960's and had been a member of the <a href="../../../s/d/l/SDLP_04bb.html" title="SDLP">SDLP</a> party before moving south.</p>
<p>Initially, Fianna Fáil's <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Lenihan_2e75.html" title="Brian Lenihan">Brian Lenihan</a> had been favourite to win, however after a number of controversies arising from the brief FF administration of 1981-82, and Lenihan's dismissal as <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Defence_242d.html" title="Irish Minister for Defence">Minister for Defence</a> mid-way through the campaign, the Labour party's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Robinson_1447.html" title="Mary Robinson">Mary Robinson</a> emerged victorious. To many in Fine Gael, the humiliation of finishing third was too much to bear and a heave was launced against Dukes. He was subsequently replaced as party leader by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bruton_6766.html" title="John Bruton">John Bruton</a>.</p>

<p>In September 1992 the new leader, John Bruton, brought him back to the front bench. In February 1994 he became involved in a failed attempt to oust Bruton as leader and subsequently Dukes resigned from the front bench. In December 1994 Bruton became <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> and Dukes failed to secure a ministerial position despite being one of the most high profile and experience members of Fine Gael.</p>
<p>Two years later in December 1996 Dukes returned as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications following the resignation of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Lowry_9029.html" title="Michael Lowry">Michael Lowry</a>. In 1997, Dukes topped the poll in the new constituency of Kildare South, however Fine Gael lost power and Dukes became Chairman of the <i>Irish Council of the European Movement</i>. In this position he was very involved in advising many of the Eastern European who were then applying to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001 he backed <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Noonan_31d2.html" title="Michael Noonan">Michael Noonan</a> in his bid to become leader of Fine Gael. Noonan was successful.</p>

<p>After 21 years, Dukes lost his Dáil seat in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_2002.html" title="Irish general election, 2002">general election of 2002</a>. This contest saw many high profile casualties for Fine Gael, including Deputy Leader <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Mitchell_934c.html" title="Jim Mitchell">Jim Mitchell</a>, former Deputy Leader <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nora_Owen_a514.html" title="Nora Owen">Nora Owen</a> and others. Many local commentators felt that the loss was down to a lack of attention to local issues, as Dukes was highly involved in European projects and had always enjoyed a national profile.</p>
<p>He retired from politics in 2002, and was subsequently appointed Director General of the Institute of European Affairs. He is still active in Fine Gael and is currently the party's national Vice-President.</p>
