<p>Alan White was a highly regarded studio drummer before joining Oasis. In 1987 he joined future Oasis member <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gem_Archer_ee24.html" title="Gem Archer">Gem Archer</a>'s band Whirlpool."He came down and just blew us all away," remembers Archer <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.. "I thought he was mega but the others were worried what a 15-years-old kid on the road and on the lager would be like. I rang his dad and told him: 'Sorry. But don't worry he's fantastic. He'll go all the way.' And he did. It was the weirdest day when he welcomed me to Oasis. And he hasn't let me forget it." White also played <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a> on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Bell_%28musician%29_c1d9.html" title="Andy Bell (musician)">Andy Bell</a>'s wife's solo album, forming a connection with another future <a href="../../../o/a/s/Oasis_%28band%29.html" title="Oasis (band)">Oasis</a> member. Prior to joining Oasis, White drummed with London-based band Starclub.</p>
<p>White's brother, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_White_457a.html" title="Steve White">Steve White</a> had played with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Weller_4ef7.html" title="Paul Weller">Paul Weller</a>'s <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_Council_59ef.html" title="Style Council">Style Council</a> and various other famous musicians, including <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a>. Because of this famous connection, Alan mentioned that Steve impacted greatly his development as a drummer. His other influences include <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Smith_ccdb.html" title="Chad Smith">Chad Smith</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Avory_923a.html" title="Mick Avory">Mick Avory</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bonham_df1b.html" title="John Bonham">John Bonham</a>.</p>

<p>White replaced original Oasis drummer <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_McCarroll_f18b.html" title="Tony McCarroll">Tony McCarroll</a> in May <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> and was immediately "thrown in the deep end", joining the band the very next day to perform a playback of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Some_Might_Say_9993.html" title="Some Might Say">Some Might Say</a> in front of a national TV audience on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC1_7dd0.html" title="BBC1">BBC1</a>'s long running music programme <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_of_The_Pops_0da2.html" title="Top of The Pops">Top of The Pops</a>. One of White's first live shows with Oasis was in front of a massive crowd at the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glastonbury_Festival_90b4.html" title="Glastonbury Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> in June 1995.</p>
<p>Until the arrival of <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gem_Archer_ee24.html" title="Gem Archer">Gem Archer</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Bell_%28bassist%29_d270.html" title="Andy Bell (bassist)">Andy Bell</a> in the Autumn of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, White was the token southerner in the otherwise <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Mancunian</a> Oasis. Initially known, inventively, as 'Whitey', he was later re-christened 'Dave' by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from "The Winchester" in the '70s TV series <i><a href="../../../m/i/n/Minder_%28TV_series%29_760d.html" title="Minder (TV series)">Minder</a></i>. White commented on the "North/South divide" saying it was not that bad, but "for ages I was the 'Cockney cunt' and they were the 'Manc fuckers'". In his book "What's the Story?" <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Robertson_eb2b.html" title="Ian Robertson">Ian Robertson</a> stated that White was also known by the phrase "Alan White - He's alright".</p>
<p>White was also entrusted with the job of being <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Gallagher_f126.html" title="Liam Gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a>'s 'official' drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together the pair were known as '<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_and_Ernie_ca15.html" title="Bert and Ernie">Bert and Ernie</a>', named after the <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a>-characters. In <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2002.html" title="December 2002">December 2002</a> Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> bar. Consequently, <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Gallagher_f126.html" title="Liam Gallagher">Liam</a> lost some of his front teeth and was arrested by the authorities. Alan, however, was inebriated and had a brain scan in a hospital afterwards after suffering minor head injuries.</p>
<p>Noel has stated that Alan had a far greater significance to the band than a mere session and touring drummer, claiming that he helped immensely in the recording process<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Noel also said that when he wrote a song he would play it to White who would often adapt the rhythm of the song or advise Gallagher on possible changes in the tempo.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> However, his style has been criticised for contributing to some of the bands more overblown moments, which earned Oasis' <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> <i><a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_Here_Now_4b01.html" title="Be Here Now">Be Here Now</a></i> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing_on_the_Shoulder_of_Giants_c5e9.html" title="Standing on the Shoulder of Giants">Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</a></i> a critical panning.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>At the time of his departure White was the longest serving member in Oasis beside the Gallaghers and passed through thin and thick with the band. He had supported the act from their years of glory during the Britpop hysteria and to their fall-out at the end of the decade. Although that longtime performers <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McGuigan_%28musician%29_c4c1.html" title="Paul McGuigan (musician)">Paul McGuigan</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Arthurs_a8de.html" title="Paul Arthurs">Paul Arthurs</a> quit the band during times of pressure, he decided to stay on with the band. The Gallaghers, for their part, have referred to White as the "best fucking drummer" they've ever played with.</p>
<p>Alan performed on 4 of Oasis' 6 studio albums: <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>), <i>Be Here Now</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>), <i>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) and <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Heathen_Chemistry_41ab.html" title="Heathen Chemistry">Heathen Chemistry</a></i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>). He also played on the majority of band's <a href="../../../b/-/s/B-side.html" title="B-side">b-sides</a>, some of which were released on the b-side record <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Masterplan_e2e5.html" title="The Masterplan">The Masterplan</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>).</p>
<p>White married model Liz Atkins on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">13 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> at Studley Priory Hotel, Oxfordshire. He had met her on the set of the "<a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Look_Back_in_Anger_0ab1.html" title="Don't Look Back in Anger">Don't Look Back in Anger</a>" music video. The couple divorced in 2000.</p>

<p>In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, White surprisingly left Oasis during the early recording sessions for the band's sixth album. According to Oasis' spokesperson there were some new tracks and demos with White's performance as well, which were made at the end <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> at the first sessions for their upcoming album, before his surprising departure. Due to his departure, the band scrapped the first midway sessions and later suffered some prolonged and difficult recording for <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Believe_the_Truth_a4e3.html" title="Don't Believe the Truth">Don't Believe the Truth</a></i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>).</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Noel also alluded to White's personal problems: "<i>He's a fucking great guy and he's one of the best drummers I've ever met in my life, but his personal life is fucking chaos,</i>" a possible reference to White's alleged romantic woes.</p>
<p>The rumours surrounding White's departure, either revolved around his past tendonitis problem or the false accusations of his leaking <i>Heathen Chemistry</i>. Amidst all the turmoil, Steve White, Alan's brother, <a href="http://www.whiteydrums.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.whiteydrums.com/" rel="nofollow">explained</a> to a fan in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> that his brother was just tired and didn't want to be in Oasis anymore, so he left to patch up his relationship with his girlfriend; <i>"The spirit of being in a band was kicked out of him."</i> However, Steve reassured the Oasis fan that his brother was in a good mood and condition and hinted that Alan possibly can continue his drumming – <i>"Perhaps some time soon, but he is very happy and very healthy and keeping very well"</i>. He currently resides in the Chicago suburbs with the love of his life, Christine.</p>
<p>White was replaced with <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zak_Starkey_adf4.html" title="Zak Starkey">Zak Starkey</a> – <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">the Who</a> drummer and the son of The Beatles' legend <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>. Ringo particularly was cited as one of White's biggest drumming influences.</p>
<p>In March 2007, the remaining members of <a href="../../../o/a/s/Oasis_%28band%29.html" title="Oasis (band)">Oasis</a> paid White £348,000 to buy him out of their company <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitely_Maybe_c30b.html" title="Definitely Maybe">Definitely Maybe</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, named after the band's <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debut_album.html" title="Debut album">debut album</a>.</p>

<p>For his part, White has kept a low profile since his departure, excluding a statement to a drumming site, where he said that the tendonitis rumours are "utter shit" and that the reasons are others. As of January 2007, 3 years after his departure of the band, White has remained out of the spotlight and he has no familiar drumming occupations at the moment.</p>
<p>His brother Steve has explained a couple of times in his website that Alan "is just having a nice time, he has pursued other interests in business. At the moment he has no plans at the minute to get behind the drums, his departure from the band left him with the feeling that the music business is full of bullshit and bullshitters."</p>
