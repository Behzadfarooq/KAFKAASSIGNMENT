<p>The MacTutor biography linked in the article mentions blackmail as reason for his going to the police. Is there a reference to a more precise biography on the web? --AxelBoldt</p>
<p>For precision and accuracy, go to www.turing.org.uk, Andrew Hodges' site. Unfortunately, he doesn't really discuss the trial in detail on the site, leaving the complicated story for his definitive book, Alan Turing: the Enigma. Suffice it to say there was an element of threatened blackmail, but it wasn't really about revealing that Turing was gay, and didn't really figure into the course of events. Basically, once the police got involved in Alan Turing's affairs (so to speak) for reasons that had little to nothing to do with homosexuality, they quickly discovered his homosexuality (he told them) and arrested him for it. The MacTutor biography has a lot of misleadingness. We should email Andrew Hodges (andrew@synth.co.uk) to see if he's willing to contribute his encyclopedic entry (<a href="http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/routledge.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/routledge.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) to here or Nupedia. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>

<p>I hate to admit this, but I had to look up 'larceny' in the dictionary. Is that really a conventional word? -- JanHidders</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Larceny</b> is a form of theft, where property is taken unlawfully. The distinction between larceny and burglary is that in larceny the perpetrator does have lawful access to the property, but no lawful right to remove it (burglary involved an act of trespass as well as theft). Police officers are authorised to confiscate the possessions of people they have arrested, but must keep them in a specific location and return all the possessions when incarceration ends (unless a court orders otherwise). Keeping any of the possessions constitutes larceny. Embezzlement dffers in that the perpetrator has the right to remove the property for specific purposes, but removes the property for some other, unauthorised purpose. Larceny is a standard term in criminal law.</dd>

<p>"he proved that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem, also known in computer science as the halting problem." That's not true. While any instance of the halting problem can be transformed into the Entscheidungsproblem, that makes the halting problem a "subset", if you like, of the Entscheidungsproblem rather than its equivalent (Robert Merkel &lt;rgmerk at mira dot net&gt;)</p>
<p>Well, the "also known in cs as the halting problem" is oversimplified, I agree. However, it is true that Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable by reducing it to the Halting problem, so in a sense the two problems are equivalent. --AxelBoldt</p>

<p>Where's the debate about his death? Anything other than suicide is terribly improbable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The cause of his death was debated from the beginning. Claiming it was "almost certainly" suicide is not a NPOV. NPOV now reflects both attributed causes of death.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only ones who doubted that it was suicide at the time were his mother and others close to him who didn't want to believe it. It was ruled a suicide by the coroner, and very few objective people have any reason to doubt that. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>"others close to him", in other words those best in the position to know his motivations? Homosexuality was seen as a negative attribute by the government at that time. The coroners report may have taken an easy out i.e. "oh, he was homosexual, it must have been suicide".</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, the coroner ruled it a suicide because he was found holding a half-eaten apple that was pretty clearly coated with a significant amount of cyanide that couldn't reasonably have been accidental. He was also known to be very depressed about the prosecution and the hormone treatments. And no, I don't think close friends are the best source of info here--suicide is also frowned upon, and some people just don't want to believe the obvious. At any rate, I don't have any problem with the article mentioning that some people doubt the suicide, as long as its clear that the <i>vast</i> majority accept it uncontroversially. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No individual on Wikipedia can presume to speak for the "vast majority" regarding an issue which is in dispute.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For God's sake, have you even <i>tried</i> to look up the issue on various sources? I did--most encycopedias simply report it as a suicide without even the slightest mention of controversy. The Turing site itself at <a href="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/bio/part7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/bio/part7.html" rel="nofollow">turing.org.uk</a> says exactly this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He was found by his cleaner when she came in on 8 June 1954. He had died the day before of cyanide poisoning, a half-eaten apple beside his bed. His mother believed he had accidentally ingested cyanide from his fingers after an amateur chemistry experiment, but it is more credible that he had successfully contrived his death to allow her alone to believe this. The coroner's verdict was suicide."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Before you accuse someone of not knowing what the majority opinion on an issue is, you might first look to see if <i>you</i> know what the hell you're talking about.</p>
<p>Simon Singh, in his book on Cryptography, cites a morbid habit of Turing's, where he would dangle an apple and mutter something like 'pretty apple, dip it in the brew' as a reference to Snow White. Off the top of my head i can't remember it, but that's the gist of it. He cites it as extra proof of suicide. <a href="../../../p/y/d/User%7EPydos_3460.html" title="User:Pydos">Pydos</a> 13:01, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quoting from a review in the New Yorker, "The possibility of clandestine assassination is hinted by the title of David Leavitt’s short biography, 'The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer' (Norton/Atlas; $22.95)", the whole review is at <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/060206crbo_books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/060206crbo_books" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Just curious, the article claims that Turing designed the bombe, but I was under the impression that he modified and improved Marian Rejewski's design, because the Biuro Szyfrow handed those blueprints over to British intelligence before Poland was invaded.

<dd>Later... On the other hand, our article on the <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombe.html" title="Bombe">Bombe</a> says that the Polish version was called the <i>Bomba</i>. Andrew Hodges seems to have missed this distinction. So we are right to say that Turing invented the <i>bombe</i>, but we should at least point out that it was based on the <i>bomba</i>. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 12:04, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we may have worded this a bit too strongly. The British bombe was not really a modified and improved Polish bomba. They certainly had superficial similarities (the name, the fact that they tried every starting point for the rotors, and that they were electro-mechanical machines used for breaking Enigma) but the interesting stuff — the cryptanalytic attack — was very different. To quote from a journal article which discusses and compares the two machines, "<i>The Polish bombe did not anticipate those key features which made the British bombe's design unique and highly effective. It is possible that the Polish machine was a starting point for the innovative thinking that led to the British bombe, but we shall never know.</i>" (Donald Davies, "The Bombe — a Remarkable Logic Machine", <i><a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptologia.html" title="Cryptologia">Cryptologia</a></i>, 23(2), April 1999). We currently say, "[the bombe]...was an improved version of the Polish-designed <i><a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomba_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Bomba (cryptography)">bomba</a></i>"; I think we would be safer if we simply said, "[the bombe]...which may have been inspired by the Polish-designed <i><a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomba_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Bomba (cryptography)">bomba</a></i>". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 14:01, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the article should be revised to say that Turing improved on the original Polish bombe/bomba. Gordon Welchman gives an account in "Hut Six Story" - its clear the original bombe/a was a Polish concept. The British refined the idea, and made it work with the additional rotors. But it still worked in substantially the same way. So it was not Turing's invention. Trious 20:07, 10 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is not correct. The British bombe and Polish bomba are similar only superficially, and do not work in "substantially the same way". Since you mention Welchman, in his last article on the subject before he died, he quoted C. Deavours, who says, "The British bombes were in no way related to or derived from the earlier Polish bomby." (The Welchman article was written to correct the mistakes in the accounts on Enigma, and to set the record straight on the Polish contribution, so it's implausible that he disagreed with this.) <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 00:38, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Spencer, I saw you'd changed "honour" to "honor" in the first paragraph. I changed it back, as I believe there are British spellings throughout, and also because this is about a British scientist and the work he did in Britain, so American/Canadian spelling seems a little out of place.

<dd>The way that I understand it, Gilbert Baker's rainbow pride flag wasn't unveiled in public until 1978, so the association of the "rainbow" portion of Apple's 1976 logo with Turing's <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a> is moot. But what about the association with Turing's suicide? It seems to be an interesting coincidence.</dd>
<dd>Check out this site from an alleged insider: <i>Rob Janoff designed it -- an Apple with a bite out of it, indicating the acquisition of knowledge. Originally, the apple logo was to be simple, but the Apple II's advantage at the time was color output, so Jobs argued the logo should have colors, and, of course, Jobs won. He ended up actually specifying several of the colors of the logo.</i><a href="http://www.kelleyad.com/Histry.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kelleyad.com/Histry.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
<dd>Also see this interview with Janoff: <i>There's a little bit of a pun in the way that the shape is designed. The bite that is taken out of it. It’s not only the silouhette of an apple, (you couldn’t take a bite like that out of any other piece of fruit shaped that way) but byte is also a computer term. So from the beginning really, I think that what computer people responded to, was the little double meaning there, in the shape.</i><a href="http://www.jacques-moury-beauchamp.com/moury/beauchamp/SIGNEDAMERICA/pages/JANOFFUS.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jacques-moury-beauchamp.com/moury/beauchamp/SIGNEDAMERICA/pages/JANOFFUS.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 07:33, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, the point is that the association of the rainbow with gay pride would not have been there when the logo was designed, so they wouldn't have used it to honor Turing, whose suicide (if that's what it was) via the poisoned apple is thought to have stemmed from depression over being persecuted for his homosexuality. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The argument published is still nonsensical. The point is actually to know if Plant means that the homage to Turing in the Apple logo is either the rainbow or the biten apple. In the former case, as the wikie states, it would be anachronistic. In the latter, however, it remains possible that the logo is an homage - but to his unusual death, not his homosexuality per se. - J.</p>

<p>I would like to discuss with Matt Crypto his deletion of my reference to Polish priority in "breaking" the Enigma code. This article, in its present state, gives a wrong (yes, wrong) impression that it was all done by Turing and other people from Blechley park. Which is historically untrue. The article makes multiple references to other people that participated in the development, but never mentions the Polish scientists.</p>
<p>With all due respect and recognition, math is not a British monopoly, and Enigma was not broken by Turing or any other British scientist.</p>
<p>And if the article is, as Matt Crypto stresses, is all about Turing, then the reasons for including British mathematicians are not more valid than those for including Polish mathematicians.</p>
<p>My email is vpatryshev@yahoo.com</p>
<dl>
<dd>Enigma wasn't broken solely by Poles — there were 1000s of people who worked on breaking Enigma, Poles, Brits, French and Americans. We can't mention everybody, and the Polish work is amply discussed in other articles. In an article on Alan Turing, we should just focus on Alan Turing. I don't believe we imply that Enigma codebreaking was a British/AMT monopoly in any way; we just describe his contribution, and that's it. The reason we mention Welchman and Keen is that they were Turing's colleagues who worked with him to design and build the bombe. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 11:14, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Enigma wasn't broken solely by Poles — there were 1000s of people who worked on breaking Enigma, Poles, Brits, French and Americans." - perfect. Let's have this kind of statement in the article. Enigma was not broken solely by Turing, by Brits (I never heard of any American input), but by an internatinal team. While probably too idealistic and politically correct, it would still be more fair. Statements like "He contributed several mathematical insights into breaking both the Enigma machine" give a wrong impression that Enigma was not cracked before Turing started working on it. Polish Bomba (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29</a>) was sucessfully working in 1938.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so, personally — even if I knew nothing about a subject, if I read that someone "contributed insights" into something, I wouldn't think that nobody else had ever worked on it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 10:09, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any ideas, by the way, why Turing is not even mentioned in "Bomba" and "Enigma" articles? Could we, at least partially, find a common ground here? Please excuse me, but this kind of defense reminds me the small patriotisms flourishing in Estonia, Turmenistan, and the like. Turing was a great scientist, and Britain is a great coutnry, and neither of these two deserves this doubtful kind of protection.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the reason Turing isn't mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomba_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Bomba (cryptography)">Bomba</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma machine</a> articles is that he would be a little off-topic (in the same way that Rejewski et al would be off-topic in this article). The <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma machine</a> article discusses the operation and history of the machine itself, in which Turing doesn't feature at all. He does, of course, get a mention in <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma_87e6.html" title="Cryptanalysis of the Enigma">Cryptanalysis of the Enigma</a>.

<p>The article needs to be clear about the status of Turing as a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_hero.html" title="War hero">war hero</a>. One contributor regards the term as POV whilst another states that such an attribution doesn't belong in an encyclopædia. I doubt either of these views is correct. The lack of official recognition should not prevent an objective historical assessment. Turing did not receive any recognition during his lifetime since his work was classified. Nor was there any posthumous recognition given the unfortunate circumstances surrounding his death. Were it not for breaking the Enigma code, the war would have continued for longer with all the consequent death and destruction. Were it not for Turing, the Enigma code would not have been broken so early and so consistently thereafter. This counterfactual assessment may be debated and other names may be credited. The question remains how to recognise not only someone's intellectual but also their moral worth. Turing did not seek recognition but he certainly deserves it. The ironic aspect of this is that the Turing name is used to reward others but the man himself was not rewarded.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the way I see it is that whether Turing qualifies as a "hero" or not is essentially a subjective judgement, and not an objective fact. The best we can do on Wikipedia is record other people's opinions of Turing — we cannot and should not try to judge whether he "deserves it" or not. And ultimately, we don't need to tell people he's a war hero. It should suffice that they can read what he did during WWII; people can draw their own conclusions. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 13:02, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's reasonable to note in the article that some consider him a war hero. That isn't a subjective judgement on the part of Wikipedia. It's objective reporting.

It's also useful to note, as you did, that he didn't get recognition as such during his lifetime.</dd>

<p>I am completely disagree with the term "hypercomputation" in Turing's dissertation used in this Wikipedia article. it is right that it is about machines with oracles but the name "hypercomputing" or "hypercomputer" goes far beyond. It is a new concept made to conceptualize the idea of the possibility of effective computation non-Turing computable going against the Church-Turing thesis. While Turing's idea relativise the theory in order to make deductions as general as such from Godel: it does not matter how powerful is a new oracle, the halting problem still stands, as in Godel work in which it does not matter how strong is a consistent theory it will be always incomplete if it includes at least the power of arithmetic. I undersand that this misundersating comes from Copeland claims but even if he is not agree with me there is a big disagree in the academical media about his claims in such respect and thus I think such term must be omited. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 81.80.177.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.80.177.151_0ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.80.177.151">contribs</a>) 23:03, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>It depends on who you talk to. Historians will say the cryptography, and computer scientists will say the turing machine or turing test. I think they should both be mentioned, and it doesn't really matter which is mentioned first. As it stands though, the intro "paragraph" is 4 paragraphs now, and is far too long; it really should be condensed. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DDG</a> 18:26, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Turing was a multifaceted chap, and four paragraphs is acceptable for a long article (which this article should be, eventually). We could merge the two sentences on codebreaking into one, but we need to summarise the main points of his life, and I can't see much else that could go. (Don't forget that Turing is also known for being a "gay man before his time", for which he is possibly most famous amongst non-technical people). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 19:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not a "gay man before his time". He lived during his time and excelled. The real point is that he was forced to inject female sex hormones by his government and died before he should have. This shows the corrosive effect of homophobia. The world lost years of productive work from Turing.</dd>

<dd>Sort-of. According to Hodges biography, Turing had a "shy, hesitant and high-pitched voice, not exactly stuttering, but hesitating, as if waiting for some laborious process to translate his thoughts into human speech" (p. 24), and his voice was "liable to stall in mid-sentence with a tense, high-pitched `Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah' while he fished, his brain almost visibly labouring away, for the right expression" (p. 209). <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Newman_ac2d.html" title="Max Newman">Max Newman</a>'s wife described his "shrill stammer and the crowing laugh which told on the nerves even of his friends" (p. 396). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 19:53, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Turing participated in the Amateur Athletics Association championships at Loughborough College Stadium, Leicestershire on 23 augustus 1947. His 2:46:3 seconds, probably his personal best, had him finish as fifth runner in the race. This race apparently functioned as qualifier for the Olympics of London 1948, and the first and second place, Jack Holden - 2:33:21 - and Thomas Richards - 2:36:7 - were two of the three runners that represented Britain in the Olympic Marathon.<br />
The Olympic Marathon was won by Delfo Cabrera in 2:34:52, Richards came second in 2:35:08, both more than 10 minutes under Turing's time. However, Holden didn't finish, and the third British runner, Stan Jones, finished 30th and last, of 41 started, in 3:9:16. No two marathons are the same, but Turing's time at Loughborough would have put him in the middle of the finishing field at the Olympic Marathon, in 15th place.</p>

<p>The author, Philip Johnston, is the home affairs editor of the Telegraph, and he wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Alan Turing is sometimes called the father of modern computer science. A gifted mathematician, logician and cryptographer, he worked at Bletchley Park, the top secret codebreaking centre in Buckinghamshire during the war. For a time, he was head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German Naval cryptanalysis...He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the bombe, an electromechanical machine which could find settings for the Enigma."</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can note the similarity with what we say,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Alan Mathison Turing...was an English mathematician, logician, and cryptographer. Turing is often considered to be the father of modern computer science...Turing worked at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre, and was for a time head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German Naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine which could find settings for the Enigma machine."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Two other lines from Turing's mini-bio appear to have been copied verbatim from another site: "Turing was the key figure in the continual battle to decode messages encrypted by the increasingly complex Enigma machines, using the Bombe machine" which seems to have been lifted from <a href="http://www.artzia.com/History/Biography/Turing/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artzia.com/History/Biography/Turing/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>; the other is "The periods when the Naval code could be broken saw dramatic reductions in the shipping losses from the Atlantic convoys so essential to the conduct of the Allied war effort."</p>
<p>I certainly do not have a problem with people reusing our work -- that's the point, after all, of creating a <i>free</i> encyclopedia. I wonder though whether doing so without acknowledging to the source is, perhaps, a little impolite. It's not a big deal, of course, but I think it's important that if anyone reuses phrases and sentences from another sources without significant rewording or paraphrase then they should say where it comes from. This applies equally, of course, to Wikipedia itself, not just off-wiki. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:12, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to being impolite, it's also a copyright violation. Most work on WP is copyrighted; the copyright holders (that is, the original authors) have licensed the world at large to use their work, but only in accordance with the terms of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, which require that credit be given. (A few editors state on their userpages that their contributions are in the public domain; I guess if you're really interested, you could track down the person who wrote that sentence and see if he's one of those.)</dd>
<dd>But let's keep it in perspective. The copyvio from WP consists of one not-overlong sentence; I would <i>hope</i> the courts would not allow themselves to be clogged up with <i>de minimis</i> stuff like this. Still, it certainly doesn't reflect well on the <i>Telegraph'</i>s reporter. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 00:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah. Her full name was Ethel Sara Turing (nee Stoney), but I gather she was sometimes/often/normally(?) known as Sara. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well spotted, Blahedo! I don't know if she ever answered to Ethel, but she was always Sara in later life, is Sara Turing on the cover, title page and copyright statement of her biography of AMT, and in the book's foreword Lyn Irvine refers to her as Sara Turing.

<dd>Letters from EST to Lyn Irvine, now in the library of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_College%2C_Cambridge_23b8.html" title="St. John's College, Cambridge">St. John's College, Cambridge</a>, were signed "Sara", so this was definitely not just a nom de plume.
