In the "History" section, it says that one (disputed) story is that they are descended from Ismailis, but below, it says that (no mention of controversy) they are descended from Twelvers ("Theologically Alawites descend from Twelver Shiites"). Does this mean to say that they are theologically <i>closer</i> to Twelvers, in that they share more beliefs?</p>
<p>Also, the "Pillars of Islam" bit is a little garbled. Traditionally, there are <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Pillars_of_Islam_b5aa.html" title="Five Pillars of Islam">Five Pillars of Islam</a>. The article makes it sound as if Alawites add two more, <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> and Waliya. But then I don't understand that they "recognize 5 of 7".--<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_power_30cd.html" title="User:Max power">Max power</a> 18:08, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>REPLY</b> I think the tow points you mentioned were corrected. 1. Ismailis are also descendents of Twelvers. There is a high probability that Ismaili sect was founded prior to Alawite but that does not mean that the latter descended from the former. 2. The part of the additional two pillars of Islam was removed. you were right though, it absolutely did not make sense the way it was written. August 10, 2004.</p>
<p>Both the Ismailis and the Alawites broke away from the main branch of the Shia and both did this in the gnostic sourroundings of Mesopotamia. Their similarities derive there from. The Ismailis were Seveners from their beginnings, but at that time there was no elaborate Twelver Shia. Not before the Saffavids ruled Persia the Twelver took shape. Thus the Alawites are a Shiite sect of their own kind.</p>
<p>I just thought I might put in something to say that the terms <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alawi.html" title="Alawi">Alawi</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alevi.html" title="Alevi">Alevi</a> are different, as that tripped me up once (I thought the latter was the Turkish pronunciation of the former). There is a liitle self-referrence in there too, that I'll remove. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:52, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've never encountered in the historical and scientific literature about Syria a percentage higher than 10-11% of the population for the Alawites, where does this 25% estimate come from&#160;? In Lebanon, they have one seat in the Parliament since the Taef agreement. In Turkey there are probably many more Alawites than in Lebanon, in the Hatay and Adana provinces, some are Arab-speaking, some 'turkified'. --Pylambert 09:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"There are also fewer than 200,000 Alawites who live in Lebanon,"</p>
<p>Though this is true, the statement could be more accurate. The number of alawites in Lebanon is really small. I doubt that there is more than a few thousands.--<a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquitor_1cfe.html" title="User:Equitor">equitor</a> 07:28, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>They have two seats actually. There are a lot of Alawites in Tripoli and in a number of villages along the Syrian border. --83.72.194.208 19:43, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states that "Alawites also study the writings of Aristotle, Socrates and Alexander the Great". This should be changed to: "Alawites also study the writings of Aristotle as well as other texts, puportedly written by Socrates and Alexander the Great", since neither Socrates nor Alexander have left any texts. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 212.205.127.4 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__212.205.127.4_8a20.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 212.205.127.4">contribs</a>) 11:19, 11 November 2005</small></p>

<dd>Thank you, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.105.224.62_dc85.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.105.224.62">58.105.224.62</a>, for your input. I think the previous comment was not to deny the place of Socrates and Alexander in Alawite texts, but to ensure historical accuracy. Do Alawites believe that they have hidden knowledge of personal texts, or is it that we are speaking of the historical texts available to all that were written about these men rather than by them? Also, we need to be very careful with the accuracy of numbers. You changed the upper limit of Alawite population of Syria from 11% to 17%. This is a big change, and seems rather unlikely. Please could you reference this figure before adding it, and I'll change it back for now. In conjunction with this, you have changed the Alawite population of Lebanon from 'a few thousand' to 'thousands'. The former suggests a population of around 3,000 to 4,000, while the latter is difficult to interpret. Granted that it would be better to have more accurate figures, the former style is more precise. You also removed the following from the article:</dd>

<p>NOSAIRIS (also known as Ansayrii, sometimes Ansariyeh), the people who inhabit the mountainous country of N. Syria, which is bounded on the S. by the north end of the Lebanon at the Nahr el-Keblr (Eleutherus), on the N. by Mt Casius, Antioch and the Nahr el-'Asi (Orontes). Various settlements of them "are found also in Antioch itself and in Tarsus, Adana, and a few other places, while in harvest time they come down as far as the Biq'a (Buka'a). From the time of Strabo until about two centuries ago, the country was famed for its wine, but now more for its tobacco (especially at Latakia). The total number of Nosairis inhabiting this country is variously estimated at from 120,000 to 150,000.</p>
<p>The origin of the name Nosairi is uncertain. Among the more possible explanations is that the name is derived from that of Mahommed Ibn Nusair, who was an Isma'Ilite follower of the eleventh imam of the Shiites at the end of the 9th century. This view has been accepted by Nosairi writers, but they transfer Ibn Nusair to the 7th century and make him the son of the vizier of Moawiya I., while another tradition (cf. Abulfeda, Geog. vol. ii. p. n, No. 7) identifies him with Nusair, a freedman of the caliph 'Ali. It is, however, noteworthy that Pliny (Hist. not. v. 81) gives the name Nazerini to the inhabitants of this district. In this part of Syria paganism remained even up to the middle ages (cf. Archives de I'Orient latin, vol. ii. 2, p. 375), and there is a complete absence of churches of the 5th to the 7th centuries in these mountains. In the 7th century the Arabs invaded Syria, but do not seem to have got into these mountains. At the end of the loth century, however, the Isma'Ilite propaganda won some success among the people. Their strongholds were taken by Raymond in 1099, and later Tancred secured the very summits. In 1132—1140 the Assassins gained possession of their chief towns, but Saladin recovered them in 1188. In 1317 the sultan Bibars endeavoured to convert them to orthodox Islam, and built many mosques, but Ibn Batuta (i. 177) says they did not use them. A fatwa of Ibn Taimiyya (d. 1327) of this time shows that the Nosairis were regarded with fear and hatred by the orthodox. For the next 5oo years they were given over to their own internal disputes, until they came under the power of Ibrahim Pasha in 1832. At the present time they are under the direct administration of the Turks. The religion of the Nosairis seems to have been almost the same in the first years of the 5th century A.H. (11th century A.D.) as it is to-day, judging by the references in the.sacred books of the Druses. As set forth in their own sacred book, the Majmu', it seems to be a syncretism of Isma'Ilite doctrines and the ancient heathenism of Harran. The ages of the world are seven in number, each of these having its own manifestation of deity. But the manifestation of the 7th age is not a Mahdi who is yet to come, but the historical person 'Ali ibn abu Talib. This is stated in the crudest form in Sura n of the Majmu&#160;: " I testify that there is no god but 'Ali ibn abu Talib." 'Ali is also called the Ma'nd (" Idea "; cf. the Logos of the New Testament), hence the Nosairis are also called the Ma'nawiyya. 'Ali created Mahomet, who is known as the Ism (" Name "), and a trinity is formed by the addition of Salman ul-FarisI, who is the Bab (" Door "), through whom the propaganda is made, and through whom one comes to God. A mysterious symbol much used in their ceremonies of initiation consists of the three letters 'Ain, Mim, Sin, these being, the initials of 'Ali, Mahomet and Salman. Of these three, however, 'Ali is the supreme. In Sura 6 of the' Majmu* the Nosairi says: " I make for the Door, I prostrate myself before the Name, I worship the Idea." Each of the seven manifestations of God in the ages of the world has been opposed by an adversary.</p>
<p>The Nosairis are divided into four sects, (i) The Haidarls (from the name haidari, " lion," given to 'Ali on account of his valour) are the most advanced. (2) The Shamalis or Shamsis preserve many traces of the old nature-worship, 'Ali (i.e. the supreme god) is the heaven, Mahomet is the sun, Salman the moon. (3) On the other hand the Kalazis, so named from a sheik Mahommed ibn Kalazi (cf. E. Salisbury in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, viii. 237), or Qamaris, hold that the supreme god ('Ali) is the moon, not the sun. Their poetry addressed to the moon is translated by C. Huart in the Journal asiatique, ser. vii. vol. xiv. pp. 190 ff. (4) The Ghaibis are worshippers of the air, for God is invisible. In this they come nearer to the ordinary Isma'ilite doctrine. Religion is restricted among the Nosairis to the initiated, who must be adults over fifteen years of age and of Nosairi parentage. The initiator, who must not be a relative, becomes a spiritual father, and the relation cannot be broken except by his consent. The initiation consists of three stages. In the first the novice is received and told to meditate on the three mystic letters; in the second, after a period of forty days, he is taught the titles of the 16 suras of the Majmu'; in the third, after seven or nine months (intended to correspond with the ordinary period of gestation), he is taught Suras 5, 6 and 9, learns the meaning of the three mystic letters and goes through a further period of instruction from his initiator. The initiated are divided into two classes, the sheiks, who are recruited from the families of sheiks only, and the ordinary members.</p>
<p>The Nosairis are believers in metempsychosis. The pious Nosairi takes his rank among the stars, but the body of the impious undergoes many transformations.</p>

<p>The use of <b>ʕAlī</b> is not consistent with other parts of Wikipedia, most notably the main artlce. I'd like to see some discussion of this so we can see if there's a consensus. If no one responds within a week, I'll make the Wikification changes and perhaps those who have put the page on their Watch Lists will the contribute. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 04:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the English WP the policy is to use the standard English spelling (Ali).

<p>I live in the Golan, which hold 4 Druze villages (Majdal Shams, Bukataa, Ein Kinye and Massade). These villages are all 100% Druze. All the rest of the communities in the Golan are Jewish commuinites built after 1967. There are no 2000 Alawis in the Golan, and I would dare to say there is not a single one...</p>

<p>There is a contradiction on some articles about whether or not the Alawites are Shia. I've ironed out what I've seen of it, although I suppose it will return. So are the Alawites shia? And who decides what is or is not Shia? <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 10:26, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My understanding is that the Alawites are a heterodox sect arising out of the Shia tradition. Orthodox Shia often don't consider them to be Shia (or even Islamic), but we could compare that to Heterodox groups deriving out of the Protestant tradition, for instance - orthodox Protestants don't consider Unitarians or Jehovah's Witnesses to be Christian, but both groups trace their origin to the Protestant tradition. It's probably best to express it in some way like that, and not get into the POV dispute over whether they are "really" Shia or not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:35, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Alawi themselves seem to regard themselves as Shia, while Twelver Shiites (more or less) don't. That's whats confusing me on this. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 16:01, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do Twelver Shiites consider Seveners to be Shiites? At any rate, I think the thing to do is to say they come out of the Shiite tradition, and perhaps that they consider themselves Shiite, but that they are considered heretics by orthodox Twelver Shiites as well as by Sunnis. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:01, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Shiite view of them is not one of simple heterodoxy. For example Twelver Shia judges started were the first jurists of the Alawi courts in the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alawite_State_d4c4.html" title="Alawite State">Alawite State</a>, Alawites were invited to Najaf (with mixed success) and they accepted oversight of the Lebanese Alawis in the 1970s. Twelvers do seem to reject the Alawites. We also have the problem that Alawites are definately claim shia origin and they are self defined as Shia. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 18:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>But shias are so much more mainstream, how can alewites be even muslim if they dont follow the 5 pillar of faith this is crazy. if they trule believ this then they should be denounced completely as mulslims. alewite beliefs are blasphemous if this is what they are</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Most religions have different factions that accuse each other of heresy -- Europe was wracked by war between Catholics and Protestants, Orthodox Christianity still has a whammy curse or something on the Pope, and most mainstream Christians view Mormanism as a completely non-Christian religion.</p>
<p>Wikipedia absolutely can't be making theological judgements. Just state the facts, Alawites call themselves Shi'ite Muslims. Other Muslim groups view them as heretical (and make sure you point out in the Sunni article that Shi'ites consider Sunnis heretical for allegedly destroying portions of the Quran).</p>

<p>"Alawites also study the writings of Aristotle, Socrates, and Alexander the Great."</p>
<p>Alexander the Great didn't write anything (that the West knows of).</p>
<p>There are some ancient biographies of him that are secular.</p>
<p>If there is some Alawite document attributed to Alexander this needs to be specified.</p>
<p>This is another sign of the high "hearsay" quotient and potential for error of this largely unsourced article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.7.2.196_a90e.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.7.2.196">75.7.2.196</a> (talk) 09:15, 24 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Just wondering, but why has the list of Natiq and Asas changed to such a ridiculous degree, now it includes Adam, Alexander and many people not originally listed.</p>
