<p><b>Alan Clayson</b> (<a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover.html" title="Dover">Dover</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>) is of a late 1970s vintage of composer-entertainers that also embraces the likes of Wreckless Eric, Tom Robinson, Elvis Costello and John Otway. While he is still making regular concert appearances, he has become better known as an author of around thirty books - mostly musical biography. These include the best-sellers Backbeat (subject of a major film), The Yardbirds and The Beatles Box. He has written for journals as diverse as The Guardian, Record Collector, Ink, Mojo, Mediaeval World, Folk Roots, Guitar, Hello!, Drummer, The Times, The Independent, Ugly Things and, as a 'teenager, the notorious Schoolkids 0z. He has also been engaged to perform and lecture on both sides of the Atlantic - as well as broadcast on national TV and radio . From 1975 to 1985, he led the legendary Clayson and the Argonauts - who reformed in 2005, ostensibly to launch Sunset On A Legend, a long-awaited double-CD retrospective - and was thrust to 'a premier position on rock's Lunatic Fringe' (Melody Maker). As shown by the existence of a US fan club - dating from an 1992 soiree in Chicago - Alan Clayson's following grows still as well as demand for his talents as a record producer, and the number of versions of his compositions by such diverse acts as Dave Berry (in whose backing group, he played keyboards in the mid-1980s), New Age outfit, Stairway - and Joy Tobing, winner of the Indonesian version of Pop Idol. He has worked too with The Portsmouth Sinfonia, Wreckless Eric, Twinkle, The Yardbirds, The Pretty Things, Mark Astronaut and the late Screaming Lord Sutch among many others. While his stage act defies succinct description, he has been labelled a 'chansonnier' in recent years for performances and record releases that may stand collectively as Alan Clayson's artistic apotheosis were it not for a promise of surprises yet to come.</p>

                                    Reviews of Alan Clayson's work
</pre>
<p><br />
THE YARDBIRDS (book)</p>
<p>Number One in Mojo book chart, December 2002 “The definitive treatment...” (Get Rhythm, July 2002)</p>
<p>"Most impressive...it’s probably the only book on the group you’ll ever need...” - (Record Collector, September 2002)</p>
<p>"Beautifully written and splendidly illustrated, this is an essential read for anyone remotely interested in the music of the ‘60s” - (Uncut, November 2002)</p>
<p><br />
NINE TIMES TWO (various artists album):</p>
<p>(a) The Last Show On Earth</p>
<p>"A powerfully-felt tribute” (Folk London, June-July)“Alan Clayson comes up trumps on a dark, doom-laden Lord Sutch tribute, ‘The Last Show On Earth’” (Record Collector, June 2002)</p>
<p>“Pete Atkin, Leon Rosselson and Robb Johnson do betray stylistic similarities, but Alan Clayson’s dissonant electric tribute to Screamin’ [sic] Lord Sutch (Monster Raving Loony as tragic hero)is a different business altogether” (Folk Roots, July 2002)</p>
<p>"A bleak, way-out experience...moments of sheer hell" (Zabadak, October 2002)</p>
<p><br />
(b) The Moonlight Skater</p>
<p>"Beginning with the kind of violin that might scare a Pogues-dreading listener away, “The Moonlight Skater” quickly develops into a lolling beauty which is at once festive, longing and just, well, nice. You don’t necessarily need to know that the B-side, “The Last Show On Earth” was produced by Wreckless Eric and was written about the death of Alan’s friend, Lord Sutch. Then, with the faint trace of a whistle, the main attraction is all over, and you’ll want to hear Clayson’s almost dulcet mediaeval tones all over again.” (Record Collector, December 2002)</p>
<p><br />
EDGARD VARESE (book)</p>
<p>"Clayson's eccentric journalese skitters about the composer's life with a recklessness that would make the more academically inclined white with fear (but) it conveys the breathless excitement you feel when first discovering a great record, book or film" (Dan Fox, www.frieze.co.uk)</p>
<p>“A racy, fanciful account. Clayson’s evident enthusiasm for the music (if not the man) and his completely unpretentious style makes this an enjoyable study. In addition, he has a sense of humour as morbid as his subject's" (Literary Review, May 2003)</p>
<p>"A breezy, journalistic style which Varese hiimself, In his iconoclastic way, might have preferred to, the more solemn, well-rounded phraseology of academic’ prose. Admirers of Varese from the classical end of the market might well be curious to see how a writer from a different background tackles their hero. In the end, however, I suspect that it is readers who are interested in Alan Clayson himself, as a musician of many parts, who will get the most out of this book" (Gramophone, February 2003)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>JOHN LENNON (book)</p>
<p>“Clayson brings enthusiastic, authoritative insight and a refreshingly salty attitude to his beat-pop reminiscences. His labyrinthine prose and simmering resentment at the indulgent mediocrity of some who make it ‘big’ make for a lively read” (Mojo, June 2003)_</p>
<p><br />
PAUL McCARTNEY (book)</p>
<p>"Perhaps it's because Clayson isn't much of a fan that he's written such a well-balanced and dispassionate account. The chapter on the early years is excellent, while his Beatles story is recounted with surprising originality. McCartney's post-Beatles career is every bit as interesting. "We never see a man. We only see his art," Clayson concludes towards the end. Actually, he's done a pretty fine job illuminating both" (Uncut, October 2003)</p>
<p><br />
BRIAN JONES (book)</p>
<p>"A gnarly story told with colour and zip...Clayson imagining his way inside Jones's head...his portrayal of the screaming claustrophobia of post-war petit bourgeois mores is both heartfelt and utterly hilarious" (MOJO, May 2004);</p>
<p>"An entertaining and even-handed portrait that will make you damned glad you didn't grow up in 1950s Cheltenham" (Q, May 2004)</p>
<p><br />
CHARLIE WATTS (book)</p>
<p>"The first biography of the drummer is a compelling mix of extremely readable narrative and secondary interviews" - Record Collector (October 2004)</p>
<p><br />
WOMAN: THE INCREDIBLE LIFE OF YOKO ONO (book) "A balanced critique of her considerable contribution to the realm of the avant-garde...deliciously waspish observations...almost certainly the first serious discussion to appear" (Uncut, October 2004)</p>
<p><br />
KEITH RICHARDS (book)</p>
<p>"Myths are debunked, fact separated from fiction, and, through Clayson's exhaustive research and tracking down of interviewees, "Keith Richards" manages to roll over some unturned Stones" (Record Collector, June 2005)</p>
<p><br />
CAPTAIN BEEFHEART (DVD)</p>
<p>An Independent Critical Analysis (Sexy lntellectual/Chrome Dreams, UK; all regions DVD) "....the placement of Alan Clayson behind the pulpit of an old English church is perhaps inspired choice, effectively casting him as some slightly mad vicar banished to a small country parish. (Ugly Things, Issue 24)</p>
<p><br />
LED ZEPPELIN (book)</p>
<p>"This history is not for the faint-hearted, but for the dedicated Zep-head. There isn't a better early years narrative than these 288 pages (Metal Hammer, March 2006)</p>
<p><br />
"The result is startling, not only as an accurate portrayal of Zeppelin,but also as an account of the ambition-packed youth of mid-60s Britain. Clayson is right on the mark" (Record Collector, March 2006)</p>
<p><br />
SUNSET ON A LEGEND (album)</p>
<p>"Incredibly strange and at times strangely incredible...Clayson’s witty, literate—if sometimes wordy— lyrics consistently illicit surprise if not outright hilarity...The arrangements are equally inventive, ranging from a quasi big-band format to the more stripped-down chansons style of some of the singer’s later work (Ugly Things, Issue 24)</p>
