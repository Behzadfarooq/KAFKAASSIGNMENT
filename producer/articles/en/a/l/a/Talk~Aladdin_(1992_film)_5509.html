<p>Um, hello, but since there's no where else to put this, I wanted to note that aladdin was not ripped from the other examples on the actual page and here in discussion, but far more from the thief and the cobbler by richard williams. Since I am only an anonymous user, and the edits I made noting this were just removed, I make a motion for someone to note the high amount of similarities between these two films, with the scene in aladdin of abu stealing a ruby from a statue being copied from the thief and the cobbler EXACTLY, agrabah being based entirely on thief's depiction of baghdad as the golden city, and countless characters, such as jafar and genie being based on the vizier character Zig Zag in thief, abu and aladdin being based on the thief and cobbler characters respectively, jasmine being based on princess yum yum, and the sultan being a blatant rip off of king nod. Before anyone says these are unverified and biased claims, try actually finding out about this movie on the wikipedia page and how much disney wished to supress what it itself used as the basis for aladdin.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes this is true, but <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">Wikipedia is not your soapbox</a>. I've taken the section down to one verifiable sentence- even if something is true, it must be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> (ie, all claims must be sourced through <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>). Also, EMPHASIZING words or using words like "blatant" is quite a skewed point of view- let the facts speak for themselves. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:39, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, you didn't remove enough. It currently says that there is a controversy over the similarities, but the link provided gives no indication of such a controversy. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 15:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hello, same person from the first edit again. I apologize if my first edit seemed biased in my word use and all, but my examples are not; if you please, go to google video and download any [even disney's] version of the film for your own viewing. If you can, please try to edit as thorough as possible a comparison on the most similar of characters, designs, and scenes. Now, in a non-emphasized way, I'd like to point out a few:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. I stand behind the abu stealing ruby from an idol/thief stealing ruby from an idol parallelism; the way abu greedily looks at the asian idol's ruby with a reflection in his eyes is almost identical to the thief greedily eying the buddha's ruby, and both robberies result in general disorder. 2. It is the most obvious and certifiable point with many disney animators that you wrote that zig-zag the grand vizier's design and character influenced jafar and the genie, but would it perhaps be elaborated upon? I'll leave that discretion to the registered users. 3. I apologize for any bias in this point, but why was the fact that disney acquisitioned the movie through miramax just to discredit it and make it seem like a rip-off of aladdin not included? I believe, if the miramax version is watched from google video, you can see how animation and dialoge was edited, hastily completed, and references to aladdin introduced in the story. 4. And, just a final point, could there please be an inclusion of how many animators who worked on thief and the cobbler left during the long production time and went to disney, and that the work print was shown repeatedly at the disney warner bros. and multiple other animation studios; I can not verify these events, but they seem highly likely, and would better explain how the disney animators were able to re-use the designs and animation. Thank you once again! Oh, and here is an actual link to all the google video links for the thief and the cobbler videos for verification of comparisons:<a href="http://www.ctufilms.com/cobbler/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ctufilms.com/cobbler/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctufilms.com/cobbler/index.htm</a></p>

<dd>Um, excuse me, but I know many of the similarities aren't easily verified, but it must be considered what this movie has been through and the obscurity created by it's minimization. And I looked at the page, and wouldn't the movie itself be a verifiable source? You can look at Wikipedia's <i>Thief and the Cobbler</i> page for examples others found, and the link I provided to all the versions of the movie so it could be included for others to view at thier own discretion to notice the similarities. Would it help if I put a statement to generalize it, like "it can be ascertained" or such? The reason I do not have verifiable evidence is because, once again, I am not a registered user. All I am trying to accomplish is a fair and informative comparison to introduce the similarities between these two great films and to bring to light <i>The Thief and the Cobbler</i>, a film I can honestly and without bias say has been very maltreated by any involved, not just disney.
<dl>
<dd>From the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>- the threshold for inclusion is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>. Being a registered user has nothing to do with finding verifiable sources. However, I'm fairly confident more sources on the comparison are out there somewhere- it just might take a little bit of digging.</dd>
<dd>Within the article itself, you may not add your own conclusions- this amounts to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which is prohibited pretty strongly. Using phrases like "it can be ascertained" is called using <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> (pardon the pejorativeness, it's just a name), which is basically the same as original research.</dd>
<dd>As for using the movie itself as a source- you cannot do this to reach new conclusions. These conclusions (which include comparisons) must have been made somewhere else by a reliable source (something with an editorial process). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:34, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've been under the impresssion since it came out that the beginning of the move was slightly altered from the movie (I saw it in the theatre) - While I'll admit it's been a while, the movie began with Aladin swiping the bread. The VHS begins after he's already stolen it. A difference like two seconds, but it stuck out to me. <a href="../../../x/c/0/User%7EXC0000005_2aa7.html" title="User:XC0000005">xC0000005</a></p>
<p>Unfortunatly, there was also a movie called Aladdin in 1986, and there are IMDB listings for movies called Aladdin in 1923, 1936, and 1953 (although it classes all of these as shorts). While the last 3 have no claim to the namespace Aladdin (movie) being both very old with sketchy details available and shorts, the 1986 italian film does. i'm just noting this, and may come back and throw down a page for the italian release (imdb entry [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090601/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090601/" rel="nofollow">here</a>]), at which point i'll move thise page and disambiguate as needed. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrackshoe_b555.html" title="User:Crackshoe">Crackshoe</a> 23:14, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but the line: "It was released at the peak strech of the Disney renaissance era beginning with The Little Mermaid and ending with The Lion King," seems a bit opinionated to me, and anyway, this period certainly must stretch over a much longer period, through all of Disney/Alan Menkin collaborations, and perhaps even until Tarzan?

<p>Thank you very much for your reply. I think that I may have found some info on the subject. According to this link, though I don't know if it is a reliable source, the DCA Aladdin show will be closing, and they are now revamping the show and moving it to Broadway. Regardless of whether or not the source is reliable we'll find out eventually when the Aladdin Broadway musical will become a reality.

<p>I know that this is an animated cartoon for kids, and it should be forgiven for plotholes, but there was one that had me scratching my head even even when I first saw it when I was nine: Jasmine was clearly convinced that Aladdin was dead (she ran away crying when Jafar told her he had been beheaded for kidnapping her) but later, after "A whole new world" when she figures out that Prince Ali and "the boy from the market" are one and the same, she is unsuprised to see him alive and well.

<p>With a quick glance over the article, none of the images have fair use rationales. Look to other film GA/FAs for examples of what to include. If they are not added, someone may quick-fail the article. Also, inline citations go directly after punctuation, there should be no spaces in between or something like: .[1]. Make sure to fix these and I don't think there shouldn't be too many problems with getting the GA to pass. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 20:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
