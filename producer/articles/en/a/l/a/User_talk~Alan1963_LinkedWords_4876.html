<p>Hi Brenneman,</p>
<p>First of all thanks,</p>
<p>Could you please help and guide us in getting this (or modified versions of it) article getting approved and published on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>What we can guarantee is that we are really not seeking for “advertising”, the project itself is getting popular anyway, currently it is widely advertised on Google and around the internet on hundreds of small to mid level sites, the resources allocated for that purpose are far enough, what we only want to get done on Wikipedia is to give an alternative, different point of view to all already existing contextual and Web 2.0 related concepts and projects out there published on the Wikipedia, which claim much or less to have the standard established, which by itself is misleading the general and common user of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>We think giving publicity to alternative concepts, visions, and beliefs is an integrated part of the overall mission Wikipedia has. Wikipedia is not and should not be an official web site meant for already popular corporations, products and services.</p>
<p>What we want to publish here is to let the millions of Wikipedia’s users know that the few popular contextual based concepts and projects on the internet today are not the only alternative available on the web. There are many ways employed by us to show this to the general public, yet we believe Wikipedia is among the best and most suitable places to do so, since it is an independent and not commercially based source of information.</p>
<p>We claim for no authority nor we claim for being notable, neither product nor company.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that this information, if published in the right and proper format here could be beneficial to the Wikipedia, being an independent source of information, widely used by millions of people around the world and not a corporate brochure of proclaiming the services and products of the already popular companies anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention,</p>
<p>Best regards, Alan</p>

<dd>Och, I now see at <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan1963_50b8.html" title="User talk:Alan1963">User_talk:Alan1963</a> that there may be some copyright issues as well, and that you've gotten conflicting information, for which I do apologise.
<ul>
<li>The message from Netsnipe has precendent over the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag that I applied, as copyright trumps everything else.</li>
<li>I cannot help but notice that you're using "we" in referrring to this account. <a href="../../../r/o/l/Wikipedia%7ERole_account_6445.html" title="Wikipedia:Role account">Role accounts</a> are banned, it's a "one man one name" policy.</li>
<li>I'd suggest the best thing would be a move into your userspace for the short term. I won't be editing for a few days, but <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a> will probably help you out, I've left him a note.</li>

<p>Hi, I'm maybe busier than I'd like, so can you explain succinctly what help you need? Just a userification of the page? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:51, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi everyone, thanks to all willing to help and involved into this discussion...</p>
<p>Okay, i understand about "we", in fact it is single role account if I am using the proper terminology anyway... I am just used to say WE, since the project being subject to that discussion is a large-scale involving hundreds of employees on 3 continents; excuse me for using "we", did not know&#160;:- )</p>
<p>Well, I would like to ask about how and what should be changed in our proposed article so that it matches the guidelines of Wikipedia and goes through getting approved and published…</p>
<p>What exactly should be amended/changed/improved, the name, the place it has been published in, its style or its format? We have removed the public company name out of the article and it no longer appears in the content as well as the article has be rewritten totally so that it does not duplicate what the official web site says about, although I have the permissions to speak and write from the company, since I am part of it and the project as well.</p>
<p>I keep asking about it since we believe this article outlines an interesting trend in the form of a concept that much or less is starting to impact the web and has its own place on the Wikipedia regardless the format, who wrote or proposed it and what kind of names or companies are staying behind this large-scale contextual project.</p>
<p>Just like what I said above this project claims for no authority nor it claims for being notable, neither the product nor the company.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<dd>I'd like to suggest that you move the article to userspace, or ask that it be moved if you don't know how. then read up on norms here and look at other company articles to see how they are done. Also look into how people comment on things, we tend to do relatively short comments, and use indenting to show threading. Have you read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>&#160;??? Many of your questions are answered there if you do the reading. People are not going to have the time to explain everything to you, they are going to expect you do your homework... so do some reading and see whether you still have qs... ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 23:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Lar for your kind assistance, I appreciate… Yup, the proposed articles have already been read and I find answers to some of the questions and points I had … Aside this I’d like to apologize for occupying your time… Thank you again and Best regards, Alan--Alan1963 09:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(I refactored your comment to make it more like how people usually comment, a lot of line breaks usually aren't needed. I then indented it to make it clear its a response to me. hope that helps you see how to do it). It's no problem. I haven't actually done anything yet because I'm not sure what. This article has a prod tag on it, so when the timer expires, it will be deleted unless the tag is removed at which point it would be taken to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a>. Do you want it userified while you work to correct it? That would avoid the deletion. Let me know. Note: you can userify it yoursel, just click move and put in something like "User:Alan1963/LinkedWords" as your destination. The talk page gets moved automatically as well unless you detick that box. Finally no apology necessary for asking or taking up time, I'm here to try to help. Just be efficient! Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:23, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks again Lar, in fact i tried to move the article but it seems my account is too new to perform this action, therefore i was unable to do so, could you please do that for me to "userify" the article...still trying to figure out what does userification exactly mean but at least it will avoid deletion as you earlier recommended thanks in advance --Alan1963 14:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've moved it for you. you now can work on it at your own speed, free of teh time pressure that PROD imposes. When you've got the article so it will pass muster (verifiable, notable, and so forth) you can move it back, or seek assistance. Good luck and happy editing! ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
