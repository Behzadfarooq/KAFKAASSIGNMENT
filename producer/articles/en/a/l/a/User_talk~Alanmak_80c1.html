<p>Hey there Alanmak, I just wanted to let you know that your photograph of Isla Vista has been added to <a href="http://ucsbwiki.com" class="external text" title="http://ucsbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">UCSBWiki</a> under the terms of the GFDL! It is a great picture, especially for our new website, and I would like to thank you for releasing it under a copyleft license.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>is there any reason you changed class="toccolours" (copied from <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a>) to class="white"? Now the box does not have a border, and it looks really weird on my screen. (I don't know if it looks weird on your computer, though. Sometimes something looks weird here but looks ok on Windows.)—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 08:18, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My thoughts about jyutping and IPA is that we should always use jyutping and not IPA. If jyutping is too weird (which I agree) or not friendly for any other reason, then we should fix the jyutping article to make it immediately usable as a pronunciation key. But we must avoid IPA for Cantonese at all costs, because the combination of current Wikipedia IPA guidelines and Cantonese IPA conventions have together made IPA transcriptions for Cantonese close to completely meaningless in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>My reasoning is stated in my user page and in Instantnood's talk page. Obviously, by now you know my writings are very disorganized, so you'll have to have some patience reading my reasoning. I don't expect you to understand what I write, however; Instantnood obviously didn't.</p>
<p>When I have some time I might try to reorganize my reasoning and post it here, but I'm not doing this now; I'm hours past my sleep time and I am supposed to be looking for some (paper) document that I still haven't found.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 08:39, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Please don't remove pronunciation guides when there's only two, or when they've already been there before you started to complain.

<p>I'm that sure, but from the google test result has shown that <i>lo mai kai</i> has a greater popularity. I thought it's the common rountine to use the more common name in Wikipedia. On the other hand, there're some problems I'd like to ask you. You would find that the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_phoenix.html" title="Chinese phoenix">Chinese phoenix</a> is redirected to <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenghuang.html" title="Fenghuang">fenghuang</a>. Is that legitimate? In the Japanese cuisine, they use <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabu-shabu.html" title="Shabu-shabu">Shabu-shabu</a> instead of Japanese hotpot.

<dd>Because the English language has an inherent POV of favouring Japanese terms, <i>and</i> there is no concensus among Chinese people what romanization to use. When in doubt, the Westerners use Japanese romanizations even for Chinese concepts, such as “kishotenketsu".—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 18:15, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congratulations for the Portuguese version of the Macau map [Image:AdministrativeDivisionOfMacao-Portugese.png]. However, there are a few typos that it would be nice if you could correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tittle should be: "Divisão Administrativ<b>a</b> (not AdministrativO) da Região Administrativ<b>a</b> (again, not AdministrativO) Especial de Macau da República Popular da China".</li>
<li>Add an acute to "António" in "Freguesia de Santo <b>António</b>" and in the legend for nr. 7 put "<b>(Território ainda não atribuído a qualquer freguesia)</b>".</li>
<li>It should be "Ponte <b>da</b> (not "de") Amizade". The neighbouring bridge should be "Ponte <b>Governador Nobre de Carvalho</b>" and not "Ponte Nobre Governador Carvalho". "Nobre de Carvalho" was the name of the governor.</li>
<li>Finally there is also an acute missing in the word "Lótus" in "Ponte Flor de <b>Lótus</b>". Thanks and keep on the good work! --82.102.42.70 13:39, 23 December 2005 (UTC) <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:Manuel_de_Sousa" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:Manuel_de_Sousa" rel="nofollow">Manuel de Sousa</a></li>

<p>I do appreciate your effort of adding Pinyin around in Hong Kong-related articles. But I'm afraid what you've been doing is creating more confusions to less-well-informed readers that they may think Putonghua is common and popular in Hong Kong, and the names are of Putonghua or Mandarin origins. Please kindly consider adding Cantonese transliterations simultaneously, or refrain from adding Pinyin for the time being. Alternatively you may put up a list to request other editors, so that they know where they have to add the Cantonese counterparts. Thanks. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 20:24, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><cite id="Pinyin_reply_1"></cite> I'm afraid you've missed my point. I do not object adding Pinyin to these articles. It is, nevertheless, my concern that you're possibly confusing or misleading many readers. You may consider creating a list to inform other editors, e.g., I myself, so that they add the Cantonese romanisations for you.
<p>Meanwhile, the status of Shanghai dialect in Shanghai and Cantonese in Hong Kong is hardly comparable. The governor there doesn't speak in Wu or the Shanghai dialect publicly in official situation.</p>

<dd>Alan, what you've added to the Chinese entry is good information. However, we simply don't have room for that much detail in the language list. There are similar details for every language in every country. Sould we also describe the Mandarin/Taiwanese issue in Taiwan? The official switch to Mandarin in Singapore? The standardized spelling of Cantonese in Chinese communities in Canada and the US? Where's the limit? We would quadruple the size of the article if we followed this level of detail for every language in every country, and it isn't fair to do this only for Chinese in mainland China. For most languages, we haven't even distinguished between national and official languages. You've supplied good info, but it belongs in the articles on China and Chinese, just as the details of other countries and languages belong in their articles. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 19:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hello, Wgfinley. Thank you for your effort on solving the edit dispute. I was not intending to accuse you of making comments on whether that was the right version. The comment that I made about "some anti-China Wikipedians are pushing their POV" is not pointing to you. I pointed that out in the edit summary, just because some Wikipedians from Hong Kong have been demonstrating their high degree of anti-China sentiments in their edits, and have been trying their best to separate Hong Kong from all articles about China. In some situations, I agree that Hong Kong should have a separate article from the same topic for China. But this practice is not really necessary in ALL situation. Again, Thank you for your effort on solving the edit dispute. - <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">Alanmak</a> 20:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I'm reverting a series of edits about the capitol of the ROC. It's not exactly set in ROC law.

<p>After a quick glance at <a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikipedia%7ECountry_referencing_templates_e61b.html" title="Wikipedia:Country referencing templates">Wikipedia:country referencing templates</a> I'm having an impression that the first critera is the <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_3166_170f.html" title="ISO 3166">ISO 3166</a> standard. We may create {{HKG-IOC}} or {{Hong Kong, China}} (and {{Macao, China}} too) for designations by the IOC and for other situations (e.g. WTO), and in fact {{<a href="../../../h/k/g/Template%7EHKG-PRC_0637.html" title="Template:HKG-PRC">HKG-PRC</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/a/c/Template%7EMAC-PRC_21b0.html" title="Template:MAC-PRC">MAC-PRC</a>}}, which was actually the result of compromise, is already serving that purpose. Please kindly do not make changes to templates that affects lots of articles before discussions (and I'd recommend restoring them before discussion is fruitful).

<dd><cite id="Country_templates_reply_1"></cite>Bet you've forgotton the possibility that the same would be happening, that people will be using the template you've modified without being aware of "Hong Kong, China" or "Macao, China" would be displayed for situations that are not necessary. However your position is, you should have stopped, restored them, and sought opinion from the community. Personally I won't mind reserving {{HKG}} and {{MAC}} for IOC and/or international organisation designations, but only after seeking community consensus, notes are adequately provided (with the &lt;noinclude&gt; tag), and their applications are closely monitored. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 18:23, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This message is for both Alanmak and Instantnood.</p>
<p>Never user cut-and-paste to "rename" a page. Page moves should always be made by using "move", never by cut-and-paste, because cut-and-paste does not preserve the article's history.</p>
<p>Also, viewing "what links here" shows that most pages link to Template:HK, which was presumably the original name for the article. So I've moved it there. If you want to propose a change to Template:HONG KONG, try <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>. Please be sure that this name change would be consistent with other similar templates.</p>
<p>In summary, please don't edit war, please don't do cut-and-paste "moves", and especially don't edit war over templates, because this can leave articles that use the templates in a damaged condition (especially if you carelessly create double-redirects, which was the case here). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:30, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Because of all the templates that have been renamed and redirected to one another (<a href="../../../h/k/g/Template%7EHKG_de07.html" title="Template:HKG">Template:HKG</a>, etc), it's difficult to sort out what's used for what and who originated what and who reverted to what. Please contact <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Committee_9b92.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Committee">Wikipedia:Mediation Committee</a> if necessary, or other steps of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a>.

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 21% for major edits and 25% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 150 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite.

<p>I have blocked you for 48 hours because the majority of your edits in the last few days are reverts. Revert wars do not improve articles. If Instantnood is being mean and nasty to you, you <i>must</i> discuss it with him or ask for outside help before doing massive reverts; grudges are not allowed on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 01:01, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You recently reverted my substitution of <a href="../../../g/o/l/Image%7EGoldenBauhiniaSquare.png_2ac4.html" title="Image:GoldenBauhiniaSquare.png">GoldenBauhiniaSquare.png</a> with the <a href="../../../j/p/e/JPEG_907e.html" title="JPEG">JPEG</a> version <a href="../../../g/o/l/Image%7EGoldenBauhiniaSquare.jpg_b11a.html" title="Image:GoldenBauhiniaSquare.jpg">GoldenBauhiniaSquare.jpg</a>. I had made the substitution in accordance with <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html#Format" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy#Format</a>, which says that photographs should be in JPEG format. There are good technical reasons for this recommendation: for example, the thumbnail at <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Bauhinia_Square_9940.html" title="Golden Bauhinia Square">Golden Bauhinia Square</a> takes <b>seven</b> times more bandwidth to download in <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> format than in JPEG format.</p>
<p>I agree that the PNG version looks slightly better at small sizes — this is to some extent due to a recent change to the JPEG thumbnail generator which emphasized compression over quality, perhaps excessively so. Nonetheless, JPEG remains the approriate, and recommended, format for photographic images on Wikipedia. If you'd like to see the quality of JPEG thumbnails on Wikipedia increased, it would be more productive to propose doing so at <a href="../../../v/p/t/WP%7EVPT_113f.html" title="WP:VPT">WP:VPT</a> rather than replacing JPEG images with PNG versions. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 23:07, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Two journalists, one from the South China Morning Post and the other from <a href="http://www.umagazine.com.hk" class="external text" title="http://www.umagazine.com.hk" rel="nofollow">U Magazine</a>, want to interview some HK Wikipedians about our experience at wp. The SCMP interview would be held on this Saturday (29 April) and the location is up to us. While the time and place for the U Magazine interview are not yet confirmed (it would probably in this week also). So are you interested? What time and place would be convenient for you? Thanks a lot&#160;:) --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorenzarius_59a1.html" title="User:Lorenzarius">Lorenzarius</a> 15:23, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed that you seem to be having a bit of troubles with Instantnood. I suggest that you try some of the dispute resolution methods on WP before getting into an edit war with him. Repeated reversions won't achieve anything whilst discussion hopefully will be more fruitful. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">novacatz</a> 03:42, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Considering that Instantnood has already been to ArbCom <i>twice</i>, what method of dispute resolution do you suggest for Alanmak? What similar smart words of advice do you have for Instantnood? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 06:47, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suggest as a first step for Alan to knock off the revert wars. It isn't like coming off a 48 hr block and then immediately resuming reverting Instant's changes is going to fix anything. I would say exactly the same thing to Instant as well. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">novacatz</a> 07:00, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite your notice at the top that you don't particularly like administrators doing dispute resolving kind of stuff, I'm going to offer to (informally) mediate between you and Instantnood, as suggested by <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a>. There is no obligation on you to agree to this, but it would be best for everyone if some dialog were to be had between the affected parties. I'm going to offer to this as a normal user - I will not block you or Instantnood for the duration of any mediation, so there's nothing to be afraid of. Cheers. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 03:29, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alan, are you coming to the table or not? <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 06:45, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your reply. I can see that you are sincere about resolving the situation.</dd>
<dd>Firstly, let me explain why I am involved. I think Ashibaka called me in because I had previously offered, on Instantnood's talk page, to mediate any disputes involving him. As someone from (although not in&#160;:P) Hong Kong, and as someone who follows issues related to Hong Kong a little more closely than perhaps your average administrator, I think I might be able to provide some insight into any mediation. Furthermore, I had previously dealt with Instantnood, Huaiwei and ShmuckyTheCat, in often acrimonious arguments, so I have some idea as to where the issues lie.</dd>
<dd>I think that it's important to keep the dialog continuing, even if one party is uncooperative. Unless Instantnood leaves Wikipedia, he is someone that all of us will have to work with, and it is to everyone's best interest to come to some kind of resolution. What I propose we actually do is that all interested parties attempt to justify or explain their reasoning behind certain questionable edits over the past days/weeks - it's been happening in the edit summaries, which isn't ideal at all. From this, we should then seek, with input from other Hong Kong Wikipedians, to see if we can amend <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_8f6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)</a>, which currently has a big NPOV tag stuck onto the Political POV section, to finalise, for once and for all, what we should call these things. Although it may seem as if we're going to a lot of effort for something that appears unnecessary, if we can formalise things a little, it'll make it easier for everyone in the end as there is some policy we can point to and guide us along.</dd>
<dd>Edit warring by anyone is bad, either by Instantnood, yourself or anyone else. Unfortunately, there is no real way to stop someone from edit warring except by blocking them - unless we stop it at the source by having some coherent policy framework we can lean on.</dd>
<dd>Keep up the good work and the thing to keep in mind is just never to lose your cool. I lost my cool once with Huaiwei, and it wasn't nice. But at the end of the day, it's just Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 10:35, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your explanation. The reason why I reverted your edit was that, in the <tt>zh-Hans</tt> mode, some Chinese characters appeared to be smaller than the others. It just didn't look very nice. Is there any other way to deal with this problem? - <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">Alan</a> 22:25, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alanmak, I think it was you who added the box for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Dragon_dd46.html" title="Chinese Dragon">Chinese Dragon</a>. I suggested this change way back in April, then went to China where it was impossible to continue editing.

<p>Why are you removing the historical note about the capital city of Hong Kong territory? I have re-added it, with clarification that it is for the historical Hong Kong territory.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the language; I will leave that alone. What happened to de facto Cantonese?</p>
<p>You reverted my revision to the note in parentheses. Parentheses are informal and I will rewrite the note about the scrapped GST plan.</p>

You asked for someone to translate the Macou map that you have made. so, I'll try my best. but I have one problem, I realy don't know how yo traslate concelho (although I understand the meaning), can I just write municipality (עירייה)? if so, so I need to change it, so let me know. by the way, you realy did a good job, I think you have the credit for that.<br />
