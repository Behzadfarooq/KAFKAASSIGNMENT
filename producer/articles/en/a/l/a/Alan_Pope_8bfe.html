	    <p><b>Alan William Pope</b> (born <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> in <a href="../../../a/y/r/Ayr%2C_Scotland_c2f2.html" title="Ayr, Scotland">Ayr</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>) is a former <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politician</a> in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. He was a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario_4e61.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario">Progressive Conservative</a> member of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario_b4b4.html" title="Legislative Assembly of Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, and served as a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_minister.html" title="Cabinet minister">cabinet minister</a> in the governments of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Davis_7714.html" title="Bill Davis">Bill Davis</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Miller_%28politician%29_fc1e.html" title="Frank Miller (politician)">Frank Miller</a>.</p>
<p>Pope was raised in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ontario_222f.html" title="Northern Ontario">northern Ontario</a>, and was educated at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo%2C_Ontario_d76e.html" title="Waterloo, Ontario">Waterloo</a> Lutheran University and <a href="../../../o/s/g/Osgoode_Hall_Law_School_7899.html" title="Osgoode Hall Law School">Osgoode Hall Law School</a> in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. He worked as a barrister and solicitor before entering politics. Pope served as an alderman in the northern city of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timmins%2C_Ontario_e9fe.html" title="Timmins, Ontario">Timmins</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>He first ran for the Ontario legislature in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1975.html" title="Ontario general election, 1975">1975 provincial election</a>, but lost to Bill Ferrier of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party_0991.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Party">NDP</a> by 1,292 votes. He ran again in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1977.html" title="Ontario general election, 1977">1977 provincial election</a>, and defeated Ferrier by 2,276 votes. He was appointed as a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_assistant.html" title="Parliamentary assistant">parliamentary assistant</a> in Davis's government in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and was promoted to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_without_portfolio.html" title="Minister without portfolio">Minister without portfolio</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>.</p>
<p>Easily re-elected in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1981.html" title="Ontario general election, 1981">1981 provincial election</a>, Pope was promoted again to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Natural_Resources_%28Ontario%29_9c7f.html" title="Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario)">Minister of Natural Resources</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">April 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. He served in this position for the remainder of the Davis administration's time in office. Pope was known for hating departmental bureaucracy, and took the initiative in opening several new provincial parks. He also made the controversial decision that mining, hunting and motorboats would be allowed on park grounds. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, he decided that the MNR would not attempt to enforce jurisdiction over disputed rice cropland claimed by the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardoch.html" title="Ardoch">Ardoch</a> aboriginal group; to date, no subsequent Ontario government has attempted to claim the land.</p>
<p>Pope's position in the Progressive Conservative Party was unusual. He supported the interventionist policies of the Davis government, and was sometimes considered to be on the progressive wing of the party. Despite this, he was not a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Tory_e7a4.html" title="Red Tory">Red Tory</a>, and was not a supporter of the party's Toronto-based establishment (commonly known as the "Big Blue Machine"). Pope was rather a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populist.html" title="Populist">populist</a>, and sought greater power for the party's neglected local branches in northern, eastern, and southwestern Ontario. In this sense, his position in the provincial Progressive Conservatives was similar to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Diefenbaker_9dea.html" title="John Diefenbaker">John Diefenbaker</a>'s role in the federal party, a generation earlier.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Pope was a prominent figure behind Frank Miller's campaign to succeed Davis as party leader. Some regarded his presence in Miller's camp as unusual, given that Miller's supporters tended to be older figures from the party's right-wing. Pope nonetheless proved an effective campaigner for Miller, compiling much-needed polling data and devising strategies for Miller's supporters at the party convention. Miller narrowly defeated <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Grossman_6bda.html" title="Larry Grossman">Larry Grossman</a> to become party leader, and Pope was promoted to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Health_%28Ontario%29_7196.html" title="Minister of Health (Ontario)">Minister of Health</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<p>It was under Frank Miller's leadership, however, that the Progressive Conservative Party lost its 42-year grip on power. Miller was reduced to a fragile <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minority_government.html" title="Minority government">minority government</a> in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1985.html" title="Ontario general election, 1985">1985 provincial election</a>, and proved unable to sustain his party in power. Pope was named <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_%28Ontario%29_e4d0.html" title="Attorney General (Ontario)">Attorney General</a> of Ontario in a post-election shuffle on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, but did little of significance before Miller's government was defeated in the house by the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Liberal_Party_2013.html" title="Ontario Liberal Party">Liberals</a> and NDP. He resigned his portfolio on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, and moved into the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_opposition.html" title="Parliamentary opposition">opposition</a> benches.</p>
<p>Pope ran to succeed Miller as <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory.html" title="Tory">Tory</a> leader in the November <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_elections_6dc4.html" title="1985 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership elections">1985 Progressive Conservative leadership convention</a>. His campaign was weaker than expected, however, and he was forced on the defensive when one of his workers was caught polling party members at to whether religion would make a difference in the leadership race. This was seen by some as a reference to Larry Grossman's Jewish background, and Pope made a public apology. He also broke with John Thompson, his first campaign manager, fairly early in the race.</p>
<p>Pope's performance at the November leadership convention was nonetheless dramatic, and looked forward to future leadership speeches by figures such as <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Flaherty_177e.html" title="Jim Flaherty">Jim Flaherty</a>: he delivered a rousing speech surrounded by his "grass roots" delegates on the convention floor, rather from than the podium. Pope also tried to portray himself as a unifying figure in the party, noting that the animosity between frontrunners Grossman and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Timbrell_ee3d.html" title="Dennis Timbrell">Dennis Timbrell</a> was threatening to tear the party asunder (one of his campaign buttons read, "Don't take sides, take Pope".) In spite of such efforts, he finished a weak third on the first ballot and was dropped from the race. Many believe that Pope could have given Timbrell a second-ballot victory by endorsing him; he remained silent, however, and allowed Grossman to defeat Timbrell by a mere 19 votes.</p>
<p>Pope had a poor relationship with Grossman, and was not given a critic's portfolio after the convention. He resumed his law practice in Timmins while still an MPP, and spent two days a week away from the legislature. He nonetheless ran for re-election in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1987.html" title="Ontario general election, 1987">1987 provincial election</a>, and retained his seat. The Progressive Conservatives under Grossman were resoundingly defeated in this election, leaving Pope as one of only 16 Tory MPPs (out of 130 seats) in the parliament which followed.</p>
<p>Pope was not given a critic's portfolio in this parliament, and did not play a prominent role in the party's affairs. He decided not to run for the leadership again in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, and endorsed <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianne_Cunningham_1db7.html" title="Dianne Cunningham">Dianne Cunningham</a> for the position (<i>Toronto Star</i>, 3 May 1990). He did not campaign in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1990.html" title="Ontario general election, 1990">1990 provincial election</a>.</p>
<p>Although Pope's anti-establishment rhetoric and populism foreshadowed <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Harris_6536.html" title="Mike Harris">Mike Harris</a>'s tenure as party leader, the two men were frequent adversaries in the Progressive Conservative Party after <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Pope made headlines when he publicly criticized Premier Harris, accusing the government of demonizing teachers and supporting the teachers' strike against Harris's Bill 160 (the "Education Quality Improvement Act") which removed the ability of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_bargaining_agreement.html" title="Collective bargaining agreement">collective bargaining agreements</a> to regulate working conditions for teachers, introduced teacher testing and allowed the government to increase class sizes and reduce preparation time.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Pope was part of a commission examining land claims by the Caldwell First Nation in the Chatham—Kent region of southwestern Ontario. The commission reported serious concerns with the accord that was negotiated in secret between this group and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Pope chaired a committee looking into Timmins's involvement in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Olympic_Games_af17.html" title="2006 Olympic Games">2006 Olympic Games</a>. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, he was acted as counsel for the law firm of Racicot, Maisonneuve, Labelle, Gosselin. He wrote a series of articles on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2004">2004 federal election</a> for the <i>Sudbury Star</i> newspaper, arguing that no party was adequately focused on issues of concern to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ontario_222f.html" title="Northern Ontario">Northern Ontario</a> (<i>Sudbury Star</i>, 18 June 2004).</p>
<p>In 2006, Pope wrote a report on the <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashechewan_First_Nation_c72e.html" title="Kashechewan First Nation">Kashechewan Crisis</a>, recommending that residents of the community be relocated to a new <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_reserve.html" title="Indian reserve">reserve</a> site near Timmins.</p>
