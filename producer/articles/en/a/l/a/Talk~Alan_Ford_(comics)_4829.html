<p>Yes but those who separate them: they're not differentiated enough...if the'yre understandable in their semantics by their form, it's more like regionalism. there are only dia- or idiolects, even the "higher" languages are dialects. --134.2.213.43 21:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on translations should be changed. Even if you could call the language in the initial translations "Serbo-Croatian", you can't in todays. I don't know what the translation is like in SCG but in Croatia it's in Croatian, I can only assume that in SCG it's in Serbian. A rewording is in order.</p>

<dd>They're not the same language, and if you think so you obviously don't now Croatian well. There are other languages which are very similar and mutualy understandable (eg. Czech and Slovakian, Swedish and Norwegian) but they are considered seperate languages (even by Wikipedia). Just because politics tried to force these two languages together doesn't mean they realy are one language. The more time passes the differences become more obvious as new generations learn their own language rather than some hibrid.</dd>
<dd>I'm not trying to start a lingustic debate. I'm just saying that the original translations were in "Serbo-Croatian" because that was the inforced standard then, but now Croatian follows it's own standard (a work perpetualy in progress, as all languages are) and the current translations in Croatia are in Croatian not "Serbo-Croatian". Believe me, there is a significant difference, you may not notice it and I'll admit most Croats won't notice it, but some of us do! For instance, the scene in the article has Bob Rock saying: "...Ne naliči li ovo pomalo na pračku?". In Croatian that should be "...Ne izgleda li ovo pomalo kao pračka?". You may think that's splitting hairs, but I assure you it's not, "naličiti" is not a verb in the Croatian language.</dd>
<dd>My point is that the article should point out that it was originaly translated into "Serbo-Croatian" but with the break up of Yugoslavia new translations are in Croatian and Serbian.

<dd><i>I'm just saying that the original translations were in "Serbo-Croatian" because that was the inforced standard then, but now Croatian follows it's own standard (a work perpetualy in progress, as all languages are) and the current translations in Croatia are in Croatian not "Serbo-Croatian".</i></dd>
<dd>There ya go&#160;:) The article talks about the initial translation by Brixy. Also, you might want to consult some linguistic resources. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Čabrilo</a> 09:16, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, whatever. I didn't come here to debate language. I do propose changing the sentence</dd>
<dd><i>Alan Ford was only translated into French and Serbo-Croatian.</i></dd>
<dd>to</dd>
<dd><i>Outside Italy Alan Ford was only published in France and the former Yugoslavia.</i></dd>
<dd>This would avoid any linguistic issues. Even if it was available in other countries it is still acurate as long as the edition wasn't published there.</dd>
<dd>Now to what I came here for. Serious Sam 2 (a FPS computer game comming out this fall) will have a weapon called the Klodovik bird which is a parrot with a bomb strapped to it's leg. This is obviously an Alan Ford reference (<a href="../../../c/r/o/Croteam.html" title="Croteam">Croteam</a>, the creators of SS2 are from Zagreb). If the game is as successfull as the original <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Sam_aade.html" title="Serious Sam">Serious Sam</a>, it will make Alan Ford a (small) part of a wider pop culture. To most people this reference will be very obscure but I think it's worth mentioning it in this article, perhaps in a section called <i>Alan Ford in pop culture</i>. I'm not all that familiar with Alan Ford so I'm not going to mess with your work unless asked to.</dd>
<dd>Let's wait for the game to come out before we include that reference. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Čabrilo</a> 20:49, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I changed that one sentence. If you don't like it, change it back, but I think it's much better now.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I don't like it. But I didn't change it back. My question is: why the hell does it matter??? Serbocroatian was one of three official language of Yugoslavia for years, and Alan Ford was translated as such. The article doesn't talk about either Macedonian or Slovenian translation. So help me out here... --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Čabrilo</a> 08:45, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, you didn't change it but <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> has (I have no idea why).</dd>
<dd>The reason it matters is because that sentence says it was translated ONLY in French and "Serbo-Croatian" which isn't true. It would be acurate to say it was translated in French, "Serbo-Croatian", Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian and Slovenian. Now do you understand my objection?
<dl>
<dd>I'm not aware of any translations into Macedonian or Slovenian. I'll try to address your concerns. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Čabrilo</a> 20:11, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You mentioned Macedonian and Slovenian translations so I assumed they existed, but even if they don't my point still stands. The rewrite is OK but perhaps a little confusing, maybe you should add wiki links to Serbian and Croatian.</dd>

<p>Alan Ford was published in Croatia (Vjesnik, Zagreb) where the term "Serbo-Croatian" or "Croato-Serbian" went out of official use in 1972 (coincidentally, the year the first translation was published). So Croatian, not Serbo-Croatian. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElephantus_ade7.html" title="User:Elephantus">Elephantus</a> 12:31, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The language was refered to as srpskohrvatski or hrvatskosrpski until 1990s. If you went to school in late 1980s, you would still learn Serbo-Croatian. As you perhaps know, aside from ultranationalists, Serbo-Croatian was still the language in 1970s. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Čabrilo</a> 13:34, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't know about the rest of Yugoslavia, but in Croatian schools the name "Croato-Serbian" or "Serbo-Croatian" wasn't in use after 1972. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElephantus_ade7.html" title="User:Elephantus">Elephantus</a> 14:39, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The fifth amendment to the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia changed the definition of official language. Additionally, here is a quote I dug up, it's from a men's magazine named CKM (from Serbia, I believe): Što se tiče "Alana Forda" u Srbiji, publici je pored sjajnog teksta, neverovatno smešan bio i <i>hrvatski jezik</i> (emphasis mine) koji je koristio prevodilac, kao i pisanje imena u originalu (Bob Rock npr.). To je išlo toliko daleko da su čitaoci bili besni što su izdanja štampana kod nas (nakon rata) prevedena na srpski. Jednostavno, duh "Alana Forda" je bio povezan sa Brixyjevim prevodima. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElephantus_ade7.html" title="User:Elephantus">Elephantus</a> 16:27, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Right, the language spoken in Zagreb, Zagorje, Belgrade, Nis or Pirot is different, and Brixy's translation was interesting to people outside of Serbia. However, do you mind providing us with exact text of the amandment? To the best of my knoweldge, the 1974 Constitution did not institute Croatian as a language, and I it's rather silly to say that the language was not called Serbo-Croatian in 1970s. You may think whatever you want about Serbo-Croatian, but that was the name of the language. Anyway, do provide us with the full text of that amandment. Also, give us reference to Croatian being the official language in Croatia at that time. Do also compare it to the 1974 Constitution, and prove that "Croatian" was in common usage. Until you do that, it's Serbo-Croatian. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Čabrilo</a> 17:55, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Among Croats, in everyday life, the language has always been called Croatian (not Croato-Serbian, Serbo-Croatian or anything like that). --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElephantus_ade7.html" title="User:Elephantus">Elephantus</a> 22:40, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find this funny, becuase me and my brother started our education in Croatia (80s).

<p>The guy acused you of not knowing Croatian and compared it with Check-Slovak (completly different) and Norwegian-Swedish (similiar, although not that much)&#160;:OOOO The Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian languages have a similarity that is present in <b>no case whatsoever</b> elsewhere. Why? Because they are merely dialects of one language.
