<p>I was actually wondering about Crz myself. He asked about nominating me, then I saw his RFB, then I hadn't heard anything back from him. I didn't want to bug him about it, so I figured I'd just wait it out. I appreciate your offer to nominate me in his stead, and I'll forward you the answers to some questions that Crz asked via email. As you saw on <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_Archive_30_d10a.html#Adminship" title="User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 30">his talk page</a>, even if I don't make it, it'll be a great learning experience.

<li>After re-reading what I wrote (and then panicking), I realized that I may not have been clear as to my intentions. I would like it very much if you nominated me for adminship. Feel free to ignore this panicking if I was clear enough in the first place. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmalas_f8d6.html" title="User:Amalas"><font color="maroon"><b>~ Amalas</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmalas_8c3c.html" title="User talk:Amalas"><font color="navy">rawr</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amalas_7b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amalas"><sup>=^_^=</sup></a> 23:22, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've accepted, answered all the comments, and adding the page 'live' to the RFA page. The only question I have is: What does "enmopment" mean in your nomination: "this user's enmopment ought to be a sure thing"? You might want to fix that typo. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmalas_f8d6.html" title="User:Amalas"><font color="maroon"><b>~ Amalas</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmalas_8c3c.html" title="User talk:Amalas"><font color="navy">rawr</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amalas_7b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amalas"><sup>=^_^=</sup></a> 02:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>My apologies for my ill-chosen language earlier used by me regarding the work of your project, and of you in particular. At this point it's hard to tell, but I think that I was primarily trying to establish a rapport with the person I was speaking to, and may have crossed the line in terms of what I now realize probably could be seen as at least implied criticism. Such criticism was never actively willful on my part however. I can and do think that in general your project probably has more power in this field than may be ideally wanted; however, that could easily be changed by having more people join the project, and it is ultimatly pretty much as viable a criticism as saying politicians have too much power in politics would be. I was at one time myself briefly, if only minimally, trying to get in the flow of your project, and unfortunately found the complexities a bit over my head and withdrew. The fact that the members of your project are willing to devote as much time and effort to the complexities of this rather staggering task is something I am seriously and repeatedly grateful for. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:55, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw your note that it wasn't completely orphaned yet. All I saw that was left was some WP and User namespace stuff and I usually leave those things alone. As far as I saw, there were no articles that used it, so it should be safe to delete.

<p>Sorry about that. I've just done something similar for "unreferenced", although more rough and ready (I missed the nuance of cl_timestamp).

<p>I don't know why you insist on me having hard and fast numerical standards for RfA's. I have a few minimal standards but looking to put numbers to them is a mistake. Between different styles of editors some will have more inflated edit counts then others, and as such looking at numbers like that shows very little about the actuall editors skill or experience. As such I have decided decively against keeping any minimal edit counts for RfA's --<a href="../../../t/-/r/User%7ET-rex_9e1e.html" title="User:T-rex">T</a>-<a href="../../../t/-/r/User_talk%7ET-rex_4226.html" title="User talk:T-rex">rex</a> 02:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, that is an AWB default thing. There is an option on the "Set options" tab that says "auto tag". It defaults to checked and it does things like "Auto tag Appends {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">Wikify</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncategorised_956c.html" title="Template:Uncategorised">Uncategorised</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} tags when appropriate. Removes stub tags from long articles. Adds the date parameter to the by-date sorted templates." (quote from AWB's page) I usually leave the option checked because it will auto-remove stub tags if the article is too long. I hadn't notice the uncat pileup, but I will definitely keep my eye on that and make sure to remove any redundancies. Also, we might want to bring this up at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAutoWikiBrowser_b4e7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:AutoWikiBrowser">Wikipedia talk:AutoWikiBrowser</a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmalas_f8d6.html" title="User:Amalas"><font color="maroon"><b>~ Amalas</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmalas_8c3c.html" title="User talk:Amalas"><font color="navy">rawr</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amalas_7b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amalas"><sup>=^_^=</sup></a> 03:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm looking forward to seeing the next cache refresh. About twice a week, the list at <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedpages_5680.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedpages">Special:Uncategorizedpages</a> refreshes, but unfortunately it only takes the first 1,000 articles in the alphabet. Because of how rapidly that new pages are being added to Wikipedia (thousands per week), it's been difficult to get any traction in the list. Over the few months, we've been making a concerted effort, so each time the list refreshes we ensure that every single article in the list gets <i>some</i> kind of tag to keep it off the next refresh, even if it's nothing more than {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncat_fb5e.html" title="Template:Uncat">uncat</a>}}. As a result, each time it refreshed, we've been able to advance a bit further into the alphabet. &#160;:) Unfortunately though, because of the limited number of pages in the list, and the infrequency of the update, these advances are small, and at a certain point we seem to hit just sort of break-even, which at the moment seems to be around the letter "F". See <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpecial%7EUncategorizedpages_faee.html#Stats.2Fprogress" title="Wikipedia talk:Special:Uncategorizedpages">Wikipedia talk:Special:Uncategorizedpages#Stats/progress</a> for a visual indicator of how we've been doing.</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have gone through about 20 of the articles that your bot automatically tagged with {{previouslycategorised}}, and my conclusion is that this feature should be turned off until you can address the problems I have raised on <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlaibot_eca8.html" title="User talk:Alaibot">User talk:Alaibot</a>. Specifically the bot should:</p>
<ol>
<li>not tag articles that have only previously been categorised due to maintenance tags</li>
<li>understand articles that have been tagged when they were a redirect</li>
</ol>
<p>...and ideally:</p>
<ol>
<li>where the last change has caused the categories to be removed, and only contains deletions, an alternate tag should be applied in such a way that does not cause the wikipedia undo capability to fail</li>
<li>handle stub removals differently.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry to put a damper on an otherwise good feature. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:13, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't regard these as "false positives", just as "behaving as advertised"; the basis for tagging these, as having had any-category-at-all is pretty explicit on the cleanup category. This is just a different tagging of "uncategorised" articles, per <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category_talk%7ECategory_needed_d0cf.html#List_of_articles_with_.22lost.22_categories" title="Category talk:Category needed">this discussion</a>, that used to have a category (of any kind). Said discussion is also why I'm not just tagging them all with "uncat", which is certainly the simplest from by perspective. If you disagree with the balance of benefit in said separate tagging, that might be the best place to comment. It's not by any means a guarantee there's a "good" version to revert too (which seems unlikely to be automatable). I've certainly no objections to tweaks to the wording on the template; or perhaps better if a lengthy explanation is required, to the category page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I see nothing inappropriate in applying this to previously-stub-categorised articles; in that case, it encodes genuine per-topic information, which is the whole point. I could further split this up by previously-categorised-with-only-stub-cats and otherwise, but that might be a little over-engineered. Some of these tag removals may be revertible, some perfectly OK (aside from the loss of categorisation); I don't see any reliable way to automate that, either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Category redlinks may be completely spurious, it's true, or as in the case you cite, the results of category deletion. In that case, the deleted category is again a plausible by-topic starting point for recategorisation. (Ideally, people or bots depopulating such categories wouldn't leave articles without categories in the first place...)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Old applications of "maintenance" categories may not be especially helpful, I'll grant you (unless their removal was inappropriate), but it's not straightforward to automatedly determine what's a "real" category, and what's not. (Almost every category seems to be a descendent of both "trees", by some route or other.) If I come up with a fairly reasonable way of doing this, I can try to exclude these from future runs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrong_Number_1596.html" title="Wrong Number">Wrong Number</a> it was moved to <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrong_Number_%28movie%29_55fb.html" title="Wrong Number (movie)">Wrong Number (movie)</a> <i>after</i> any of the database dumps I was working from; the categorisation, and loss of categorisation occurred to the latter, and it just so happened that the former was <i>also</i> uncategorised. As it's not possible (as far as I know) to query the live database by page_id, as distinct from title, there's not much that can be done about such cases. But it should be pretty clear from any manual examination of the history that that's what's happened, they're likely to be extremely rare, and the overall "harm" seems pretty small.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I follow your comment that the bot should "understand articles that have been tagged when they were a redirect". I'm not tagging redirects, and redirects shouldn't in general be categorised. If you mean articles that have at some earlier point categories like "unprintworthy redirects", see my comments about maintenance cats in general. On the comment that "where the last change has caused the categories to be removed, and only contains deletions, an alternate tag should be applied in such a way that does not cause the wikipedia undo capability to fail". That seems to be a) impossible in general, because <i>any</i> change will have that effect, and b) is especially not possible for pywikipedia bots, as they don't deal with article histories in any way. The only way to deal with the former would be for people to work from a cleanup <i>list</i> rather than a cleanup category, which tend to be less popular overall. Those are easy for me, though, so again if you want to argue for that rather than the other at <a href="../../../n/o/c/CAT%7ENOCAT_8fd0.html" title="CAT:NOCAT">CAT:NOCAT</a>, I'm happy either way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But you may be glad to hear that I'm not currently tagging any more of these, and won't be (at least) until either I work out how best to handle templatised articles (so as to avoid "real" false positives, i.e. tagging an article that transcludes a category from a template), or else there's a more recent database dump with some "fresh meat". When I do, I may try to look into adding the older categories, and/or the "timestamp" of said categorisation into the template. (The latter would be easier, as it'll be consistent for a particular run.) Would you find that useful? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:50, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, thanks for the detailed response.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I dont buy the "behaving as advertised" argument, because if your bot didnt tag these articles, another bot would have added {{uncategorised}}. Your bot performs a better analysis of the article, but due to the problems I pointed out, it is causing as much work as it is solving. In the above analysis, I defined "False positive" as any case where the <i>previouslycatagorised</i> tag was applied to an article where there was no benefit in looking into the history of the article. For each of these false positives, I wasted maybe 5-10 minutes trying to find a useful previous categorisation in the history, to no avail. For each of these, it would have been better that your bot tagged the article with <i>uncategorised</i>, or left that for another bot to do so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "maintenance" categories, it should be possible to programatically build a list of all such categories under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_cleanup_9d23.html" title="Category:Wikipedia cleanup">Category:Wikipedia cleanup</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_maintenance_1745.html" title="Category:Wikipedia maintenance">Category:Wikipedia maintenance</a>, or maybe <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_administration_d8a9.html" title="Category:Wikipedia administration">Category:Wikipedia administration</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "previously-stub-categorised articles", I agree that the bot is doing a great job. If it could also distinguish these from the other types of {{previouslycategorised}}, that would be even better.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "understand articles that have been tagged when they were a redirect", that was due to the <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrong_Number_1596.html" title="Wrong Number">Wrong Number</a> vs <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrong_Number_%28movie%29_55fb.html" title="Wrong Number (movie)">Wrong Number (movie)</a> mixup, which I can now see is a very tough bug and as you say, probably isnt worth caring about as there is no harm.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In regards to the case where 'previous edit only deleted text, including categorisations', instead of tagging the article the bot could do either:
<ol>
<li>automatically restore the deleted text (I think it is fair to assume that if a "deletion" removed categories it was probably either vandalism or accidental damage),</li>
<li>add the article to a User:Alaibot/Deleted text list, and people to watch the list and manually fix the problem, or</li>
<li>do nothing, as there are other bots that automatically restore deleted text</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a result of such a high rate of false positives, all of the recent contributions of Alaibot will need to be combed through carefully in order to fix the _real_ previous categorisations. It would be really cool if you could extend your bot revise the articles that it tagged with <i>previouslycatagorised</i>, and automatically find those that should be instead tagged with something like {{previouslycatagorised|stub=...|date=...}} or {{previouslycatagorised|tag=...|date=...}}. As we manually work through the remainder of the articles in the category, we may find other parts of this task that can be automated.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am happy that this feature has been put on hold, but I will be even more happy when this feature is back in action with these improvements in place. It has a lot of promise. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 02:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been creating a lot of country specific stubs for record labels. Currently there are hundreds of record label stubs under this main heading, where previously there were only country specific stub categories for UK, US and Canada. I realise that there might not be many record labels for Iceland, Austria, etc, but I think it's better than lumping them under the general record-label-stub for non UK/US labels.

<p>Huh.... That's odd... I really have no idea why I did that. I looked back through my contributions around that time, and this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Stub_types&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73039668" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Stub_types&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73039668" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is about the only guess I have. It looks like I was organizing the alt/indie rock into by-era splits (as opposed to organizing the by-era stuff into by-genre splits). So I guess my thinking was that the appropriate parent would be the genre one, not the time one. That may have been back when I didn't quite grasp the idea that things can have 2 parents. Now, looking at that edit, it doesn't make any sense. Sorry to have caused any trouble with that. Feel free to restore those parent cats.

<li>I don't think it would have caused an edit war, as I don't think I have those pages on my watchlist. If I was watching every category or template (or article!)

Someone responded on the Mainland China one, and you were the one who put it up there, so you know more about it than me. Also, I'm not sure what to do with the Chicano one.

<p>You've been kind to help me with previous concerns. After repairing significant vandalism to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Latin_School_e956.html" title="Charlotte Latin School">Charlotte Latin School</a> entry, my <a href="../../../e/z/r/User%7EEzratrumpet_88de.html" title="User:Ezratrumpet">user page</a> was vandalized with phrases referring to improper behavior towards students.</p>
<p>The vandal was Tarheelblue32242, who was also responsible for vandalizing the Charlotte Latin School entry.</p>
<p>I'm happy to post the vandalism warnings, but since it's a personal attack, I thought it best to check with an administrator before acting.</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I have, for some time, been trying to wittle down the Military personnel stubs. I created a Oceania-mil-bio- template that has Oceania-bio and Mil-bio as subcats. However, after doing this, I realized that Australia, New Zealand and Fiji already have bio-stubs. Could you take a look and fix this problem? Thanks--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 22:59, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It is supposed to be an upmerged template. The problem, as I see it, is that it would be applied to an article that would include Australians etc so they would be sorted into the Australia bio's as well as the Oceania-bio, making it redundant. However, if we delete the Oceania-bio, a military person from the Solomons would not be sorted in Oceania-bio. Sorry if I was unclear with the problem--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 01:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I take it, you're talking about {{<a href="../../../s/l/o/Template%7ESlovakia-footy-bio-stub_3514.html" title="Template:Slovakia-footy-bio-stub">Slovakia-footy-bio-stub</a>}} and it's category. The proposals page already had this proposed, with two supports and no negative votes. It sat in proposals untouched for ten days, so why not go ahead and make it, it isn't a surprise that this was gonna be made. The only reason I see these proposed stubs hadn't been made yet, was because of the Scandinavia/Nordic countries debate, which has little to do with Slovakia. I notified the proposals page that I was going to make/in progress of making the stub and its cat, and followed through with systematically going through every article in the Slovak footballers cat. I see no wrong in making a proposed stub that had support for ten days, and was done according to the guidelines. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 09:54, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That sounds fair, and I did try to be more informational about it with the recent Slovakia stub, so I have moved just an inch, but not following Grutness' arguments. I just get defensive when I get told what to do, when the criticism appearently isn't about the actual work done, but the level of control and bureaucracy that Grutness wants, to cause him less annoyance.. But I did communicate the stub making to proposals this time (and will in the future), I just didn't know I should list it afterwards, which I think is the only reason it subsequently popped up in discoveries and gave Grutness the excuse to fling insults. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 10:23, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I wonder if you know of a way to quickly remove the "Moon-stubs" from those articles that also have "crater stubs". As it is now, when you look at the category of moon stubs, there are so many crater articles that it is almost impossible to find those articles that really need attention. I assume that there is some kind of bot that can do this, but I'm not that advanced.

<dd>I'll look to see what I can do, but I suspect that I'll have to wait until the next database dump, to be able to get meaningful input for the 'bot. And it's been a month and a half since the last one, with no indication of when the next one is due (mutter, mutter). Alternatively, I might be able to get something from the toolserver people -- I must get 'round to putting a request in.

<dd>I've belatedly followed your talk page instructions and moved this to my talk page, since the "watch the other person's page" is disasterously useless as far as I'm concerned: I'm firmly in the "split it up and be darned" camp, I'm afraid.

<dd>I've had a trawl through the most likely-looking stub categories, and not really found much. As there's on the order of 50,000 album infobox usages I'm not sure I want to trawl all of those on the live database: I'll tackle those when I have a "fresh" db dump. Likewise then I'll be able to tag the albums in categories with no infobox. There's probably also many of the stubs that specifically lack a by-artist/genre category, or a a release-date category, I can have a look for those. If I don't get back to this in a week or two, drop me a reminder. (If there's no db dump by then, I'll re-moan on the wikitech list.) If you're at a loose end, there's lots of <a href="../../../n/o/c/CAT%7ENOCAT_8fd0.html" title="CAT:NOCAT">other articles to categorise</a>, of course... <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
