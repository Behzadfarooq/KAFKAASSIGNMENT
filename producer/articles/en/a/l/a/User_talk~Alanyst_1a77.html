<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlanyst_1a77.html" title="Edit section: BC/AD">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BC/AD</span></h2>
<p>Actually I've talked out of both sides of my mouth on Thursday, and my position has evolved on the whole issue. Most simply, I'm not sure that Thursday is anything more than a day dedicated to Thor. The "existence" of Thor is not disputed (although whether he was/is real is another matter altogether). So on one level, a day or a month could be seen as "named after" someone or something. There is also, of course, the argument that Thor is no longer a major deity, but that argument is rather weak. There is also the little matter of lacking a viable alternative.</p>
<p>On the whole BC/AD issue it seems to me that the argument that makes most sense in terms of <i>keeping</i> BC/AD is one of dilution. The idea that BC and AD have been used so widely that the meaning of the word is lost. I don't agree with it, but i see it as a viable argument. I remember when I first discovered what AD meant. I was about 10 years old. My first thought, my first words were "so non-Christians can't use that term?" I'd think that on a matter like this, a child's thinking, the simple uncluttered analysis of the words, is the ideal starting point. If you take the words at face value, then BC and AD are POV. To move beyond that, I would need evidence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to discuss the meanings of the NPOV policy, I wouild love that. Since few people have challenged me on that I have not had to take it apart the same way as I have the BC/AD issue. It would be equally interesting to see where that would go. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:47, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You said: "<i>Since many non-Christians comfortably use the term in an identical manner to how Christians use the term, one cannot tell whether a particular usage of BC/AD is, by itself, expressing a Christian POV or not</i>"</dd>
<dd>As I see it, POV or NPOV is not a function of the <i>intention</i> of the writer, but in the possible interpretations of the readers. As with any written communication, nuance and expression are absent. Written communication (in an encyclopaedia!) only means what is written. What the writer <i>meant to say</i> is irrelevant. What the writer <i>said</i> is all that matters. That is why my starting point is that of a naive child. We need to write literally. Metaphors aren't terribly useful - metaphors depend to much on cultural context. Majoritarian POV (like BC/AD) would only work if we circumscribe our audience. That is decidedly <i>not</i> the purpose of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is there for the impoverished school in Africa, in Jimbo's vision. For that reason, couples with the centrality of NPOV, I don't think see BC/AD as a dating system that meets the needs of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:19, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, can you help fix some of the issues that are brought up there. I'd much rather see this kept that removed from featured status. The biggest issue I have is the lack of references.

<p>Hi Alanyst, thanks for the heads up.

<p>The very Name Jesus is to a degree POV, as it means "Saviour." While the title Christ is arguably more biased in Our Lord's favour, I believe that it may be used neutrally and interchangeably with the Holy Name; consider if a Buddhist were to refer to Siddhartha Guatama as the Buddha. Now, neither of us would agree that this man was truly the enlightened one, but the title can be used; it indeed is on this website. Mohammed has occasionally been referred to as a prophet. And with respect to the question of capatilising pronouns, etc., I must mention that this is ordanarily permitted when referring to God the Father; examples of this phenomenon abundantly exist.

<p>I don't have any objection to you removing it but I do see it as somewhat useful. I've always looked at Wikipedia as an all knowing source and so thought i should have all information on everyone. At the time that the article was nominated for deletion, it did not have any album information and it was a personal biography. I added the album information after the deletion nomination and that prompted many people to change there votes. When it was restored it had a lot of notable information and I thought that the other information just added to it. --Jasonlesliewright 05:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I admittedly have a difficult time with comments that are without logic, backwards, and just plain false. It is impossible for something to be the opposite of itself. I am not sure how best to handle these type of edits. I suspect the best way is just quit feeding the trolls. There is much wisdom in such a statement, but lately I have noticed a surprising coincidence where no comment becomes interpreted as acceptance of the statement as fact. Of course this mindset can easily turn into a need to respond to everything perceived as negative, which I don't think is necessary. My objective is to determine the stage most important in which to take a stand; Village pump seems like a stage that would have the most impact on the community at large. Do you think it would be better to just ignore those types of comments, those that are obviously lacking in thought, and move on? Your comments are appreciated and I can use some direction in this regard. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:07, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

It seems that if it was the correct place for <i>you</i> to question <i>me</i> that it is also the fitting place for you to answer my questions. This appears to be another case of one editor dictating the circumstances of where, when and how a problem will be addressed; I consider this a case of you <i>editing</i> my comments on a talk page, which is, at best, poor form. It isn't your job to determine what is appropriate for that page (<i>at least not after I answered your questions there</i>). <font face="raphael" color="green"><a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuke53_0b5c.html" title="User:Duke53">Duke53</a> | <sup><a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuke53_0ad9.html" title="User talk:Duke53">Talk</a></sup></font> 14:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I moved it because, after seeing Visorstuff's comments on the original page, I decided he was right and it <i>wasn't</i> the correct place for me to question you. I should have started the whole tangent on your own talk page, but as I didn't realize that until I saw what Visorstuff wrote, I did what I thought was the next best thing and corrected the problem as soon as I became aware of it. I have not changed any of your comments, and I have endeavored to leave a trail behind so it's clear where the discussion originated and where it went to, so that if anyone besides you and I are following this discussion they can stay with it without too much effort. Cleaning up talk pages by moving discussions to a better venue is perfectly acceptable on Wikipedia and in no way is it poor form. I mean to be dictating nothing; if you think the discussion belongs back on the Village Pump or somewhere else, by all means move it yourself. I decline to do so since I am now of the opinion that it is where it belongs, but if you feel strongly enough to move it back then I will not obstruct your efforts to do so. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanyst_efdd.html" title="User:Alanyst">alanyst</a> <sup>/<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>/</sup> 16:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I went to that page, <b>it was blank</b>; I do not lie, unlike some other editors here at Wikipedia. If there is / was a software glitch, okay; but the page was completely blank when I posted the warning. You can have anybody you choose 'investigate' but I know how the page was when I visited it. <font face="raphael" color="green"><a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuke53_0b5c.html" title="User:Duke53">Duke53</a> | <sup><a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuke53_0ad9.html" title="User talk:Duke53">Talk</a></sup></font> 23:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not asking anyone to "investigate," Duke53, merely keeping for historical purposes - a common practice at wikipedia - by simply pointing out the facts for those who want to see what happened to warrant your particularly over-dramatic and harsh response.</p>
<p>Software glitch or not, you <i>could</i> have double checked why Alanyst was complaining about the blanking and offered the software glitch explanation as an alternative. This is much more productive than using phrases such as <i>"I am awfully sick of your crap. You edit as you see fit and I will edit as I see fit; I need no advice from you,"</i> which is similar to many other statements you've made to others in your editing history.</p>
<p>Check when someone complains to you personally why they are complaining instead of over-reacting (I do). Most of the time they see edits like this and really can't assume anything else - which is why he contacted you directly. This is what it means to assume good faith. With Wiki software it is easy to check yourself and why people assume things about your edits.</p>
<p>Putting aside our editing philosophies and religious differences, I'd be happy to help you learn wikipedia culture, how to use the software, build consensus, and make the most of your wikipedia experience. We could work together on non-LDS-related pages if you are interested in taking me up on my offer. I am pretty easy to work with, and have a good reputation for working with others. Let me know. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 23:25, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS: Incidentally, we should report the software glitch so this unfortunate exchange doesn't happen to other editors. Duke53, would you like to post the problem to the Village Pump? -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 23:25, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're right; I wanted this here.</p>
<p>I am <i>so</i> very happy that you're keeping such good track of me. When editors are joining Wikipedia to edit one (<i>and only one</i>) article and aren't seen again anywhere else it gives me a pretty good indication that their edits are simply <i>vandalism</i> or <i>censorship</i>. You worry about your style of editing and I will worry about mine, okay? <i>Some of the things you do here don't exactly thrill me either</i>. <font face="raphael" color="green"><a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuke53_0b5c.html" title="User:Duke53">Duke53</a> | <sup><a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuke53_0ad9.html" title="User talk:Duke53">Talk</a></sup></font> 19:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Heya, I agree SR was a bit over the top but ever less than Duke IMHO. If you're gonna delete SR's comments I think you should delete Duke's because the latter's comments implicitly hint that editors who don't tag along with his references to "evil" are "evil" themselves, <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_personal_attacks_8865.html" title="WP:No personal attacks">WP:No personal attacks</a> and so on.
