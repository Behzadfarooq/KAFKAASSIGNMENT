<p>While Alan Freed called himself the "<i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_known_as_the_father_or_mother_of_something.html" title="List of people known as the father or mother of something">father of</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a></i>", he was not the first to play it on the airwaves, but is credited for coining and popularizing the term "Rock and Roll" to describe a style of music. He was a promoter and he was very successful at what he did, until his own personal failings became exploited by others. They built their own careers upon the legacy created by Freed, while Freed's personal career was obliterated.</p>

<p>Many of the top African American performers of the 1950s have given public credit to Alan Freed for pioneering <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_integration.html" title="Racial integration">racial integration</a> among the youth of America at a time when the adults were still promoting racial strife. Little Richard has appeared in several programs about that era, to give the credit to Alan Freed that others have denied him. An example of Freed's non-racist attitude is preserved in motion pictures in which he personally played a part as himself with many of the leading African-American acts of that day. His influence and the music that he promoted crossed artificial racial barriers that were in place during the 1950s.</p>
<p>In the 1956 film "Rock Rock Rock" Freed, as himself, tells the audience that, "Rock and Roll is a river of music that has absorbed many streams: rhythm and blues, jazz, rag time, cowboy songs, country songs, folk songs. All have contributed to the Big Beat."</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> Alan Freed was introduced to European audiences by his appearances in a succession of rock 'n' roll movies such as <i><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Around_The_Clock_1103.html" title="Rock Around The Clock">Rock Around The Clock</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Knock_the_Rock_500e.html" title="Don't Knock the Rock">Don't Knock the Rock</a></i> and other titles. That same year and while working for <a href="../../../w/i/n/WINS_7e55.html" title="WINS">WINS</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Alan Freed began recording a weekly half-hour segment of the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Luxembourg_%28English%29_ef0a.html" title="Radio Luxembourg (English)">Radio Luxembourg</a> show called <i><b>Jamboree</b></i> that was aired on Saturday nights at 9:30 PM. The billing of his segment in the <b>208</b> magazine programme guide described him as "<i>the remarkable American disc-jockey whose programmes in the States cause excitement to the fever pitch.</i>". A year later <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Clark_2b95.html" title="Dick Clark">Dick Clark</a> appeared in a rock 'n' roll movie of his own called <i><a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamboree_%281957_film%29.html" title="Jamboree (1957 film)">Disc Jockey Jamboree</a></i> when it was released in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><i>Jamboree</i> with Alan Freed was heard throughout the British Isles and much of Europe via the powerful AM nighttime signal of Radio Luxembourg, and outside Europe by a similtaneous relay via transmission on shortwave. Due to the strange effect that the ionisphere had on the skywave signal of Radio Luxembourg, it was heard poorly in parts of southern England with extreme fading and like a local station in northern England cities such as <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool%2C_England_7a62.html" title="Liverpool, England">Liverpool</a>. The <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a>' founding members claim to have been influenced by African American artists such as <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a> who were both promoted on Alan Freed's radio shows. The recordings made by these artists were in turn promoted on sponsored shows paid for by the record labels that were also heard over Radio Luxembourg, which was the commercial radio station heard in the United Kingdom until 1964.</p>

<p>After departing from WINS, Freed for a time was employed in New York by <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_3b83.html" title="WABC">WABC</a> 770 AM around 1958, ironically about two years before it evolved into one of America's great Top 40 stations by launching its "Musicradio" format. At this time, WABC (unlike rocker WINS) was more of a full- service station which began implementing some music programming elements. Ironically, Reed was employed at the station around the same time as another famous pioneering disc jockey who arose during a different era: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Block_2d82.html" title="Martin Block">Martin Block</a> (of WNEW 1130 AM - now <a href="../../../w/b/b/WBBR_ae01.html" title="WBBR">WBBR</a> - "Make Believe Ballroom" fame), toward the end of Block's legendary career. Freed was eventually fired by WABC (1959) during a dispute where he refused to sign a statement assuring that he had never accepted payola.</p>

<p>Alan Freed also appeared in a number of major and historical rock and roll motion pictures during this period. These films were often welcomed with tremendous enthusiasm by teenagers because they brought visual depictions of their favorite American acts to the big screen, years before music videos would present the same sort of image on the small television screen. One side effect of these movies shown before mass audiences was that they sometimes presented an excuse for thugs to turn a fun event into a riot, in which cinemas in both <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> were trashed.</p>

<p>It was at the height of Freed's career at the beginning of his new <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> series that various individuals decided to use Alan Freed as a scapegoat for all that was wrong with the recorded music industry. His show called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Big_Beat_29e3.html" title="The Big Beat">The Big Beat</a> (which predated American Bandstand) on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> was suddenly cancelled after an episode, in which <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Lymon_f864.html" title="Frankie Lymon">Frankie Lymon</a> of Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers was seen dancing with a white girl, offended the management of ABC's local affiliates in the Southern states. Into the void that had been created by the absence of Freed on TV, the career of <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Clark_%28entertainer%29_9e7b.html" title="Dick Clark (entertainer)">Dick Clark</a> began to take off.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> During this period, Freed was seen on other popular programs of the day, including <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Tell_The_Truth_964d.html" title="To Tell The Truth">To Tell The Truth</a>, where he is seen defending the new "Rock and Roll" sound to the panelists whom were all clearly more comfortable with swing music:<a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Bergen_1e98.html" title="Polly Bergen">Polly Bergen</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Bellamy_4a07.html" title="Ralph Bellamy">Ralph Bellamy</a>, and <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Carlisle_86b6.html" title="Kitty Carlisle">Kitty Carlisle</a> [Note: The re-broadcast of this particular episode of TTTT occurred on The Gameshow Network on February 4th or 5th, 2007].</p>

<p>In 1958, Freed faced controversy in Boston, when he told the audience, "The police don't want you to have fun", as a result, Freed was arrested and charged for inciting to riot. The career of Alan Freed ended when accusations were made that he had accepted <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payola.html" title="Payola">payola</a> – that is, taken bribes to play specific records. He had also taken songwriting co-credits (most notably on <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>'s <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Maybellene.html" title="Maybellene">Maybellene</a></i>). This entitled him to receive part of a song's royalties, which he could help increase by heavily promoting the record on his own popular radio show.</p>
<p>Although these practices were not unique to him, he was singled out for attention. Freed lost his own show on radio station WINS, then he was fired from the station altogether. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> payola was made illegal, although this by no means stopped the practice which continues in various forms to this day. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> Alan Freed pled guilty to two charges of commercial bribery for which he received a fine and a suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Although the punishment handed down to Alan Freed was not severe, the side effects of negative publicity were such that no prestigious station would employ him, and he moved to the West Coast in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, where he worked at KDAY-AM in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica_aa1e.html" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. In 1962, after KDAY refused to allow him to promote rock 'n roll stage shows, Freed moved to WQAM in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, but that association lasted only two months. He died in a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Springs%2C_California_6f8b.html" title="Palm Springs, California">Palm Springs, California</a> hospital in 1965 at the age of 43 suffering from <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uraemia.html" title="Uraemia">uraemia</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liver_cirrhosis.html" title="Liver cirrhosis">liver cirrhosis</a>, which was brought on by alcoholism. Shortly before this he had begun working at a radio station in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Springs%2C_California_6f8b.html" title="Palm Springs, California">Palm Springs, California</a>.

Although director Floyd Mutrux created a fictionalised account of Freed's last days in New York radio by utilising real-life elements outside of their actual chronology, the film does accurately convey the fond relationship between Freed, the musicians he played and the audiences who listened to them.
