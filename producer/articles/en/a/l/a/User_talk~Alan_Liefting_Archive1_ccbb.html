<p>You shouldn't have moved it by cutting and pasting. That destroys the history of the article.</p>

<dd>I fixed the cut and paste move to restore the proper page history. There are still many links to <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabine_River_0341.html" title="Sabine River">Sabine River</a> that need redirecting to the North American river page, however. Also, if you move a major article, there are often links in the other language Wikipedia. For example, there is a article in the German Wikipedia about the Sabine River. It's considered a courtesy by the person who moves a page to fix this links as well.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecumanus_9e44.html" title="User:Decumanus">Decumanus</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDecumanus_9c89.html" title="User talk:Decumanus">Talk</a> 15:35, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I notice you had moved the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackenzie_River_c62d.html" title="Mackenzie River">Mackenzie River</a> to disambiguate it. Disambiguation is good, but in this case, we have an established policy of letting well-known major rivers (which the Mackenzie certainly is) live at the regular name space (cf. <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_%28disambiguation%29_517a.html" title="Mississippi River (disambiguation)">Mississippi River (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_River_%28disambiguation%29_c25b.html" title="Jordan River (disambiguation)">Jordan River (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraser_River_%28disambiguation%29_8ff8.html" title="Fraser River (disambiguation)">Fraser River (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swan_River_%28disambiguation%29_7b38.html" title="Swan River (disambiguation)">Swan River (disambiguation)</a>), so I moved it back and created a separate disambiguation page <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackenzie_River_%28disambiguation%29_06fd.html" title="Mackenzie River (disambiguation)">Mackenzie River (disambiguation)</a>. Also in North America, and elsewhere, the convention many of us have established is to use parentheses to disambig rivers. The reason is that a name like <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackenzie_River%2C_Northwest_Territories_7ef4.html" title="Mackenzie River, Northwest Territories">Mackenzie River, Northwest Territories</a> is in the form of a community, and in fact many times it will be such (cf. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Toms_River_df9b.html" title="Toms River">Toms River</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Toms_River%2C_New_Jersey_f11c.html" title="Toms River, New Jersey">Toms River, New Jersey</a>). Also, the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabine_River_%28Texas-Louisiana%29_c5f5.html" title="Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)">Sabine River</a> in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> is a pretty important river. Disambiguation is probably OK in this case, but doing so leaves behind lots of links that you need to redirect away from the disambig page, as a matter of courtesy (check "What Links Here" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Sabine_River" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Sabine_River" rel="nofollow">like this</a>, which shows the links that are now stranded): it's often one good reason to let major rivers stay in the undisambig article space. Moving them requires lots of link correction).</p>
<p>You are invited to join the discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Rivers_e9c8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Rivers">Wikipedia:WikiProject Rivers</a> where we've had an ongoing discussion about river disambiguation for quite some time.

<p>Hi, I removed the link to England that you added in the Oban disambiguation page. It wasn't clear if you were saying there is an Oban in England, because the link just went to an England page. If you meant to suggest that Scotland is part of England, I can only hope you did this out of ignorance rather than malice.

<p>You include man-made dams in your environment proposal but deleted my suggestion because you say <b>built enviro</b> is not relevant. Aren't dams <b>built enviro</b>? The protection at Kerikeri basin is for the whole <b>local environment</b>, not just the buildings. The <b>area</b> is where missionaries established NZ's first (permanent) mission station and over the years caring people have been restoring the environment there as much as possible to the way it was in the 1820s. Same for Hongi Hika's pa there, where he lived and armed his warriors with muskets for forays down south. If they build a dam over the Kerikeri basin, will that qualify for your article?&#160;:)-. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 22:16, Oct 7, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dams are disruption of a natural environment (visually, ecologically, physically). The Historic Places Trust is to protect a heritage <b>built environment</b> so is not a relevent heading in this article. However, a <b>dam</b> on the Kerikeri River will be of interest for this article. If that were to happen I would like to document the effect on the natural environment and the activities of the environmentalists. The <b>historic environment</b> or <b>historic built environment</b> would have to be an article unto itself. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 20:16, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not only the historic places trust that has been working to restore/preserve the Kerikeri basin environment, and three buildings are only a part of the very important local environment. They are not going to build a dam. To the contrary, they are removing a busy road bridge which is a <b>"disruption of a natural environment (visually, ecologically, physically)"</b>, to help restore the basin environment to the natural state it was pre pakeha . In an article dedicated to the environment of NZ, the Kerikeri experience surely justifies inclusion. And guess what, if an <b>"article unto itself"</b> was created about this <b>"historic environment"</b>, someone would merge it with the article quicksmart. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 21:06, Oct 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alan! You and I seem to be chasing down each other's geo-stubs on NZ's South Island and (mostly) improving them! I'm in the middle of a major rationalisation of the categories used for NZ geography at the moment and am hunting out any which aren't categorised... As well as the "NZ rivers, lakes, islands, etc" categories, every place in NZ is being linked to a category for its region (at the moment it's mainly S.I. ones that have categories, but give me time!). Can I ask you to add these categories with any new articles you do, please? All the categories are subdirectories in the <b>Locations in New Zealand</b> category at the moment, if you want to know what they are.

<dd>Hi Alan - the idea about a tunnel through the pass was mentioned in an old (1969) copy of <i>Wises's New Zealand Guide</i> entry on Copland Pass: <tt>"It has recently been suggested that a tunnel should be pierced here to facilitate the flow of visitor traffic to the Hermitage."</tt> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a> 00:18, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure if it received widespread promotion or support. I guess it begs the question of where the cutoff point for relevence lies. Not sure how authoritive the statement in the Wises Guide would be. I wrote a tongue in cheek "Letter to the Editor" of the Christchurch Press newspaper suggesting a tunnel. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 00:57, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking forward to your edits of <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_movement.html" title="Environmental movement">Environmental movement</a> this needs some work. Keep in mind <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology_movement.html" title="Ecology movement">Ecology movement</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_movement.html" title="Green movement">Green movement</a>. On the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_ecology.html" title="Deep ecology">deep ecology</a> article, deep ecology is described as differentiating the ecological from the environmental movement, maybe this difference is important enough to be put in the introduction? Would it be correct to say that the conservation movement has evolved into the environmental movement and thence to the ecological movement? <a href="../../../m/u/x/User%7EMuxxa_a431.html" title="User:Muxxa">Muxxa</a> 05:31, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan - I've expanded and modified the text and descripion at the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meadow-grass.html" title="Meadow-grass">Meadow-grass</a> page to include NZ Tussocks and have put in a request to have the page moved to <i><a href="../../../p/o/a/Poa.html" title="Poa">Poa</a></i>. Please add any more NZ species that should be in! (I added two that I could find details for easily) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 16:42, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again - I've just been adding a bit to <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutu_%28plant%29.html" title="Tutu (plant)">Tutu (plant)</a>. One of my books lists <i>Coriaria microphylla</i> and <i>C. ruscifolia</i> as native to both NZ and South America, but online sites suggest they are just South American, with no reference to NZ. Can you check to see if these two species occur in NZ as well please? - Thanks, <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 17:50, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Alan - thanks for the weblink on NZ plants; on <i>Cordyline</i>, I'm not saying that it is <i>never</i> called 'Torbay Palm' here, I'm sure it is occasionally (by uneducated people who don't know the difference between Agavaceae and Arecaceae!), but it certainly isn't in widespread use, and certainly not, as claimed, <i>throughout</i> the UK. It is called Cabbage Tree in all the UK tree books. I'd say 'Torbay Palm' is less common as a name than 'That Spiky Thing'. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 10:18, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The answer as to where I got the figures from would be the link that is now dead. It's quite a while ago I made the edit, I'm not sure I remember much else. Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 3 July 2005 08:58 (UTC)</p>
