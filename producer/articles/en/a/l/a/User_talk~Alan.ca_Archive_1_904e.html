<p>Hi. I agree that <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hughes_Electronics_07f1.html" title="Hughes Electronics">Hughes Electronics</a> needs sources. Now that it's been brought to my attention I will work on it. However I've removed the deletion template because there is nothing controversial in the article and frankly I think the template should never have been added in the first place, the sources tag is enough. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 19:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mark, the tag was added because there were no sources. The whole idea of proposed deletion is to see if anyone objects to the deletion. You are well within your rights to remove the tag template, but make no mistake, I am justified in including it. It would seem that people should check their facts before writing an article. Without facts, everything in the article is supposition.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 19:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for getting back to me. It's just my opinion and I know you aren't violating policy, however you're approach does have a heavy handed feel, if you'll forgive me being blunt. The article is sound. It's unreferenced which is less than adequate, but the facts are sound. As such I think a clear warning that is unreference is enough to warn readers and it gives interested parties time to work on the article. Deleting a sound article on a notable subject doesn't seem like an ideal way of resolving such a problem. Thanks again for responding. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark83_2412.html" title="User talk:Mark83">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mark83_75d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mark83">contribs</a>) 19:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Hi. Fair points above. You may have noticed both today and yesterday I added a lot of references. Regarding the merger - I have merged Hughes Electronics into Hughes Aircraft. By the time of the sale of Hughes Electronics it was (although still a major company) a shell of what it was when GM bought Hughes Aircraft in 1985. This way the full details of all the divestitures can be dealt with in full in one article instead of fragmented between three or two articles. Hughes Aircraft still needs a lot of reference work, I'll work on it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 15:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have created a number of articles recently, most of which have 2 or 3 sources. To which articles are you specificially referring? Most of them I have used from my own sources, but several were created from existing aritcles that did not have sources. I am trying to rectify that, but it takes time. As for the co-axial helicopters, thanks. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 07:47, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If your referring to the <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_S-69_0319.html" title="Sikorsky S-69">Sikorsky S-69</a> page, you should have noticed from looking at the History that I added the {unreferenced} tag when I created the article, and that it does have one source. I created the article using text from another article (I don't recall which one at the moment) that was unsourced, but I have read of the projects in other places. I had hopes the tag would attract other readers who might have or know of sources they could add or direct me to. Given you interest in co-axial helicopters, if you know of a good source on the topic (esp. online, as I am currently an invalid, and can't get out), that would be helpful.</p>
<p>If you do add {cn} tags, please give some time (at least one week is a reasonable time, which I go by). Thanks for you suggestions. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 08:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I am referring to that page. Let's just leave the uncited information out until we can find citable sources. I did some searching on the Internet, but even the aircraft history sites didn't have any citable specs. You will note that the template you're using even has a mandatory field for a cited source. Please remember that specs should be cited from an independent source. Often, if you contact the manufacturer they will advise of the independent testing facility that verified their numbers. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The big issue I have with uncited information is that someone looks up the article and assumes the data on the page to be accurate. At some point in the future, we realize it's not correct, so we update the article. That visitor has already used the incorrect information and possibly propagates it further. Our change does not percolate down the same path and the invalid info comes back later to conflict with the accurate version. When I'm deciding whether or not to leave an uncited piece of information and tag it with 'cn' or 'fact', I ask myself if I have any reason to believe the info is valid. If I am not reasonably certain, I remove it. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's not get into a revert war over this. If you'll leave the pages as I had them, I will make it a priority to adress the problems within one week. I thought I had a source for the specs on the S-69 listed, but I didn't put them in. In fact, I left out the Refernces-footnotes section! You deletions brought that to my attention, but it would have been simpler to just add a {cn/fact} tag, and possibly post a note on the talk page about your concerns. I would not have added anything to the articles if I doubted their credibility. I knew it was unsourced, and took the proper steps to address that. I got caught up in antoehr project,and neglected to return to the articel; my bad. Now that I have been remined, I will do my best to address the issues, and will remove the items myslef in one week if I have not sourced them to Wiki standards. Is that good enough for you?</p>

<dd>Fair enough, I'm not going to hassle an editor that actually intends to include cited sources. I hope you understand my point though about leaving unsourced information out until atleast one source has been found. I'm going to just trust that you're reasonably certain the info is correct, but if it's not cited in a couple of weeks I will most likely return to clip out the same sections. I will take a look at that other article, happy editing!<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks. If you see anything else on pages I'm editing that needs attention, just post on that article's talk page; I watch my Watchlist every day.

Oh, and someone else has already added a source to the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hughes_Helicopters_5953.html" title="Hughes Helicopters">Hughes Helicopters</a> article.

<dd>You must know that "Let's just leave the uncited information out until we can find citable sources." is incorrect. If you have a problem with a particular fact add a fact/citation needed tag.

<dd>Actually Mark, an editor can remove any statement that is not sourced. By definition any disputed fact is controversial. You should also notice that when I remove a statement, I often use html comment tags to make it disappear from the article, but leave it intact in the wikitext in case someone chooses to verify the fact and reinclude it.

Alan, I'm a bit concerned that you have apparantley ignored the concerns raised above by me and by others. [i.e. editing for several hours after comments have been posted here].

<p>I noticed that you added a link to a WikiProject on Hamilton which has yet to be created on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROJGUIDE_5ec5.html" title="WP:PROJGUIDE">Project Guide</a>. I was wondering whether you might want to consider contacting <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ontario_15d8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ontario">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ontario</a> to discuss with them the possibility of establishing such a group as a subproject of the Ontario project. Speaking as one of the primary constructors of the existing project directory, I know that it currently has over 1100 separate projects and that one of the biggest obstacles several of them have is recruiting members. If you were to establish such a group as a subproject of the Ontario project, you would benefit from having the members of that project know about your project, and likely get some contributions from them that you may not have gotten otherwise. As no project officially exists right now, I am removing the red-link from the project directory. If such a group becomes a subproject of the Ontario project, I am sure that they will reinsert it. If after discussion, you still feel that the best or only way to proceed is as a separate project, please read the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROJGUIDE_5ec5.html" title="WP:PROJGUIDE">Project Guide</a> for some ideas on how other successful projects have developed, and perhaps contact me at my talk page if you want any help setting the project page up.

<p>Hi. I have chosen to remove the discussion last edited on 00:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC) here to avoid it getting lost. Your edit was "Actually Mark, an editor can remove any statement that is not sourced. By definition any disputed fact is controversial. You should also notice that when I remove a statement, I often use html comment tags to make it disappear from the article, but leave it intact in the wikitext in case someone chooses to verify the fact and reinclude it.

<p>My point was based on <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>: <s>:To summarize the use of in line tags for unsourced or poorly sourced material:</s></p>

<p>This is not relevant as <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wp%7Ecite.html" title="Wp:cite">wp:cite</a> is a style guide, not an official policy document. I have therefore stuck out this point.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 01:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The first point to make here is that <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">Verifiability</a> is an official policy of Wikipedia where as <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wp%7Ecite.html" title="Wp:cite">Citing sources</a> is considered a guideline for Wikipedia.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>A large company is not always a notable company. It is the responsibility of the contributing editor to prove the notability of a subject by using cited facts. Please realize there is a difference between the notability of a subject in your mind and the proven notability of it in an encyclopedic article.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 01:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As an aside, please know, I do appreciate the work you did on the Hughes Electronics article. I am having this debate with not to just hammer a point, but to debate it.

<p>Alan, as you're noticing from the above you're quickly becoming a pest with the speedy tagging. You better turn of your bot before people get too aggravated. In my case the bio, finished less than a minute before your tag, was sourced by stating that it was a translation from the Dutch wikipedia article. On top of that, I was about to add some more info (like a link to a Dutch website) which perhaps would have stopped you from adding the tag in the first place. You seem to feel strongly that your tags are important, but please give people at least some time to finalize their article.<a href="../../../a/f/a/User%7EAfasmit_12f4.html" title="User:Afasmit">Afasmit</a> 08:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>It wasn't a bot, I was flying through manually. I admit I went to far with a few of them. I apologize if your article was one of them. It was my first run of new page patrol and I already admitted some of it went too far. Please also note, the original author is not permitted to remove a speedy tag.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually Afasmit, I didn't tag your page for speedy deletion. I put an unsourced tag because your article did not have any sources.

Please return the tag. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:17, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, Alan, I never said you tagged this innocent little article on the athletic achievements of a non-living person that I simply translated from the Dutch wikipedia for deletion. I was trying to warn you that your current overly fast and thus poorly-thought-out tagging and probably other editing (like your answers to my complaint) will lead to a lot of flaming from less benign editors, as witnessed by all the text that you've already cleared from this page. Perhaps you can live with that, or even enjoy it, but it does not encourage people from adding information to wikipedia, which hopefully still is at the heart of this project and at least equally important as your beloved 3 pillars. It would make more sense if the new-page patrol (a thankless job, I'm sure) focuses on articles that contain some level of potentially controversial or dubious data. I'm sure there are plenty of those. In the case of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Berger_2326.html" title="Chris Berger">Chris Berger</a>, his sprint records of the 1930s can often be confirmed in the wikipedia articles to which I'd internally linked. With respect to the tag, I removed it because I'd added the source that I was about to add when you out-tagged me. Adding a source seems a good reason for removing a no-source tag, but apparently I didn't follow the rules exactly. Is it because I called it an external link rather than an external source or reference? In that case you would've corrected the header instead, so that won't be it. Or is it that the source is in Dutch? It'll be hard to find such a good source for information on this person in English. With such rigorous requirements, you will have a lot of work tagging unsourced articles. There will be over a million of those. <a href="../../../a/f/a/User%7EAfasmit_12f4.html" title="User:Afasmit">Afasmit</a> 10:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyone who challenges a great deal of edits is going to have some backlash. An unsourced tag is no reason for backlash, but apparently some people misunderstand its purpose. If an article is unsourced for any period of time, the unsourced tag is an acceptabl placement. The fact that there is so much discussion on my talk page is a testament to the fact that I explain my choices to those who challenge it and try to work to find the best solution for wikipedia. In your case, I think it's a simple over reaction to a simple maintenance tag. IF you want my constructive criticism, here it goes:</li>

<p>1) When citing sources please try to include the reference in the text of the article where the statement you are citing lies. I generally use footnotes which can be learned about at <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wp%7Efoot.html" title="Wp:foot">wp:foot</a>. Have you seen the citation templates available?</p>
<p>2) Consider when initially creating an article to write something brief that contains well sources facts. This gives other editors time to contribute to your work while limiting the need for someone like myself to come along and challenge the unsourced nature of your article. Either way, thanks for the feedback and I hope you continue to invest the time to translate articles. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 19:07, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed your comments to the <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Loftus_b105.html" title="Amy Loftus">Amy Loftus</a> AFD and find you seem to (IMO) be misrepresenting accurate sourcing. It has always been acceptable to source non-controversial detail to statements made by an individual about themselves. Self-published sources cannot establish notability, of course, but they are valid sources for information. Even if a newspaper article does not actually quote a subject directly when making statements about them, it is most likely that they simply got those details from the subject in any event; thus no real extra reliability is gained thereby.</p>
<p>You should also be very careful about ever removing a stated source from an article - in other words, don't do it unless you have a very good reason, which should normally be that you have found a better source for that information (although it never hurts to keep multiple references). Sources are cited to document where the information came from. If you delete a source, you are in effect losing that origin information. A poor source is not ideal, but it is better than no source being stated at all.</p>
<p>We take self-published statements as sources all the time. We source a company's own press releases in writing an article about it. We source Microsoft's web site when writing an article about Microsoft Word. We source peoples' personal websites to gain biographical detail. This is normal, natural and correct. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 11:10, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the feedback Morven, citing sources is a point of interest for me. I may have been too agressive with that <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Loftus_b105.html" title="Amy Loftus">Amy Loftus</a> article, I often comment out or move such things to the talk page. However, on the issue of unreliable sources, do you not agree that referenced citations in an article tend to give crediblity to that article if they are accurate or not? As strange as it may sound, from my POV, when I see that footnote, I don't always click it, I somehow assume that if someone included it, it must be useful. In the case of a reference to the subject's web site or a blog page, I feel as though the integrity of all citations are being brought into question.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's not to say that I do not check citations when the subject is important, but that I know many people do not. In the case that I do check a citation, I try to make certain it meets the standard of verifiability and NPOV, so when someone like myself reads the article, in the case when they do not check, I am improving the accuracy of what is being read or indicating the fact has not been checked properly. I guess where we differ in opinion, is that, I see a poor reference as no reference at all. As in, I never ask a friendly fisherman to show me with his hands how big was the fish he caught when I was not around. To me, this blatant conflict of interest can only lead to trouble and therefore I discount the evidence. I'm not arguing that independent sources cannot be wrong, but I guess that's where I draw the line. Further on this subject, what is your point of view on citing a subject's statements from a public interview?<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 11:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, it all depends on what a subject's own statement is being used to support. If it is a non-controversial detail, then I'm definitely fine with it. We (and journalists, for that matter) tend to use a subject's own statements for things like that when there is no suggestion of controversy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If the subject's statements are being used to support something stronger than minor detail, I want the article text to explicitly state that this is the subject's own claims, rather than leave it appearing to be a neutral statement. E.g. "In an interview, Subject claimed that she was sexually abused between the ages of ten to fourteen".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to references, I think a poor source is better than <i>leaving the content in the article unsourced</i>. Depending on what is claimed, sometimes the right thing to do with a poor source is to remove the statement from the article (placing it in the talk page so that others can find references). IMO, one should never leave the statement in the article but remove the source; that just loses useful information.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree that references in an article add undeserved credibility to it. Since sourcing is mandatory, every statement in Wikipedia should (in general) be sourced. There is some argument to the idea of 'invisible' references, reducing the clutter to the general reader. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 11:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When one living person accuses another <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living person</a>, Wikipedia should be especially careful about sourcing. While poor or marginal sources are acceptable for many purposes, they are never acceptable for a derogatory claim about a living person. Also, where it is not clear whether a person is living or dead, we must presume them living. I have no clue whether the person that Barbara Biggs accuses is still living, but until I see a reliable source concerning his death, I must presume him alive. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 13:32, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, you might mention at the same time that you might want to consider setting up a task force to deal specifically with articles relating to Hamilton, its people, geography and culture, and ask them if they would be willing to perhaps create a subproject to deal with it. Subprojects tend to have advantages over full-fledged projects, particularly in having much less administrative tasks to deal with, as the mother project generally performs them.

<dd>The way I see this debate is to first establish what sources are valid in the article. Do you agree that if Barb makes a statement in an interview, if it is published, televised or whatever else, it is still coming from Barb? The whole idea of independent sourcing is to get an outsider's point of view, that is independent on the subject of the article. Therefore, we cannot cite Barb's statements in an interview, no matter where it has been published.

<dd>Putting aside the question of notability, as per POV and article content, as always I agree. In the BBC interview, even in just the openning statements by the inteviewer (and on the written summary page for that matter), there is a 3rd party journalistic verification about what that inteviewer is saying about the suject and that in itself can be considered a reliable source.

<p>If Oakshade is arguing for notable on the basis of the BBC interview and the Age article, you will all see now many more citations to many more articles which were not there before. I have been the subject of a great many high profile journalistic interviews which I have now mentioned in the article. (But if this is seen as biased, remove the sentence by all means. But if you want notability, these references provide more.) The list of articles cited now in the entry is by no means complete - many important ones can't be found now on google since they several years old. But in any case, there are so many it would be silly to include them all even if they were to hand. As for the verifiability of my story, with the enormous amount of media coverage it has received, nobody has yet questioned any single fact I have claimed happened to me. How would one, under your criteria, say, for example, prove that what happened th Frank McCourt when he was a boy, really happened? Presumably he is the only one who could verify many of these events. Anyone in the media who then talks about these events, would only be doing so based on what he had said since nobody else would ever have published anything else, independantly, about his life. On this basis, you could never verify any memoir of a non-famous person. Also, I have suggested to Oakshade on his own article, since he gave the entry a strong keep recommendation, that he may have an interest in rewriting or rejigging the article. Or asked where I could post a notice requesting that some interested party might do this. In any case, where does this leave the entry now? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbbiggs_c3b1.html" title="User:Barbbiggs">Barbbiggs</a> 15:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Barb, we're going to withdraw the deletion process, but please stop writing your own biography! It violates many fundamental principals of wikipedia.

<p>My WP username seems to have been deleted. Are you able to explain how or why this may have happened? My laptop is in for repair, so I'm in an internet cafe logging on, but that shouldn't change anything should it? If I create a new user name, it means I can't access any messages in discussion or talk pages under my old username. What does withdrawing the delete process mean? It's still marked for deletion when I request the page as a non-user. I have stopped writing my own biography. I have merely sourced what was there to satisfy the complaints that were identified as problems. I have lived my life not relying on others to fix problems for me. If I'd waited for that I'd still be back at the amoeba phase! In any case, I'm pleased to see that someone has put back the political candidacy reference, added quotes from Peter Hollingworth etc. As for sources, the ones I found, I did so because I knew where to look. Surely you're not going to tell me that sourcing comments yourself violates fundamental Wikipedia policy. I read an article in the Washington Post that someone sent me about Wikipedia's treatment of its delete policy. It was not a positive article for the Wikipedia profile. 203.36.217.79 04:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Barb, the deletion process is a debate. Robert and I, as the main opposition of keeping your article have agreed to keep your article with the understanding that you will be supervised not to edit the main page article. That includes adding sources. I cannot comment on the review you speak of, but in this case we simply do not want someone writing their own biography as it does not respect the wikipedia principle of neutral point of view. Please understand that things move slowly on wikipedia and that failure to include everything that should be in the article instantly is not a failing of this process. Are you aware that having your biography on wikipedia may lead to it including information that you may not be comfortable with being shared on the Internet? Please remember you are not the authority on what goes in and does not go in to your biography on wikipedia. If you can respect this principle, your article will grow in time and people will volunteer to improve it. If you choose to violate this principle you will find that your article will be content locked from being changed and that your user account will become banned. I hope this is not what has to happen as I believe you will continue to make great contributions to wikipedia in the form of editing other articles. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 04:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do I deal with a wikipedia admin who is presently engaged in a revert war with me for the second time, on an entirely separate article. I have filed a cabal case and complained on the 3r admin noticeboard. I investigated this user's edits and have found that on atleast one other occassion, this month he has engaged in another revert war.

<dl>
<dd>Looking at your 3RR complaint, I have to agree that it is not valid. Aside from problems of form (you need diffs, not versions), you need to prove four reverts within 24 hours. The four you cited covered nearly sixty hours. That's not even close. Do you have any evidence that the Admin is using his powers to intimidate you or gain an advantage? If you feel that he has, then you can report the problem on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, but I see no clear evidence of an actionable problem.

<dd>Please note that I am the wikipedia admin Alan.ca is referring to. The "revert war" he's alleging is on the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Marsales_fe38.html" title="Judy Marsales">Judy Marsales</a> article, wherein I've removed inconsequential information than appears to be thinly-disguised POV-pushing.

<dd>The other situation involves my dispute with <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">User:GoldDragon</a>. GoldDragon's general "modus operandi" on Wikipedia is to repost the same edits over and over and over, even in situations where everyone else disagrees with him. I've dealt with him over a period of several months, and consider him to be a nuisance editor most of the time (although not a vandal). I'm certain that I'm not alone in this view. I've tried introducing compromise language several times, but, unfortunately, I've learned that one frequently has to descend to his level of multiple reverts to counter his dubious edits. It isn't pleasant, but the alternative is generally worse.</dd>

<dd><i>(I put this on the admin noticeboard as well)</i>The problem I see here though is that much of what you've PROD'd <i>doesn't</i> fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it's just <b>unverified</b> not <b>unverifiable</b>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a reason to delete if an article absolutely can't be verified, not just because the editors who contributed lack knowledge about the policies here (or in some cases are just too lazy to follow them).

<dd>Again, I think this simply refers to "unverifiable" not "unverified"; i.e. if no reliable, third-party sources exist for an article, this article should be deleted. If the sources exist and are not in the article, the article should be tagged or sourced. Unless an article has sat tagged for sourcing for an inordinate amount of time or is an obvious <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> violation, I don't think that statement justifies a PROD.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:36, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your point of view Isotope23, I appreciate the feedback, but I feel strongly about citing sources in an encyclopedia article and I think a debate should take place on making atleast one cited source a minimum requirement for a new article. I argue that <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">wp:v</a> as one of the 3 pillars already makes this assertion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 15:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then AFD them.

<ul>
<li>I don't want to run in circles discussing this topic. I used the PROD tag on articles that did not cite sources. My interpretation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wp:v">wp:v#Burden of evidence</a> tells me that an article that doesn't have sources can be deleted. A prod, is the least obtrusive application for deletion as it can be halted by any user removing the tag. Unless someone is going to cite an arbcom decision, this finalizes my thoughts on the subject. If you wish to continue this debate, take it to your talk page. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 15:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only other thing I will say is that if you want to go through a daily PROD of articles that will be subsequently deprodded that is your business, but it sort of defeats the purpose of your rationale against AFD as this will just eat up more of your own time as well as the time of other editors.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you truly believe an article should be deleted due to lack of sourcing, when someone deprods an article you should AFD it. But if you're just going to ignore the article after prodding it I'm quite certain that's disruption to make a point. The best way forward to be to actually finalise something, and not toss it aside because you think everyone else is wrong. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 15:57, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a previously outside observer to this discussion, I'd like to point out that I think you are misreading the Burden of Evidence section of WP:V. The section you quoted: "If an article <i>topic</i> has no..." is where I believe you may be missing the italicized word "topic". It is the topic that needs to be unverifiable and not the article itself that may exist without sources as unverified. For example, if I write the first article about the Eiffel Tower and do not cite any sources, that does not mean that the article needs to be deleted. The Eiffel Tower is a verifiable topic, but the article is not verified. The article will need a {{sources}} tag for sure, but prodding it is not appropriate. If an article topic is verifiable and yet, as you claim, it were appropriate to prod-tag the article for removal, then there would be no point to having the source-request tags. This is in comparison to an article I could write on my Aunt Milny the Hermit. Not having been out of her house for 40 years, there's no verifiability in secondary sources for this topic and therefore the article could be prodded quite easily (in this case, I've chosen an extreme example that would probably also be speedied as well). I encourage you to see some of the valid uses of and information about the prod-tag at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPRODSUM_d4fb.html" title="WP:PRODSUM">WP:PRODSUM</a> and <a href="../../../w/p/p/WP%7EWPPDP_5767.html" title="WP:WPPDP">WP:WPPDP</a> if you have not already. Please understand that I'm commenting to help you better choose your course of action on unsourced articles that will benefit the Wikipedia in the long run by requesting sources for verifiable article topics rather than removing the entire article. Remember, WP:V stands for Verifi<b>ability</b>, not Verified-or-not-ity. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand the perspective of the opponents in this argument, I just don't agree with it. To me, we only review articles on wikipedia, not topics. It is the responsibility of the inclusionist editor to prove that an article meets policy. I don't push the AfD because in most cases if someone removes the PROD they feel obligated to find a source. In due course, if the article is not sourced another editor may choose to initiate the AfD at a later date. If the editor fails to cite sources for their content, any editor has a right to remove that content, this is written into <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">wp:v</a> as well. If we want to have a reliable encyclopedia here, I believe we should not create articles if we cannot cite atleast one source, as if we do, the policy essentially states the entire article content may be removed. Maybe this debate should be had on the talk page for <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">wp:v</a>. Thank you all for participating, the last comment about the word topic did actually make me reconsider for a moment. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 21:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As the High Pontiff of Rabid Deletionists (depending on whom you ask) let me preface this by saying that I'll <u>not only</u> happily {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} anything without sources, I've <u>also</u> been known to {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} them as well. I have <u><i>even</i></u> made use of my adminstrative powers to delete something *gasp* unilaterally that was blissfully free from tags of any kind.</p>
<p>Whenever someone gets their back up over something I've done, I do try to soften my stance a little, if for no other reason than that it stops me from ending up on someone's <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">naughty list</a> and they undo all my tagging anyway.</p>
<p>All that said, I'd consider anything less than circa fifty prod tags a day to be <b>un</b>disruptive, and in particular if you (somehow) keep a list and follow up the articles later there is <i>clearly</i> no problem. <b>But you've got to be nice.</b> Some of the last few comments/edit summaries have pushed the edge a little bit, eh? I know, we're approaching the point where it's "Stop hasseling me!" "Why do you say I'm hasseling you?" "Just leave me alone!" "Why do you want me to leave you alone?" territory.</p>
<p>So remove this messge if you want of course, but I <u>please</u> just ignore whomever it is that has gotten up your nose right now, ok?</p>

<p>As the image is not a copyright violation, I took down the tag so that it would not get deleted after seven days.

Please do not add nonsense to my talk page. For one thing, I am not new to Wikipedia, according to your user contributions, I have been here longer than you. And secondly, <i>you</i> are the one perpetuating a revert war. You keep reverting by saying that you have proof that the image is copyright Mr. Chung, yet the owner of the web site that you are citing has said that the information there is incorrect. You have no source for your claim, so do not try and say that you are continuing this debate for copyright reasons. I don't know if you have something against Mr. Harper or whether you just like fighting, but please stop, this is getting very tiresome. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> 23:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Alan.ca, it seems me that the image you're linking to is probably an outdated page. However the image has been updated to be "© House of Commons" at Harper's proper biography page at the Parliamentary website. Which is it Alan.ca? So who owns the copyright now? Herman Chung or the House of Commons? <a href="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78553&amp;Language=E" class="external autonumber" title="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78553&amp;Language=E" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I can't figure out how to get to that one page you're linking from their main page. So I have to go by the assumption you googled this image to find the appropriate page to make your argument here. I've removed the copyright violation tag as the <a href="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/MainMPsCompleteList.aspx?TimePeriod=Current&amp;Language=E" class="external autonumber" title="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/MainMPsCompleteList.aspx?TimePeriod=Current&amp;Language=E" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> gives me the exact link <a href="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78553&amp;Language=E" class="external autonumber" title="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78553&amp;Language=E" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>instead of the link given by Alan.ca.</li>

<li>I have read your submission. My submission is not unsourced, I included the URL on the parliament web site in the deletion template. Until an admin is able to review our dispute, the tag should be left intact on the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Image%7EOfficialPhoto.jpg_6f75.html" title="Image:OfficialPhoto.jpg">image:OfficialPhoto.jpg</a> page. If you read the template, instructions for disputing the claim are included. Imagine how you would feel if I was deleting your response to my submission. As for your talk page, you have a welcome to wikipedia template at the top of the page. This template is usually placed on the talk pages of new users. If you find my assumption insulting, you may want to consider removing the welcome maessage as it gives the impression that you're a new user. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 00:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not avoiding anything. I don't remember how I came to that page. I probably just put OfficialImage.jpg into google. How the page was found is moote anyway, the point is we have a web page that disputes the copyright. You have an alleged letter from the PMO, but nothing from The House of Commons. Saying the PMO owns the property of the Crown is like saying that Dalton Mcguinty's office owns all of the parks in Ontario. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 00:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I took at look at your web site, it's a nice collection of photographs. I really don't know much about how the copyright would apply to the images on your site. The point I am making here is that we have two pages, on the same web site, that claim two different copyrights. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying wikipedia admin staff should review this image as I believe the policy of wp implies this image doesn't belong. I'm also saying that the release needs to come from the House of Commons and the matter of Herman Chung needs to be resolved. If they believe they own the rights, they should update the page I have referenced. At a minimum this creates ambiguity that needs to be resolved. My recommendation would be to take a photo of Harper at a public event and include it in place of the one we are disputing. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a>

<dd>I don't care if it's a nice collection of photos. My point stands. You're the one reverting the proper website to the one you want because you found it on a simple google search.

<dd>I nominated the image for copyvio because there was some discussion leading in this direction. The two users, ViriiK and Arctic Gnome have been modifying the posting and removing the template. The policy clearly states they are not supposed to do this. I warned them because instead of allowing the process to continue, they are trying to disrupt it. I have made several attempts to get the attention of admins to try and resolve this dispute. No one responds. Everything I have read on wp implies that copyright violations are serious.

<dd>Yet you keep going ahead lying about the fact that the Office of the Prime Minister declared "Yes, it is the freely-licensed official image. Please use that one." and the Library and Archives Canada corroborates the Office as the copyright holder.
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I have no idea what's going on here. I haven't lied to anyone. I tagged an image because of a copyright dispute I observed. This is not an unreasonable thing for me to do. I'm not saying that you're wrong. I am just saying there is more than one claimant for the copyright. I approached this image from a neutral point of view. The first URL I found from google stated it was copyright of Herman Chung. If you would just be patient and stop fighting with me, the issue will resolve itself in due course. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 07:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For some reason you seem to think this is some kind of civil court case between you and I. Why are you so opposed to letting the deletion process take its course? You make a great case for keeping the image and I have no idea what they're going to do with it. I usually take my own pictures and upload them to avoid these kinds of disputes. It seems that someone has already replaced this image with an alternative in the Harper article, so what's the big concern? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:02, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that you refuse to accept other parties as the copyright holder and you're stuck on Herman Chung because of an outdated page <b>you found on Google</b>. The Library and Archives Canada shows that the Office of the Prime Minister is the copyright holder and the email corroborates the free-use of the image on wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriiK_838b.html" title="User:ViriiK">ViriiK</a> 08:04, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ok, since you want to have this discussion and I have read the information you provided, let's talk about it. If you review the url <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-December/059214.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-December/059214.html" rel="nofollow">provided link for edit</a>]. You will notice the editor is citing a persons response in a discussion thread. They are not citing the consensus of a group, but a mere remark of one of the mail list contributors. How do you suggest this represents consensus to change the <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">wp:v</a> policy? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:02, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As not a change, but a slight clarification. Before that edit, the policy read: <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, <b>not truth</b> "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source. Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</i> Ergo, we report what other primary and secondary sources report, and attribute their ideas, whether they're erroneous or not. The thread and the comment are a slightly humorous way of summarizing the standard that is currently being applied, so it isn't a change that affects the spirit of the policy. The consensus for the change was already there, as the idea was already there. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 09:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I see your point of view. I would have discussed any change on the talk page first, but maybe I'm too cautious. I will spectate in this case and see how this edit turns out. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:11, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even a reversion and asking WAS 4.250 on his talk page would have been all right, but what really <i>offended</i> me, to be honest, was the reversion <i>as vandalism</i>. Wikipedia operates based on <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">the assumption of good faith</a> in other editors, and most of the time, editors make modifications to pages in an effort to improve the pages, not to harm them. Let's say that you had been the one who posted the link, and added the sentence to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and someone else had accused you of vandalism.</dd>
<dd>How would you have reacted? It probably would have caused a conflict. That's what I asked you from the beginning: to not accuse editors like that. Work on that, and you'll see that you won't run into many problems around here.

<dd>At first glance it appeared to be vandalism. As it is an important policy I acted quickly. What I don't understand is why you took to arguing with me about it here when the user I reverted made no comment. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:24, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have no grudge with you. There is nothing wrong with making sure copyright checks out. I just think that in the case of the PM picture you are being <i>way</i> too cautious because of one inconsistent webpage. You should accept the word of governments and other big organizations as reliable sources. In the <i>very</i> unlikely case that they are lying, we will have had just cause to think that copyright checks out, so no fault on us. Let no one say that you aren't willing to see a project through to the end; I'd be glad to have you on WP:Canada. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> 08:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I've lost faith in your ability to perform useful mediation in the above dispute. In particular, I've been waiting weeks now for something -- anything -- to happen. Several times you seem to have found reasons not to proceed, in each case these issues vanished and yet nothing further happened. At this point I'm no longer happy. Perhaps this is just because of my own misunderstandings about the process, but whether it is my fault or yours, I no longer have confidence in you.</p>
<p>I'd like it if someone else could be found to handle this dispute, and, if at all possible given how long it has been waiting, if someone could be found <b>quickly</b>.</p>
<p>Please note that I can be reached by email, and that I prefer that for dealing with matters that require rapid attention. --<a href="../../../p/m/e/User%7EPmetzger_45a4.html" title="User:Pmetzger">Pmetzger</a> 19:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

He promptly filed the mediation when he didn't like the results of the RfC, posting on my talk page that he would "happily take this to official mediation and arbitration if necessary."(<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na&amp;diff=98531140&amp;oldid=98531028" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na&amp;diff=98531140&amp;oldid=98531028" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) His statement, summation and request completely misrepresented the situation and contained insults.

<p><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080"><i>Hi Aeon, thank-you for your message on my page. For future reference, you might encourage someone who finds something I do problematic or obscure to get in touch with me, since I don't think there is any need for advocacy here. I did, I admit, do a "drive-by" sourcing for Judy Marsales, a Member of the Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Hamilton, Ontario. This sourcing can be seen more or less in this diff. I also left my opinion on the talk page about whether or not the article should include a reference to Marsales vote against a private member's bill about property taxes on the basis of on article. (You can see the description of the proposal in the last line of Tim Hudak.) In our system, private members' bills have no chance of passing, especially on matters of taxation. Voting for or against it is hardly news-worthy, much less wikipedia-worthy, and as far as I can see the bill only merits a single-line in its proposer's biography and reaction to it is found in no other MPP's article. It's clearly doesn't belong, and you should ask Alan to go find some other similar reference to a private member's votes in any other Canadian politicians' biographies. I think if he finds one in another such article, he'll see how out-of-place they seem. But most of all, I think you should encourage Alan not to resort to your advocacy until he's attempted a good one-on-one exchange with another editor.

If I (not being from that area or country) looked her up for some reason I would really not be interested in an individual vote (and nor would most people doing that kind of reasearch). While it is great that you want to make the article the most precise it could be, a admittedly very minor fact would not really add to the article in question. I would have to agree that it really doesn't warrant inclusion into the article (Speaking again as a neutral party).

<p><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">I'm not offended in anyway by your comments. However, I think the same could be said of the entire article lacking International interest, yet somehow it warrants inclusion. I guess I feel that this fact seems to be fitting into a hole between inclusion and deletion.

<dd><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">I agree with you on the inclusion policy. However, if we allow an article to exist that probably should not, we must apply the same criteria to including facts as we did for including the article. In this case, I have a news article reporting a vote affecting a law for the province of Ontario that was poorly received by her constituents. If we are to consistently apply the inclusion policy, either what I am proposing should be included or all of the other cited facts will need to be removed leaving no article at all.

<p><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">So far it has been a 50/50 split, I have had two supporters for inclusion and CJCurrie has had two supporters for exclusion. I will trust your judgment, if you think I should just leave it out, I will move on. The reason I have held on to this issue so tightly is that I don't think this encyclopedia is going to make much progress if we don't follow some kind of guidelines. These guidelines must be applied consistently. I feel that if I let go of this one fact for inclusion, I am supporting that any editor can remove any fact they don't like without citing any guidelines that apply. I have been on the other side of this argument many times supporting deletion of content and almost every time we err on the side of inclusion if the fact is supported by reliable sources. My understanding is the correct way to resolve this for an opponent to this verifiable fact is to include another contrary finding to balance the article. The vote itself is verifiable as it is recorded in the public record of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Further, the newspaper article verifies this vote as well. The opinion portion of it, I can understand the opposition somewhat, but I cannot see a good argument as to why the vote itself cannot be included. If you can show me what guideline inclusion of this vote violates, I would be willing to let this go. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 20:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</font></font></p>

It has been very successful over at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Former_Country_11eb.html" title="Template:Infobox Former Country">Template:Infobox_Former_Country</a>. The problem with infobox city is that it is an old and very used template. In order for this to work you would need to have the fields (in this case km2) entered in without any puncuation, no commas, no spaces, nothing. Some of the U.S. Cities have sq miles entered in before the square kilometers; i.e. this is on one line, in one field total area. If everything is not perfect, then you will get an error expression. Also, the numbers in the fields would be automatically formatted with a comma every three spaces and some people prefer a space and visa-versa. Due to the amount of pages that use infobox city template, changing the total area field to no punctuation and only km2 may be more work than it is worth, but it is worth a look. —<a href="../../../m/j/c/User%7EMJCdetroit_76e3.html" title="User:MJCdetroit">MJCdetroit</a> 15:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</font></font>

<dd><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">Follow-Up: There are about 3,500 pages that use the infobox city template. If a small group of editors were to prep all those pages, then the the automatic conversion could be installed very easily. By prep, I mean removing any puncuation or superscripts or anything that is not numbers from the desired field. For example if total_area= 11,000 then it would have to be changed to 11000. Editor comments seem to be OK. It is not the template but the prep work itself that would be the hard work. I don't know if AWB would be helpful in this either. I would probably take 30-40 second per page. I think in the long-run auto-conversion would be the best way to go. —<a href="../../../m/j/c/User%7EMJCdetroit_76e3.html" title="User:MJCdetroit">MJCdetroit</a> 21:30, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

I tested this field in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Ontario_a636.html" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>'s Infobox City. Ultimately we would modify the template to only do the calculation if the corresponding unit field was empty while the other was provided. However, I'm not certain if there is anyway to check that the input is valid before rendering a conversion. Possibly there is a way to test that the conversion is correct before displaying it. This would allow us to provide nothing in the space if the conversion was unsuccessful. I think I'm going to move this discussion to the talk page of the template.

Yesterday, I play with an autoconversion parameter in my template sandbox. It works well. Although, I am not sure what you mean by saying "check to say if the conversion is correct". It is going to convert the way that it is told to everytime and that's the easy part. You know the old computer saying garbage in-garbage out! The way we did it at another template was to always have the metric units entered in and always convert to imperial.

As the discussion on <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITY_31e4.html" title="WP:CITY">WP:CITY</a> was about your linking to these articles, I figured a debate on if those articles should be included would be a good first step. I think you may need to consider where you draw the line between a Cable Company that warrants inclusion and one which does not. If I started providing Internet to my neighbors, would I warrant inclusion? Please also consider the international importance. As well, when your edits are centered on Cable Companies it seems like agenda pushing when you start editing City articles with your only contribution as the addition of this information. Having said that, I appreciate your polite tone in discussing these matters. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 20:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</font></font>

<dd><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">As for my contribution to city pages, those edits proceeded by my first compiling a list of cities serviced (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northland_Communications_Corporation_b1f5.html" title="Northland Communications Corporation">Northland Communications Corporation</a>, or <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediacom.html" title="Mediacom">Mediacom</a> for an even more extensive example) and then following those links and adding a return wikilink to the cable utility.

I think you had an idea to add this content as a good faith contribution. However, I think including this information in City articles blindly is not appropriate. The policy of Wikipedia these days seems to be on the side of article inclusion for anything that isn't offensive or grossly incorrect. You will probably not find much opposition to your Cable Company Articles, but you might find yourself in hot water again by inserting them list style into connected articles.

In my understanding of the two terms, Serbian refers to a Serb specifically from, or living in Serbia, while Serb means someone who is an ethnic Serb but not necessarily from Serbia (ex: might be from Bosnia). Being someone from the Balkans, I always found the confusion between these 2 terms interesting. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 05:36, 12 February 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">I saw that one of your comments concerning sub-sections. From my perspective, I don't believe that changing the formatting is possible given that such sub-sectioning for city articles is now almost the norm (see <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville%2C_Kentucky_392f.html" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>). When it comes to sub-sectioning, are you more in favor of those seen at several non-US city articles (e.g. those in India) that do not use sub-sections? Personally, the idea of sub-sectioning is to <i>improve</i> readability, and some areas (e.g. culture and geography/climate) demand it for organization purposes.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">I appreciate it when people give suggestions on article improvement, but it becomes a problem when someone is bound to one thing without willing to hear out another person's opinion on a particular matter. I am hoping this is not the case and that any suggestions will further improve the article rather than lead to an edit war and/or more arguments.

<li><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">I am totally flexible on all article development concepts. One of the problems with all of these sub headings is that it creates a long TOC. As well, when I read these sub-sections, I often find incomplete paragraphs. It also seems common that the long sections containing these subjections would be better served by forking to a dedicated article on that subject while keeping a good summary in the main article. Admittedly, the Ann Arbor article isn't the worst offender. Here's a thought to ponder: Why create a <i>Geography and Climate'</i> section, just to create two subjections basically about <i>Geography</i> and <i>Climate</i>? Would it not seem more sensible to create a <i>Geography</i> and <i>Climate</i> main section separately? How about condensing the entire section with subjections down to 3 to 4 well written paragraphs under one heading? This discussion really should be taking place at <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITY_31e4.html" title="WP:CITY">WP:CITY</a> to get broader input. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 11:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</font></font>

<li><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">I took your suggestions into consideration. For now, I think the two sections that should retain sub-section headings are culture and infrastructure (this is a personal preference, since these topics are fairly broad and cannot be summarized into three to four paragraphs in an adequate manner). Also, I noticed that you believe Boston has similar problems (most of which I have addressed), though you did not seem to have similar concerns on the other articles I mentioned (particularly Seattle and Louisville). Is there a reason for that out of curiosity? <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="../../../p/e/n/User_talk%7EPentawing_dadc.html" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 22:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</font></font>

<li><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">Given that it doesn't appear likely that we will be reaching an agreement concerning sub-sections in city articles in the near future (e.g. &lt; 1 week) before the Ann Arbor FAR is automatically closed, I have proposed to do the following: I will be posting this issue on the WikiProject Cities talk page and attempt to gain feedback and hopefully have a consensus reached concerning a proper policy for sub-sectioning. Since this will take time, I am also proposing that the FAR for Ann Arbor be declared closed in favor of the article's maintaining its FA status (given that the other issues, in my view, have been addressed and corrected). Given that such a policy can have a major impact on all city articles (notably for those which are FA or are achieving FA status), it would be the most prudent to gain greater feedback on the matter. At the same time, the Ann Arbor article will continue to maintain its FA status until the issue is finally resolved by the larger community. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="../../../p/e/n/User_talk%7EPentawing_dadc.html" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 03:29, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</font></font></li>

Nevertheless, I am leaving the post on the WikiProject Cities talk page in hopes of getting a final consensus concerning sub-sections in articles. In the meantime, you have not yet answered one question that I have presented: why focus on only the Ann Arbor and Boston articles while not bothering with the Seattle and Louisville articles? I am not trying to be judgmental or accuse you of something, but unless you can give a reason the lack of similar comments for the other two articles to me is very telling. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="../../../p/e/n/User_talk%7EPentawing_dadc.html" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 00:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</font></font></li>

<p><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">Hi, sorry, you're right. I had missed how old those merge discussions had been dead. My primary concern, however, was that these are not really proddable articles. AFD is a more fitting venue for both, in my opinion, since it might bring the article to the attention of someone who can improve it, save it, or do the merge. (As a matter of policy, you shouldn't re-prod an article, even if you think the reasoning was erroneous.)

<ul>
<li><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">It's no big deal really, I'm sure we're both trying to keep the improvements moving here. The reason some of us use the prod tag is in cases where we believe an AfD would be a waste of community time considering the state of the article. I prod a very low percentage of articles relative to the number which I merge. I reverted your edit on the one article because it was clear that your reason for removing the prod did not apply to that page. It wasn't a matter of opinion, it was a fact, you had referred to a merge discussion that wasn't occurring. I could only assume, as the <a href="../../../e/s/_/WP%7EES_f020.html" title="WP:ES">WP:ES</a> was verbatim the same as another prod you had removed that it may have been a mistake on your part. Was it in fact a mistake on your part? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 16:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</font></font></li>

<li><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">Yes, as I said, I was mistaken in the reason that I *gave*, but as is often the case, the edit summary reflects only a small portion of one's thinking on a subject. In this case, I don't think this is a suitable article for a prod and would remove it regardless.

<dd><font color="#000080"><font color="#000080">Strictly speaking, I don't have to give a reason, I merely have to remove the template. The point here is the article seems to me as borderline-enough that someone might actually decide it's keepable or mergeable. Those kinds of cases should go to AFD, not PROD. Now, I expect that it would fail at AFD, as most articles do, and I might&#160;!vote delete at AFD myself.
