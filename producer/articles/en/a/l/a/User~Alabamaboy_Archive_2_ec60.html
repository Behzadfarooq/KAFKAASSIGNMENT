You've volunteered to do housekeeping duties that normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops can't do a lot of stuff: They can't delete pages just like that (except patent nonsense like "aojt9085yu8;3ou"), and they can't protect pages in an edit war they are involved in.

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">How you doing? I couldn't help but to check out your user page after reading your comments on the Miguel Piñero talk page. I must admit that I am very impressed with your work on African-Americans, especialy the African-American literature. I read one of your articles and I found it very good reading. I admire the fact that you want people to know about the contributions of the African-American the same way that I want people to know about the contributions Puerto Ricans have made. Good job. Oh, by the way it wasn't my intention to block Dali because of the dispute (even though it may have seemed that way), I really thought he broke the three revert rule. It was my dumb mistake and I'm glad that he was unblocked.

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Congratulations on your nomination. However, before I throw in my vote, I want to be sure if you are up to being an admin. From what I saw with other users, an admin is immediately thrusted into the internal politics of Wikipedia, with some admins actually leaving because of the strain. Hence, if you could convince me that you are up to it, then I would not hesitate to support your candidacy (you accepted nomination, which implies that you are willing to face the great responsibilities of being an admin.

<dd>Actually, while the <a href="http://www.asq.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.asq.org/" rel="nofollow">American Society for Quality</a> is a nonprofit, it is a "commercial content provider" (as stated on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_c969.html#Articles" title="Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Candidates_for_speedy_deletion#Articles</a>) because it offers, in it's own words, "technologies, concepts, tools, and training to quality professionals, quality practitioners, and everyday consumers." <a href="http://www.asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This content is only provided for a cost. I was very careful when I looked at deleting this article and only did so b/c it was less than 48 hours old, from the website of an organization providing commercial content, and met all the other criteria.

<dd>The American Society for Quality is certainly not in the business of selling the biographies of those who are invited to speak at one of their conferences. Taking so broad an interpretation of "commercial content provider" would make anything appearing on the web page of nearly any company to be speediable. If you read the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_Proposal_Blatant_copyvio_material_e970.html#A_version_I.27d_like" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion/Proposal/Blatant copyvio material">proposal that led to this specific wording</a> you'll see that it was crafted specifically to avoid this idea.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the exact same biography appears on the web page of another conference <a href="http://www.psqtconference.com/2001east/WedSessions1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psqtconference.com/2001east/WedSessions1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> strongly implies that the ASQ does not own the copyright to this bio at all. It may well have been written by Mr. McCabe himself and provided to both of these organizations, and not beyond the realm of possibility that he also posted it to Wikipedia himself. Compare the first revision of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hewitt_103a.html" title="Carl Hewitt">Carl Hewitt</a>, which was also a bioblurb that appears next to his name as a speaker at several conferences (as well as the Stanford page I cited in the copyvio template). As it happens, in that case it <i>was</i> the subject of the article who wrote the blurb, provided it to the conferences, and posted it to Wikipedia. It is exactly this sort of situation that a week of limbo on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> is intended to catch.</dd>

<dd>I do owe you an apology for assuming you hadn't checked, though. Stretching of the speedy criteria is one of the few things that truly bothers me on Wikipedia, and this one's a particular sore point (I was one of only six who opposed it). My blood pressure goes up whenever I see "copyvio?" show up as the comment in the deletion log, and I find articles improperly tagged for A8 nearly every time I can bring myself to look at <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>. (The most recent was Sunatori.com, despite them selling pens, not <i>advertisements</i> for them. The most ridiculous was F L Dunkin Wedd, whose source was a personal geocities webpage.)

<p>First, I aggree that the FARC was too soon after promotion - see the specific FARC's talk page. I speedy de-listed it and tried to convince the nominator to hold off. I also asked for assistance from Raul, the FA director, but was ignored (either because he din not object to the FARC going forward, or he did not care). When other users expressed a desire for the FARC to go forward, there was little I could do.</p>
<p>As for the article being de-featured, I stand by my decision. I believe consensus was reached (although consensus is not always used with FAs). FAs must live up to a higher standard, and even a slight consensus is enough to warrant defeaturing, especially considering that it can take only <i>one</i> actionable objection to sink an FAC full of supports.</p>
<p>Deryck C. did address some of the concerns raised, notably the copyvio stuff, yes, but that was only a small part of the issue. Once Deryck feels the article is up to snuff, he should take it through the FAC process again (he can do it now if he wants). --Jeffrey O.

However, after seeing how she was treated in the recent RfC, I must admit she is correct. While there are many good editors on Wikipedia who are pushing to correct these problems, there are many more who push racist and biased agendas. As such, I am taking an extended leave from editing Wikipedia in protest of this environment and, hopefully, to draw attention to this issue.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 18:42, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was saddened to see this note pop up on my watchlist. I wander into African-American lit articles myself every now and again, so I've long been following your work with admiration, and I was very happy to see you make admin last month.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's no doubting that racism's a problem in Wikipedia (and certainly was in Deecee's RfC) but I'd hate to see us lose you over it, even for a limited period, just as I'm absolutely furious that we seem to have lost Deecee. For starters, I'll miss y'all personally (as a lit student myself I refer to your Shakespeare and Af-Am lit articles often), but more to the point, it hands over one of the most popular information sources in the world to exactly the people who shouldn't have it. While the Systemic Bias on WP is infuriating, it's also the fastest way to fight systemtic bias on the web as a whole, I think; a lot of our African history and language coverage, for example, exists <b>nowhere</b> else on the English-language web. I suspect the same is true with many of your African-American lit articles, and I hope you won't long let these folks stand in the way of the good work you're doing. It's an <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Thermopylae_fd42.html" title="Battle of Thermopylae">uphill fight</a> but I think one well worth fighting and making sure we win.</dd>

<dd>I think you're making a mistake by leaving for an extended period of time. Racism needs to be confronted, its the only way to stop it. The racists want you to leave they won't shed any tears. You should stay and draw attention to the subject, I have repeatedly threatened to leave and all it does is cause a temporary out burst of activity. People respond for a little while, but ultimately go back to business as usual. The best thing to do is to stay and keep chiping away at the problem, that's the only thing that every really does.

<dd>Maybe <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim">User:JuanMuslim</a> is right; a <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_Wikipedia_Boycott_Campaign_b2fb.html" title="User:JuanMuslim/Wikipedia Boycott Campaign">boycott on Wikipedia</a> seems radical, and considering I have not been editing so much lately gives light to the fact that I don't feel that I have done anything useful on Wikipedia as I have not gotten an RfA or a featured article in the past year. So, I stopped wanting to be one here so much anyway (as you see, my 1,814 contribs. in October were followed by less than 400 in November). I do want to make <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_of_Jesus_a3f3.html" title="Race of Jesus">this article</a> a featured one and get it on the front page, though. Wikipedia's recent controversies are only giving it bad air, so if you do decide to protest that racism is haunting the site (which it most certainly is) you will help put it under (although I don't think you should). So my idea is to present a petition or something of that nature to a higher governing power on Wikipedia. If that doesn't work someone should spread that message as the Seigenthaler incident has been done. However, I truly don't want to conspire against Wikipedia, so I am planning to simply cut back on editting and just try to help when and where I can. I think we need someone like the ArbCom to look into this, (I don't know if they have or not). But if no one listens, it may need to be some type of scandal. I don't know, I guess this argument is just muttered gibberish right about now?

<dd>Personally, I think Wikipedia is an excellent tool for educating the general public and one of the better sources of info on the web (which is why I laugh when I hear people complain about Wikipedia being inaccurate, because they are forgetting that at least Wikipedia is more accurate than most web info sources). That said, I do think racism and systemic bias here needs to be addressed. I initially thought a protest or something might help but all that does is let the racists continue to edit while we turn our heads. Perhaps a petition would be a useful tool, as would bringing in ArbCom. In the end, though, you are probably correct. Perhaps a scandal is needed. Bet if the mainstream media believed hard-core racists are using Wikipedia for their own ends and wrote about it the issue would be dealt with quickly.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 20:33, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I must admit that I have never taken the time to actual try to research do in depth research (very bad, I know) unless I can find another source of the internet. I know to not do stupid things like going to a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathroom_Reader_00fd.html" title="Bathroom Reader">Bathroom Reader</a> to create an article like I used to (that is how <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Ketchum_65bb.html" title="Tom Ketchum">this got screwed up</a>). I definately don't put any effort when I write articles so much either (not NEARLY as much as I do on school papers or personal ones which I do very well on). But I want to create one really good article before the year is up. That means I am going to treat that one like a school paper once I get the opportunity, and remember, I really never have done that here before. I am definately guilty of writing articles in five minutes without thinking twice, it is time for me to do better, and for the past weeks I have been going back to improve the old "Bathroom Reader" articles of mine, and others. But I know I can get this to a Featured Article, I have usually get A's on papers in college, I had 96 percentile on a national writing component, so I definately feel embarassed about some of my past crap here... BUT IT SHALL CHANGE SOON!!!! Anyway, thanks AB - glad to see you came back. <font color="#708090"><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">ε</a></b><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopedist_b147.html" title="User:Encyclopedist">γκυκλοπαίδεια</a><i><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">*</a></i></font> <font color="#708090"><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncyclopedist_baa9.html" title="User talk:Encyclopedist">(talk)</a></font> 16:53, 10 December 2005 (UTC) 21:57, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deeceevoice RfA</span></h2>
<p>I saw that you voted to accept the Deeceevoice RfA. While I disagree with you on this decision, it is yours to make. However, I am curious how the fact that an admin posted false info on the RfA prior to your vote, then admitted that this info was false, plays into your decision? (For more on this, see <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_deeceevoice_a845.html" title="User:Robchurch/deeceevoice">User:Robchurch/deeceevoice</a>. In my opinion, this RfA is a witchhunt and, like the RfC, has so devolved into nothing but a shouting match that I fail to see how anything can be decided from it. Finally, does your vote for acceptance mean you also are voting that Justforasecond is harassing Deeceevoice (as many users believe)?

<dd>My vote to accept is based only on apparent violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. I can see there is a lot of nonsense involved here, probably on both sides. I am distressed by the low level of participation in Wikipedia of all minorities (other than Chinese) and prepared to make some accommodation, but frankly I think we are dealing with someone who is routinely violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><span class="mw-headline">harrassment</span></span></h2>
<p>Alabamaboy,</p>
<p>I do not understand how you, or anyone, can support deeceevoice in light of her comments. Most recently she described me as starting a "lynch party" complete with kerosene, etc.</p>
<p>Put yourself in my shoes.</p>
<ol>
<li>She's violated as many policies as I can see (we'll have to avoid arguing this one)</li>
<li>Been asked cordially to desist</li>
<li>Responded nastily ("deleted without reading")</li>
<li>Been served an RfC</li>
<li>Refused to respond nastily (mealy mouthed brats, etc...)</li>
<li>Been served an RfA</li>
<li>Tears into me with claims about lynchings, tears into wikipedia overall as some huge racist organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>How would you feel if she had written about your being a racist murderer, who held a picnic while lighting people on fire? As if that's not enough, when I go to the noticeboard and see you are there trying to start a "check user" towards me -- as if I'm some sort of repeat vandal. What is your issue with me? I am following wikipedia policy as well as possible. There is one bad African-American editor here that, as far as I can tell, has violated numerous policies. I've filed an RfAr to determine if this is the case, and you are indicting me as a racist harrasser. If there is something, *anything* you want me to do, please tell me. I will remove any comment, address any edit, revert any bad blood, anything I have done, other than this filing against deeceevoice.</p>
<p>How is what I've done racist here? This is the prescribed wikipedia policy. How is it harrassment to file an RfAr and inform users about it? Isn't this how things are supposed to proceed? Is it harrassment to report an offensive page that has already been deleted by well-intentioned admins? I hope you don't believe that merely filing an RfAr is racist in itself. Throughout all of this if I have broken any policy I'm happy to adjust my behavior. I removed notices about the RfC from article talk pages when other editors objected, and I haven't been anything but polite to most folks, with the possible exception of the guy that said "cry me a river white boy" and his friends that insisted it was not racist. I've had discussions with Encyclopedist, Jcarriker, Dyvost (sorry I don't know the spelling) which have been cordial. If you really think this is harrassment, *PLEASE* explain to me how it fits the wikipedia definition (and point me to the wikipedia definition). Nowhere on the dispute resolute pages did it say that pursuing an RfAr might qualify.</p>
<p>If you want to file an RfC against me, I can't stop you. You have more friends than I do, but I expect it will look pretty bad. You've asked another user to sign on to this negotation with me (to which he wrote two words) and you are calling me a racist. As far as I can tell, you're using this term just because I've filed an RfAr against your friend.</p>
<p>As you know, the RfA will fail if it is groundless. If she's a good editor, it will fade away, and wikipedia will be all the better for the clarification of behavioral standards. If it passes, then I guess I wasn't such a bad guy after all. So please, lay off.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm taking a break. It seems the RfAs take a while to get rolling, and I can't deal with everyone calling me a racist for now. I'll check my talk page for your response, but I'm not going to touch any deeceevoice related issues until the evidence phase.</p>

<p>Alabamaboy, please stop implying (or stating) that I am a racist. If there is something I've said, please tell me so I can adjust it. If your only claim against me is that I have filed an RfAr, informed relevant parties, and filed a notice on the AN, I don't think you've got much of a leg to stand on. Your endorsement of phrases like "cry me a river, white boy" and very strong support of a user that uses "crakkka" frequently makes it increasingly difficult to assume good faith here.</p>

<dd>As you stated in your message above, "I can't deal with everyone calling me a racist for now." Obviously this statement means a lot of other people see racism in your actions. That said, I have merely stated that your actions seem like harassment and that it is possible that race has played into your actions. I would love to be proved wrong about this and look forward to seeing you change the way you have been acting. After all, actions speak louder than words.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 18:08, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
