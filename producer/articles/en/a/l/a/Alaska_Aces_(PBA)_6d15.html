Alaska Milk Corporation of American owner Wilfred Uytengsu was accepted as the league's sixth team before the start of the 1986 season in April. Alaska acquired several holdovers from the old Magnolia team (Marte Saldana, Rudy Distrito and Biboy Ravanes among others) for their inaugural campaign.</p>
<p>Alaska's imports for the 1986 Reinforced Conference were former <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Jazz_5c87.html" title="Utah Jazz">Utah Jazz</a> Jerry Lee Eaves and former <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Basketball_Team_99b2.html" title="Toyota Basketball Team">Toyota</a> import Donnie Ray Koonce.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_PBA_season_9489.html" title="1987 PBA season">1987</a>, Alaska Milk changed its name to the Hills Bros. Coffeemakers. After Manila Beer's disbandment, the Coffeemakers acquired Yoyoy Villamin to form a bruising tandem with Ricky Relosa, known as the "Bruise Brothers".</p>
<p>They also had former <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispa_Redmanizers_45ca.html" title="Crispa Redmanizers">Crispa</a> shooter William "Bogs" Adornado to banner the team, although the former three-time MVP was already slowing down at the time.</p>
<p>The All-Filipino saw the team finally jelling, with the emergence of the "Bruise Brothers" combination of Villamin and Relosa. It entered the Finals, where it got swept 3-0 by Great Taste Coffee. Despite the sweep, it was a brutal, physical Finals series with Villamin and Relosa being matched up against Great Taste's "Royal Brothers" Abe King and "Prince" Philip Cezar.</p>
<p>By virtue of its runner-up finish, Hills Bros. participated in the first PBA-IBA World Championship Cup. It finished third, behind the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> Cougars (which had future Alaska import Sean Chambers in its line-up) and Great Taste Coffee.</p>
<p>Reinforced Conference saw Hills Bros. parading a sweet-shooting import by the name of Jose Slaughter. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">October 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> in a game which Hills Bros. won over Great Taste 129-115, Jose Slaughter scored 79 points, the most ever scored by an Alaska/Hills Bros. player in a game. He also scored 14 three point field goals.</p>
<p>The team also made the Finals, losing however to the Bobby Parks-reinforced <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel Beermen</a> 4-1.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Villamin and Relosa would be named the All-Defensive team. Villamin would also be named most improved player, the same award won by Ricky Relosa the year before. Nat Canson and former <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanduay_Rhum_Masters_5fd1.html" title="Tanduay Rhum Masters">Tanduay</a> bench tactician Turo Valenzona were the team's head coach during the '87 campaign.</p>
<p>After the year, Adornado announced his <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retirement.html" title="Retirement">retirement</a> from the league, his jersey no. 33 was retired and was hung in the rafters of the ULTRA during the opening of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> season. He was first player in Alaska/Hills Bros franchise to have his number retired and was later named as the team's coach. <a href="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=86&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1467" class="external autonumber" title="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=86&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1467" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Aces_%28PBA%29_6d15.html" title="Edit section: 1988-1990: Alaska Air Force">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1988-1990: Alaska Air Force</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_PBA_season_5699.html" title="1988 PBA season">1988</a>, the team reverted back to the Alaska name with the Air Force monicker. Some believe that the nickname was a sort of Uytengsu's support for the US soldiers that were based in <a href="../../../o/l/o/Olongapo.html" title="Olongapo">Olongapo</a> at that time.</p>
<p>The Air Force finished third place in both the Open and All-Filipino Conferences but failed to place more than fourth in the season-ending Reinforced Conference.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_PBA_season_e028.html" title="1989 PBA season">1989</a>, Alaska acquired three players in what many believed as the richest drafts in league history. Bong Alvarez, Ric-Ric Marata and Boy Cabahug were taken from the draft. Same as a year before, Alaska won two third place trophies in the Open and Reinforced Conferences.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_PBA_season_e028.html" title="1989 PBA season">1989</a>, American <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Cone_e4c1.html" title="Tim Cone">Earl Timothy Cone</a> became the new coach of the Air Force after Adornado was fired during the season (owner Uytensu coached a won ballgame for the team). The year also saw the debut of Sean Chambers as Alaska's import.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_PBA_season_a81e.html" title="1990 PBA season">1990</a>, Alaska advanced in the finals of the Third Conference against a young <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods</a> team. Their imports then were Carlos Clark and Chambers. After a 2-0 lead in the Best-of-five series, Alaska suffered one of the biggest collapses in league history as Purefoods won the next three games to win the title. The team had the top pick in the draft and grabbed Alex Araneta out of <a href="../../../a/t/e/Ateneo_Blue_Eagles_9f90.html" title="Ateneo Blue Eagles">Ateneo</a>. But in later years, Araneta was considered a bust and was out of the league by <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_PBA_season_7748.html" title="1997 PBA season">1997</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_PBA_season_2a06.html" title="1991 PBA season">1991</a>, Eugene Quilban joined Alaska from the rookie draft to bolster the Alaska squad. After a third-place showing in the All-Filipino, they returned to the finals of the Third Conference against crowd-favorite <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Barangay Ginebra Kings">Ginebra San Miguel</a> and former <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Lakers_c195.html" title="Los Angeles Lakers">Laker</a> Wes Matthews. Alvarez and his team dominated the series that saw them winning the series 3-1 for their first title in team history.</p>
<p>Jojo Lastimosa was acquired after being taken from Purefoods in a trade with Elmer Cabahug. Alvarez was then eased out of the team when his one-on-one style didn't suit the new offensive scheme being enforced by Tim Cone - the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangle_offense.html" title="Triangle offense">triangle offense</a>. Quilban later left Alaska for 7-Up, in which he led the team to a finals loss to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Cola_Panthers_c2f2.html" title="Pop Cola Panthers">Swift</a>. <a href="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=86&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=813" class="external autonumber" title="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=86&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=813" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Alaska managed one third place finish in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_PBA_season_3be4.html" title="1992 PBA season">1992</a>. In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_PBA_season_de49.html" title="1993 PBA season">1993</a> draft, the Milkmen drafted <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_Eastern_University_b72b.html" title="Far Eastern University">Far Eastern University</a> <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_guard.html" title="Point guard">point guard</a> Johnny Abarrientos, an energetic and exciting little man who can drive to the basket against taller opponents. The Milkmen never won a trophy during their '93 campaign.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_PBA_season_5d0a.html" title="1994 PBA season">1994</a>, Alaska acquired Bong Hawkins from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Sta._Lucia_Realtors_153d.html" title="Sta. Lucia Realtors">Sta Lucia</a> which helped "The Hawk" resurrect his career. Alaska lost to Purefoods in the Commissioner's Cup Finals. In the Governor's Cup, Alaska defeated Swift to win their third PBA title with Abarrientos, Lastimosa, Hawkins and import Sean Chambers leading the team.</p>
<p>Alaska made all it to the Finals of conferences of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_PBA_season_5e66.html" title="1995 PBA season">1995</a>. In the All-Filipino, they lost a seven-game tussle against <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Cola_Panthers_c2f2.html" title="Pop Cola Panthers">Sunkist</a>. In the rematch, the Ronnie Grandison led Juicers once again powered the Derrick Hamilton-led Alaska to win the Commissioner's Cup crown. But, in the Governor's Cup, the Milkmen overcame a 2-3 deficit to defeat <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel</a> in seven games with a strong performance by Lastimosa. Alaska also got Jeffrey Cariaso from the draft and added center Edward Juinio to the team.</p>

<p>In the All-Filipino Conference, the Milkmen defeated the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods TJ Hotdogs</a> team of <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Patrimonio_c4c1.html" title="Alvin Patrimonio">Alvin Patrimonio</a> and Jerry Codinera in five games. In the series-clincher, Jeffrey Cariaso was fouled in the final second on an inbound play. Cariaso sank both free-throws to seal Alaska's first title of the year.</p>
<p>Their toughest championship series was in the Commissioner's Cup Finals against a tough <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Turbo_Chargers_f45f.html" title="Shell Turbo Chargers">Formula Shell</a> team of Benjie Paras, Victor Pablo, and import Kenny Redfield. After six grueling games, the Milkmen captured the seventh and final game to win their fifth title in franchise history with Johnny Abarrientos, Jojo Lastimosa and Bong Hawkins leading the team alongside import Sean Chambers, who came in to replace Derrick Hamilton midway through the conference.</p>
<p>Chambers returned for Alaska in the Governor's Cup and for the eighth straight time since 1994, Alaska was back in the Finals against crowd-favorite <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Barangay Ginebra Kings">Ginebra San Miguel</a> who ousted sister team <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel</a> in the semis. But it was a one-sided affair as the Milkmen went to win the first three games of the series before defeating Ginebra in Game five to capture the feat.</p>
<p>By season's end, Hawkins, Lastimosa and Cariaso were included in the Mythical team while Abarrientos became the smallest man in PBA history to capture the coveted <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Basketball_Association_Most_Valuable_Player_award_371f.html" title="Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player award">Most Valuable Player award</a>.</p>

<p>Alaska suffered one of the biggest losses prior to the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_PBA_season_7748.html" title="1997 PBA season">1997</a> season when Jeffrey Cariaso signed with the rebuilding <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_N%27_Text_Phone_Pals_079e.html" title="Talk N' Text Phone Pals">Mobiline Phone Pals</a>. The Milkmen failed to enter the semis of the All-Filipino Cup. In the Commissioner's Cup, the first ten games of the tournament was bannered by former Ginebra import Sylvester Gray. He was eventually replaced by Kevin Holland and the Milkmen advanced to the Finals against <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Barangay Ginebra Kings">Gordon's Gin Boars</a>. The Boars took a 3-0 series lead but Alaska managed to win the next two games to cut the deficit to 3-2. However, Gordon's won Game Six as Alaska fell short again. In the Governor's Cup, they landed Kenneth Duremdes from <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Cola_Panthers_c2f2.html" title="Pop Cola Panthers">Pop Cola</a> and the 24 year old became a perfect replacement for Jeffrey Cariaso. Alaska, with Chambers once again as import, defeated Purefoods to win the title in five.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_PBA_season_8e47.html" title="1998 PBA season">1998</a>, Alaska dominated the All-Filipino Cup and took on San Miguel in the finals. The Beermen led 3-2 after a strong showing by Nelson Asaytono in game five. But, Alaska won the next two games to capture another title.</p>
<p>Dreadlocked wearing Devin Davis powered Alaska in the Commissioners Cup, winning Best Import honors. The team advanced to the finals in a rematch against the Beermen. Duremdes was named as the Best Player of the Conference while defeating San Miguel in six games for their ninth title despite losing Bong Hawkins to a season-ending injury.</p>
<p>Already, several people were hyping a possible 'Grand Slam II' for the team. But, with the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_Asian_Games_607e.html" title="1998 Asian Games">1998 Asian Games</a> set in December and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Cone_e4c1.html" title="Tim Cone">Cone</a> was named head coach, he tapped Abarrientos, Duremdes and Lastimosa to lead the Philippine team.</p>
<p>Assistants Jun Reyes and Dickey Bachmann took over for Alaska. But despite a strong showing by shooter Roel Gomez, the Milkmen failed to enter the semis of both the special <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_PBA_Centennial_Cup_c621.html" title="1998 PBA Centennial Cup">1998 PBA Centennial Cup</a> and the season-ending Governors Cup.</p>
<p>Duremdes was named the Most Valuable Player at the end of the year, the second Alaska Milkman to win the coveted individual award.</p>
<p>With the arrival of some talented Filipino-American cagers in the league, the Milkmen opted to stick with the same core for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_PBA_season_4486.html" title="1999 PBA season">1999</a> season. In the All-Filipino, the Milkmen was eliminated by expansion team <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanduay_Rhum_Masters_5fd1.html" title="Tanduay Rhum Masters">Tanduay</a> in the semis.</p>
<p>In the Commissioner's Cup, Devin Davis made his return to the team, but the young San Miguel team of Danny Ildefonso and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Seigle_4ebf.html" title="Danny Seigle">Danny Seigle</a> eliminated the Aces in five games. They finished third in the tournament.</p>
<p>Alaska advanced to the Finals of the Governor's Cup with Chambers at the helm but San Miguel led by Lamont Strothers defeated the Milkmen in six games despite Alaska getting an early 2-1 series lead.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_PBA_season_2362.html" title="2000 PBA season">2000</a>, Jojo Lastimosa was traded to Pop Cola as part of the team's future plan to rebuild. Alaska won their 10th PBA title at the expense of Purefoods in the All-Filipino Conference. Purefoods won Game one of this series but the Milkmen won the next four games to win the series.</p>
<p>The Milkmen failed to enter the Finals of the Commissioner's Cup after they were eliminated by Beermen in the semi-finals.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Aces_%28PBA%29_6d15.html" title="Edit section: 2000-Present: Alaska Aces">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2000-Present: Alaska Aces</span></h3>
<p>As part of the league's move to strengthen its marketing through the PBA Properties, Alaska adopted a new monicker in the Alaska Aces (incidentally, this was also a name of an <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Aces_cc5b.html" title="Alaska Aces">ice hockey team</a>) replaced its original logo and uniforms to a more cartoonish-look which they still have today. Despite the change, however, Alaska failed to reach the Finals of the Governor's Cup once again.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_PBA_season_e90c.html" title="2001 PBA season">2001</a> season, the Aces traded popular star Johnny Abarrientos to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Cola_Panthers_c2f2.html" title="Pop Cola Panthers">Pop Cola Panthers</a> for forward Ali Peek. In the draft, Alaska used the fifth pick to draft fil-am John Arigo. The Aces also signed Duremdes to a reported 48 million peso deal for seven years.</p>
<p>In the All-Filipino, the Aces were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Abarrientos and Pop Cola. In the Commissioners Cup, a strong showing by Peek gave defending champion San Miguel a fight but still loss in five games of the semis. In the Governors Cup, they were eliminated in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Chambers retired three games into the Governors Cup. In a simple ceremony, the Aces retired his #20 jersey, becoming the second player in team history to have his number retired.</p>
<p>Duremdes was borrowed to the national pool in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_PBA_season_d705.html" title="2002 PBA season">2002</a> and Lastimosa made his return to Alaska. The Aces, with Ron Riley and James Head as imports, advanced to the finals of the Governor's Cup against Purefoods. The Aces led 2-0 in the seven game series, but the TJ Hotdogs won the next three games. After Alaska tied it up in Game Six, Purefoods won Game seven to deny the Aces its 11th title. In the Commissioner's Cup, Ajani Williams and Head bannered the Aces but was eliminated by Talk N' Text in the semi-finals. Duremdes returned for the Aces in the All-Filipino and made it to the finals. After winning Game 1, the Aces lost the next three games to settle another runner-up finish.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_PBA_season_7a08.html" title="2003 PBA season">2003</a> PBA Draft, the league was shocked by the trade of Duremdes to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Sta._Lucia_Realtors_153d.html" title="Sta. Lucia Realtors">Sta. Lucia Realtors</a> for the fifth pick of the first round. This enabled Alaska to land Brandon Cablay to the team.</p>
<p>The Aces also hold the first overall pick in the draft and selected <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_La_Salle_University-Manila_759f.html" title="De La Salle University-Manila">De La Salle University-Manila</a> star <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_guard.html" title="Point guard">point guard</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Cortez_723c.html" title="Mike Cortez">Mike Cortez</a>, who was considered as the next great point guard in Alaska franchise following Abarrientos.</p>
<p>During halftime of their season opening game, Alaska retired Jojo Lastimosa's #6 jersey. During the offseason, Lastimosa announced his <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retirement.html" title="Retirement">retirement</a> after playing 15 seasons in the league. He is currently one of the team's assistant coaches.</p>
<p>In the All-Filipino, Alaska failed in its bid to enter the Finals as they were eliminated by Talk N' Text in a grueling five-game series.</p>
<p>In the Invitational tournament, Alaska had to play in the qualifying round to enter the tournament. The Aces swept the round to enter the tournament. They won all four games of the elimination round to make it to the semis. In a one-game showdown, Alaska defeated <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_Barako_56e2.html" title="Red Bull Barako">Red Bull Barako</a> to face <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca_Cola_Tigers_4151.html" title="Coca Cola Tigers">Coca Cola</a> in the Finals.</p>
<p>The Tigers won Game One of the series, but the Aces won the next two games to win their 11th PBA title, this time with a different set of players. Brandon Cablay was named as Finals MVP while Ali Peek won Best Player of the Conference honors.</p>
<p>In the Reinforced Conference, Alaska struggled in the tournament and was eliminated by Duremdes and Sta. Lucia in the quarters.</p>
<p>Alaska paraded former <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> journeyman Galen Young for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Fiesta Conference. The Aces placed second after the elimination round of the tournament. But, they failed to enter the semis of the said tournament winning only one game in three outings.</p>
<p>In the 2004-05, the Aces managed to finished fourth in the qualifying round. After eliminating <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air21_Express_e06a.html" title="Air21 Express">FedEx</a> in the Wild-Card phase, they were swept by San Miguel in the quarters. During the tournament, Arigo and Peek were shipped to Coca-Cola for Jeffrey Cariaso and Reynel Hugnatan. Bong Hawkins also made his return to the Aces, reuniting him with Cariaso, assistant coach Jojo Lastimosa and Cone.</p>
<p>Alaska hired Leon Derricks for the Fiesta Conference. However, he had inconsistent game and was replaced by former <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bulls_cb53.html" title="Chicago Bulls">Chicago Bull</a> Dickey Simpkins. The addition of Simpkins helped Alaska climbed into third at the end of the classification round. The Aces faced <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_Barako_56e2.html" title="Red Bull Barako">Red Bull Barako</a> in the semis, but Bryan Gahol's game-winner in Game three eliminated Alaska out of the tournament.</p>

The Aces also acquired the services of former Mobiline and Coca-Cola import Artemus "Tee" McClary for the Fiesta Conference.</p>
<p>After the Aces placed second behind Team Pilipinas, with Dela Cruz playing for the said team, the team was considered as one of the top contenders to win the upcoming season.</p>
<p>However, the Aces went on a slide after a good start. After Alaska blowing a 28-point lead and losing to the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods Chunkee Giants</a>, the team went on a downhill since. With McClary's decline starting to show, he was eventually replaced by Odell Bradley, who showed some impressive scoring outputs. However, Alaska still finished seventh in the classification phase with a 7-9 record.</p>
<p>The Aces swept Sta. Lucia in a best-of-three matchup in the wildcard phase before being swept in a best-of-five affair by eventual champion <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_Barako_56e2.html" title="Red Bull Barako">Red Bull Barako</a>.</p>
<p>Weeks before the start of the Philippine Cup, Alaska traded Brandon Cablay to San Miguel in exchange for veteran Nic Belasco. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the Aces traded Don Allado to Talk 'N Text for guard Willie Miller and forward John Ferriols. Alaska finished with a 9-7 record in the classifications, thus earning an outright berth in the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, the Aces defeated the Coca-Cola Tigers, with former Alaska star <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Abarrientos_5ef3.html" title="Johnny Abarrientos">Johnny Abarrientos</a> on the squad, 3-1. The opening game of the series saw Alaska winning on a last second three-pointer by Nic Belasco.</p>
<p>In the semi-finals against top-seed <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods Chunkee Giants</a>, the Aces led 3-1 and was a win away from a finals berth but failed to win all of the remaining games. Alaska would end the tournament on a winning note, capturing the third place trophy with a 102-95 win over San Miguel, their 12th third-place finish in team history.</p>
