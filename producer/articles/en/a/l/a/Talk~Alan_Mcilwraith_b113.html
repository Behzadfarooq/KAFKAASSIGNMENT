<p>Alan McIlwraith is a complete hoaxer, but he is now a famous hoaxer, since he's featured in national newspapers. Should his fame (or infamy) entitle him to a wikipedia page, or should it be suppressed because he's an idiot? I don't have an answer, just throwing it out for conjecture.</p>
<p>He probably deserves a mention now for his infamy,as he's mentioned in the papers etc. Just a brief footnote, nothing more. Is it possible to read the own self-indulgent article just for giggles? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBensonby_b5e2.html" title="User:Bensonby">Bensonby</a> 09:12, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, this is such a goodie. Frontpage news in the Daily Retard today.</p>

<dd>Dunno why it hit the news today - from the Daily Record articles, it looks like he annoyed his co-workers to the point they started digging themselves. But it's actually a pretty good example of how Wikipedia deals with hoaxes - patiently and carefully the first time, less patiently the second time, tagged for speedy within two minutes of creation the third time&#160;;-) See the Daily Record articles: <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16929538%26method=full%26siteid=66633%26headline=exclusive%2d%2dmeet%2dthe%2dreal%2dsir%2dwalter%2dmitty-name_page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16929538%26method=full%26siteid=66633%26headline=exclusive%2d%2dmeet%2dthe%2dreal%2dsir%2dwalter%2dmitty-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16929536%26method=full%26siteid=66633%26headline=mcilwraith%2ds%2dentry%2din%2dwikipedia-name_page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16929536%26method=full%26siteid=66633%26headline=mcilwraith%2ds%2dentry%2din%2dwikipedia-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I don't know if he's actually broken the law or is just sad and delusional.

<p>This should be kept up as it resulted in exposing two jokes for the price of one - McIlwraith, but also the Daily Retard, who tried to pass off as an "exclusive" something that's been available to all for free over the last 6 months. It's typical of that rag, fleecing others work off the net &amp; trying to pass it off as original. Any day now there will be an "Elvis is dead EXCLUSIVE!" headline from them - 14/4/2006</p>

<p>Why slag off the Daily Record? How many Internet users would do a search on a Sir Alan Mcilwraith when the original entry was live? You guys only deleted a fake entry. Well done, but Wikipedia does this everyday. A Wikipedia fake yes. However would anyone have known how far he went with the charade? In a word, no.</p>
<p>The Daily Record did have an exclusive because look at the amount of stories from people who worked with this head case or encountered them. It is a sad state of affairs that he was allowed to go about doing this, with his employers not checking out his background.</p>
<p>The press uncovered a man with serious problems, beyond the normal realms of fantasisers. The public had a right to know, especially those that worked with him.</p>
<p>Regardless of what some people think of the Daily Record, their information was 100% accurate in this case. If he wasn't rumbled by the press, Sir Alan would have continued his creepy life and who knows where it would end? If Dell or any of his employers in the past found out, he would have been sacked which then Alan could go somewhere else and continue the fraud.</p>
<p>He is an insult to anyone who died in conflict, and he abused the good work of several charities for his own ends.</p>
<ul>
<li>It might be 100% accurate technically, but it is also very easy to read incorrect inferrences. They say "The entry has now been pulled from Wikipedia" when they should say "the entry was pulled from Wikipedia six months ago, and was only up for five days". Very different connotations - it gives the impression we only pulled it after they noticed. Yes, they actually stopped him - it never occured to me that someone would try to pull such a weak fake in real life, rather than just over the safety of the internet, and in that I congratulate them.

<p>Guys, Alan had a 2nd entry in Feb 2006 I believe, which was similar to the October 2005 entry. Nobody who worked with him knew about the original entry that contained the UN Speech, the apparent intervention to stop an act of terrorism in London and last but not least the Sandhurst yarn about the faces. I didnt rumble him to the press, however from my sources nobody knew about the Oct 2005 entry. Alan showed off the Feb 2006 entry at the call centre. So whoever rumbled him must have shown that entry to the paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>He put it up at 10:53 and it was marked as nonsense at 10:55. That isn't exactly a huge amount of time. He must have put it up and printed it out immediately. If they'd looked him up on Wikipedia they'd have seen he thought he was a fake (or at least wondered why the article was no longer there). <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 16:47, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article had no history until it was unprotected and therefore the Guardian and others didn't have access to the information we do now, with Average Earthman spotting the original hoax within a few days; hence the problem came out of the way the article had been protected to hide its history, ie it was wikipedia's fault and not that of the newspapers. If they'd had the info we have now but which had been hidden the press articles would have looked very different, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed - as long as Alan Mcilwraith isn't allowed to write it this time&#160;;) . Not only is it a notable example of fakery (real live Walter Mittys) but it is interesting from a Wikipedia point of view as he tried to use it to forge his history and I think that angle needs exploring and I think (given the shaky information being handed around by the news media) that it is worth clarifying how quickly it was spotted and removed - a good example of the self-correcting mechanism. So two reasons it is notable. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 15:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I know it's naughty, but I checked his payroll entry at BT (I work for a 3rd party) and it was unusual. Shows him not living in glasgow. Why did he tell BT he lived in #######? Mum's address. Sorry, can't recall his date of birth, just wanted to see if he was down as "sir" and change it!</p>

<p>It was claimed he wrote the wikipedia article to bolster his position.

<p>It is a pity that some people are still trying to get this article removed. Alan Mcilwraith is worth a brief Wikipedia article due the amount of media coverage that the case has received, and also because a hoax Wikipedia article was involved at one point.

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Mcilwraith created a Wikipedia article about himself on 5 October 2005. The article was created under the username "MilitaryPro"</p>
<p>How do we know it was McIlwraith himself who authored the initial wiki entry? Has he admitted to being "MillitaryPro"? I understood from newspapers interviews MacIlwraith was claiming a "friend" (aherm) had written the entry. Did I get this wrong?</p>

<dd>If you read the intro to that category then it explains why:
<dl>
<dd><i>"This category is only for Scottish people who are "famous for being famous", or who are notable for unusual reasons and do not belong in any of the other categories. There are separate categories for Scottish actors, Scottish musicians, Scottish television presenters, Scottish sportspeople, etc."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Basically, it is a cat for people who do not fit into any of the other occupation cats, see <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_people_by_occupation_51f7.html" title="Category:Scottish people by occupation">Category:Scottish people by occupation</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 18:28, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's a better idea to misout the category - Alan Mcilwraith is not a celeb under any meaning of the word!

<dd>The "celebrities" categories are the standard Wikipedia cats for people who just do not fit into any other "occupation" categories, as is the case with Mcilwraith. I do not think that we should be making policy on the hoof on this one article: if people have concerns about the naming of all these cats then take the whole bunch to CfD for discussion as to a better name. Here they all are:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/e/l/Category%7ECelebrities_ccea.html" title="Category:Celebrities">Category:Celebrities</a> and Category:Celebrities by nationality</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Please take note of the "<i>Note on categorization</i>": "<i>Individuals should not be included in this category unless they do not fit into another occupational category. Disclaimer: This category may inappropriately label persons. See Wikipedia:categorization of people for advice on how to apply categorization to articles relating to people.</i>" In other words, we are not the first people to have noticed that the cat name is inappropriate in certain cases. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 09:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That might be the case, but I think we're over categorising here. Mcilwraith is already in <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Glasgow_5833.html" title="Category:People from Glasgow">Category:People from Glasgow</a>, if he does not naturally fit into any of the occupation cats then surely it's better to not include?

<dd>No, I just do not accept that: he ought to be in one of the Scottish occupation cats, not just the one for where he was born. The occupation cats are the principal method of categorising people here at Wikipedia, the place of birth cats are subsidiary. If people have a problem with the "celebrities" name then CfD it, but you must do the whole bunch, not just focus on the Scottish cat: this is a Wikipedia-wide issue. The more I look at that horrible "Celebrities" cat and its stupid subcats, it becomes clear that this is a common problem. Nevertheless, <i>those cats are specifically designed for people like Mcilwraith</i>, so in it he must stay. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 09:52, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still don't buy it, and certainly don't have the stomach to tackle the "big problem"&#160;:) If someone is not well known for their profession then it makes no sense to categorise them under a profession.
