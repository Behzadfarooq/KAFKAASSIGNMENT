<p>This article states:</p>
<pre>
"Alaska is administratively divided into "boroughs," as opposed to "counties." The function is the same,
but whereas most states use a three-tiered system of decentralisation - state/county/township - 
Alaska only uses two tiers - state/borough."
</pre>
<p>I believe Hawaii also uses a two-tier system. None of its cities are incorporated municipalites, with all governing done at the county and state levels. Do any other states operate this way?</p>
<p>Is this true? Alaska seems to have incorporated cities within and not seperate from the boroughs. (Check the constitution as one source.) So it would seem that the system is three-tiered, with the borough being much like a strong county government found in southern and western states. Can anybody help clear this up? --68.160.179.30 21:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most of Alaska is federal land, with the next largest land group being the state. There are several incorporated boroughs, with large chunks of state and federal land in between. Some municipalities are incorporated, so we have a three-tier system, plus the Native corporation lands and village councils. Not quite three-tier; maybe three-tier plus a parallel three-tier? <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirdre_1773.html" title="User:Deirdre">Deirdre</a> 18:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I notice the coordinates are mentioned in the detailed info sidebar, but I'm wondering if some sort of further trivia should be added to this article, establishing the fact that the Aleutian islands cross the 180° Longitude mark, thus making Alaska the eastern-most state in the US instead of Maine. 207.177.12.151 04:18, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't buy that. They're called the "Western" and "Eastern" hemispheres for a reason. The coordinates change from "degrees West" to "degrees East." The nearby part of Russia is called the "Far East." It's a technicality, but it's valid.</p>
<p>"...in the United States." That places reference on the US, not on the international dateline. Alaska is the eastern-most US state in the world, but not in the United States, just as Florida is the northern-most state in the Caribbean, but not the northern-most in the world.

<p>I'm surprised that there isn't more about gold or oil in this article. I was always under the impression that one of the big reasons that purchasing alaska was not a "folly" was the large amount of gold and oil reserves. I don't know this for a fact so I won't add it, but if true I think this connection should be made in the history section. 68.49.142.108</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I remember, the gold and oil resources were unknown at the time Seward was pushing for the acquisition of Alaska. Maybe there were rumblings of potential reserves, but the gold rush didn't happen until after Alaska was made a territory of the US. Once the gold and oil reserves were discovered, people realized we got a good deal on the purchase price...</dd>
<dd>I don't remember what Seward's big reason for pushing for the purchase of Alaska was...maybe someone who's more of an Alaska history buff can fill the article in...perhaps Steven Haycox at UAA could be converted to a Wikipedian!

<dd>Alaska join Canada?! I hope not! Canada's sinking into a debt hole of overtaxing and making people too dependent on the public teat! Rather it be the other way around! Way back in 1976, a humorous editorial in a Whitehorse paper suggested that Alaska, Yukon and the NWT separate from Canada and the US and form the nation of Nordicus! I don't think that's practical, but at least culturally, Alaska has more in common with its neighbours along the latitude. 207.189.250.46 14:34, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many Alaskans who think that leaving the US is a good idea, but I rarely have heard discussion about joining Canada. The AIP is just a part of the very odd political landscape in Alaska. First, elections are primarly determined on how long you've lived in Alaska (commonly referred to as Sourdough Status), then on issues. The main issues revolve around the Alaska Permanant Fund and the related Dividend. Anything after that is typically a wedge issue (subsistence, hunting rights, etc.). Alaska is strange because while it's government is fairly socialistic in nature, it still tends to be very conservative. The State has tight control over natural resources (even if the resources are on your land), yet one of the biggest parts of the State Constitution is the right to privacy pretty much trumping everything else. Also, the state is mostly conservative except for Juneau which is very liberal. There are a share of Democrats in Alaska government (Tony Knowles was governor for 8 years), but as I like to say "An Alaskan Democrat is a Marylander Republican".</dd>

<p>Canada has had 9 years of budget surpluses and is paying down the debt(While America is continueing its past time of deficit spending) so i dont know where " Canada's sinking into a debt hole" comes from. FYI one of the old rants that always seems to go around Alaskan communities every few years is a dual succession of Alaska and the Yukon from their respective countries and combining into an independent state. There's no way Alaska would just join Canada, though--sentiment toward Eastern Canadians is as negative as sentiment toward Eastern Americans. 4.20.74.62 17:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The AIP is Alaska's 3rd largest political party, however its platform varies depending on who you ask. Some die-hard AIP members want to secede from the USA. Others want Alaska to revert back to a territory claiming statehood has led to too much federal control. Others argue the exact opposite, that Alaska is a state in name only and is put on the back burner of federal policy. These individuals call for more federal representation.</dd>

<p>About seven months ago, an anon changed the etymology of the name to read:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The name "Alaska" is most likely derived from the Aleut word Alyeska, meaning greater land as opposed to the Aleut word Aleutia, meaning lesser land. To the Aleuts, this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the mainland from an island.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This greater/lesser "Aleutia" assertion seems very dubious. There's no source, and not a single Ghit to verify; in fact, the only pages with both Alyeska and Aleutia in the text are copied from this article, or typoed the word "Aleutian", or were about something totally unrelated. I'd be surprised if "Aleutia" were even remotely <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleut_language.html" title="Aleut language">Aleut</a> to begin with; to me it reads like a guesswork backformation from "Aleutian".</p>
<p>I've copied the text here so it's easily available to reinsert should an actual source for this exist, but for now I'm putting it back how it was. —<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero_Gravitas_e670.html" title="User:Zero Gravitas">Zero Gravi</a><b><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero_Gravitas_f48c.html" title="User talk:Zero Gravitas">t</a></b><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero_Gravitas_e670.html" title="User:Zero Gravitas">as</a> 23:21, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's not just the lack of roads that was so funny; it was the complete lack of sense of the distances in the region, <i>even if there were roads</i>.

<p>I thought it would be nice to include the fact that Alaska is in sixth place on <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranked_list_of_subnational_entities.html" title="Ranked list of subnational entities">that list</a>, but then I noticed a problem:</p>
<p>The info box gives the following figures -- <i>Total Area 663,267 sq mi (1,717,854 km²)</i> -- which matches the number shown on the aforementioned <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranked_list_of_subnational_entities.html" title="Ranked list of subnational entities">statoid list</a>, but the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html#Geography" title="Alaska">Geography</a> section tells a different tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area (it is larger in area than all but 18 of the world's nations) at 570,374 square miles (1,477,261 km²), over twice as large as <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, the next largest state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That number would push Alaska down from sixth to ninth place on the list.</p>
<p>So my questions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can anyone explain this discrepancy? <small>I'm thinking land area to total area, including coastal waters, or the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleutian_Islands_60d5.html" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Island chain</a>, or something similar.</small></li>
<li>Would someone like to put the explanation into the article (besides me :)?</li>

<p>Does anyone understand the "Hispanic only" lines in the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html#Race_and_ancestry" title="Alaska">Race and ancestry table</a>? This seems to be breaking down the Hispanic population into White, Black, Asian, Native American and Native Hawaiian. Does that make any sense?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The data is from the US Census Bureau, which seperates Hispanic as a series of data partitioned off from racial breakdowns. Where it can generally be accepted in the US that races like White, Black, Asian, etc. can be related to specific people who came from particular regions of the world (genetic makeup and ancestry), the term Hispanic is far less obvious in its origins and use. The term in the US typically relates to those who speak Spanish in their ancestry. This means that people from Spain, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, etc. can all be classified as Hispanic. If you look at the people who make up the countries where Spanish is spoken, things get very confusing very fast, much like looking at the ethnic and racial makeups of Central Asian countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan. For example, the substantial portion of Mexico's population is made up of American Indians, Spaniards, and mixing of the two (commonly referred to as Mestizos in the US). Technically the Spaniards are of white racial descent (western Europe), yet they are classified as Hispanic. The American Indians were there long before the Spaniards came with the Spanish language and are classified as Hispanic. The mixture of the two groups of people is probably more in line with what the typical outsider might see as being the definition of Hispanic. Throw in the Caribbean, which has a substantial black population due to slavery, and you have black people that are calld Hispanic.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure how Google Earth does map datum, because how it approximates the ellipsoid of the Earth over that distance could reasonable throw off the distance by another system by a 100 miles. So in their native coordinates, both Google Earth and the other item could be correct. They could both be wrong.

<p>The vandalism on this and other pages is out of control. They are learning quickly how to skate around the editors. Some of you who are watching this page have probably noticed several times that vandals have edited several times in a row without signing in, and then after signing in they leave a notice that they have deleted some vandalism when in fact they are just cloaking the vandalism from being easy to find. I have seen this happen twice now and if you don't catch it right away it makes it all the harder to find. I for one am tired of this. I can't seem to find anyway to contact Wikipedia so I am posting here. It is time to change the policy in which non-registered and non-signed in editors can edit. This should cut down the massive problem. My daughter's high-school teacher informed her class that Wikipedia would no longer be considered a reliable source for their reports. Vandalism plays a major part in hurting Wiki reputation. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 21:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have tried time and again to get someone in Wiki to do something about the daily, sometimes hourly vandalism on this and other articles. One way would be to lock out the article(s) to those who are not registered or logged in. They seemingly don't think there is a major problem that needs to be addressed. Is it just me, or has the problem doubled? Other editors who watch this one article know what I am talking about. I for one am through with watching this article. I love Alaska but if Wikipedia won't fix the problem then I am forced to stop keeping watch. I just don't have the patience to constantly repair what the vandals do. It's such an easy fix but they won't implement it. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 01:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Whatever. Point is, yeah, Wikipedia can only do so much as an institution/organiation, and vandalism is only one of many problems; myself I find it incredible that people need to deface/scrawl on things the way they do, and at other times 'hostile edits' or completely spurious positions/arguments/POV are a lot worse than petty vandalism; I'm not sure which page you're talking about re Alaska but let me know on my talkpage or email me and I'll take a look; not that I can do anything about it, but....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:17, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Exactly. I believe the same thing had happened: Russian tsarina leased Alaska to United States for the period of 100 or 99 years - a deal similar to British lease of Hong Kong from China. Due to October Revolution in 1917 in Russia, declaration of all laws and contracts made by tsarist regime void by the Bolsheviks, foreign intervention that followed, Russia has never been able to reclaim Alaska. Hope someone can shed some light on the issue from historical and legal stand point.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, even if the Bolshevik denunciation of all laws and contracts made by the tsarist regime were recognized and valid (see item imediately below), then that would also apply to the laws and contracts establishing the Russian America Company and its license to trade and whatever form of ownership was claimed by the Tsar over Alaska (the technicalities of which are a very good question; was imperial title implicit in the RAC's trade monopoly and imperial assertions?). In short, the Tsarist actions to extend empire to Alaska and California (yes, California) <i>also</i> were laws and contracts that the Bolsheviks should have repudiated, if they didn't; likewise the accessions of Siberia, the Russian Far East, Kazakhstan, Checnya et al. All tsarist laws and contracts of one kind or another; and the RAC was all about contracts with the imperial regime, just as the HBC was with the British Empire; so what was the nature of Russian title/claim over Alaska, in legal technicalities (i.e. the Tsarist proclamations establishing Russian dominion in North America)?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:21, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Similarly, the Chinese regime invokes Qing rule of Tibet and Eastern Turkestan and Manchuria, but repudiates other Qing constitutionalities; but in those cases they have rule-on-the-ground to back them up. The Russians never established a major military or settlement presence in Russian America, just a series of trading posts and communities built around them, and while there's a lasting Russian ethnic legacy among Alaskans, particularly native peoples, it was never "a part of Russia" or "one of the Russias". In wanting to inherit the mantle ot tsarist empire while disavowing responsiblity for tsarist laws and contracts, post-imperial Russia is not alone....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>03/18/2007: I checked: the Library of Congress has the copy of the agreement. Nothing there about the lease. Just cession.

<p>I'm not a huge Lisa Murkowski fan, but I read the article as suggesting that Frank's appointment of Lisa to the Senate was pure nepotism. Had she stayed in the State House, she would have been State Speaker for the 2003-2004 session, so I think she would have been a finalist anyway. I did a little modification that I think is more neutral. <a href="../../../a/k/b/User%7EAkbeancounter_54ac.html" title="User:Akbeancounter">-- A.</a> 20:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says: "Alaska is the least densely populated at 2.849 people per square kilometer (1.1 per square mile)" How can it be more per square kilometer than square mile? Are these figures swapped?</p>

<p>I'm replacing an abusive message about our lack of a section on climate with this statement that, hey, maybe it would be good for us to have one.

<dd><b>update</b>: Of course, we <i>did</i> have a section on climate, but it had no section of its own (it was part of "Geography"). So I just created a subject header for Climate so that it can be more easily found -- even perhaps by people such as the one who left the aforementioned piece of abuse. --<a href="../../../y/k/s/User%7EYksin_807b.html" title="User:Yksin">Yksin</a> 22:33, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
