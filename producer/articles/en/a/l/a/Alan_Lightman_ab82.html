<p>In his scientific work, Lightman has made fundamental contributions to the theory of astrophysical processes under extreme temperatures and densities. In particular, his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory, the structure and behavior of accretion disks, stellar dynamics, radiative processes, and relativistic plasmas. His research articles have appeared in <i>the Physical Review, the Astrophysical Journal, Reviews of Modern Physics, Nature,</i> and other journals. In 1990, he chaired the science panel of the National Academy of Sciences Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee. He is a past chair of the High Energy Division of the American Astronomical Society.</p>

<p>In 1981, Lightman began publishing essays about science, the human side of science, and the "mind of science", beginning with <i><a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian_%28magazine%29.html" title="Smithsonian (magazine)">Smithsonian</a></i> and moving to <i>Science 82</i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, and other magazines. Since that time, Lightman's essays, short fiction, and reviews have also appeared in <i>The American Scholar</i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Atlantic_Monthly_522b.html" title="The Atlantic Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a></i>, <i>Boston Review</i>, <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences_4625.html" title="American Academy of Arts and Sciences">Dædalus</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Discover_%28magazine%29.html" title="Discover (magazine)">Discover</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploratorium.html" title="Exploratorium">Exploratorium</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Granta.html" title="Granta">Granta</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper%27s_Magazine_7616.html" title="Harper's Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a></i>, <i>Harvard Magazine</i>, <i>Inc Technology</i>, <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Review_of_Books_a345.html" title="The New York Review of Books">The New York Review of Books</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, <i>Science 86</i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sciences_cf6a.html" title="The Sciences">The Sciences</a></i>, <i>Story</i>, <i><a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology_Review_045d.html" title="Technology Review">Technology Review</a></i>, and <i>World Monitor</i>.</p>
<p>Lightman's novel <i><a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein%27s_Dreams_3b90.html" title="Einstein's Dreams">Einstein's Dreams</a></i> was an international bestseller and has been translated into thirty languages. It was runner up for the 1994 PEN New England / Boston Globe Winship Award. <i>Einstein's Dreams</i> was also the March 1998 selection for <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Public_Radio_8b7c.html" title="National Public Radio">National Public Radio</a>'s "<a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_of_the_Nation_f0b9.html" title="Talk of the Nation">Talk of the Nation</a>" Book Club. The novel has been used in numerous colleges and universities, in many cases for university-wide adoptions in "common-book" programs, and is one of the mostly widely used texts in American colleges today. Lightman's novel <i>The Diagnosis</i> was a finalist for the 2000 National Book Award in fiction and has been adopted by high school teachers of Advanced Placement English.</p>
<p>More than two dozen independent theatrical and musical productions have been based on <i>Einstein's Dreams</i>, including a production at Chicago's National Pastime Theater in 2000, produced and directed by Patrizia Acerra and Dawn Arnold; a production at Paradise Theater in New York in 2001, produced and directed by Paul Stancato and Brian Rhinehart; a production at the Culture Project Theater in New York in 2003, directed by Rebecca Holderness; a production at the People's Branch Theater in Nashville in 2003, adapted by Brian Niece and David Alford, directed by David Alford; a musical production at the Martin Segal Theater of <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_University_of_New_York_91a7.html" title="City University of New York">CUNY</a> in New York in 2003, produced by Brian Schwartz with music and lyrics by Joshua Rosenblum and Joanne Lessner; a production by the Underground Railway Theater in Boston in 2006; and a production by the University of Memphis in 2006, under the direction of Gloria Baxter; a musical composition titled "In This World" by Paul Hoffman in 2000 and performed by the Silverwood Trio on their own CD; and a musical composition titled "When Einstein Dreams" by Nando Michelin in 2003 and performed by the Nando Michelin Group on a Double Times Record CD. A major musical adaptation is now being planned for the Prince Theater in Philadelphia, directed by Marjorie Samov.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Lightman_ab82.html" title="Edit section: Other Major Projects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other Major Projects</span></h2>
<p>In 1999, Lightman founded the <a href="http://harpswellfoundation.org" class="external text" title="http://harpswellfoundation.org" rel="nofollow">Harpswell Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide educational opportunities to disadvantaged children and young people. The Foundation is funded from the donations of private individuals. All major projects of the Foundation so far have taken place in Cambodia, a country in desperate need after essentially all of its educated class were destroyed by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. In June 2005, the Harpswell Foundation completed a four-room school building in the village of Tramung Chrum, about 50 miles from Phnom Penh. In July 2006, the Foundation completed a dormitory for college women in Phnom Penh, which allows outstanding women to attend college. This dormitory will serve all the colleges in Phnom Penh and is one of the first dormitories in Cambodia. Not having a safe place to live while attending college has been the major obstacle preventing young women from outside Phnom Penh (over 90% of the population) to receive a college education and become leaders. Colleges in Cambodia do not provide housing for their students. Male students can live in the Buddhist temples, but female students cannot. The dormitory houses 36 women, who have been selected on the basis of their intelligence, ambition, and leadership potential. In addition to providing free housing, the Harpswell Foundation Dormitory gives these young women food; free classes in English, French, and computer skills; readings and discussion of current events in Cambodia and the world; and a weekly leadership seminar.</p>
