<p>Hello, could someone explain the purpose of the ref tags used in the viaduct article after the headings in the Ballot Options section?</p>
<p>I'm referring to the following:</p>
<p>====Surface-Tunnel Hybrid &lt;ref name="Seattle_Channel_Viaduct_In_depth" /&gt;====</p>
<p>Perhaps they should be removed? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Max. Please keep them in. They're important for any time that you have multiple references to the same source. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>Adding ref tags makes a link into a footnote:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;ref&gt;[link]&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you reference the same source multiple times in an article, you can reuse a single reference entry by creating a named reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;ref name="myref"&gt;[link]&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>and then for all additional references you can reuse that same reference again using a single named ref tag (you don't repeat the link or the end tag. Do include the slash as shown below):</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;ref name="myref" /&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the references section, you'll see a little "a, b, c" indicating that the reference was used multiple times, and the letters jump-link up to the place they were used in the article.</p>

<p>Any tunnel with ramps to replace the existing Alaskan Way ramps has a big obstacle: Terrain. The existing ramps use the terrain and are largly flat. The exceptions are at the ends of the structure. The ramps in question all intercept (to go around the ramps, you must change streets) select streets that go towards and away from <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliot_Bay_1397.html" title="Elliot Bay">Elliot Bay</a>. The same ramp from a tunnel must now fight, rather than use the terrain. It is more likely that those ramps would simply connect to the surface Alaskan Way (like Upper and Lower <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wacker_Drive_3b07.html" title="Wacker Drive">Wacker Drive</a> in Chicago, IL).--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Pittenger_1026.html" title="User:Will Pittenger">Will</a> 07:14, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that WSDOT is eliminating the downtown ramps in both the final options - they are currently underutilized and would be difficult to rebuild to meet current safety regulations. Only the 1st Ave S and Western Avenue ramps will be rebuilt, barring unforseen circumstances.Lack Thereof 13:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Such a name is misleading. Structures can be made "earthquake resistant," but not earthquake proof. Resistant structures are design to provide some assurance that they would either survive without damage or not cause casulties in an earthquake up to a given magnitude, say 6.3 on the Richter scale. Even with weaker earthquakes, a rated structure might fail as there is no way to absolutely guarantee the structure would handle the quake as specified. That is why the owner would buy insurance.</p>
<p>"Earthquake proof," as mentioned in the article, would require the structure survive <i><b>ANY</b></i> quake -- even a hypothetical 10.0 quake. (To my knowledge, no one has ever found any historical evidence of a quake that strong on Earth.)</p>

<p>I just made a few changes to improve readability and emphasis. The section called "uncertainties" was really all about the extent/risk of earthquake damage, and was largely reference and historical information. I renamed it to "Earthquake Damage" and moved it down to serve as supplemental information near the end of the article. That allows "Future Plans" to be the first named section of the article, which I think is a big improvement.</p>
<p>I also edited the 2nd paragraph to remove some redundancy about the viaduct capacity (I kept the stat in the 1st paragraph that was referenced and removed the unreferenced stat in the 2nd).</p>
<p>I hope everyone sees these as an improvement. If not, I look forward to hearing from you as to why not.</p>

<dd>I think your changes have improved the entry considerably. I think at some point the "options" category needs more internal organization. I think the claim that only two options are being considered at this point is misleading and might constitute a violation of NPOV. That is, even if WSDOT is attempting to narrow the discussion to two options, there is still lively discussion about alternative projects and those projects might well be implemented if there is a shift in popular opinion (or, for that matter, a change in governance). When we're talking about projects that could last decades, the current position of WSDOT is not the end of the discussion...Thoughts? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenzocane_abc1.html" title="User:Benzocane">Benzocane</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenzocane_fcb4.html" title="User talk:Benzocane">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Benzocane_7a8f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Benzocane">contribs</a>) 03:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenzocane_abc1.html" title="User:Benzocane">Benzocane</a> 03:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, and good thoughts on further needs for the article. I just added information on the advisory measures on the upcoming March 13 ballot, and looked for more information on the alternative projects. The option to remove the viaduct completely, as advocated by the People's Waterfront Coalition, appears active and I have included it as context for the ballot options and what a rejection of both official proposals might mean (support for this or another alternative). I didn't spot any other alternatives that need to be added, please correct me if I've missed something. pladuk 4:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the external link to the song <a href="http://zebox.com/cgi-bin/artists/dl.cgi?evolume_-_alaskan_way_viaduct_v1.mp3+q+d4" class="external text" title="http://zebox.com/cgi-bin/artists/dl.cgi?evolume_-_alaskan_way_viaduct_v1.mp3+q+d4" rel="nofollow">Alaskan Way Viaduct</a> by Seattle artist <a href="http://www.myspace.com/evolumemusic" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/evolumemusic" rel="nofollow">Kenji Beatbox</a> is relevant. Just as a photography might artistically capture the size, age, and history of the structure, so too can a piece of music sonically represent a drive over the structure. If photography by unknown photographers is acceptable why not music? If the artist is known, then would the link would be acceptable? Or are all links to music unacceptable even if they relate directly to the article? Would the link be better suited for the article "Music of Washington?"</p>
<p>What defines an artist as a known artist? Kenji Beatbox (a.k.a. 'evolume') has appeared for live performances in Seattle at Chop Suey for the April 2005 <a href="../../../l/a/p/Laptop_battle.html" title="Laptop battle">Laptop battle</a> and at Fuel in Pioneer Square. He also plays keyboards in the band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/siegeofkaffa" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/siegeofkaffa" rel="nofollow">Siege of Kaffa</a> who has performed at El Corazon and The Comet Tavern. Kenji Beatbox is also currently featured on this month's web radio show as at <a href="http://mishkas.com/" class="external text" title="http://mishkas.com/" rel="nofollow">Mishkas.com</a> out of London and Lithuania. So it could be said he is known both locally and internationally, however obscure his name may be to some.</p>
<p>I realize music is subjective, but I believe the reason for removing the link is also subjective and to encourage <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, I am interested to see a little discussion on this issue.</p>

<p>No offense was intended in providing updates to the Wikipedia page, and we want to abide by the expectations and guidelines involving the Wikipedia community. The Wikipedia page was updated on October 27, 2006, to correct inaccuracies about the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Project and project cost estimates. Below is the information we wanted to correct – we invite others to make these updates or we would like to make these changes, if no one objects.</p>
<p>• Under the Options section, the page read that seven replacement alternatives were studied in our Draft Environmental Impact Statement, and what followed was a bulleted list of eight replacement alternatives (this discrepancy has since been corrected). In our DEIS, released in 2004, we only studied five alternatives. We did not study retrofitting the viaduct, a series of cable-stayed bridges, or a Transit+Streets alternative in the DEIS. These alternatives have been considered at other times and in separate studies, but since the discussion was already framed in terms of what was studied in the DEIS, we wanted to show the five alternatives that were actually studied in the DEIS.</p>
<p>• Cost information: In September 2006, WSDOT updated cost information for the Tunnel and Elevated Structure Alternatives, in order to account for national trends of rising inflation rates and construction costs.</p>
<p>All of this information can be seen in more detail at the project Web site, www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/viaduct, and is based on technical studies completed by subject-matter experts.</p>
<p>Our goal was to present accurate information about this complex project. We think sites such as Wikipedia are a great way for people to get information and engage in dialogue about replacing the viaduct and seawall. We value the time and energy users spend on providing information to each other on this site and want to meet the expectations of other participants.</p>
