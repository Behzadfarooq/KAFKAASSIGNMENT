<p>Why don't we just title this "Green Lantern (Golden Age)"? It would be easier to search for in the database, especially for those who might not know who Alan Scott is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think "Alan Scott" is fine. This is why we have a section called "Biographies of the Major Green Lanterns" in "Green Lantern" article. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesfer_a67b.html" title="User:Lesfer"><i>Lesfer</i></a> <a href="../../../l/e/s/User_talk%7ELesfer_d1c5.html" title="User talk:Lesfer"><font color="red"><big>☎</big></font></a> 13:15, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Still, it's rather confusing. The title works under the assumption that the character is most recognized by his secret identity (like, say, Guy Gardner). Solely titling it "Alan Scott" makes it hard to find. In comparison, all the articles related to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starman_%28comics%29.html" title="Starman (comics)">Starman</a> have modifiers at the end to indicate the articles are still talking about characters who bore the mantle of Starman. Something along the lines of "Green Lantern (Alan Scott)" or "Green Lantern (Golden Age)" would be more effective. WesleyDodds 22:57, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Why do so MANY people keep making that mistake? Alan Scott was a CIVIL Engineer (he designed the bridge that was blown up), not a railroad engineer. He was on the train as a courtesy for a test run - he was not part of the train's normal crew.</p>
<p>Just pick up Golden Age Green Lantern Archives #1 and read the first story (Alan's origin). You'll see.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Ross_21f8.html" title="Alex Ross">Alex Ross</a> painting, while certainly prettier, lacks the information of the <i>All-American</i> cover, which shows Green Lantern's full head-to-toe costume on the first issue he appeared in. The Ross painting lacks any identifying context to tell the reader its source and significance for the character. This not only makes for a poor choice for illustrating an informative article, but undercuts the fair use rationale—the Ross painting is more decorative than informative. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not about which image is prettier. Is about having a current image of the character in the SHB. I'm sorry, but all this thing about "<i>painting lacks any identifying context to tell the reader its source and significance for the character</i>" is nothing but blah-blah-blah and POV. Ross' image portraits the current Alan Scott, period. This is fact and is also what is supposed to be in the SHB.

<p>Why exactly is it best to have the "most current depiction" as the lead image? We're dealing with a character that was first published 65 years ago—how is the "most current" necessarily the most important and the most informative the character? Even within the fictional universe, he certainly wasn't lacking an eye most of his superhero "career." Not to mention the issue of how a painting is the most informative about how a comic book character is portrayed... And Lesfer, please explain why you considered it appropriate to mark a reversion of the image being discussed on this talk page as a minor change and not to provide any edit summary?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Scott&amp;diff=59759654&amp;oldid=59745460" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Scott&amp;diff=59759654&amp;oldid=59745460" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 21:16, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, in JSA 83 he was seen with two eyes, but being One Year Later, we can suppose he was using a trick, but check issues 85 and 86.</p>
<ul>
<li>In JSA 85, after <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jakeem_Thunder_645c.html" title="Jakeem Thunder">Jakeem Thunder</a> calls the ghost of <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_%28comics%29.html" title="Jade (comics)">Jade</a> for help. Jade goes away, visiting her wounded father</li>
<li>In JSA 86, Alan wakes with his "green orb eye" explaining that "Jennie left me a connection to her ghost. Enough to see traces of the spirit world".</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the story arc, JSA is temporarily disbanded. JSA Classified and Checkmate starts from the destruction of JSA Headquarters to the present, so, the green orb he shows in Checkmate is the one he acquired in JSA 85. DrTofu83 13:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the collection of Alex Ross' art, called "Mythology" says that the "Green Knight" or just plainly, that continuum's Green Lantern is Hal Jordan, not Alan Scott as it says in this article. Also it would make sense that it's Hal Jordan, because during the time difference between the regular continuum, the character's age, and Alan Scott's Daughter is in her mid to late thirties by the time of the series, so Alan would at least be 70 during Kingdom Come, also, Alex had it set up so each character has been replaced by their children, with exception to the JLA Regulars, Aquaman remains in his kingdom while Aqualad has taken over as Aquaman, Avia has replaced Big Barda and Scott Free, There is Captain Marvel Jr. (Now King Marvel), Mary Marvel (Now Lady Marvel), and they're Child, The Whiz, representing the Marvel family while Billy is working for Luthor, and since Starfire is dead and Red Robin (Dick Grayson) hasn't returned to crime fighting yet, his daughter Nightfire (a character Alex Ross has created when he was much younger and has wanted to introduce into the DC mainstream) has taken over; so it could be entirely probable that while Alan Scott is old and Retired, his Daughter Jade and his son Obsidion has taken over and carry on his legacy.</p>
<p>And look at the other non-superpowered characters, they're silver age and they look like they're about to retire.</p>
<p>- No way is that Hal Jordan. It is absolutely clear both from context and from his appearance that the Lantern is Alan. 74.114.147.235 00:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
