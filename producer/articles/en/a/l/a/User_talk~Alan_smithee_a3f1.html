<p>Hi - I see you've listed a couple of useless redirects on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>. While I fully agree that these need deleting, you might like to know that technically speaking the proper place to take redirects is <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 01:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re your note: the only thing you forgot was to sign your name with ~~~~. Apart from that, perfect. You're doing a great job with the redirect maintenance, too!</dd>
<dd>This next bit may be confusing, so let me apologise in advance. I'm re-listing the AfDs, because if I don't, someone else will. I'm also going to close them, though, since you've taken the redirects to <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a>. So everything's okay. ^_^</dd>
<dd>If you're still not certain about anything, or if you'd like any more help, then please do just ask. The deletion process is hideously arcane - there are even some <i>administrators</i> who constantly make mistakes with it - so there's certainly no shame in not understanding it! — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 01:44, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I am a new WikiGnome &amp; so don't know a lot of the mysteries of Wikiformatting. In your recent edit of the "Epistolary novel" article, you added the English titles onto the beginning of the titles of a few foreign-language novels I had added to the article, along with a vertcial bar. What does this do? Does it direct the reader to the article describing that novel, using the English-language title of the novel as the title of article? <a href="../../../z/_/w/User%7EZ_Wylld_4dbc.html" title="User:Z Wylld">Z Wylld</a> 21:53, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly what it does. It seemed most logical that, since WikiPedia pages seem to be generally titled using English versions of book titles, I had the foreign-language-title links still display the foreign-language titles, but link to a Wiki page titled with the English title of the work. (If said English title exists, it'll go there; otherwise, it'll only tacitly suggest the creation of the English-title page (not both the English-title page and the foreign-title page).)

<p>It is obviously accepted on Wikipedia to insert a comma in. Please stop changing this, as I just have to revert your edits.

<dd>How is this "obvious"? I see both versions with and without a comma. Most style guides explicitly disallow the comma, and I couldn't find an explicit rule either way on Wikipedia. Could you please explain why you "have to" revert my edits? Alan smithee 08:00, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact that all articles with a Sr. or Jr. in the subject's name should make this clear. For example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, a very popular article. The fact that his article uses the comma, after having been edited by thousands of Wikipedians, should indicate this strong convention. Thus, I want to ensure the convention is followed, and reverted your changes to maintain this. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 05:06, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm assuming your first sentence means, essentially, that since "all" articles with a Sr. or Jr. in the subject's name follow the convention of using a comma before the suffix, that is a strict convention here. But plenty of articles don't: <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Coleman_68fe.html" title="Norm Coleman">Norm Coleman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will.i.am.html" title="Will.i.am">Will.i.am</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Parker_Jr._66e5.html" title="Ray Parker Jr.">Ray Parker Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Clay_Ford_Jr._9eac.html" title="William Clay Ford Jr.">William Clay Ford Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Card_e7e9.html" title="Andrew Card">Andrew Card</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wrigley_Jr._cd4f.html" title="William Wrigley Jr.">William Wrigley Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._Mark_Felt_640a.html" title="W.

I certainly agree that many articles use the comma, but many don't, and most style guides recommend <i>not</i> using the comma (e.g., CMS 14th ed. 8.55). If you're still dead set on keeping your reversions of my changes, shouldn't there be something explicit about this policy in some Wikipedia style guide? (And isn't this a decision for more than just one person (or two people), anyway – isn't that one of the fundamental points of Wikipedia?) Alan smithee 07:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I changed your edit to the article for <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Tyler_6293.html" title="Steven Tyler">Steven Tyler</a> where you had changed the links for his birthplace. You changed "Massachusetts" to "MS" and I changed it back. First of all, because MS is the abbreviation for Mississippi, not Mass. Also, because most people outside the U.S., and even some within, wouldn't know what MS is but they have a better chance of knowing that Massachusetts is a state. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:02, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that's a terrible example of rushed editing (on my part). (The "MS" instead of "MA".) I hadn't thought about the view outside of the US (ah, the naive American). FWIW, my intent was to separate the single "Boston, Massachusetts" link into two separate "Boston" "MA" links. Thanks for catching that. Alan smithee 19:57, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Could you tell me your source? Thanks! Alan smithee 04:14, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it comes from 2 things: 1) the version with "Is" capitalized is a redirect to the version with "is" in lower case in wikipedia. and 2) words like "is" in titles are not usually capitalized. However, upon further research, I found that imdb.com lists the film with "Is", as do some other sources (from google), but not all. So I would say that "Is" is (I sound like <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton" class="extiw" title="q:Bill_Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>) probably correct, even though it conflicts with my understanding of standard English syntax. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 06:20, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is quite odd. It seems perfectly obvious that there is no "standard" way of adding a "junior" suffix to a name. If you ask me, the Wikipedia way is to avoid arbitrary prescriptivism: I would say we should use the most common form <i>for each individual</i>, and if that is hard to find out, just stick with whatever the article has. That would follow the precedent established for things like American/British spelling differences, as well as the fundamental rule that an article should be given the name most people will be expecting it to have.</p>
<p>The way to get a guideline changed is to propose a change on the talk page of the guideline itself. That way, everyone who cares about the guideline text will see your proposal and discuss it, and it will either be adopted or rejected. It appears this particular guideline is being treated quite protectively by the editor who created it, which means it's likely that any proposal will be contested, so be prepared to argue your case. &#160;:)</p>
<p>You might like to refer to some printed style guides to get an idea for how other people approach this matter. For example, while <i>Hart's Rules</i> does state that a comma should normally be used for Americans, it is quite explicit that the comma should be left out for British people, or for Americans who did not habitually use a comma themselves.</p>
<p>If you do decide to propose that the wording of the guideline be broadened, let me know; I'd be happy to support you. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:25, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've basically been waiting for a year for any of the people who edit <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_adaptation.html" title="Film adaptation">Film adaptation</a> to notice that I hadn't bothered to find out the precise linking for <i>Ten Things I Hate About You</i> and <i>O.</i> I don't mean to say that I was writing poorly on purpose, but rather that I tend to leave a few things intentionally in the articles I do that I think are going to get a lot of edits. In that year or so, the edits have been somewhat predictable (everyone wanting to add his or her favorite type of adaptation (the comic books, e.g.)) and unpredictable (one editor on a jihad to say ... something... about Clarke's writing of <i>2001</i> being...I think he wanted to say "after" the script) and some pleasantly surprising (people <i>haven't</i> done the usual Wiki-mess of adding and adding and adding to that foolish "list of adaptations" at the end of the article (the list I had nothing to do with; it's about the only thing left from the substub originally written); normally, wiki editors love to add things to lists). You're the first to correct the substantive gaps. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While some style guides recommend lowercase for all prepositions, it seems that most recommend lowercase only for short prepositions. In the the case of the specific things ("10 Things I Hate About You" and "Wings Over America"), a google search for those terms turns up no results (until I got tired of looking) of an instance in which "about" or "over" is written with a lowercase first letter. So since these articles are widely refered to using the uppercase version of those words, and Wikipedia doesn't seem to have a specific policy about capitalizing prepositions, I think we should go with what everybody else is doing for these subjects. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 07:53, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Generally, if I were creating a title, I'd argue that we use miniscule for prepositions. That's the classic style I've been taught and teach. However, our primary duty at Wikipedia is to report and to lodge novel lemmae at positions where they will be most commonly sought. Therefore, if the film company called their movie "Ten Things I Hate About You," it's our duty to lodge our article at that location, with the majiscule. If, on the other hand, we're creating a new article, we should locate it where it will be most often sought. Beyond that, Wikipedia does have a guide in naming: Majiscule for the first word and miniscule for all subsequent words, regardless of part of speech, unless it is part of an artwork or work that carries capitalization. So, if it is an artwork, we should do what the publisher does. If it's not, miniscule. For textual reference, I'd say we should be accurate to the published version. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Additionally, my copy of <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i> (14th ed.) notes in 7.127 (p.282):
<dl>
<dd>Articles <i>(a, an, the)</i>, coordinating conjunctions <i>(and, but, or, for, nor)</i>, and prepositions, <b>regardless of length</b>, are lowercased unless they are the first or last word of the title or subtitle.</dd>

<dd>(the <b>bold</b> is mine). My copy of <i>MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</i> (3rd ed.) notes in 2.5.1 (p.50):

</dd>
<dd>notice that one of their examples is a seven-letter preposition. Which style guides recommend lowercase only for short prepositions? And as far as concern with people finding these articles where they're commonly sought I completely agree (though I think a redirect for <i><a href="../../../w/i/n/Wings_Over_America_61b3.html" title="Wings Over America">Wings Over America</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_8bf5.html" title="10 Things I Hate About You">10 Things I Hate About You</a></i> sufficient).

<dl>
<dd>The poster of <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i> also has the words "things", "hate", and "you" all lowercase, do you recommend we lowercase them as well?</dd>
<dd><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/c/capitalization.html" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/c/capitalization.html" rel="nofollow">This guide at dictionary.com</a> says that only short prepositions should be lowercase, and <a href="http://www.sc.edu/webpresence/editorial_guide/capitalization.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sc.edu/webpresence/editorial_guide/capitalization.html" rel="nofollow">this guide for university publications at the University of South Carolina</a> also says that only short prepositions should be lowercase.</dd>
<dd>As far at <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>, there seems to only be two possibilities, like the poster ("10 things I hate about you"), or like every textual reference I can find (Amazon, imdb, every result on a google search) ("10 Things I Hate About You"), which seems that it would be the publishers prefered textual representation. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 21:30, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My apologies — I should have been clearer: my pointing out that "about" appears in lowercase on the poster was merely to note that it wasn't capitalized; were it capitalized on the poster, there might be a better argument that the creators of the film had meant for "about" to only appear capitalized. Also, I do not recommend placing "things," "hate," and "you" in lowercase. I would argue that (and, in fact, do argue above that), in addition to the two possibilities for capitalization that you suggest, there is a third (<i>10 Things I Hate about You</i>), as prescribed by CMS and MLA (as I note above). You present two (seemingly) minor style guides (presumably) to counter two of the most respected in the English language; it seems that me both that the CMS and MLA are clear about how to treat this case and that they should be adhered to above the other two style guides (so long as Wikipedia users can find the article they are looking for through <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_8bf5.html" title="10 Things I Hate About You">10 Things I Hate About You</a></i>, of course). Frankly, it seems to me that Google, IMDb, Amazon.com, etc. are great source for determining how people might search Wikipedia (hence why the redirect page is there) — in other words, what are <b>popular</b> capitalizations — but they should not be to basis for determining what is the <b>correct</b> capitalization.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to also comment on the authoritativeness the two style guides you note. Who runs dictionary.com (in particular, why should it be considered authoritative?) Additionally, isn't it even possible that they got their rules from the same source as USC, thus making these two sources used to counter CMS and MLA essentially one (possibly weak) source? And what exactly does "short" mean — is a five-letter preposition too long? The USC site lists three examples, all of which are two-letter prepositions, but, as they don't exhaust the list of two-letter prepositions (e.g., "to" is missing), they presumably cannot mean that those that they list are a complete list of "short" prepositions. I would say there is at least some doubt as to the how the USC and dictionary.com rules apply here and, as the very first rule under capitalization on the USC Web site states: "[w]hen in doubt, do not capitalize." Alan smithee 01:00, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Above and beyond all style guides I think we should go with what the producers of the film intend. What is on the poster is a graphical rendering and does not seem to be the intention of the producers for how the film should be refered to in textual form. Amazon, which most likely gets its data from the movie industry (I don't think someone at Amazon types in the titles of all their products when they arrive in the warehouse), and IMDB, which seems to be somewhat of industry standard would most likely get it right. Plus the absence of a single instance of the title of the movie with "about" lowercase leads me to believe the producers intended "about" to be uppercase.</dd>
<dd>My point about the style guides is simply that there are different conventions, and Wikipedia doesn't itself have anything to say on the matter so there is really no reason to go against the producers wishes on capitalization based on conflicting conventions. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 01:09, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Two of the biggest (most accepted, revered, authoritative, etc.) style guides are clear about what to do — even the USC style guide leads to agreement with CMS and MLA. (If I started a tiny Web page that disagreed with a point that every style guide agreed upon, does that suddenly make "conflicting conventions" that, thus, should be ignored?) I completely understand your concern caused by Wikipedia not specifically covering this issue (if that is actually the case — I certainly couldn't find it covered); I think that details should be added to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">style guide</a>. However, the Wikipedia Manual of Style is clear what to do when a rule is not covered: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#When_all_else_fails" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#When_all_else_fails</a> says to revert to a style guide such as CMS (or Fowler's, though I think this issue falls outside of Fowler's bailiwick).</dd>
<dd>Also, I don't see how capitalizing "about" is "go[ing] against the producers wishes on capitalization" — how do we know the "producers wishes?" But, more importantly, I don't see why Wikipedia articles should match "producers wishes" — Wikipedia is not a forum for advertizing, it is an encyclopedia. Again, I agree that if someone looks for <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_8bf5.html" title="10 Things I Hate About You">10 Things I Hate About You</a></i>, they should have no trouble getting to the article — but that is exactly what redirects are for.

<dd>The producers created their work, they named it, we should respect how they want it to be named. Naming a film properly is not advertising, the existence of the page could be considered advertising, but naming the article properly is not advertising. Would you like it if I refered to you as "Alan Smithy"? I don't think so, that is your choosen user name, and it should rightly be respected. Should we also change the name of the movie to "Ten Things I Hate about You" because there are plenty of style guides that would recommend spelling out the number 10?</dd>
<dd>As I already explained we know the producers intensions because many websites which likely get their data directly from the producing studio have consistently spelled the title. For further proof consider this: movies.go.com is a website owned by Buena Vista (look at the copyright on the bottom of the page) the distributor for the film, <a href="http://touchstone.movies.go.com/" class="external text" title="http://touchstone.movies.go.com/" rel="nofollow">the Touchstone Pictures website</a>, the production company for the film, is even hosted from movies.go.com, (see the <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0147800/companycredits" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0147800/companycredits" rel="nofollow">company credits page for 10 Things I Hate About You at imdb</a>) If you do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:movies.go.com+10+things+i+hate+about+you&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:movies.go.com+10+things+i+hate+about+you&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">a google search limited to movies.go.com for "10 things i hate about you"</a>, every result you get (at least until I stopped looking after about 60 results) has "about" capitalized. There doesn't seem to be any doubt the producers of the movies want "about" to be capitalized.</dd>
<dd>Your argument about redirects is moot, I could just as easily use it to argue that the article can be placed at my prefered place.</dd>
<dd>The MLA style guide is for academic writing in the humanities, so it does not apply here. So that leaves just the CMS, and you simply cannot deny that there is another convention on this issue, I've shown you two places where it is used (one from a major university, another from a website that is the 132 most visited website on the internet <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=dictionary.com&amp;url=dictionary.reference.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=dictionary.com&amp;url=dictionary.reference.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). It doesn't matter that the CMS is more prestigous or whatever, the fact that there is another convention different from the CMS cannot be changed no matter how prestigous the CMS is. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 06:45, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia Manual of Style states that this issue should be resolved by "other resources, such as [CMS or Fowler's];" CMS resolves it.</dd>
<dd>The only reason why I am writing any more is to respond to several of your specific points (which I believe become moot by my previous sentence); I appreciate a healthy, intelligent debate and I don't want to simply be dismissive of responses you took time and thought to respectfully create (something that seems rare in any sort of discussion on the Internet).</dd>
<dd>I have no interest in changing the name of the film; my interest is in how it is indexed in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Should we, for example, reindex the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> Wikipedia page with a lowercase "a" because of their logo? Image:Amazon.com logo.gif</dd>
<dd>"Smithy" and "Smithee" are different spellings; if my account were being referred to by something (say, an on-line encyclopedia) in which the appropriate style were "Alan Smithee" (with a capital "S" — or even "Alan Smithy," though it does seem odd that a style guide would suggest that), I would not object.</dd>
<dd>A Web site that lists the film as "... About ..." is proof only that the person who typed in the relevant code/data for that Web page typed "About." (Additionally, I conjecture that the production company probably doesn't care how "about" is capitalized.) Also, an argumentum ad populum (or argumentum ad Google, if you wish) does not provide a convincing argument about the producers' wishes.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry I that was unclear in my redirect argument (it is sometimes difficult to communicate through this medium). I meant that it seems to me that a lowercase "about" is correct, but that I agreed with at least this concern: if someone goes to <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_8bf5.html" title="10 Things I Hate About You">10 Things I Hate About You</a></i> at Wikipedia, they should get the appropriate article; my suggested solution to this concern is a redirect link. Your suggestion that the article could equally be placed at <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i> (and presumably include a redirect from <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_about_You_d199.html" title="10 Things I Hate about You">10 Things I Hate about You</a></i>) misses my point: then the article would be, according to CMS (and, thus, according to the Wikipedia Manual of Style), in the wrong place. With both options, either capitalization will lead Wikipedia users to the right place; however, mine adheres to the proper style.</dd>
<dd>How are film and the construction of an encyclopedia not related to the humanities?</dd>
<dd>That dictionary.com is the 132nd-most-visited Web site does not mean their style guide is correct. (Additionally, this can be considered an argumentum ad populum.) I <i>agree</i> that there are other conventions, insomuch as other Web sites, books, etc. present alternatives to <i>The Chicago Manual of Style'</i>s view; Wikipedia just happens to lead one to use CMS to resolve this issue.</dd>
<dd>(Also, you never responded to the following notes. (1) Your alternatives in one case is unclear (how short is too short?) and in the second case suggests "[w]hen in doubt, do not capitalize" (and there clearly is doubt here). (2) If I started a tiny Web page that disagreed with a point that every style guide agreed upon, does that suddenly make "conflicting conventions" that, thus, should be ignored?)</dd>
<dd>Again, except for the first sentence, all the points in this response are moot to the primary argument — unless there is something wrong with the first sentence of this response ("The Wikipedia Manual of Style states that this issue should be resolved by 'other resources, such as [CMS or Fowler's];' CMS resolves it.") Alan smithee 02:13, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure why we keep going on circles here, but it is abundantly clear what the producers intentions are, every single instance of the film's name on the producers own website has "about" capitalized. This is not an argument by google or argument by popularity, this is how the producer of the films website consistently spells the name of the film, as I <b>was searching the producer's of the film's website</b> (just because I used google as a tool to search their website doesn't invalidate the information I got from the search tool). No style guide can override what the producers of the film intend the title to be, and that is "10 Things I Hate About You". If there was any confusion in the production company then you'd think there would be one single instance of "about" being lowercase, but I haven't found one, and you haven't produced one. It seems to me like a consistent effort has been made to consistently capitalize the name of the film by the production company (and by everyone else too). Your conjecture that the production company doesn't care about the capitalization is not backed up by any facts whatsoever, while I've have provided overwelming evidence to the contrary.</dd>
<dd>Regarding Amazon.com, I'm not sure why we would want to rename the Amazon.com as that is what Amazon.com refers to itself as in textual form (while it's graphical logo uses a lowercase a, whenever Amazon.com refers to itself in text form the a is always uppercase, for example at the bottom of <a href="http://www.amazon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">www.amazon.com</a> we see the text "© 1996-2006, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates"). While on Wikipedia is it impossible to have the name of an article be in lower case due to technical restrictions, there are several examples of articles where the subject uses an initial lowercase letter. What Wikipedia does in this case is to put a little note at the top of the article stating that the first letter should be lowercase but isn't due to technical restrictions, see <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">IPod</a> and <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id_Software_9f51.html" title="Id Software">Id Software</a>. Every reference to the subject of the article in the main text then uses a lowercase first letter. This is only one more argument why the title of the film should be respected according to the producers wishes: Wikipedia already respects the names of products, companies, etc when their first letter is lowercase even though every style guide (including CMS, MLA, Fowlers, and the two I linked to) would most likely say that the first letter should always be uppercase (and it does all this despite the technical restrictions as well). There are tons (almost 1,000) of examples of similar articles in Category:Article titles with lowercase initial letters.</dd>
<dd>When the Wikipedia manual of style says that when all else fails issues should be resolved with a style guide, such as CMS or Fowler's, that most certainly does not mean that CMS or Fowler's should be taken to be the bible of style guides. My understanding of that section is that if the Wikipedia manual of style does not specify a preference on the matter you can consult a style guide, and then it gives some examples of ones to consult. Anyways, this is really moot, as the producers have a clear preference for the title of the film, style guides don't override that.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not an academic journal, it is not a thesis for a university, and it is not a paper for a university course in the humanities. Plain and simple Wikipedia is not part of the academic humanities. I don't think we would see an article on the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetric_hypergraph_theorem.html" title="Symmetric hypergraph theorem">Symmetric hypergraph theorem</a> in the humanities.</dd>
<dd>"Alan Smithy" is different from "Alan smithee" and "10 Things I Hate About You" is different from "10 Things I Hate about You". So why should only spelling be respected but when a consistent effort to keep the capitalization consistent it should not be respected? Spelling and uppercase/lowercase are just two parts of the same thing.</dd>
<dd>Your "agrument by popularity" point can just as easily be countered by an "argument by emperors new clothes" point: just because someone important says it doesn't mean it's true. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 06:14, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since any secondary arguments seem moot unless my primary point ("The Wikipedia Manual of Style states that this issue should be resolved by 'other resources, such as [CMS or Fowler's]'; CMS resolves it.") is incorrect, I will address what seems to be your main response to my primary point.</dd>
<dd>You write "No style guide can override what the producers of the film intend the title to be." Presumably, you mean that Wikipedia cannot index things in a different format than the creators of those things intended. Why not? Alan smithee 20:37, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia can index things in any way it wants, but it has already demonstrated that for names of companies, products, movies (eg <a href="../../../e/x/i/EXistenZ_d6de.html" title="EXistenZ">eXistenZ</a>), and many other things that it indexes them at the name that the creator intended. Obviously this doesn't apply to everything (the centre of a political scandal would probably want the scandal to be called a "non-scandal", or forgetten entirely), but for titles of creative works Wikipedia should (and does, as I've already demonstrated with almost 1000 examples) index the work by the creators intended title. The creator of the work chooses the title, not you or me. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 08:35, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why should they be indexed by the creators' intended title? (I realize that a work's creator creates the title, but that is not the question at hand.) Should <i>eXistenZ</i> be indexed as <a href="../../../e/x/i/EXistenZ_d6de.html" title="EXistenZ">eXistenZ</a> (well, <a href="../../../e/x/i/EXistenZ_d6de.html" title="EXistenZ">EXistenZ</a>, thanks to Wikipedia's initial-capital limitation) or <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existenz.html" title="Existenz">Existenz</a>? (Again, the actual title of the movie is <i>eXistenZ</i> — that is not in question — the question is how it should be indexed in Wikipedia.) Whatever the answer is, I think that the answer should be in the Wikipedia Manual of Style. How does one start the process to have that answer in the Wikipedia Manual of Style?</dd>
<dd><b>If</b> it should be up to the creator(s), then determining how the creator(s) capitalize "about" is the key. I checked the DVD (including the box, the disc itself, and the chapter-search-index card inside) and it always appears in one of two ways: the stylized format that appears on the poster or all caps. This seems to me that, if we are to index Wikipedia articles by the way the creators capitalize their work, then <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_about_You_d199.html" title="10 Things I Hate about You">10 Things I Hate about You</a></i> should be indexed under 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. (Also, how does this compare in relevance to a Buena-Vista-owned Web site when Buena Vista distributed (as opposed to created) the film?)</dd>
<dd>(My argumentum-ad-populum comment merely warned against taking something as many sources when it could acutally be only one (or few).)</dd>
<dd>You have not provided any evidence that the production company "cares about capitalization" (not that this is particularly relevant to the actual topic at hand).</dd>
<dd>You write "... when all else fails issues should be resolved with a style guide, such as CMS or Fowler's, that most certainly does not mean that CMS or Fowler's should be taken to be the bible of style guides. My understanding of that section is that if the Wikipedia manual of style does not specify a preference on the matter you can consult a style guide, and then it gives some examples of ones to consult." Are you saying then that the Wikipedia Manual of Style is suggesting that these style guides be consulted ... and then ignored? It is not necessary to take CMS or Fowler's as the "bible of style guides," but they clearly should be looked at — and what they contain should affect stylistic decisions (particularly when the Wikipedia Manual of Style suggests consulting them).</dd>
<dd>I agree that Wikipedia is not an academic journal, that it is not a thesis for a university, and that it is not a paper for a university course in the humanities. That doesn't mean that the construction of an encyclopedia is not a task in the humanities. How would you categorize such a task?</dd>
<dd>SUMMARY: I think the Wikipedia Manual of Style should include a resolution to the more general issue (proper capitalization of articles whose titles are titles of works) — until then, it seems that the WMS suggests using CMS which resolves this with "about"; of course works' creators create the works' titles — it's how they should be indexed in Wikipedia that is being discussed; if Wikipedia should index with the usage of a work's creator(s), do the creator(s) here use <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>, <i>10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU</i>, <i>10 Things I Hate about You</i>, or something else?

<p>I had not heard <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Halmos_7591.html" title="Paul Halmos">Paul Halmos</a> had died, and a quick search on the internet doesn't confirm this.
