<p>For checking. I have recently been the target of a vicious personal attack on WP by someone who obviously knows me IRL, so I retreated, tortoise-like, to regroup and regain confidence. So nice that somebody noticed. (Didn't stop me from keeping up with WP work, though, as you can see!)

<p>Just wanted to inform you that the user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeabundo_ac15.html" title="User:Mikeabundo">Mikeabundo</a> is once more wreaking havoc in the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosplay.html" title="Cosplay">Cosplay</a> article regarding:</p>
<p>1. Adding a picture of a Filipina cosplayer that links to an adult site named asian-sirens.com - which, as someone had already pointed out in the talk page, does not make a very good general perception of cosplayers in general. (I'm not entirely sure if the cosplayer in said photo is a Filipina adult actress or similar with a penchant for cosplaying, but either way, I think sourcing a cosplay photo from an adult site is in rather bad taste.</p>
<p>2. Citing sources as a means of self-promotion; he cites two articles as his source for acknowledging cosplay as a Philippine mainstream, yet the article fails to confirm this. I have scanned the articles, and it would seem that the main reason for their inclusion revolves around the fact that he was a featured interviewee for both; the articles themselves fail to explain how cosplay is a Filipino mainstream, merely that cosplaying does exist in the Philippines. Again, this seems just another attempt by him to 'big up' links pertaining to him.</p>
<p>3. He has called some users who have attempted to revert these changes 'anonymous trolls' and similar, and has adopted a somewhat supercilious tone towards them.</p>
<p>You were one of the few admins I could find who dealt with the earlier issue regarding him (as per talk page), and since attempts at reaching a compomise with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeabundo_ac15.html" title="User:Mikeabundo">Mikeabundo</a> has failed (I assume because none of the parties are administrators that can restrict his actions), I was hoping you could help out again, or at least refer another administrator who would like to help step in and sort things out by removing the issues listed above, AND protecting the page until an agreement has been reached. The <a href="../../../c/o/s/Talk%7ECosplay_53bc.html" title="Talk:Cosplay">Talk:Cosplay</a> page is beginning to degenerate into a mudslinging competition of sorts. Thank you very much for your time; I hope this gets sorted out soon.</p>

<p>Hi, I saw you contributed to the debate about creating <a href="../../../c/o/r/Category%7ECornwall_stubs_0e00.html" title="Category:Cornwall stubs">Cornwall stubs</a> - This is just to let you know I've now created it, and have about 200 stubs in it, in addition to the approx 400 <a href="../../../c/o/r/Category%7ECornwall_geography_stubs_8dc1.html" title="Category:Cornwall geography stubs">Cornwall geo stubs</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 16:30, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Umm... I haven't created a 'regional bio stub' (by the way, what are the good reasons for not having them?) - I've created a general Cornwall stub. While it might be true that the one article you mention says next to nothing about his time in Cornwall, it may be that someone who knows about Cornish cricket will be able to expand on this, eg. did he play for <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall_County_Cricket_Club_d2f1.html" title="Cornwall County Cricket Club">Cornwall County Cricket Club</a>,? <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your contention that I'm using it as a regional bio stub or place of birth stub - what I have done is add it to stub articles that appear to me to have a Cornish connexion - of course other editors can change any stub or cat marker as they see fit. I think you will find that most of the articles I have stubbed as Cornwall-stubs were already in Cornwall-related cats, and many were already stubbed in other stub cats. Many are also not 'bio' articles. It may be that I have marked some articles as Cornwall stubs when they should not be - it's also probable that there are other articles I haven't stubbed that should be. If you have good reason to remove the Cornwall stub from a particular article then of course you should go ahead and do so. I would just add that my original message to you that I had created the Cornwall stub cat was identical to the messages I placed on the talk pages of the other users who had contributed to the discussion, and was meant as a courtesy to let you know what had happened. I will also copy this reply to your talk page. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 18:12, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think an article should not have a particular stub tag on it, then you could always remove it yourself - I had thought that was one of the point of Wikipedia. I note that you have only cited a single article. I am struck by the vehemence of your remarks - and am sorry if I have offended you in any way - tho' I don't see how. I do not understand your comment about me creating the stub contrary to the debate - the result was to create. Of course I shall be coming back to articles I have marked as Cornwall stubs - but I'm sure you will appreciate that (1) I can't do this instantly, and (2) the point of stubbing is to draw the attention of a wide range of editors who will each bring their own knowledge and perspectives to editing. This is the first stub I have created, and I am still comparitively new to Wikipedia. If your intention is to discourage inexperienced editors from contributing, then you are going about it in the right way. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 19:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. As you say, you looked at two or three articles and found one where you disagreed with the stubbing. I don't know what an upmerged category is - you proposed it, but didn't explain what it is, and when I did a wikipedia search for it (after the debate had been closed), I couldn't find anything. If it means putting the Cornwall geo-stubs in the Cornwall stub and not having a Cornwall geo-stub, surely that would create an unmanageably large stub cat? Anyway, I have unstubbed the article you objected to, and don't think that any of the other ones I stubbed fit the circumstances you objected to. If users less experienced than me are complaining about not getting admin privileges - I don't really see what that's got to do with this specific issue. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 01:28, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an odd request, but I noticed you offered on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category_talk%7ECategory_needed_d0cf.html" title="Category talk:Category needed">Category talk:Category needed</a> to generate a list of articles from a database dump... this is a bit beyond my technical abilities, and I've been looking for someone who could do this for me. Is there any way you could provide me with a list of orphaned articles? (e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/n/Special%7ELonelypages_2fac.html" title="Special:Lonelypages">Special:Lonelypages</a>) but from A to Z? I've been lead to believe it's not that complicated, but I know nothing about SQL so... still too much for me to figure out.

<dd>Well, the alphabetization isn't a real indicator... there are about 25,000 articles (mostly A through J) in <a href="../../../o/r/p/Category%7EOrphaned_articles_c0c3.html" title="Category:Orphaned articles">Category:Orphaned articles</a>, so do the math, there's probably 25,000+ more K-Z. I've been slowly running my bot through them with AWB for a few months, so there's no real rush... I just figured getting the full list would speed things up. So uh, again, I hate to be a bother but this is apparently something I'm not going to figure out on my own any time soon. Time isn't a problem, I'll be doing this project until someone else volunteers to take over, which is unlikely&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 15:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, or the user space, because that's where I keep my list of orphan articles. Special:lonelypages is just pages with no incoming links period though, so that might be what the default queries return. Either list is useful... the one with just no incoming article links is probably substantially larger though. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:40, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks so much... I really think this will do for now, my bot ignores ones that are deleted, not actually linkless and a zillion other reasons, so it should run pretty cleanly now that I have a list. It would be nice to eventually get the ones without incoming article links, if you can just ignore articles with just incoming links from <i>my</i> userspace (where I keep the list of orphans, I haven't really figured out a better way to list them yet) that should yield a list of untagged orphans, since I generate that list based on articles tagged with the linkless template. But I'd say wait until at least the next database dump, since I imagine it will take me some time to tag all of these.</p>
<p>But really, this list alone is a huge help already and I don't want to trouble you any further. I owe you a big favor now, just as long as it doesn't involve stub sorting&#160;:-P --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was very much bothered by your unwillingness to consider putting convention aside in a case that very many people didn't believe it applied to, and whether you meant it or not, your snide edit-summaries and comments further conveyed a sense that you refused legitimacy to any other position. That in addition to your closing the discussion just as the possibility of compromise was at least being discussed, left me feeling quite dissatisfied with your general management of it. I hope that you take my comments into consideration for the future. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 17:10, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering that users from the other POV hinted that some form of "Palestinian" might be acceptable, as well as numerous users from the POV that I argued, I don't think it is fair to imply that I was alone in pursuing this 'compromise.' Additionally, I am not bothered by convention per se, but rather your interpretation of how to apply it here; for all your efforts you have only ensured that the current stub name does not reflect any hint of reality (ie that the West Bank and Gaza Strip are a territorial unit known as "Palestine"). And while it is beyond me how you can equate my continuing to point that out with less than professional remarks on your end, I don't wish to bicker, but as you seem to be a serious editor, I hoped that you would actually be able to take what I say into consideration. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 16:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. Thanks for your helpful offer on my talk page. I have not got access to the dumps myself at the moment. If you could run the query to find all the category #redirects occasionally and email me the output (or keep up to date at, say, User:RobotG/Category redirects) then that would be a fantastic first step. Is there also a query you could do that would tell me if there were any articles that were in non-existent categories? That would be useful because I could make the bot gradually remove the categories from the articles, or create category #redirects to the correct categories, or mark the categories with {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}} as appropriate.</p>
<p>For the longer term, can you give me a quick tutorial how to get at the database dumps?

<dd>Thank you very much for this, Alai, it will help a lot. My longer term plan now is to use <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_redirect_art_cat_0302.html" title="User:Alai/redirect art cat">User:Alai/redirect_art_cat</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_category_redirects_0c06.html" title="Category:Wikipedia category redirects">Category:Wikipedia category redirects</a> together, as I was originally hoping.</dd>
<dd>Which dump did you get it from? Presumably you don't need the huge "full dump <i>with</i> history"!</dd>
<dd>Can I ask for a tweak? I don't need to know <i>which</i> articles are in the #redirected categories, merely a list of #redirect categories that are populated. (Unless, you have a use for both bits of information, of course?) I noticed the cross-namespace redirects too: it may be acceptable to just remove such categories from articles.</dd>
<dd>If you can run these queries regularly after each dump (eventually I hope I might be able to do it myself) then I think I may eventually get RobotG to convert the less-used {{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECategory_redirect_1b76.html" title="Template:Category redirect">category redirect</a>}}s to #redirects as it goes, because any articles put into them will be picked up next dump. That will mean that your redirect_WCD_arts is redundant, because the category will only contain the few most-regularly-populated cat redirects, the ones that it will be worthwhile RobotG scanning through each time (for instance, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_People_fb17.html" title="Category:Living People">Category:Living People</a> has articles added every day).</dd>
<dd>None of this is decided yet, of course: it may not be possible using the python pywikipedia framework, and I may have to investigate other avenues. The changes to RobotG won't happen overnight, in any case!</dd>
<dd>Thanks again for your assistance. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 17:52, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I was working on the <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rahm_1baa.html" title="Kevin Rahm">Kevin Rahm</a> article, and I noticed a double stub, that was caused by Alaibot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_Rahm&amp;diff=84174347&amp;oldid=80369168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_Rahm&amp;diff=84174347&amp;oldid=80369168" rel="nofollow">in this edit</a>.

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I created a South Africa sport category on 13 Nov but I forgot to create the template. Today, while creating the template, I discovered that not "Sport in South Africa" article exists, as the existing template "Belgium-sport-stub" had. Do you have a suggestion on how to remedy this short of creating an Sport in South Africa article?--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 21:38, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can you oppose stub categories that fit within the project's scope. This project covers the creation and editing of articles related to the City of Munich, its buroughs, geography, transportation, culture, history and so on. It aims to expand Wikipedia's resources on Munich in a fair and accurate manner. By deleting these stub categories, you're going against WikiProject Munich's scope by unfairly treating the categories by limiting the resources of the project. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 00:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do have a talk page template. DOn't get the stub categories deleted unless you're willing to replace it with something suitable. You not just going against me, you're going against an entire WikiProject. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 02:21, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Ignore all rules</a> policy is the policy that should be inforced here since the current stub rules prevent WikiProject Munich from improving and maintaining Wikipedia's Munich-related articles. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 17:20, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>G'day Alai - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist">User:The Transhumanist</a> has recently started an interesting project, a "virtual classroom" giving handy tips and quick summaries on how parts of WP work.

<p>I and a few other editors, collectively <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cue_sports_7220.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cue sports">Wikipedia:WikiProject Cue sports</a>, are trying to clean up the "billiards" mess you commented saliently on at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_16_a93c.html#Category:Pool_and_Snooker_computer_games" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 16">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 16#Category:Pool and Snooker computer games</a>. Ironically, Americans (who insist that "billiards" means either "everything to do with cue sports", "only carom billiards games" or "only pool" — we Yanks don't seem able to agree) have stymied the debate. It would be of value to have some non-'Merican input over here at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBilliards_4209.html#Move_of_this_article_to_.22Cue_sport.22" title="Talk:Billiards">Talk:Billiards#Move of this article to "Cue sport"</a>. The gist is, we're trying to rename the fatally ambigous main cue sports article "<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billiards.html" title="Billiards">Billiards</a>" to "<a href="../../../c/u/e/Cue_sport.html" title="Cue sport">Cue sport</a>" and work from there, but meeting signficant resistance that does not seem to <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grok.html" title="Grok">grok</a> that "billiards" means different things to different people. PS: I note that you did stop in to comment once, but the issue has moved along beyond the now-resolved question of whether the move was "non-controversial". — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 10:22, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I don't know if this is something for you (as the specialist stub-sorter and category-splitter), there seems to be a problem (clash?) with the category NN. There are many articles in that, and maybe they should be split into smaller chunks? Lately someone removed a large amount of tags from pages, where I think the tag was appropriate, maybe a solution is to change category there, and split the category up in small sub-categories? And, eh, well, if it is not something for you, just ignore and carry on with the good work!
