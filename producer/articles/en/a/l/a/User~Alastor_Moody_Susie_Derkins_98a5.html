<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlastor_Moody_Susie_Derkins_98a5.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>When Susie Derkins became the new girl in class and first appeared in the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_and_Hobbes_386b.html" title="Calvin and Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_strips.html" title="Comic strips">comic strips</a>, she was drawn pretty much as a young <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl.html" title="Girl">boy-and-girl dismussion</a> with little disribtion. At that time, she sometimes appeared in the strip only when Susie was being attacked by Calvin, or when she had her stuffed toy tea parties. In addition, she was described as mild-mannered and the fairest within the strip. Nevertheless, in the later years, she had a big relationships with <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_and_Hobbes_386b.html" title="Calvin and Hobbes">Hobbes</a> by inviting him to some over her "tea party" events. While having a calm, good side of her, she also has a fuusbudget habit of yelling constantly, similar to the behavior of <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_van_Pelt_63a7.html" title="Lucy van Pelt">Lucy van Pelt</a>. Though she isn't crabby, she'd easily get mad at Calvin and sometimes try to use physical violence.</p>
<p>But she would rather leave Calvin on his own, or either be seen constantly yelling and screaming at him. Susie is also Calvin's target in throwing <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowball.html" title="Snowball">snowballs</a> and water balloons at her, which he does frequently and often results Calvin getting the consequences of either getting backfired, being in a wild-goose chase by Susie, or having Susie snitch on Calvin to his mom. During around the few years before the strips came to an end, Susie was then well-known throughout the readers. She was normally seen wearing overalls or a simple dress or skirt.</p>
<p>Slowly did Susie change until when Watterson put Calvin and Susie together like when Ms. Wormwood's class had to give a project on a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planet</a>, but had to pair up with one partner. Instead, Ms. Wormwood herself chose the groups leaving Calvin and Susie together. Susie's and Calvin's objective was then to study about the planet, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28planet%29.html" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>. But during the process, Calvin was lazy and treated Susie to do all of the work and was frquently not coming to the library to do their project. Susie would then always complain for Calvin's immature behavior and drawing pictures rather than doing any research. She would then ask to trade partners or whine that she was going to fail the project for Calvin not doing the half of the project. By the time when the reports were given, Susie was seen rapping up her presentation and with Calvin coming up next. Before Calvin gave his presentation, he began a stupid introduction resulting in Susie yelling to Miss Wormwood that it wasn't her fault Calvin didn't do any work. But when Calvin began his report he only complained to the class why the planet was named after some mythological god instead of himself. Then, after Calvin's very short, and useless presentation, Susie threatened Calvin ti him by raising her fist in the air and walking toward Calvin with a nasty expression on her face. Later it showed Calvin explaining to Hobbes that he had failed the project by himself for not giving any effort to help and for not turning in his due project. But for Susie, she have received a grade A for only herself for trying to finish the project.</p>
<p><a name="Appearances" id="Appearances"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlastor_Moody_Susie_Derkins_98a5.html" title="Edit section: Appearances">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appearances</span></h2>
<p>During the Strips first years, Susie was seen wearing a dress or skirt with a large round elliptical head, much like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Brown_6d8c.html" title="Charlie Brown">Charlie Brown</a>'s round head. She was constantly seen yelling or screaming, mostly due to the reactions of Calvin. She slowly changed over the years.</p>
<p>Later, she was stereotyped as a young girl who was very playful and liked to play "house" or "doctor" and have her tea parties with her own stuffed animal toys. She would (rarely) ask Calvin to come over and play with her when she would make up her mind and try to get along with him, but they usually always end up yelling at eachother and with Calvin storming away.</p>
<p>But Susie was also known to begin annoying Calvin for her own fun and usually target snowballs at Calvin first, tease him about his negative stuff at him, use physical violence at him, and rarely would Susie use cuss words at him when outraged at him (although Susie dosen't believe in using bad words). But the reasons of why she does them are mainly unknown, but Susie once threw a snowball at Calvin, when he sent her an "I-hate-you" Valentine Day's card; but inside her mind, she was very impressed that he sent her a card and must have liked her.</p>
<p>But Susie is much of a loner herself since she dosen't have any known or ever mentioned friends. Although there are dozens of anonymous characters in Miss Wormwood's class, Susie, Calvin, and Moe were the only ones confirmed as real characters. But a few times, Watterson made a few one-shot students with given names. Nonetheless, Susie was once seen talking with another stuent, a girl named Candice who had long hair (possibly blonde hair color), wore glasses, and had freckles on her face.</p>
<p>Like Calvin, she has her own creative imagination, but Susie's <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> scenarios are more calm and less mean. She acts civilized, having tea parties for her stuffed animals. She is sometimes bossy, but really intelligent, serious in school, and gets good grades. But unlike Calvin, she is not a <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoiled_brat.html" title="Spoiled brat">spoiled brat</a>. In the later years, she evolved an appearance resembling <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pansy_Parkinson_a6be.html" title="Pansy Parkinson">Pansy Parkinson</a>, a girl in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> novels.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlastor_Moody_Susie_Derkins_98a5.html" title="Edit section: Characteristics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>Susie is the smartest in her class, receiving lots of good grades and remarks on her talented ability. But her weakness is sports since Susie doesn’t like or do any <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">physical education</a>. In addition, she dosen't have any friends. Although she rarely seen talking or playing with other kids, she mainly like to play by herself on small games or activities. One time, Susie had to stay in Calvin's house for the afternoon since her parents were working late. The strip showed her doing homework immediately after she came over and reading a book when she was done. When Calvin showed surprise at why she was doing homework early, Susie's reply was that she took piano classes after school. Although Susie is a respectful girl, she usually tattle-tales on Calvin to either Ms. Wormwood (when it happens in school), or to Calvin's mom (when not at school) which ends up Calvin usually in big trouble in both ways. But she also was known to get revenge on Calvin. One time, Susie's doll was stolen by Calvin in attempt to force Susie to pay up a ransom of <a href="../../../%24/1/0/%24100.html" title="$100">$100</a> in order to get her doll back. But then she stole Hobbes, leaving Calvin later paying for Hobbes' return for <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarter_%28United_States_coin%29_9ab9.html" title="Quarter (United States coin)">25¢</a>. Susie also has a "<a href="../../../c/r/u/Crush.html" title="Crush">crush</a>" on Hobbes since she says he is very cute compared to what Calvin says that he is a bloodthirsty, killing tiger. While being a hot-tempered girl at times, she is usually obedient at school and at home and respects her elders in a way Calvin thinks she is insane.</p>
<p>But usually, Susie has the upper hand to make Calvin the "loser", such as when she was having a waterfight with Calvin. At times, Susie knows how to bride Calvin to fail a big math test cause whenever Calvin dosen't study for an upcoming test, he has a habit of asking answers from Susie,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Calvin</b>: "Psst. Susie! What is the answer for 3+7?"</i></li>
<li><i><b>Susie</b>: "A gadzillion!"</i></li>

<p>Susie's and Calvin's social relationships are not smooth to eachother. They sometimes like to make and see eachother suffer. Since the strip's beginning, Calvin and Susie just didn't seem to like eachother at all. Since then, Susie mainly seemed to be an innocent victim, but in the later strips, when Watterson had confirmed Susie's behaviors to Calvin, it showed she was cunning and sometimes to blabber mouth on Calvin, which sometimes ended up Calvin in trouble with his mom, Miss Wormwood, or with Prinicpal Spittle.</p>
<p>At one time in a single Sunday strip during the strips mid-years, on a snowy <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentine%27s_Day_56e9.html" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a> morning, it showed Calvin and Hobbes going to their mailbox to see if they got any mail, which they regulary do. When they received a pink envelope, Calvin announced that it was a Valentine's card. When Calvin and Hobbes found out it said "Please be my Valentine", Hobbes dicovered it was from Susie Derkins and began teasing and mocking Calvin. When Calvin began to chicken-out he received a Valentine's card from Susie, he began to worry if he had to kiss her. After becoming insane with the love-letter, Hobbes pointed out that Susie was coming down the street. After a fit of childish reactions, he threw her card at Susie and yelled he hated her very much. Until then, Susie later revealed that she had intentionally sent the card to Hobbes instead.</p>
<p>Hobbes in the meantime was then mocking Calvin with an annoying song while Calvin was "doomed" he got a love note from Susie. Also, the stanzas of Hobbes singing a his silly song at Calvin also went something like this...</p>
<p><br />
"Calvin and Susie, sitting on a tree!<br />

<p>Unlike, Calvin's relationships with Susie, Susie rather likes Hobbes. She usually likes to hug him and calls him "cute". But at times, she would try to lure Hobbes into her tea parties with her stuffed toy animals. Although Hobbes usually dosen't mind, Calvin becomes very angry when he hears word about it. At one time when Susie asked Calvin and Hobbes to come over to a tea party she was planning, Calvin immediately refused leaving Susie feeling very disappointed and depressed for going into the trouble of asking him. But then Hobbes asked Calvin if Susie was going to be having any <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookies.html" title="Cookies">cookies</a> in her tea party since she usually brought out real cookies during her stuffed animal tea parties. Because Calvin had a big craving for cookies, he became irrestiable and finally decided to join in. But when Susie saw him coming, she asked if he would now come. Calvin's reply was, "Were not here to join parties, were here to crash them." It was also known that in the strip, Susie was only known to fall in love with Hobbes rather than flirt around with any other boys in the strip which strongly included Calvin. But the only boys ever known her Calvin, Moe, and a wide variety of anonymous students in Calvin's <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_school.html" title="Elementary school">elementary school</a>, which limited on who for Susie to fawn over with.</p>
<p>Susie, like most of the other characters in the strip, see Hobbes as a plain stuffed tiger slightly bigger than herself. In contrast of knowing Calvin as the the owner of Hobbes, she would sometimes bring along Hobbes to hang out with her. In a single strip when Susie was having her own birthday party, she invited Hobbes to come while only mentioning Calvin as the stupid kid Hobbes can bring to her birthday party, if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Another time was when during the strip's earliest years, Calvin and lost Hobbes due to a fact that a stray dog had chased him down and kidnapped Hopbbes. Susie later found Hobbes laying on the ground which she then began to wonder whom it belonged to. Without knowing the owner, she decided to take him to one of her stuffed animal tea parties. Calvin in the meantime was looking for Hobbes when Susie appeared and asked him if he was wanting to join in her of her stuffed tea parties. Calvin then rejected at her and said he was looking for his lost tiger, Hobbes. But after things became hopeless, Calvin finally plucked up the courage to ask Susie if she had seen Hobbes. But when he finally made his move, he went up to a brick fence and asked Susie if she had seen a lost tiger. Then he screamed out "Hobbes!" and ran up to him and gave Susie thank-you kisses on her hand. After leaving, Susie later discovered that someone had stolen the cookies, and finally suspecting Calvin.</p>

<p>Although Susie was rarely seen together with other characters in the strip other than Calvin, Hobbes, Calvin's mom, Principal Spittle, and Ms. Wormwood, she was yet seen in a very small number of strips with other students in her class. At one time in the strip's later ages, she was seen talking with another students sitting right next to her when Calvin was bring his "Stupendous Man" costom to school. The student Susie talked to was a female student with a name of Candice who had long, blone hair and wore glasses, asking Susie if she lived near-by him. Susie's reply was, "I barely know him Candice!". Nevertheless, Susie was never seen together with Moe, another classmate of Susie and Calvin's who enjoyed bullying over Calvin.</p>
<p>Also in a series of strips based on the same story during the strips's early days, it showed Calvin one morning all grouchy for having his mom waking him up so early and wishing that he was dead. But in a next strip, it showed Susie coming by and asking him how his insect project went by. Then Calvin was seen surpised that he has forgotten all about his project which was due on that day. Then Susie told Calvin to quickly run home and get it before the school bus had left. But Calvin then explained that he had not even began the project and pursaded Susie to help him find any bugs before class. While in his rush, Susie then told Calvin a lecture of why not doing any work done and not caring anything about school nor his grades. But then after seeming hopeless, Calvin then asked Susie if he could buy her project for 30¢. By the time class began Calvin then demanded Susie for some supplies but all he got in response was telling him to give up the project and saying that he had already failed. But as there conservation continued, Ms. Wormwood then caught Susie talking in class, and told her to sit in front of the class. In the next strip, Calvin wrote an insulting letter to Susie by passing notes in class. When receiving the note and reading the message, Susie then decided to write back to Calvin only to be caught by Ms. Wormwood again and being sent to the princpal's office. After worrying so much, it then showed Principal Spittle and Susie in a chair talking to each other while Principal Spittle explaining to Susie that she had done nothing wrong, since he had seen what happened in the class from a video camera hidden in the class. Then it showed Susie returning to class and Calvin asking if she had told the principal until a smug grin on Susie's face showed Calvin that she had told. The last panel of the strip showing Ms. Wormwood telling Calvin to come up to her desk. Then at a later time, it revealed Calvin explaining what was his day. It showed that he got in trouble for truning in his late project (which he eventually got a D- on although Susie earlier stated he couldn't even get a least an F+), not paying attention in class, and for getting Susie in trouble. Then he said he got in more trouble by both of his parents and after wrapping up his story, it ended Hobbes reminding him to do his book report.</p>

<p>One of Calvin's best friends is Susie, mainly since Susie is a girl. Later, Calvin created his own club called G.R.O.S.S. (a.k.a. <b>G</b>et <b>R</b>id <b>O</b>f <b>S</b>limy Girl<b>s</b>) which included Calvin as the Supreme Dictator For Life, and Hobbes, otherwise First Tiger Hobbes. The club's main objective is to annoy and bother or play pranks on girls which includes Susie. But at times, in the strip, Hobbes would sometimes abandon Calvin in his missions and become "a wishing captive of the enemy" to Susie, as Calvin says. But the club, itself is very disorganized at times, and so far, had no sucessful attempts to bug Susie except for a few times when they have either partial succesful missions or winning a moral victory. Nonetheless, whenever a mission has ended, Calvin would then begin to give awards, medals, and honors to the club, which is usually only Calvin and Hobbes.</p>
<p>At one time when Calvin and Hobbes cooked up a prank on Susie, their objective was then to make a fake "coded" message, in which it was actually a message spelled bckwards and upside down. The message was to lead Susie to Calvin's house where Calvin and Hobbes could throw waterballoons at Susie. But when Susie had not appeared, Calvin went to look for Susie when he was surpisenedly attacked by Susie and soaked with a water hose. Then it ended Calvin getting all wet and vowing that the war goes on and they were going to get revenge on Susie. Later, it showed Calvin's mom bring lunch to him along with some comic books. Then it finally ended Calvin eating sandwiches and reading comics with Hobbes all afternoon.</p>

<p>Unlike all of other characters in <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, Susie Derkins was the only character with a full last name. The surname "Derkins", came from Bill Watterson's wife's family <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beagle.html" title="Beagle">beagle</a>, which was found out to be a beagle. Although much of the pure reason remains unknown, Miss Wormwood, her school teacher, once reconginized her as "Miss Derkins", when Susie was "caught" talking in class.</p>
<p>Also it was mentioned that Susie also had a mother and father who lived nearby Calvin's house. Although they were unseen, in contrast of Calvin's parents usually visible at the time, it was clearly known that her parents were then also known as "Mr. and Mrs. Derkins" due to the family's well-known last name, although usually Susie calls her parents as "Mom" and "Dad".</p>
