<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Didak_a9bf.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Didak has always been a gifted football player, playing in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/SANFL_91a2.html" title="SANFL">SANFL</a> seniors with <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Magpies_0f0f.html" title="Port Adelaide Magpies">Port Adelaide</a> at 17 years of age, and was the captain of the junior side in a series against <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. He was drafted by <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood_Football_Club_b05a.html" title="Collingwood Football Club">Collingwood</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_AFL_Draft_60fb.html" title="2000 AFL Draft">2000 AFL Draft</a> with their first pick at number 3. 'Dids' made his <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">AFL</a> debut in his first season at the club against the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Melbourne_Football_Club_8dbc.html" title="North Melbourne Football Club">Kangaroos</a> at the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telstra_Dome_ff94.html" title="Telstra Dome">Telstra Dome</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001 he only played the 5 games, but it was his second year at the club where he made his stand. A decent midfielder in his junior levels, he was made into a half-forward at Collingwood. He played his first game for the season in Round 4 and had an impact, but the next week he was statless, and his form had a same trend of inconsistency being dropped weeks later, but his performances for <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williamstown_Seagulls_2962.html" title="Williamstown Seagulls">Williamstown</a> earned him another go in Round 10, where he played every match but one for the season. He was used sparingly in the forward line and chipped in with 3 goals in each of the Round 13 and 14 clashes, but his match against <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorn_Football_Club_2b9f.html" title="Hawthorn Football Club">Hawthorn</a> saw him kick 5 goals. He played in all 3 finals for the club, but didn't have a major impact in those matches, only kicking 2 goals, and didn't kick a goal in the Grand Final against the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Lions_4cd4.html" title="Brisbane Lions">Brisbane Lions</a>. He earned a <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Rising_Star_64b7.html" title="AFL Rising Star">AFL Rising Star</a> nomination during the season.</p>
<p>During the 2002 season when the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basement_Jaxx_fe9e.html" title="Basement Jaxx">Basement Jaxx</a> song <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where%27s_Your_Head_At__7baf.html" title="Where's Your Head At?">Where's Your Head At?</a> was released, many Collingwood fans sung the song "Where's Your Didak?" at games, which became one of the most popular chants at football matches.</p>
<p><a name="2003_season"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Didak_a9bf.html" title="Edit section: 2003 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2003 season</span></h2>
<p>Didak played every game in 2003, and kicked 36 goals as a goal-sneak. He kicked 3 goals in a game four times, including in the Grand Final against Brisbane for consecutive years, this time it was in a match when Collingwood were convincingly beaten. He continued to be inconsistent as his career has proven to be. At times he went missing and scoreless which was a concern to himself and fans. As a small-forward it was expected, and believed to be a wasted talent sitting in the forward line when he was so dominant as a midfielder in junior years, and when played in the centre.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Didak_a9bf.html" title="Edit section: 2004 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2004 season</span></h2>
<p>2004 wasn't as convincing as 2003, but he showed more maturity and continued to show glimpses as a senior player. His main problem in the season was his inaccuracy, kicking 21.26 over the year, but he still averaged more than a goal a game, playing 18 games. On <a href="../../../a/n/z/ANZAC_Day_e650.html" title="ANZAC Day">ANZAC Day</a> against <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon_Football_Club_46a8.html" title="Essendon Football Club">Essendon</a> he took one of the marks of the year over Essendon player <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Welsh_479c.html" title="Andrew Welsh">Andrew Welsh</a>.</p>
<p><a name="2005_season"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Didak_a9bf.html" title="Edit section: 2005 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2005 season</span></h2>
<p>In his 2005 season, it was quite interrupted with several injuries and problems. He had knee surgery during the pre-season, setting him up for his first game on <a href="../../../a/n/z/ANZAC_Day_e650.html" title="ANZAC Day">ANZAC Day</a> against <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon_Football_Club_46a8.html" title="Essendon Football Club">Essendon</a>. His injury had an effect upon his performances, with him only kicking 3 goals in his first 4 matches back, but it was not to worry too long, before having a good run of form, kicking 14 goals in his next 4 games, including 5 goals against <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geelong_Football_Club_e3ed.html" title="Geelong Football Club">Geelong</a> and 4 goals against Hawthorn. Having niggles since the mid-year break, he was suspended in round 14 for 2 matches, and returning from that he injured an ankle. It wasn't too serious the ankle injury, but his next week return lasted only 20 minutes, when Didak suddenly fainted on the ground with an irregular heart beat, and missed the rest of the season through the illness, but was just a precautionary act, and there was no damage done.</p>
<p><a name="2006_season"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Didak_a9bf.html" title="Edit section: 2006 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006 season</span></h2>
<p>2006 was Didak's most outstanding season. He played every game including one final and was awarded a half forward position on the coveted All Australian team. A season highlight came in Round 20 against Port Adelaide, when after a relatively quiet night he kicked the winning goal with less than one minute remaining. He was ultimately rewarded with the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copeland_Trophy_1675.html" title="Copeland Trophy">Copeland Trophy</a> as the best and fairest Collingwood player for 2006. Didak would kick a career best 41 goals in his 23 games, and would also play his 100th match against <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton.html" title="Carlton">Carlton</a>, where in that match he would lay a controversial bump on former team-mate <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_Scotland_aa21.html" title="Heath Scotland">Heath Scotland</a>. His consistency had continued and had shown the football public he is a top footballer.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2006, Didak was involved in an <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_rules_football_incidents_0063.html" title="List of Australian rules football incidents">off-field indiscretion</a> with his girlfriend, model Cassie Lane at Boutique nightclub in Melbourne. Surprisingly, this story made the front page of the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_Sun_1ee3.html" title="Herald Sun">Herald Sun</a>. Again, in October of that year, he was arrested for refusing to pay what he considered an "unreasonable price" to a <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxicab.html" title="Taxicab">taxi</a> driver for a short trip. Didak said he was "shocked with all the media and publicity that's come out of it [the incident]." <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20534253-11088,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20534253-11088,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Two nights later, he attended the Copeland Trophy count, the award of which he was the winner.</p>

<p>In December 2006, Didak split from Cassie Lane, a former Temptation Island contestant. She received much criticism for her outfit at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Brownlow Medal">Brownlow Medal</a>.</p>
