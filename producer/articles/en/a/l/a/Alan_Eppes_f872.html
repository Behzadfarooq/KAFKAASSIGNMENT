<p>Alan Eppes is the amiable father of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Eppes_7737.html" title="Charlie Eppes">Charlie</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Eppes_3818.html" title="Don Eppes">Don Eppes</a>, and is particularly protective of his younger son, Charlie. He is a widower and retired <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_planner.html" title="City planner">city planner</a>, and in "Waste Not", Charlie referred to him as an <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineer</a>. He keeps busy by getting involved in the personal lives and careers of his sons (though he does not understand the intricacies of what Charlie does for a living) as well as volunteering for causes he believes in. It makes him proud to see his competitive sons working together. Alan worries about his sons being able to settle down and have a family, especially given their problems in maintaining relationships with women for extended periods of time. Recently he had been on his first date since his wife's death, with a caterer he was fond of, and has once more taken up work, investing in a consulting firm with Stan Fisher, which is related to "all his years in urban infrastructure." He is currently dating <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NUMB3RS_characters_4feb.html#Mildred_Finch" title="List of NUMB3RS characters">Dr. Mildred "Millie" Finch</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chair_%28official%29.html" title="Chair (official)">Chair</a> of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division.</p>

<p>For much of the first two seasons, his wife's name was never mentioned in the show, though she was referred to on the set as Margaret. He met Margaret when she was working for a tenants' rights organization and he was working for a housing developer. Alan held onto his wife's clothes, which he hid in the garage, despite Don helping him pack it six months before. When Charlie showed concern, he told him it was none of his business. Don confronted him as well, but both were criticized for giving advice as unmarried men and Mr. Eppes finally decided to get rid of the clothing on his own. After Charlie found a musical composition for the piano by his mother under her maiden name, Margaret Mann, in the Eppes garage, Alan revealed to his sons their mother's talent with classical music and her training in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. He was astonished when his son noticed that some of her other compositions were dated after the birth of their children as he thought she had put her music work aside for her law career to help the family. Alan has seen his wife (<a href="../../../j/o/b/JoBeth_Williams_ddbb.html" title="JoBeth Williams">JoBeth Williams</a>) in a dream at the same time as Charlie.</p>

<p>Alan volunteered his son's house for Valerie Eng's (a girl Don and Charlie both liked during high school) wedding, toiled over coordinating every detail, and assigned the seating arrangement to Charlie, who created a mathematical <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> for it, though Charlie didn't overall seem too enthusiastic about it. He claimed that since he never had a daughter, this would be his chance to make amends.</p>
<p>Alan has considered moving out of his son's house in order to live alone (something he has not done in forty years) and accomplish things on his own, but was rather hesitant to tell Charlie. He was shocked when his son seemed fine with it. Don tried to persuade him to take a place next to a <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a> court, as his eldest son is fond of the game. Alan finally decided against moving, since he favors his sons' company over being alone. He wants a new staircase to his room. Moreover, he wants Charlie to be more responsible in maintaining the house and be able to have a family. After giving Charlie a hard time about his chores, he seemed to grasp Charlie's situation more fully after a comparison to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein's</a>.</p>

<p>Like Don, he enjoys <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>. He has attempted to persuade Charlie to take up <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a> like him, delighted that he can at least teach his brilliant son something. He sometimes works on puzzles to occupy his time when not busy, continuing his wife's hobby and allowing time for conversing with Charlie's colleagues, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_NUMB3RS_48fd.html#Larry_Fleinhardt" title="Characters of NUMB3RS">Larry Fleinhardt</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_NUMB3RS_48fd.html#Amita_Ramanujan" title="Characters of NUMB3RS">Amita Ramanujan</a>, over pizza.
