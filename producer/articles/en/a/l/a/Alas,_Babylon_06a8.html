<p>The novel's title is derived from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelation_4ea8.html" title="Book of Revelation">Revelation</a> 18:10, which is interpreted and quoted in the book as describing the aftermath of a nuclear attack. In the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Bible_1b4e.html" title="King James Bible">King James Bible</a>, this passage reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour is thy judgment come.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This title was also used because the signal that a war was starting was "alas, Babylon."</p>

A former <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> infantry officer, he ran for the state legislature and was soundly defeated because he supported the Supreme Court decision of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_9aee.html" title="Brown v.

This changes when his brother, Colonel Mark Bragg, sends him a telegram with the code words "Alas, Babylon"—their private code for disaster. Mark, who is on the Air Intelligence staff of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Air_Command_6b3b.html" title="Strategic Air Command">Strategic Air Command</a> (SAC), is certain war between the United States and the Soviet Union is imminent. He sends his wife Helen and children Ben Franklin and Peyton to stay with Randy in Fort Repose, Florida.</p>
<p>Randy privately warns those people of Fort Repose who he believes to be his friends; including Malachai Henry, his gardener.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-11_Tiger_8833.html#Trivia" title="F-11 Tiger">U.S. Navy fighter</a> fires a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat-seeking.html" title="Heat-seeking">heat-seeking</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> at a Soviet reconnaissance aircraft that same day. The missile goes off course and hits an ammunition depot at <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latakia.html" title="Latakia">Latakia</a>, Syria, resulting in an explosion that may include nuclear devices. This event is the pretext (called in the text a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casus_belli.html" title="Casus belli">casus belli</a>) for the Soviet Union to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States.</p>
<p>Early the following morning, Mark is on duty at SAC headquarters in <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omaha%2C_Nebraska_e00c.html" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>. He suspects an attack is imminent. He recommends that SAC ask for the authority to use nuclear weapons since the weapons-release process takes about a minute and a half, and the U.S. expects only about a fifteen minute warning if the Soviet Union were to attack. This is granted. Later, when American radar reports an attack underway, the SAC commander says to him "Thanks for the ninety-five seconds."</p>
<p>In Fort Repose, Randy and his houseguests are awakened by shaking. "The Day" has begun. The effects of the war, called "The Day", on Fort Repose are varied. Tourists are trapped in their hotels. The local bank manager tries to get instructions from <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacksonville%2C_Florida_dcd8.html" title="Jacksonville, Florida">Jacksonville</a> as Jacksonville is destroyed. The local <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_jockey.html" title="Disc jockey">disc jockey</a> nervously reads instructions on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/CONELRAD_7bed.html" title="CONELRAD">CONELRAD</a> system. The only reliable method of news from the outside world is a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortwave.html" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> receiver owned by one of Randy's neighbors, a retired U.S. Navy admiral. Convicts break free of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_gang.html" title="Chain gang">chain gangs</a>; the local retirement homes are filled with panicked people; and the flash from a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_blast.html" title="Nuclear blast">nuclear blast</a> over the city of Tampa temporarily blinds Randy's niece, Peyton.</p>
<p>As the effects of the disintegration of society get worse, many prominent people fail. The local banker commits suicide once he realizes money is useless. Randy's political rival obtains looted radioactive jewelry and becomes seriously ill with radiation sickness. Randy, instead, grows stronger. He organizes his immediate neighbors to provide housing, food, and water for themselves, organizes the community into self-defense, guides his family, and helps find salt and new supplies of food when they grow short. He fights "<a href="../../../h/i/g/Highwaymen.html" title="Highwaymen">highwaymen</a>" who murder residents and assault the local doctor. Some in Fort Repose discover faith; others degenerate into drunkenness. Randy and his family fare the best, though, for when Randy needs something, he commandeers it. He is backed up legally by an order of President Josephine Vanbruuker-Brown (who was the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_Health%2C_Education%2C_and_Welfare_5440.html" title="United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare">Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare</a> when "The Day" came) for retired officers to form local militias; however, the Admiral, who would have been senior officer, takes Randy's orders, based on Randy's take-charge attitude.</p>
<p>Also, his niece, Peyton, discovers an attic of antique wonders--a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victrola.html" title="Victrola">Victrola</a>, old-fashioned <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_razor.html" title="Straight razor">straight razors</a>, a treadle <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machine.html" title="Sewing machine">sewing machine</a>--in his ancestral home, allowing the families to adapt more easily to life without electricity.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">Air Force</a> finally makes contact with Fort Repose again, the community has survived, but at a cost.</p>

<p><i>Alas, Babylon</i> depicts fallout and radiation as an invisible threat, rather than a roaming "cloud of death" as in other novels such as <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Beach_c71a.html" title="On the Beach">On the Beach</a></i>. Its theme is "You can survive if you are ready and willing to adapt."</p>
<p>The book also portrays nuclear war as arguably winnable. When the Air Force personnel find Randy and his survivors, they are asked about the outcome of the nuclear exchange and are told: "We won it. We really clobbered 'em!" (The value of this victory is questioned, even by the speaker, who adds, "Not that it matters"; he has already explained that the "victorious" United States now has a smaller population than prewar France, and will be accepting lend-lease shipments of foodstuffs from South America, Thailand, and Indonesia.) The book presents the post-apocalyptic situation as grave but survivable, that even within the so-called "contamination zones", it is possible for communities to continue. The U.S. government is presented as functioning in uncontaminated areas, and working to help survivors as best as possible in contaminated zones. This depiction is very different from later books and films on nuclear war.</p>
<p>In the foreword of the 2005 edition of <i>Alas, Babylon</i>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Brin_c616.html" title="David Brin">David Brin</a> admits that the book was instrumental in shaping his views on nuclear war and had an effect on his own book, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Postman_902a.html" title="The Postman">The Postman</a> (pp. xi-xii, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-06-074187-2</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints.asp?imprint=Harper%20Perennial%20Modern%20Classics" class="external text" title="http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints.asp?imprint=Harper%20Perennial%20Modern%20Classics" rel="nofollow">Harper Perennial Modern Classics</a>).</p>
