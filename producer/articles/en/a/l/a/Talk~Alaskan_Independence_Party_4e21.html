<p><i>Its most well-known plank is its call for a vote on secession, which they claim was not offered as an option in the plebiscite on statehood.</i> - shouldn't that read "which they claim <i>should have been offered</i> as an option"? It's impossible to make claims about what actually was on the plebiscite, as opposed to what should've been on the pebliscite <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENik42_afcf.html" title="User:Nik42">Nik42</a> 04:29, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>They are correct in stating that it was not offered upon the ballot. International law said that it should have been, therefore the article is correct in that sense.</p>
<p>Some examples of the ballots are still on file at the <b>United States National Archives and Records Administration - Alaska Region</b> offices (654 W. 3rd Ave, Anchorage, AK, 99501); I've handled them while an employee, but I didn't read them.</p>
<p>The wording was most likely yes/no question; Alaskan non-office elections almost always are, and almost always have been, both before and after statehood. (I happen to live in Alaska. The AIP is hardly pushing the secession issue in Alaska. I'd never heard it elsewhere than here; I never looked, either.) I can't actually go check; I'm not permitted to publish any research done in that office until 2009. Someone else could, however, request a copy.</p>
<p>The assertion about Hickel not following their platform is questionable, and clearly political, and does NOT belong there. (I would agree with it, however... )</p>

<dd>FWIW, plebiscites on statehood in the U.S. are non-binding, since the final decision on admitting new states is up to Congress. Even the Puerto Rico plebiscites, which have always resulted in at least a plurality in favor of the status quo, could be overruled if Congress saw fit to do so. Of course, such an action by Congress would be politically difficult.</dd>

<dd>I was registered as an AIP voter for a part of the time I lived there during the '90s. I never had any doubts at the time that secession was one of their ultimate goals, though I had no illusions that a plebiscite could ever actually result in independence. Whether their stance could reasonably called "pushing" secession might be subject to debate. I have the impression that since Vogler's death the party has drifted toward trying to present a more mainstream face. 24.178.126.182 21:05, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, I agree. I was born and raised in Anchorage and understood from the very earliest days of my political awareness that the AIP was all about <i>independence</i> in the sense of leaving the union. It was just understood that this political goal was relatively unattainable, and so they focused their energies on other subjects. I've had AIP friends who've said as much. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Crippen_b05d.html" title="User:James Crippen">Jéioosh</a> 21:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree. I think it's perfectly acceptable, encyclopedic, and honest. He did basically use the party affiliation so he wouldn't have to deal with the state Republican Party, and for all intents and purposes ignored the AIP after his election. Other than his arguments for increased resource exploitation, greater private property ownership, and lower taxes, Hickel really didn't do anything in support of AIP goals, and I think this was even commented on in editorial media. I'm sure if you could find a scholarly history covering his tenure you'd probably find the same claim. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Crippen_b05d.html" title="User:James Crippen">Jéioosh</a> 21:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's still massively opinion, and belongs not on the AIP page, but on a Walter J. Hickel page.</p>
<p>As to the independence issue: it's not been a major facet of their <b>public</b> face since I became aware of them circa 1980 (in Jr. High). Jéioosh, we have met... and your "earliest days" go <i>well</i> before my own... by the mid 1980's, their people coming to the Chugiak HS government classes were not pro-secession; pro-secession rhetoric was not being used by the party publicly in the various fora I've followed.</p>
