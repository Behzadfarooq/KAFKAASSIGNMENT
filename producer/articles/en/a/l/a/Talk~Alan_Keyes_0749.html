<li>The claim that Keyes throwing his daughter out of the house was met with 'widespread acclaim' is unsourced and doesn't seem to have any supporting evidence. This sentence should be removed. I will do so shortly if there is no disagreement on this point.</li>

<li>"In spite of Keyes' experience as a U.N. ambassador, he has been critical of the U.N. itself." I believe this sentence bears positive sentiments towards the U.N.

<p>"The show and websites champion conservative issues and causes including opposition to abortion, affirmative action, gay rights and seeks the enslavement of African-Americans. "</p>

<dd>As long as he's an Illinois resident with an Illinois address and runs in an Illinois political race, which he is, he is an "Illinois politician." Because this will be one of those prominent historical races in Illinois that will be remembered for a long time (first U.S. Senate race between two Black men), I think his name should be kept on the Illinois politicians category even if he loses and moves back to Maryland. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerald_Farinas_ff16.html" title="User:Gerald Farinas">Gerald Farinas</a> 16:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From reading the article, I know he's black, and a Republican. But what are his politics? The article needs to discuss his unique brand of evangelical anti-federalism. Some choice quotes should demonstrate his proud wingnuttery, like this exchange when he was on <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1191581/posts" class="external text" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1191581/posts" rel="nofollow">Fresh Air</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>DAVIES: You were quoted as saying in the year 2000, quote, "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there." You're from Maryland, running in Illinois. Have you changed your mind, or are the standards different in your case?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>KEYES: Oh, no, no. The standards are the same, and I have not changed my mind. And I think that what Hillary did, I would still criticize roundly, because she self-evidently shopped around America, looked carefully to pick a state that would serve her personal ambition, prepared the ground, went in in order to construct a basis for pursuing her personal ambition, and was consciously translating her national standing and reputation into a bid for a seat for power--regardless, really, of the principles of representational integrity and state sovereignty. That's not what I'm doing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DAVIES: Well, you are a man of some . . . yeah. . . .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>KEYES: I didn't have any thought whatsoever of coming here to run. It was not something that was on my personal agenda in any way. I was approached by people in Illinois, by their own decision--which is what makes it formally consistent with sovereignty. But even more important, the federalism issue that I raised is very important to me, but federalism has two components, which, as I've reminded people, are wonderfully summed up in the state motto of Illinois. It's "state sovereignty, national union." Federalism has two parts. I think we ought to respect the state sovereignty part and not sacrifice it to personal ambition--but when the principles of our national union are at stake, Lincoln, for instance, recognized in his statesmanship that you must limit your allegiance to state sovereignty in order to defend the principles of our national union. And those principles are at stake in this race because Barack Obama is deeply committed to a stance on abortion and other moral issues that rejects the founding principles of this country. And as I thought it through, I said, "Look, I have a moral obligation, after all I've said in life, to go in and defend those principles, because if I didn't, people would think I was an outrageous hypocrite."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DAVIES: Well, let's get to that. I mean, you made a lot of headlines in the Illinois papers early in this campaign by saying that Barack Obama had, I believe, "the slaveholder position" on life, because of his position on abortion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>KEYES: Absolutely.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DAVIES: Awfully strong words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>KEYES: Not so much, just logical. It's just rational. It's an argument, because the slaveholder position--as reflected in, say, the position of somebody like Stephen Douglas. He was a pro-choice candidate back [then] on slavery. He said he didn't care whether it was voted up or voted down, so long as it was done by popular sovereignty, which meant "the people's choice." And Abraham Lincoln came forward and excoriated him because of the stance of indifference to our fundamental moral principles, and Lincoln referred to the Declaration of Independence: "All men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." The same indifference, exactly, is involved in the issue of abortion, the notion that somehow you can look at the life in the womb and say the mother's choice determines our respect for it, when our principles say that every human being, regardless of circumstance, development, or condition, the worth of that human life comes from the Creator--that's what the Declaration states. So, just as the slaveholder and people like Douglas were willing to disregard the worth of black Americans on the basis of their choice, so we have people like Obama today saying we can disregard the God-given worth of that babe in the womb because of our choice--and in doing so, they reject the fundamental principle that Lincoln asserted, that Martin Luther King asserted, that Frederick Douglass and others asserted, that we must respect the conscience shaped by the Declaration on which this country was founded. I believe that, and I think that it's clear that Barack Obama does not. And so, I'm not calling him names or anything, I'm just saying, "Look! The principle at stake is the same, and his position is like the position of Stephen Douglas and others who were the slaveholders' favorites in those days."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Considering that the author of the Declaration of Independence was a slaveholder, Keyes' tortured defense of his "slaveholder" attack is nonsensical.</p>
<p>Often people make principled declarations yet follow it up with unprincipled actions...its called hypocrisy. Just because Jefferson was a hypocrite does not invalidate the principles in the Declaration of Independence themselves. Keyes argument was not protection of Jefferson, it was protection of the principles he formulated in the the DoI. Your confusion of the two is nonsensical.</p>

<p>The addition of "U.S." before "Senate" in the headings seems OK to me, but it seems to have been accomplished by a revert-then-edit. (I had corrected "ahd" to "had". My edit summaries don't always describe every such change.) I've now restored that correction, and fixed caps in headings: "Senate" should be capitalized, but not "summit". <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 01:21, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems redundant to me, given that the intro establishes the context as a U.S. politician. It would read oddly to me if, for example, the article on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Chirac_001d.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> kept making reference to his races for "Prime Minister of France" rather than simply saying "Prime Minister" after the context was established. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 08:49, Sep 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not redundant because there are more than 50 legislative houses called "senate" in the United States. "U.S. Senate" makes it clear. <a href="../../../a/c/s/User%7EAcsenray_d459.html" title="User:Acsenray">Acsenray</a> 15:06, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The original article stated "A devout Roman Catholic, Keyes does not believe in the separation of church and state and favors a view that the founding fathers of the United States intended the laws of the country to be based on principles of religion."</p>
<p>This is incorrect. Keyes believes the 'founding fathers' intended the laws to be based on the principles of Christianity not religion.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this page, there's a photo of the Keyes family, with the caption, "Keyes is married to Jocelyn Marcel Keyes; they have two children, Francis and Andrew, and one daughter, Maya." This is awfully weird wording. Shouldn't it be, "two sons, Francis and Andrew, and one daughter, Maya"? I mean, daughters and sons are both types of children, yes?</p>

<p>I broke up the section on media and advocacy and moved the racial commentary under its own header. Is this an improvement?</p>
<p>Revised: "Keyes has repeatedly spoken in themes of race and racism, often accusing others of racism." This is a silly exaggeration. (Jesse Jackson, et al, would give Keyes a run for the money in the racism-accusing department.)</p>
<p>Following that statement were examples of the alleged accusations of racism. The accusations regarding media racism were easily verified, sourced, and corrected. The paragraph below no so:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> Keyes reportedly accused Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead of racially insulting him and then quit his post there. Media reports also claimed Keyes accused the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_National_Committee_6379.html" title="Republican National Committee">Republican National Committee</a> of racism in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> when the GOP did not give him a prime speaking spot at the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_National_Convention_c1fb.html" title="Republican National Convention">Republican National Convention</a> (the RNC later gave him 2 speaking spots). Keyes would apparently again accuse the GOP of racism when they pulled their support for his trailing candidacy for the Senate in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless the above can be verified and sourced, it likely falls under the exaggeration category typical of this page, and deserves the axe (or at least more tweaking). The words reportedly, claimed, and apparently were added by me to give some balance to the unproven statements. There is always another side to the story. That is missing from this paragraph (and from much of this page, for that matter).</p>
<p>I have spent the day cleaning up this page from its slew of inaccuracies, wrong dates, quotes used without context, positions on issues actually reversed, and editorializing. I would like to see the important facts surrounding this public figure expanded, and the irrelevancies and obvious pot-shots reduced.</p>

My entire purpose at this time is to defend the Catholic Church's policies on things like this. Yes, the Catholic Church doesn't approve of Abortions. Yes, according to #34, the Catholic Church reserves the right to excommunicate women who themselves have had an abortion. Also, of note in #34, there's a <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunt.html" title="Shunt">shunt</a> which also says it's alright to vote for a canadate who doesn't favour restricting abortion as long as they are in a party that favours restricting abortion. Sounds like silly Conservative Catholic bias to me. Conte's fuzz on his logic leads him to be an unreliable, and more importantly, he does not dictate an official Catholic stance on the matter by being a lay member of society (and of course, not the [primate]). As of now, there is no official Catholic stance on who a Catholic should vote for. I've had to deal with this over the past eight years without fail. Now, another fun fact, Chicago is a grand Catholic city, in many ways. Now, if every Catholic in Chicago voted for Keyes, Keyes would have won by a landslide. But that didn't happen. Personally, I find this section very debatable and in need of change for a more updated factual basis on the Catholic vote in Illinois. Personally, Chicago's Archbishop Leadership <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Cardinal_Bernardin_5933.html" title="Joseph Cardinal Bernardin">Joseph Cardinal Bernardin</a> discussed the Seamless Garment <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bernardinwade.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bernardinwade.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for years. Lastly it sounds like the Catholic Church is attempting to endorse Keyes, which is a violation on their <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax-exempt.html" title="Tax-exempt">tax-exempt</a> status.

<dd>There's some real idiots in the church - both clerical and lay - that have decided that to be a good Catholic a Catholic <i>must</i> vote Republican. Not Democrat or anything else, only Republican. They don't care if they violate the church's tax exempt status in the process. These idiots tends to look down their noses at everyone - including the Pope if he isn't Catholic enough for their tastes. Most Catholics I know - including priests - aren't in that category. It doesn't mean we vote straight ticket Democrat, but it doesn't automatically mean that they vote Republican either. The attitude my friends and I took was anyone but Bush. In fact I wrote my parents in for both President and Vice President. Because with what we got in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> for choices, my parents would have beaten both Bush and Kerry hands down for being worthy of those offices. And where I live, the traditional neturality was respected, from the Archbishop on down. It wasn't a case of vote this or else.<br /></dd>

<dd>Alan Keyes has spoken at the Steeling the Mind Bible conferences. He has also written a Christian article in the book "Steeling the Mind of America," Volume II. I have it in my hand, now. He is a very vocal proponent of Christian and biblical values. Therefore, he is indeed a Christian leader, a Christian minister, and a Christian writer. The conclusion that he is also a creationist is the logical conclusion made after acknowledging his faith in Jesus Christ. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 04:26, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Except "logical conclusion" is original research. And not all Christians support creationism, many are opposed to the creationist movement.

<li>Some thoughts. Are you saying that any Christian writer is automatically a minister and a leader? If that is the case what is the distinction between these categories?

<dd>A Christian writer <b>is</b> a Christian minister. His or her writings minister to others. However, a Christian minister <b>is not</b> necessarily a Christian writer. This is what keeps the categories meaningful. Example: JP Holding is a minister. He is not an author. Keyes is both.</dd>
<dd>A Christian writer isn't necessarily a Christian leader, but if his book is read by millions it would certainly bring him into consideration as one. Nonetheless, Keyes is a Christian and he was an ambassador, so that qualifies him as a Christian leader.

<dd>By your definition it seems that any prominent Christian is a Christian leader. is this how you define Christian leader? If so, the category is going to be overwhelmed by Christians that most people do not consider to be Christian leaders. When users go to the category Christian leaders they are expecting to find popes, Billy Graham, Rev Moon and other similar figures in Christian history. Please address this point since it makes no sense to have most Christians in every Christian category.</dd>

<p>So in your view "creationism" is an extremely wide tent. It basically includes anyone who believes in religion. That's one way of looking at it. But the standard way of looking at it is that "creationist" means someone who says life was created by God pretty much in its present form rather than evolving over millions or billions of years. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 21:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>i will continue here since the indents are getting out of control. Roman catholics are definitely Christian. Where does wiki distinguish them as something else? The moral is don't believe everything you read on wikipedia. With regard to Kenneth Miller (who is a roman catholic Christian) I don't know what his position is on Creation. I know he does not have a problem with evolution, so it is possible he is an example of a Christian who believes that God set the universe in motion (created at the time of the big bang) and then the rest of history just followed the physical rules without the intervention of God. If he does believe this, and insists he is a Christian, would you still categorise him as a creationist? Or are you saying these people have to form a off shoot religion from Christianity?</p>
<p>While we are at it, are creationists only Christian or should the term, with respect to the wikipedia categories, also include other religions? <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 21:46, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are we to once again be subjected to self-serving attempts by Gastrich to force Wikipedia to be conform to his views of what is and is not a "Christian?" His claim that Wikipedia makes such a "dictinction" between Christians and Catholics is entirely disingenuous, and is influenced by his own peculiar reading of Wikipedia text and his anti-Catholic bias. Notice his "I" talk: "All I see is that he is an evolution proponent," according to Gastrich. Not only is that good enough for <i>him</i>, and should require no more thought or consideration, it must be good enough for everyone else, as well, at least at Wikipedia. A dispassionate view, uncolored by religious biases, clearly reveals that Catholicism is simply a specific form of Christianity, as distinguished from Protestantism. One can further study the history of the Christian movement and understand the roots of the controversy, but they must not be allowed to color the content of a secular encyclopedic resource. If all Gastrich sees is an evolution proponent, in large part because Miller is Catholic, then his view is slanted, biased, and laden with a non-neutral POV. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 21:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Neither does history or common sense. There are many kinds of Christians, though we all know about the "true Scotsman" application with respect to that sort of thing, and we also know about the general arrogance of those whom claim that <i>their</i> particular or favored group has it right, while everyone else has it wrong, somewhere or somehow.</dd>
<dd>It is fair to say that, in a very general sense, all Christians are creationists, that is, if we decide that "creationist" is someone who believes that the Universe was created by God through some mechanism or another. However, the last 45 years or so, particularly, have forced a specific view upon us, that is, that creationists are generally thought to be those who view certain specific passages in the Bible as literal history, leading them to believe that the Universe, and the Earth with it, were created in literally six, twenty-four hour days. If that's the accepted definition of a creationist, then there are lots of Christians who don't meet that criteria, just as there are also lots of Christians who don't think that God had any hand in the natural history of the Universe beyond its initial creation. Of course, to some, these aren't "real Christians," either. In the end, however, <i>Christian theology and tradition</i> says that it's God who makes the determination and it's God who knows. No one, claiming to be a Christian, has the right to decide whether someone is a Christian or not (and I can certainly debate those aspects of Scripture that are interpreted to say otherwise). If Kenneth Miller says he's a Christian, that's good enough. If he's a practicing Catholic, that's evidence of his Christianity, since Catholicism is a Christian religion. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 22:17, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Michael Behe definitely believes that creation has happened after the first living organism. He does not seem to believe in kinds being formed intheir present form. I should point out that i misspoke inthe paragraph above. i meant to say the the creationist category should be reserved for those that believe in the biblical creation or Behe style creation. Those Christians that believe that "God never ceases to maintain control and control all of creation" but believe the creation occured prior to the formation of earth should not be considered creationists. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 20:23, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed not, and they tend to have their own viewpoints and believe what they believe despite attempts to classify or pigeonhole them into neat little categories. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 20:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, that's what I said (or, rather, wrote), and I stand by it. That you don't know of any and appear to subscribe to unnecessarily restrictive definitions of Christianity and theism does not mean that those concepts do not have application outside of your experience. Theism is simply a belief one or more higher beings with "godlike" attributes, but it does not <i>require</i> that he/they/it continually demonstrate those attributes or that he/they/it always demonstrate and never relinquish control or guidance of the Creation. I've run into quite a few Christians (def., followers of Jesus) who are pretty close to deistic in their view of God's participation in the Universe. In fact, before I ultimately abandoned the faith, entirely, that was my view, having seen no evidence of God's intervention, anywhere. Regardless, arguments from incredulity are hardly compelling, but they should at least be properly identified. It may be that you don't know any Christians like that, but they <i>do</i> exist, and I suspect that you may find that they compose a larger percentage of professing Christians than might be supposed, if they were to be honest with themselves and with you. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 05:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may have a good example of someone who is a Christian who is not a creationist, but we won't know unless we read what he says on the topics of his faith and belief about creation. For the sake of categorization, we might want to research this man's words or just call it an abberation. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a></dd>

<dd>There is no doubt that there are different sects of Christianity. i agree with that interpretation. but the issue here is how do deal with Christians that do not believe in the creation of life on earth. I do not know if Kenneth Miller is such a person although he is the one public figure that comes to mind. I do not believe he is an abberation, many in the Church of England think that way, many scientists who are religious think that way too. So you need to consider their position under the umbrella of Christianity. Despit the fact that your own version of Christianity does not harbor such beliefs this does not mean you can shoe horn others into wikipedia categories. In summary, it is wrong to say ALL Christians are creationists. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 22:14, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to Wiki's article on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>, the category of Creationist can include other faiths. For instance, it would be fully possible for a theistic evolutionist to reject Christ and still believe in creation. Now, if the term category were "biblical creation," that would be another story.</dd>
<dd>Hope these things help. Glad we could discuss this. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 21:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes and this leads to the problem of what is the category intending to convey. i was under the impression it was a narrow category that was representing the subset of Christians that belive in biblical creation. If it is the very broad version of Creationism then you open the category up to Hindu and other religions. I don't particularly care how it is defined (braod or narrow) but i was under the impression that it was the meant to be the sub set of Christianity category. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 22:14, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At this point, I see only two options. 1) We follow Wiki's definition of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> and use that as our benchmark for the Creationists category. This means it would remain a broad category and include anyone who believes God created. 2) We delete the Creationists category and use YEC, OEC, and perhaps other more specific categories. What do I say? I'm open to the consensus, but I like the idea of having <b>both</b> general and specific categories, so I vote we keep Creationists and follow Wiki's definition of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> when it comes to each entry's conclusion. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 22:42, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I didn't get beyond the statement that Keyes is a neocon. The writers lack of knowledge was exposed at that point - either about Keyes' views or what a neocon is precisely.</p>

<p>Last night, I looked at this profile and saw there was absolutely nothing written about him as a controversial figure. In fact, reading this you would have little idea that he even ran for Senator of Illinois. There is also absolutely nothing written about the fact that he and his wife essentially disowned their daughter for being gsy - not unlike Randall Terry. So what I did was create a "controversy" section detailing some of Keyes's more outrageous moments, the Mary Cheney incident for example. Then there was the fact he criticized Hillary Clinton's campaign in New York and yet ran for Illinois senate where he had no prior connections.</p>
<p>The fact that all of these things are omitted appears to be part of a campaign to make Keyes look better than he is. All I know is that if nothing else, there needs to be a controversy section because being an outspoken anti-gay, anti-abortionist activist, he should at least have a controversy section to detail his views of homosexuality as "selfish hedonism".</p>

<p>Is it not also notable to that this Politician who was rabidly anti-gay also has a daughter who came as a lesbian a few years back?</p>
