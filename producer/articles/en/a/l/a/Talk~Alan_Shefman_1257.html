<p>How can you justify this interim councillor stay when you are taking down other "Full-Time" city councillors, the deputy mayor and the mayor. This article is nothing more than a self promotion posted by Shefman's son and updated by himself. Please explain to me why you think the lowest position on council deserves an article but the "full-time" councillors, regional councillors, deputy mayor and mayor are being blanked?--69.156.151.42 06:31, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Ferri article was not blanked because he doesn't deserve an article, it seems to have been blanked because it was poorly written, unformatted, and overly gushing.

<p>Basicly you are saying this article of a "interim" councillor deserves to have the self promotion content but all other more senior positions "full-time councillors, regional councillors, Deputy Mayor and Mayor don't deserve this as you guys keep blanking there article. Also, why do you keep taking the "interim" portion out of this article to give the false impression that he is a full term councillor? If you insist that this article stays as is then revert all the other more senior articles. --69.156.151.42 16:52, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted a few sentences at the end. Nobody is interested in irrelevent facts on Shefman's life. This is something that is best left to his Campaign flyers. <i>above unsigned by user 70.29.239.249</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The unsigned comment above is quite PoV. <b>If</b> we continue to keep Vaughan Councillor pages, which I don't think we should (see my suggestion for one big vaughan city council page), then they should be accurate. serving on the BoG of a University is not NN and doesn't warrant deletion, especially with some of the stuff being kept on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Strelchik_72ef.html" title="Simon Strelchik">Simon Strelchik</a>. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 01:24, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dah well</p>
<p><i>above unsigned by user 70.29.239.249</i></p>
<p>I'm stil waiting for you to report me. It's funny, because you think your version of this page is the correct version. You sound like Vaughan City Council, you should try and run in the future.<br />
<i>above unsigned by user 70.29.239.249</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I've reported you. And no, it's WP policy not to make major edits during a deletion debate. Plus, the current version had previously been agreed to. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 02:42, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with user VaughanWatch, why does Shefman have so much information, while the mayor only has one sentence. Cue the Prime Minister... <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.29.239.249.html" title="User:70.29.239.249">70.29.239.249</a> 04:50, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, because no one knows enough about DiBiase to write a full article, while I did have enough knowledge, yes, because I'm his son, to fill out this article. It's quite simple really. Is it a conflict of interest? Yes, we've established that. <i>Get over it</i>. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 05:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>He is not an interim councillor. Interim implies that it is temporary. According to Dictionary.com; "Belonging to, serving during, or taking place during an intermediate interval of time; <b>temporary</b>" There is no reason for it to be there, he is of equal rank to all other local councillors. We've already had this discussion in the VfD, we all agreed that DiBiase and Ferri should have their own articles, as should hte other local councillors, I don't see why this should be such a problem. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 00:21, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please explain why "interim" councillor was removed. Wasn't he elected to this position in a by-election half through the term? If he was elected in a by-election then he is the interim councillor as he would be the councillor NOT elected in the general election but filling in until the next general election. Interim is commonly used in these situations, websters dictionary defines interm as "in the meantime".--67.70.148.49 20:47, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, interim is defined as "temporary". Interim implies exactly what you say, "in the meantime" as if he's just holding it for someone else. He won an election, if you want to distinguish that it was in a by-election rather than a general election, you can specify that with simply (elected in By-Election). To say 'interim' though is patently false. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 21:24, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This man is NOT notable. The Mayor of Vaughan has 2 or 3 sentences, though a veteran of Vaughan Council for 21 years; the local Councillor Alan Shefman, chosen in a by-election 13 months ago, has 2 pages.</p>
<p>Why? Because Alan Shefman's son is pm_shef and he is a staunch Liberal. Why do councillors Mario Ferri and Sandra Yeung Racco have two pages (before I shortened them today) and councillors Linda Jackson, Joyce Frustaglio, Peter Meffe, Tony Carella and Bernie di Vona have two lines? Because both Ferri and Racco are proclaimed Liberals, and everybody else is not; even Racco's spouse, Mario Racco, is a Liberal MPP. And being a Liberal seems to be the criteria for receiving glorified, self-promotional encyclopedia listings in Vaughan. And help from pm_shef .</p>
<p>To the admin reviewing this article, I plead with you - for the sake of objectivity, of encyclopedic integrity, remove this article and place it among the heap where over 5000 other councillors of Ontario are confined. *Delete <a href="../../../v/a/u/User%7EVaughanWatch_62a5.html" title="User:VaughanWatch">VaughanWatch</a> 04:51, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh give me a freaking break VaughanWatch. You know <b>full well</b> that the reason the other councillors/mayor don't have full articles is because no one on here knows enough about them! We've gone over this a thousand times, and this latest post is simply rhetoric, nothing more. SimonP hits the nail on the head, if you have a problem, expand DiBiase's article. Oh, but then again you're probably too busy making articles for NN nobody's like Ruffolo. I'm politically biased? Ha, look in the mirror. <b>Oh. and thank you very much, I voted NDP in the last election.</b> Shows how much you know. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 05:37, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The definition of a <b>nobody</b> is a councillor from the City of Vaughan (or pretty much any other Canadian city that isn't Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto). They should either all be deleted or they should be kept to a two sentence maximum. It takes 5 minutes of research on Mayor Di Biase or Linda Jackson to write what you've done for your father. Just go to the Vaughan website and look at the bio. I'm sure all of them has served for the local public library. Give me a break.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shefman, you are the <b>most politically biased</b> one in here. I did a search on Corey Shefman, and apparentely, the Mayor made a little speech in your honour earlier this year. Maybe you can recount some stories from that and post it up. <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.29.239.249.html" title="User:70.29.239.249">70.29.239.249</a> 06:07, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Precisely what SimonP saidâ€”there's lots of interesting stuff about Di Biase out there; wasn't there a scandal not so long ago about him fixing traffic tickets? Bulk up his coverageâ€”make it a bette article!</dd>
<dd>By all means correct any factual inaccuracies introduced by Pm shef or anyone else. But <i>don't</i> delete swaths of text from articles because you think that we have too much information.

<li>1)The mayor gave a speech in my honour because i won a prestigious award of the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, I'm sorry that I win awards.

<li>Oh will you <i>please</i> give it a rest. I didn't redirect this because it is currently undergoing an AfD debate and it is <b>against the rules to blank a page that has been nominated for AfD</b>. Thus, since I <b>respect</b> the rules, I left it up. Would you have preferred that I break the rules and have done the redirect? And finally, if you are going to accuse me of "politically motivated attempts" you're going to need to substantiate it. You and that anon editor have been accusing me of bias and political edits for the last week and you <b>have yet to give one example of bias</b>. You continue to make these claims, yet have been unable to give even one example of me breaking WP policy. Why?

<ul>
<li>To respond to this uncivil response from Eyeonvaughan, I don't think it's appropriate to redirect while AfD is open, and then, we shouldn't redirect this page unless the consensus on AfD is delete; there's a lot of info here, and that info would all be lost in a redirect. You and some of the other Vaughan-specific editors hounding this article seem to think that it's reasonable to want to limit this article to being very short and not including information. That's not the Wikipedia philosophy. As people have told you repeatedly, if you feel that some articles are too short, improve them; it DOESN'T go the other way around. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 12:52, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
