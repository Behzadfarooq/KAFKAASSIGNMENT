<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Eagleson_9cef.html" title="Edit section: A hockey power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A hockey power</span></h2>
<p>Eagleson, then a lawyer in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, first became involved with hockey as an advisor to <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Pulford_5364.html" title="Bob Pulford">Bob Pulford</a>, a player with the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_bc61.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. That led to other members of the Leafs becoming clients, most notably <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defenceman_%28hockey%29.html" title="Defenceman (hockey)">defenceman</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Brewer_8761.html" title="Carl Brewer">Carl Brewer</a>, who hired Eagleson as his agent. When the NHLPA was formed in 1967, Eagleson was appointed its first executive director, a position he held for 25 years. He was also active in promoting the sport, helping to organize the historic 1972 Summit Seriesâ€”the first time Canadian and Soviet pros had ever competed against each other on the ice. Notably, Eagleson was responsible for the decision to exlude many <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Hockey_Association_fb62.html" title="World Hockey Association">WHA</a> stars from the Summit Series, including <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hull_d326.html" title="Bobby Hull">Bobby Hull</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Cheevers_9286.html" title="Gerry Cheevers">Gerry Cheevers</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Sanderson_3fd3.html" title="Derek Sanderson">Derek Sanderson</a>. Four years later, he organized the first Canada Cup.</p>
<p>During one of the Summit Series games in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, Eagleson garnered international attention by attempting to assault one of the referees after the latter failed to light the goal lamp when a Canadian player scored, at which point he was seized by soldiers of the Soviet army. The Canadian players and the few Canadian fans rallied to his defence to prevent him from being arrested, providing one of the most memorable off-ice moments of the series.</p>
<p>Within a decade, he was one of the most powerful men in hockey, and was even elected to the <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame_1a24.html" title="Hockey Hall of Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1989 as a <a href="../../../b/u/i/Builder_%28hockey%29.html" title="Builder (hockey)">builder</a>--the only known instance where a union official has been elected to the hall of fame in a major team sport. The same year, he was named an Officer of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Canada_843d.html" title="Order of Canada">Order of Canada</a> for his work in promoting the sport.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Eagleson_9cef.html" title="Edit section: Political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
<p>Eagleson was also active in politics for many years. In the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1963.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1963">1963 federal election</a>, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> for the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservatives</a> in the Toronto riding of <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_West_80cc.html" title="York West">York West</a>. He was defeated by hockey player <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Kelly_82a6.html" title="Red Kelly">Red Kelly</a> who ran for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberals</a>. Later that year, he was elected to the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Legislative_Assembly_901c.html" title="Ontario Legislative Assembly">Ontario Legislative Assembly</a> as the Progressive Conservative <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Provincial_Parliament_ca49.html" title="Member of Provincial Parliament">Member of Provincial Parliament</a> (MPP) for the Toronto riding of Lakeshore, serving there until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. He was a major PC fundraiser and, in the late 1960s, president of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario_4e61.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario">Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario</a>. He was a member of the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Blue_Machine_60eb.html" title="Big Blue Machine">Big Blue Machine</a> that dominated Ontario politics for much of the 1970s and 1980s. At one point, his name was even bandied about as a potential candidate for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister_of_Canada_5dd6.html" title="Prime minister of Canada">prime minister</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Disgrace" id="Disgrace"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Eagleson_9cef.html" title="Edit section: Disgrace">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Disgrace</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, several former players led by Brewer accused Eagleson of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeering.html" title="Racketeering">racketeering</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embezzlement.html" title="Embezzlement">embezzling</a> player pension funds, particularly those raised from the ticket sales of the 1972 Summit Series.</p>
<p>He was also accused of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collusion.html" title="Collusion">colluding</a> with teams whose management he favoured, such as the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Blackhawks_a40d.html" title="Chicago Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>, to hold down salaries. For example, after Orr's contract with Boston ran out, Eagleson told Orr that the Blackhawks had a deal on the table that Orr couldn't refuse. It later emerged that the Bruins offered Orr one of the most lucrative contracts in sports history, including an 18 percent stake in the team; however, Eagleson never disclosed this to Orr.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the work done in exposing Eagleson's crimes was conducted by Brewer's long time companion Susan Foster and American newspaper writer Russ Conway of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Eagle-Tribune_849c.html" title="Lawrence Eagle-Tribune">Lawrence Eagle-Tribune</a>, a paper located just outside Boston. Conway ran a series of stories detailing Eagleson's activities that was eventually turned into the book <i>Game Misconduct.</i> The first series of reports forced Eagleson to resign as NHLPA executive director in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Eagleson was charged with skimming off money intended for the NHLPA pension fund and disability insurance money. The NHLPA, it turned out, had unknowingly footed the bill for expensive clothing, theater tickets and a luxury apartment in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Eagleson pleaded guilty to three counts of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_fraud.html" title="Mail fraud">mail fraud</a> in Boston and was fined $700,000. Later that year, he pleaded guilty in Toronto to three more counts of fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars of Canada Cup proceeds in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> and 1991. He was <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disbarment.html" title="Disbarment">disbarred</a> and sentenced to 18 months in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">jail</a>, of which he served six months. Since being released, he has largely remained out of the limelight, although he was interviewed on television after Canada's loss to Russia in the 2006 Olympics.</p>
<p>Soon after his guilty plea, he was <a href="../../../r/e/m/Removal_from_the_Order_of_Canada_9453.html" title="Removal from the Order of Canada">removed from the Order of Canada</a> (though he continued to wear his lapel pin during the court proceedings prior to his sentence). He also resigned from the Hockey Hall of Fame after the Hall's board informally voted to expel him (a formal vote, which was almost certain to pass, was due within a few weeks). The Hall had tried to stay out of the controversy, but was forced to act after Orr (who once looked on Eagleson as a big brother), <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hull_d326.html" title="Bobby Hull">Bobby Hull</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordie_Howe_0dc3.html" title="Gordie Howe">Gordie Howe</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Bucyk_2378.html" title="Johnny Bucyk">Johnny Bucyk</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Lindsay_8506.html" title="Ted Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Richard_7805.html" title="Henri Richard">Henri Richard</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Park_fe3c.html" title="Brad Park">Brad Park</a> and other prominent players threatened to pull out of the Hall if Eagleson were allowed to remain a member.</p>
<p>Defenders of Eagleson point out that during his tenure as executive director of NHLPA, both salaries and pension benefits increased exponentially, offering real security to players that had not existed prior to that time. During the criminal proceedings against him, several players whom he had defrauded were amongst his biggest supporters. Moreover, prior to Eagleson's involvement, Canadian professionals had never participated in international hockey, an involvement that has now grown into involvement in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Hockey_Championship_5b02.html" title="World Hockey Championship">World Hockey Championship</a>, the World Cup of Hockey, and the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Olympic_Games_94a5.html" title="Winter Olympic Games">Winter Olympic Games</a>.</p>
