<p><b>Alan Oliver</b> is a veteran <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a> and chief sports writer for the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evening_Chronicle_05d5.html" title="Evening Chronicle">Evening Chronicle</a>. He is the main <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_United_777b.html" title="Newcastle United">Newcastle United</a> reporter and often appears on <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Sports_News_3b98.html" title="Sky Sports News">Sky Sports News</a> and other national media outlets to discuss news concerning the club. He has covered Newcastle for more than 20 years and is arguably one of the most prominent sports reporters working in local newspapers. He wrote a book about the Kevin Keegan era entitled Geordie Messiah. More recently he has appeared on the Chronicle website in a frequent video feature, in which he discusses the latest Newcastle news and matches, as well as having a column in the Newcastle matchday <a href="../../../e/v/e/Event_programme.html" title="Event programme">programme</a> in which he tells anecdotes about the local footballing media.</p>
<p>He can be a polarising figure among supporters. In recent years some Newcastle fans have come to view him as the unofficial mouthpiece of Newcastle <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a> [[Freddy Shepherd]. And some take issue with his writing style, which can merge news reporting with comment.</p>
<p>But even his harshest critics would have to admit that during his time at the Chronicle, he has been the prime force in establishing it as arguably the number one choice for fans looking for news about their club. His record in getting accurate stories about potential Newcastle United transfer stories during at least the last 10 years is without peer among other journalists in the local and national media. His stories and interviews on the back of the Chronicle are picked up by the national press on an almost a daily basis, routinely without attributation.</p>
<p>He had a world exclusive when he broke the news that Newcastle were signing Alan Shearer. However he does not have a 100% record in predicting transfer targets - probably no football reporter does - and, for instance, was wrong when he predicted a few seasons ago that Brett Emerton would join the club.</p>
<p>Some fans have accused him of favouring the players prepared to give him interviews. Numerous players and managers have fallen out with him over the years because of his criticism of performances including Arthur Cox, Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Peter Beardsley, Andy Cole, Craig Bellamy, Barry Venison, and Lee Bowyer. Graeme Souness once said of Oliver: "That man gives my players three out of ten [in player ratings]."</p>
<p>He continues to have a good relationship with Shearer, and <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Ferdinand_f108.html" title="Les Ferdinand">Les Ferdinand</a>, among other players. He is close to <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Roeder_f868.html" title="Glenn Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a>, the current manager who he first established a rapport with when he was a centre half at the club when he was still playing.</p>
<p>Arthur Cox, stung by Oliver's critcism of the way his side were playing, once bungled him into the Newcastle dressing room to give the pre-match teamtalk. "If you're so clever, you tell them what to do," Cox said, leaving Oliver and the players more than a little stunned.</p>
<p>His can be a difficult job: on any given day he can get a dozen emails or letters castigating him for criticising one player and another dozen saying he was spot on. Newcastle is a well documented hotbed of football and the team is probably the most discussed subject in the region by some distance.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, after a game against <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_b55b.html" title="Tottenham Hotspur">Spurs</a>, he was involved in a fracas in the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_James%27_Park_ec57.html" title="St James' Park">St James' Park</a> press room when Newcastle <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midfielder.html#Winger" title="Midfielder">winger</a> <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurent_Robert_7120.html" title="Laurent Robert">Laurent Robert</a> confronted Oliver after comments made following a defeat to <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_Wanderers_0985.html" title="Bolton Wanderers">Bolton Wanderers</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/2624917.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/2624917.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, although the Chronicle said Robert had actually confused Oliver with John Gibson, a fellow Chronicle sportswriter. <a href="http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/news/tm_objectid=12489845%26method=full%26siteid=50081-name_page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/news/tm_objectid=12489845%26method=full%26siteid=50081-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Some fans have criticised his treatment of foreigners compared to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">British</a> players, particularly <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geordies.html" title="Geordies">Geordies</a>. During Newcastle's search for a manager in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he claimed during an interview with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mag_af50.html" title="The Mag">The Mag</a> that he 'shuddered' at the thought of a foreigner taking charge, despite four of the top five teams in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> being managed by non-British managers at the time. His treatment of certain Geordie players, such as Lee Clark, has been criticised by some fans.</p>
<p>However, he has been a great supporter of some of Newcastle's foreign stars, such as Nolberto Solano, and, during the early part of his spell there, David Ginola.</p>
<p>Because of his profile and his personal writing style he has occasionally been a victim of parody from Newcastle supporters. After <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_FC_25be.html" title="Liverpool FC">Liverpool's</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_UEFA_Champions_League_Final_1f05.html" title="2005 UEFA Champions League Final">Champions League win</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, one Newcastle supporters' website featured a spoof article by "Alan Doh'liver", claiming that Liverpool's victory was a hollow one because of their <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> manager, <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Benitez_dac6.html" title="Rafael Benitez">Rafael Benitez</a>, and a lack of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouse.html" title="Scouse">Scousers</a> in the team.</p>
<p>However, he also remains popular with many fans. He irregularly appears at talk-ins at pubs in the region with people from the club and is generally well-received.</p>
<p>Of his job, which many Newcastle fans would love to do, Oliver has said: "Newcastle fans, like fans from any club, always think their opinions are more correct than anyone else. So it can be tricky because there's probably tens of thousands of fans who think they can do it better than me. But I have travelled all over Europe and the world following Newcastle and would not change a thing. I just hope Glenn Roeder can win a trophy for Newcastle's magnificent supporters."</p>
