<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_W._Livingston_cf46.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Livingston was born in <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%2C_Pennsylvania_a873.html" title="McDonald, Pennsylvania">McDonald, Pennsylvania</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. He was the youngest of three children, whose mother encouraged reading books and playing musical instruments. He began his career in the entertainment business leading his own college orchestra as a student at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. After graduating from the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wharton_School_7af3.html" title="Wharton School">Wharton School</a> of Finance and Commerce with a B.S. in Economics, he moved to New York where he worked in advertising for three years. At the start of World War II, he enlisted in the army as a private and served as a second lieutenant in the infantry. After his discharge, he borrowed some money, hitched a ride on an army plane and headed for <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California where he obtained his first position with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_df10.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>, Inc. in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> as a writer/producer.</p>
<p><a name="Capitol_Records" id="Capitol_Records"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_W._Livingston_cf46.html" title="Edit section: Capitol Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Capitol Records</span></h2>
<p>His initial assignment was to create a children's record library for the four-year old company, for which he created the "<a href="../../../b/o/z/Bozo_the_Clown_0be1.html" title="Bozo the Clown">Bozo the Clown</a>" character. He wrote and produced a popular series of storytelling record-album and illustrative read-along book sets beginning with the September <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> release of "Bozo at the Circus." His record-reader concept, which enabled children to read and follow a story in pictures while listening to it, was the first of its kind. The Bozo image was a composite design of Livingston's, derived from a variety of clown pictures and given to an artist to turn into comic-book-like illustrations. Livingston then hired <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinto_Colvig_cbc5.html" title="Pinto Colvig">Pinto Colvig</a> to portray Bozo on the recordings. Colvig, a former circus clown, was also the original voice of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s Pluto, Goofy, Grumpy, Sleepy and many other characters. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_May_b225.html" title="Billy May">Billy May</a> produced the music. The series turned out to be a smash hit for Capitol, selling over eight million albums in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Successful record sales led to a variety of Bozo-related merchandise and the first television series, "Bozo's Circus," starring Pinto Colvig on KTTV-Channel 11 (CBS) in Los Angeles in 1949. The character also became a mascot for the record company and was later nicknamed "Bozo the Capitol Clown."</p>
<p>Livingston wrote and produced many other children's recordings including products for <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>; <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Lantz_d857.html" title="Walter Lantz">Walter Lantz</a>'s <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Woodpecker_3063.html" title="Woody Woodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a>; <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugs_Bunny_5903.html" title="Bugs Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> and all of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> characters. In the case of the latter, he wrote the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> pop hit "I Taut I Taw a Puddy Tat" for <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Blanc_2b48.html" title="Mel Blanc">Mel Blanc</a>'s <a href="../../../t/w/e/Tweety_Pie_afca.html" title="Tweety Pie">Tweety Pie</a>.</p>
<p>Within a few years, Livingston moved on to the adult music arena and became Vice President in charge of all creative operations of the company. He signed <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> when Sinatra was at a low point in his career. Livingston wanted Sinatra to work with arranger <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Riddle_6d91.html" title="Nelson Riddle">Nelson Riddle</a>, however Sinatra was reluctant to do so out of his loyalty to <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axel_Stordahl_36dc.html" title="Axel Stordahl">Axel Stordahl</a> with whom he had worked for most of his career. The first Sinatra/Stordahl recordings for Capitol failed to produce the magic Livingston and producer Voyle Gilmore were looking for, and Sinatra agreed to try a session with Riddle on April 30, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. The impact was immediate, producing the classic "I've Got the World on a String." However, it was "Young-at-Heart" that became the defining moment in Sinatra's comeback, peaking at #2 during its 22-week run on the charts in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>.</p>
<p>Livingston has been credited as the creative force responsible for Capitol Records' growth from net sales of $6 million per year to sales in excess of $100 million per year.</p>
<p>He has also been officially credited as the inspiration for the distinctive <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_Tower_63e5.html" title="Capitol Records Tower">Capitol Records Tower</a>, completed in April <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, noted for being the first circular office building in the world.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>After 10 years with Capitol, Livingston and the company sold the "Bozo the Clown" licensing rights (excluding the recordings) to <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Harmon_83c9.html" title="Larry Harmon">Larry Harmon</a>, one of several people hired to portray the character at promotional appearances, as Livingston left the company to accept a position as President of California National Productions, Inc., the wholly owned film production subsidiary of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Broadcasting_Company_8a11.html" title="National Broadcasting Company">National Broadcasting Company</a>. Shortly thereafter, Livingston was also named Vice President of NBC, in charge of Television Network Programming, dealing principally with all films made for the network. In this capacity, he hired David Dortort to write and produce the pilot for the series "<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonanza.html" title="Bonanza">Bonanza</a>" for which Livingston's older brother, songwriter <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Livingston_2e92.html" title="Jay Livingston">Jay Livingston</a>, wrote the memorable theme. During this time, Alan also served on the Boards of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> Enterprises, Inc. and Joseph Mankiewicz's motion picture production company, Figaro, Inc.</p>
<p><a name="Return_to_Capitol" id="Return_to_Capitol"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_W._Livingston_cf46.html" title="Edit section: Return to Capitol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to Capitol</span></h2>
<p>Five years later, Capitol Records induced him to return as President and, eventually, Chairman of the Board. He was also named to the Board of <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">Electric and Musical Industries (EMI)</a>, a British corporation that was the largest stockholder in Capitol. Subsequently, he merged Capitol Records into Audio Devices, Inc., a magnetic tape manufacturer listed on the American Stock Exchange, and changed the name of the surviving company to Capitol Industries, Inc., of which Livingston was named President. It was during this period that he turned Capitol Records into a more rock-oriented company with such artists as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_6081.html" title="The Beach Boys">The Beach Boys</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Miller_%28musician%29_5308.html" title="Steve Miller (musician)">Steve Miller</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_86d7.html" title="The Band">The Band</a>, and others. His most noteworthy accomplishment at that time was signing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> for Capitol in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> and bringing them to the United States in 1964.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_W._Livingston_cf46.html" title="Edit section: Later ventures">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later ventures</span></h2>
<p>Livingston later sold out his stock in Capitol Industries to form his own company, Mediarts, Inc., for the production of motion pictures, records and music publishing. He eventually sold his interest in that company to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Artists_7688.html" title="United Artists">United Artists</a> as a result, particularly, of its success in the record business including <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_McLean_5a03.html" title="Don McLean">Don McLean</a>, who reached the #1 position in the country with his "American Pie" single and album in 1972. Two feature motion pictures were completed during the company's operation: "Downhill Racer" (1969) starring <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Redford_cfb9.html" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Hackman_126a.html" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>, and "Unman, Wittering &amp; Zigo" (1971) starring <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hemmings_9677.html" title="David Hemmings">David Hemmings</a>; both released by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>.</p>
<p>In August 1976, Livingston joined <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_Century_Fox_d2fe.html" title="Twentieth Century Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a> Film Corporation as Senior Vice President and President, Entertainment Group. He left in 1980 to accept the presidency of Atalanta Investment Company, Inc., and resigned in 1987 to produce a one-hour film for television and to form Pacific Rim Productions, Inc.</p>
<p>Livingston also wrote a novel titled "Ronnie Finkelhof, Superstar" about a shy Harvard pre-law student who becomes an overnight success as a rock musician. It was published by Ballantine Books in the spring of 1988.</p>
<p>On August 1, 1998, Livingston received his first honor for his creation of "Bozo the Clown" as the International <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clown_Hall_of_Fame_ca1e.html" title="Clown Hall of Fame">Clown Hall of Fame</a> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin presented him their Lifetime of Laughter Achievement Award.</p>
<p>Briefly married to the actress <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Hutton_534e.html" title="Betty Hutton">Betty Hutton</a>, Livingston is currently retired and married to actress <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Olson_96f1.html" title="Nancy Olson">Nancy Olson</a>, whose film credits include "Sunset Blvd." (1950) and "The Absent Minded Professor" (1961). They reside in Beverly Hills, California. Their son, Christopher Livingston, is a movie producer, director, writer and songwriter.</p>
