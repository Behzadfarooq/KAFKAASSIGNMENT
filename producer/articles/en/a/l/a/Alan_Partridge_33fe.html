<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: Character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character</span></h2>
<p>Partridge is rather insecure, superficial and narcissistic, concerned largely with the status and level of his fame and, to a lesser extent, the possessions this allows him to acquire (such as his beloved <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_%28car%29.html" title="Rover (car)">Rover</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexus.html" title="Lexus">Lexus</a> cars and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_%26_Olufsen_758e.html" title="Bang &amp; Olufsen">Bang &amp; Olufsen</a> stereo systems).</p>
<p>Whereas many of his personality defects are apparent in his appearances in shows such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_Today_c22c.html" title="The Day Today">The Day Today</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowing_Me%2C_Knowing_You_with_Alan_Partridge_3f42.html" title="Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge">Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge</a></i>, it is largely from <i><a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_Alan_Partridge_5855.html" title="I'm Alan Partridge">I'm Alan Partridge</a></i> onwards that his creators began to explore his personality in depth, and most of the observations that follow originated in that show. These shows depict a marked downturn in his fortunes as his BBC television career ends, and most of his life from <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i> onwards is consumed by his desire to get back onto television in any form, and the various (frequently disastrous) attempts he makes to achieve this goal. He is frequently found reciting surreal, and ever more desperate, ideas for programmes (several involving <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Youdale_c26d.html" title="Diane Youdale">Jet</a> from <i><a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladiators.html" title="Gladiators">Gladiators</a></i>) into a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictaphone.html" title="Dictaphone">dictaphone</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being a professional chat-show host, Partridge is socially incompetent and awkward. He displays deep insensitivity to social norms, and at times he appears a somewhat ghoulish character, displaying thoughtlessness, selfishness and lack of interest in anything or anyone outside of his own needs and desires. He seems unable to forge genuine friendships, usually needing only a sympathetic ear for his terrible jokes, comically banal topics of conversation ("bowl of bread there") and overall inanity. Most of his attempts to form friendships with others — such as the staff of the Linton Travel Tavern in the first series of <i><a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_Alan_Partridge_5855.html" title="I'm Alan Partridge">I'm Alan Partridge</a></i>, and the builders constructing his house in the second series — are doomed to failure, as others are quick to see his unpleasant, self-involved nature.</p>
<p>Among his few "friends" are <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Benfield_3c2a.html" title="Lynn Benfield">Lynn Benfield</a>, his put-upon and long-suffering personal assistant, and Michael, an emotionally tortured ex-soldier from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle-upon-Tyne_91d2.html" title="Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Newcastle-upon-Tyne</a>; it is notable, however, that he treats even these people with little more than disdain. In the first series of <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i> he does not even seem to be on first-name terms with Michael.</p>
<p>Despite showing them little concern or regard, Partridge nonetheless appears to expect them to be devoted to him in return, and is genuinely appalled when this is revealed not to be the case: in series one of <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i>, he threatens to fire Lynn when she laughs at a joke made at his expense and for "joining in fun in a way that excludes her employer". On one occasion in series two, upon discovering that Michael has other friends than just him ("Michael, what the hell's going on?"), Partridge breaks up their friendship before storming out in an over-protective huff.</p>
<p>Partridge appears not to have a particularly rich or detailed personal life. He often occupies himself with pointless or needless tasks, seemingly just to give himself something to do; in one episode, while still living at the Linton Travel Tavern, he walks to a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filling_station.html" title="Filling station">petrol station</a> to buy 12 bottles of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windshield_washer_fluid.html" title="Windshield washer fluid">windscreen washer fluid</a> for no apparent reason. The same episode sees him drive around a ring-road repeatedly and buying tungsten-tipped screws he has no intention of using. Abandoned by his friends on another occasion, he goes to an <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_arcade.html" title="Video arcade">amusement arcade</a> and reveals a childish tendency: "Then I fought some zombies with a boy in care. Wiped the floor with him."</p>
<p>Most of his interests appear to reflect his taste for the superficial and flashy; it is notable that he describes <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s band <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wings_%28band%29.html" title="Wings (band)">Wings</a> as "the band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> could have been". He is also fond of the music of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Bush_9841.html" title="Kate Bush">Kate Bush</a>, the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Light_Orchestra_bf45.html" title="Electric Light Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abba.html" title="Abba">Abba</a>, and appears to be stuck in a time warp with regard to modern society. He also boasts about his six-figure income and self-built five-bedroomed house in a "good part" of Norwich. His few hobbies include driving, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambling.html" title="Rambling">rambling</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birdwatching.html" title="Birdwatching">birdwatching</a> and collecting celebrity <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorabilia.html" title="Memorabilia">memorabilia</a>.</p>
<p>Politically, Partridge leans towards the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a>, and he is a strong <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatcherite.html" title="Thatcherite">Thatcherite</a>. His favourite newspaper is the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, a right-leaning publication which he claims is "arguably the best newspaper in the world". He is very pro-law and has a strong stance on criminality, viewing hoodlums and miscreants as "sub-human scum". He also favours the death penalty for treason and murder.</p>
<p>Sexually, he appears repressed, illustrated by the lengths he goes to deny any interest in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> "<a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathoey.html" title="Kathoey">lady-boys</a>" ("fascinating creatures, though. Looks like a lady, but really it's a man. I don't find them attractive, it's just confusing"). He describes himself as being a "homosceptic", but appears to possess some hidden <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoeroticism.html" title="Homoeroticism">homoerotic</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a> tendencies. In the first series of <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i>, he frequently finds himself fantasising about performing an <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_dancing.html" title="Erotic dancing">erotic dance</a> for a selection of men (usually those who can help further his career in some way, such as Tony Hayers) in a peephole <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pringle_of_Scotland_5ac7.html" title="Pringle of Scotland">Pringle</a> jumper and vulcanised rubber pants; he was also apparently once witness to naked <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bare-knuckle_boxing.html" title="Bare-knuckle boxing">bare-knuckle boxing</a> in a "barn in Somerset".</p>
<p>He can be prudish, too, as when he insists on "letting battle commence" with his soon-to-be-unemployed receptionist with the room in total darkness, then gets upset when she decides to apply chocolate mousse to his person. When it turns out that his new best friend Dan and his wife are <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swinging.html" title="Swinging">swingers</a> ("they're sex people, Lynn! They're sex swappers!") he leaves their house very quickly. Despite this, Alan and his ex-wife did once make love behind a large boulder in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helvellyn.html" title="Helvellyn">Helvellyn</a> for his birthday.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">Misogyny</a> could also be said to feature quite markedly in Alan's life. He tends to "objectify" women, often patronising those he comes across. In addition to his failed relationship with his ex-wife, almost every woman he meets ends up ridiculing, ignoring, or detesting him, because of his manner toward them. In the second series of <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i> he manages to sustain a romantic and sexual relationship with Sonja, a 33-year-old immigrant from Eastern Europe who is quite devoted to him, despite the linguistic and cultural barriers between the two and her scatterbrained personality. However, it is apparent that her affection towards him is largely unreturned and that his relationship with her is mainly based on the boost to his ego that their 15-year age gap provides (which he is frequently heard boasting about). "I love you... in a way", he says at one point, and after comparing her to a <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> "<a href="../../../f/e/m/Femme_fatale.html" title="Femme fatale">femme fatale</a>" he mentions that he "doesn't trust her". At the end of series two, when she is evicted from her flat, he lets her stay in the caravan — "if they can come to some arrangement".</p>
<p>Alan is also fairly isolated from his family. He is divorced and both of his children are estranged and wish for nothing to do with him. Alan has one sister, a nephew, a cousin (who owns <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Norwich_9e19.html" title="BBC Radio Norwich">BBC Radio Norwich</a>), an uncle who died a virgin, and a brother-in-law who Alan finds irritating on account of his constant whingeing about his <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_Disease_38ed.html" title="Parkinson's Disease">Parkinson's Disease</a>. Alan's father is dead but his mother is mentioned in the DVD commentaries as alive but ill. Alan doesn't seem particularly close to anyone in his family, and we have never seen any of them. His chronic lack of social skills further cements his alienation from his family.</p>
<p>He apparently considers <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Lee_Travis_d628.html" title="Dave Lee Travis">Dave Lee Travis</a> to be his <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemesis.html" title="Nemesis">nemesis</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h3>
<p>Alan was born Alan Gordon Partridge on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2.html" title="April 2">April 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> in <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Lynn_cb86.html" title="King's Lynn">King's Lynn</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and spent his childhood in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwich.html" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>. He was bullied at school by a boy named Stephen McCoombe, who called him "smelly Alan Fartridge". At Sir William Dunwoody's High School he was known as "Alison Partridge", and was once <a href="../../../c/a/n/Caning.html" title="Caning">caned</a> for having a chalk penis drawn on the back of his school blazer, an incident about which he still feels bitter.</p>
<p>Alan had a lonely childhood in which he would ramble about the Norfolk countryside in solitude, singing his favourite pop songs. His father once laughed at Alan for crying at <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Don%27t_Be_A_Hero_7549.html" title="Billy Don't Be A Hero">Billy Don't Be A Hero</a></i> by <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paper_Lace_f90b.html" title="Paper Lace">Paper Lace</a>, and it is obvious he had a very sheltered childhood that was to mould him into what he was to become in later life. At school Alan won an essay-writing competition on the subject of sport (his first foray into the sporting world) and later went on to attend <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_East_Anglia_c4d2.html" title="University of East Anglia">East Anglia Polytechnic</a>. He passed his driving test when he was 17, celebrated by getting a Mint Cracknell, and bought a white <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Maxi_9ffa.html" title="Austin Maxi">Austin Maxi</a> for £60 from a copy of <i><a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_Trader_b190.html" title="Auto Trader">Auto Trader</a></i>.</p>
<p>Alan achieved 4 Bs and 2 Cs at O-level, and a C in art and a B in general studies at A-level (he dropped French). He later admitted framing the certificates and displaying them in his office.</p>
<p>He later married Carol, who gave birth to Alan's son Fernando and daughter Denise. Carol left Alan for a fitness instructor, and took the children with her.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: Radio career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Radio career</span></h3>
<p>After graduating, Alan worked his way upwards from a position as a DJ on Radio Smile on <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Luke%27s_Hospital_808e.html" title="St Luke's Hospital">St Luke's</a> <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital_radio.html" title="Hospital radio">hospital radio</a>, until he left, after arguments with patients. He then began presenting the <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drive_time.html" title="Drive time">drive time</a> <i>Traffic Buster</i> show on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Norwich_9e19.html" title="BBC Radio Norwich">Radio Norwich</a>, where he stayed for five years and was named sports reporter of the year in 1988. He then became a presenter on the BBC's <i>Scoutabout</i> programme, where he entered into the top eight of BBC sports reporters. Alan soon garnered a slot presenting sports news on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_4_eb17.html" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a>'s <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Hour_2579.html" title="On the Hour">On the Hour</a></i> programme (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>) presented by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Morris_%28satirist%29_42e5.html" title="Chris Morris (satirist)">Chris Morris</a>. On that show Alan suffered from a severe lack of any sporting knowledge and developed a notable talent for mixed and/or nonsensical <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphors</a>.</p>
<p>Alan got his first starring role in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> as host of BBC Radio 4's <i><a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowing_Me%2C_Knowing_You..._with_Alan_Partridge_42d3.html" title="Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge">Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge</a></i> (a spoof chat show with fictional guests). He managed to offend people on his show who would then attempt to disgrace the host. During his tenure on the show, Alan hit a child genius, unknowingly took <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, bribed rent boys, lost his wife's car in a bet, was openly homophobic, forced the resignation of a junior <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_%28government%29.html" title="Minister (government)">government minister</a> and, in the series finale, his guest Lord Morgan of Glossop died from an apparent heart attack.</p>
<p>There was also a one off spoof-documentary about the show called <i>Knowing, Knowing Me, Knowing You</i>. It provided a behind-the-scenes look at how the show was put together and the antagonism between Alan and those who worked for him, as well as giving insight into the problems with his marriage to Carol.</p>

<p><i>On The Hour</i> transferred to television as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_Today_c22c.html" title="The Day Today">The Day Today</a></i> in 1994, where Alan continued as the inept sports reporter ('This is Sports Desk... I'm Alan Partridge'). Here he bungled his way through a feature on the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_FIFA_World_Cup_f1ae.html" title="1994 FIFA World Cup">1994 FIFA World Cup</a>, gave a colourful report on the previous sporting season, and was beaten up by a female martial-arts instructor.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: Knowing Me, Knowing You">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Knowing Me, Knowing You</b></span></h3>
<p>The transition to television was to be a success for Alan and was swiftly followed by a television version of <i>Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge</i>. The format was largely the same as the radio show, with the addition of a house band under the directorship of <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Ponder_8fa4.html" title="Glen Ponder">Glen Ponder</a> (played by musical comedian <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Brown_%28composer%29_5c25.html" title="Steve Brown (composer)">Steve Brown</a>). In the sixth episode, Alan accidentally shot dead one of his guests (<a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes_McAllister_7e94.html" title="Forbes McAllister">Forbes McAllister</a>) on air while examining one of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Byron_c0e1.html" title="Lord Byron">Lord Byron's</a> duelling pistols. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal BBC investigation.</p>
<p>In reality, <i>KMKYWAP</i> was a huge success; in the fictional world of Alan Partridge, it suffered from terrible ratings. This was because of "poor scheduling" (The show was aired at the same time as the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_at_Ten_49de.html" title="News at Ten">News at Ten</a></i>) and Alan's PA, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Benfield_3c2a.html" title="Lynn Benfield">Lynn</a>, claimed that "the show started badly and went downhill from there". In the end the show was taken off the air at the end of the first series.</p>
<p>In 1995, Alan hosted a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_special.html" title="Christmas special">Christmas special</a> of <i>KMKYWAP</i>, humorously titled <i>Knowing Me, Knowing <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yule.html" title="Yule">Yule</a></i>. One of his guests was the (fictional) director of programming at the BBC, Tony Hayers (later to become Alan's nemesis, played by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Schneider_%28actor%29_69fd.html" title="David Schneider (actor)">David Schneider</a>). Alan, with a characteristic lack of subtlety, was seen probing for a new series of <i>KMKYWAP</i>. However, the show was an unmitigated disaster for Alan, as his attempt at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_placement.html" title="Product placement">product placement</a> was blatantly exposed, and the show climaxed with Alan punching both a man in a wheelchair and Tony Hayers (twice) with a turkey stuck on his hand. As Alan cried at the end of the show, "I'll never chat again", <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Hucknall_662e.html" title="Mick Hucknall">Mick Hucknall</a> of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simply_Red_3b01.html" title="Simply Red">Simply Red</a> played the show out. It was the beginning of the end of his time at BBC television (he was "kept on the books", as it were, for a short while, but after a particularly harrowing meeting with Hayers at the BBC cafeteria (which involved assault by cheese) he was left in no doubt that his BBC TV career was over).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: I'm Alan Partridge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>I'm Alan Partridge</b></span></h3>
<p>Partridge next appeared in <i><a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_Alan_Partridge_5855.html" title="I'm Alan Partridge">I'm Alan Partridge</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>), a look behind the scenes of his rapidly failing career. In this television series, he is seen having gained a slot on the fictional Radio Norwich. He continues to cause offence, this time mainly to his listeners and also his colleague Dave Clifton. Alan had by this stage been kicked out by his wife and, after wandering around a <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Menzies_b659.html" title="John Menzies">John Menzies</a> for five hours in a state of depressed <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homelessness.html" title="Homelessness">homelessness</a>, Alan had been forced to take up residence in the equally fictional <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linton%2C_Cambridgeshire_f379.html" title="Linton, Cambridgeshire">Linton</a> Travel Tavern, which was "equi-distant between <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwich.html" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>". The first episode featured Alan meeting Tony Hayers, begging for a new series on the BBC. Hayers was not impressed, and Alan had to wrap up his production company Peartree Productions, firing all its staff. During his time at the Linton Travel Tavern, we discovered more about Alan's failed marriage, his children and his obsession with "<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladyboy.html" title="Ladyboy">Chickboys</a>". Alan was also nearly kidnapped by his "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking.html" title="Stalking">number one fan</a>", a crazed lunatic called Jed Maxwell.</p>
<p>In the final episode, Tony Hayers died after a fall from a roof, and one of Alan's old friends, Chris Feather, took over as head of programmes at the BBC. However, at the decisive moment when the new executive was about to sign a five-year contract, he keeled over and died, forcing Alan to forge the dead man's signature.</p>
<p>(Note: in the fictional world of Alan Partridge, this was not a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary</a>, but actually a "post-documentary". In the commentary on the <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>, Alan explains that all the events depicted in the series actually occurred, but everyone in the show, apart from himself and his <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_assistant.html" title="Personal assistant">personal assistant</a> <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Benfield_3c2a.html" title="Lynn Benfield">Lynn Benfield</a> (played by <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felicity_Montagu_cb13.html" title="Felicity Montagu">Felicity Montagu</a> who went on to play a vicar's wife in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nighty_Night_a9b3.html" title="Nighty Night">Nighty Night</a> (2004)), were actors hired to portray the events in the Linton Travel Tavern "after they had actually occurred".)</p>
<p>Alan's next appearance was in a 1999 half-hour special filmed for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Relief_ec40.html" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a> in which Alan started to lose the plot, foreshadowing his <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_breakdown.html" title="Mental breakdown">mental breakdown</a> in the second series of <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i>. A simulcast between <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Two_4086.html" title="BBC Two">BBC Two</a> and Radio Norwich, Alan appears incoherent and incapable of keeping track of the format of his own show. A second Comic Relief appearance followed in 2001, showing him interviewing a boxing manager, played by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kay_bff1.html" title="Peter Kay">Peter Kay</a>. Eventually, this resulted in Alan taking on one of the boxers in the ring and being beaten by the boxer, the manager and his friend Michael.</p>
<p>Coogan was apparently reluctant to continue playing the character, but returned for a second series of <i>I'm Alan Partridge</i> in 2002. This time, Alan was temporarily living in a caravan while waiting for his new house to be built. Despite his five-year contract with the BBC, according to Alan there was "bad blood" between them and they were "shits", so they had to let him go.</p>
<p>Alan returned to radio, securing the "third best slot on Radio Norwich", presenting <i>Norfolk Nights</i>, a big leap from his former timeslot of 4am to 7am, when he presented <i>Up With the Partridge</i>. Alan also presents a military-based <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiz_show.html" title="Quiz show">quiz show</a> called <i>Skirmish</i> on the (fictional) <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_TV_1086.html" title="Cable TV">cable</a> station UK Conquest, and has a deal with Meteor Productions to make the <i>Crash! Bang! Wallop!... What a Video</i>/<i>Scum on the Run</i> series of car-crash videos.</p>
<p>In the period from his time at the Linton Travel Tavern to his residence in the temporary "static home", Alan suffered a mental breakdown and put on weight, or as he put it, was "clinically fed up" and "repellent to women for two years". This collapse culminated in Alan driving a <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vauxhall_Vectra_b31a.html" title="Vauxhall Vectra">Vauxhall Vectra</a> to <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> in his bare feet, while gorging himself on <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toblerone.html" title="Toblerone">Toblerones</a> (in a similar incident, Alan recounts throwing all his tax receipts off a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> ferry). However, by 2002, his life was firmly back on track, save for the odd glitch. He even had a <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> girlfriend called Sonja, who was 33 years old — 14 years younger than himself ("back of the net!"). This period in Alan's life is documented in his autobiography <i>Bouncing Back</i>, which Alan claims has been described as "lovely stuff" by entertainer <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakin%27_Stevens_c037.html" title="Shakin' Stevens">Shakin' Stevens</a>.</p>
<p>Memorable moments of this series include Alan dry-vomiting his way through a speech about fireplaces; mistakenly getting involved with <a href="../../../w/i/f/Wife_swapping.html" title="Wife swapping">swingers</a>; attacking a six-foot stuffed <a href="../../../y/e/o/Yeomen_Warders_be39.html" title="Yeomen Warders">Beefeater</a> bear; his summing up the entire opening of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_%28film%29_da3a.html" title="The Spy Who Loved Me (film)">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></i> in less than a minute; Lynn's baptism at her <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> church and, of course, the sad pulping of his autobiography which, despite taking up four weeks of his life to write, simply wasn't selling well (partly because every anecdote ended with the phrase "Needless to say, I had the last laugh".) Unfortunately, Alan tells us, it seems the public was more concerned with buying gangster autobiographies like <i>Bad <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slag_%28slang%29.html" title="Slag (slang)">Slags</a></i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: Anglian Lives">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Anglian Lives</b></span></h3>
<p>In 2003, Alan again returned to our screen in a half-hour special of <i>Anglian Lives</i>, a fictional regional BBC show. This was presented by Ray Woollard (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Baynham_231f.html" title="Peter Baynham">Peter Baynham</a>) and "Digital Dave", and was basically a sycophantic look at Alan's career, past and present; the credits listed it as being <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_producer.html" title="Executive producer">executive produced</a> by Alan himself. It shed more detail on Alan's hatred of London, his Toblerone addiction, and his future.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Edit section: Future">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Future</span></h2>
<p><i>Anglian Lives</i> was the last time Alan Partridge appeared on TV in his own programme. It is unknown whether he will return, but writer <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_Iannucci_3aba.html" title="Armando Iannucci">Armando Iannucci</a> says it is "doubtful".</p>
<p>In 2004 Coogan also gave an interview with <i>Now</i> magazine, and when asked "Is it true that you're killing off Alan Partridge?", Coogan replied: "No, not at all. What's he up to at the moment? Well, I'd say he's being <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryonics.html" title="Cryonics">cryogenically</a> preserved next to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>. Don't worry. When the day comes that I feel like I need to do something else with him, I'll defrost him and make him funny again."</p>
<p>This occurred briefly for Comic Relief 2005, when Alan appeared to interview a grown-up, openly gay <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milkybar.html#Milkybar_Kid" title="Milkybar">Milkybar Kid</a> (played by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Pegg_771c.html" title="Simon Pegg">Simon Pegg</a>). This involved a lot of recycled material from previous live appearances. However, there was some bizarre <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoeroticism.html" title="Homoeroticism">homoeroticism</a> between Alan and the Milky Bar Kid which resulted in Alan agreeing to rent a caravan and go hiking with him.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_Iannucci_3aba.html" title="Armando Iannucci">Armando Iannucci</a> hinted in a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_2_14a4.html" title="BBC Radio 2">BBC Radio 2</a> interview with <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Ross_%28television_presenter%29_846b.html" title="Jonathan Ross (television presenter)">Jonathan Ross</a> in May 2005 that the idea of making a one-off special episode of <i>Skirmish</i> (Alan's fictional military based game show on 'UK Conquest') has been discussed, but no firm plans, script, or rules of the show exist.</p>
<p>However in August 2004 a small piece appeared in the <i><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metro_%28Associated_Metro_Limited%29_4f7d.html" title="Metro (Associated Metro Limited)">Metro</a></i> newspaper which claimed that: "Steve Coogan got the green light from a US studio to play the spoof DJ on the big screen." Coogan reportedly said: "It's always been my plan to make Alan go global. It's what he lives for really, not just doing the show on Radio Norwich." Other sources confirm the film will be going ahead and <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> has reported that <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Beckham_45d1.html" title="Victoria Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a> will be playing a "demanding diva" in the film. Coogan has since denied that Beckham will appear.</p>
<p>In mid 2005, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a> submitted that an Alan Partridge movie was in pre-production. It was later revealed the film would involve an <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> siege. However, due to the sensitivities of such a storyline after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the project now appears to be on hold.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although not appearing <i>per se</i>, Alan Partridge does feature in the 2006 film, <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Cock_and_Bull_Story_dfec.html" title="A Cock and Bull Story">A Cock and Bull Story</a></i>. In a complex, multi-layered film which blurs the viewers' perception of fact and fiction, Steve Coogan plays an egotistical, philandering film actor (called Steve Coogan) who is most famous for his television work in the guise of Alan Partridge. Despite his best efforts to leave Partridge in the past and move onto new projects, other characters in the film constantly remind Coogan about Partridge, going so far as to mimic Partridge in order to mock Coogan. In one highly self-referential scene, journalist <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Wilson_bc17.html" title="Tony Wilson">Tony Wilson</a> (whom Coogan had played in the film <i><a href="../../../2/4/_/24_Hour_Party_People_fc61.html" title="24 Hour Party People">24 Hour Party People</a></i>), playing a journalist called Tony Wilson, insists on interviewing Coogan's character, actor "Steve Coogan", in Alan Partridge's <i>Knowing Me, Knowing You</i> style. The self-referencing here is particularly dense because Coogan's earlier portrayal of Wilson had been, by the actor's own admission, reminiscent of Alan Partridge <a href="http://www.coogans-run.co.uk/h/steve-coogan-newsitem.php?id=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.coogans-run.co.uk/h/steve-coogan-newsitem.php?id=6" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and it has been speculated that the Partridge character was partly based on the real Wilson <a href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=301252002" class="external autonumber" title="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=301252002" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.manchesterad.com/html/interviews/tonyw0.php?content=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manchesterad.com/html/interviews/tonyw0.php?content=4" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
