<dd>I'd never heard of it before, either; I'm more familiar with the 1839 arrangement between the HBC and the RAC whereby the British obtained rights to Fort Stikine and the entirety of the Panhandle's mainland fur resources for 10 years, in exchange for supplying the RAC with food and other goodies; can't remember if it was extended but I do know there was an informal truce between the HBC and RAC even during the Crimean War...until the Royal Navy and the French fleet showed up at Esquimalt after retreating from Petropovlavsk, that is....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 02:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recall that in some text it was mentioned that Russians used to use Alaska only for fur-animal hunt. In those years, number of animals already declined (due to over-hunting), so they had no more interest in the area. Could someone confirm this, plz? Saigon from europe</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, according to Lydia T. Black, a scholar of Russian America studies in Alaska, the Russians managed their fur harvesting quite well. It wasn't until the Americans started coming north that the populations declined; the Russians wiped out <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steller%27s_sea_cow.html" title="Steller's sea cow">Steller's sea cow</a>, but Black contests the idea that it was the Russians who severely depleted the populations of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_otter.html" title="Sea otter">sea otters</a> and various fur seals. Her book from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alaska_Press_1d85.html" title="University of Alaska Press">University of Alaska Press</a> talks about this (it's been quite a while since I read this, so I'm not positive about her conclusions. I'm not sure what the general historical consensus is, but the Russians actually managed the fur harvesting, whereas the Americans didn't do any management of fisheries or fur trapping until Alaska became a state, I think. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirdre_1773.html" title="User:Deirdre">Deirdre</a> 20:37, 25 January 2006 (UTC---</dd>

<p>Link (in Russian): <a href="http://historic.ru/news/item/f00/s09/n0000909/" class="external autonumber" title="http://historic.ru/news/item/f00/s09/n0000909/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> This is basically a summary of it:</p>
<p>To clarify the claims in the preceding discussion, the most elementary research on the Alaskan so-called Purchase in 1867 would reveal that the original deal was, in fact, a 100-year lease. According to the original conditions of the diplomats of Alexander II, Alaska would be returned to Russia in 1967 when it pays the US government back with interest (about 10^9 US$). (By the way, why does only the first page of the pictured document with all of the Tsar's titles appear, and no substantive pages?) The tsarists never sold Alaska to the Americans. So what the Russians believe about the lease of Alaska is essentially true.</p>
<p>However, the loan was later nullified by the Bolsheviks on three separate occasions. Lenin, in order to secure an end to economic sanctions against the USSR, offered to withhold any pretentions to Alaska. Stalin, in the Yalta conference, told Roosevelt that Alaska was American when persuading him on the management of the Eastern Bloc. The final "nail in the coffin" was when Khruschev neglected to demand Alaska back from the Americans (which he still could have done legally, since the first two incidents were not fully official) and suppressed historians' articles on the issue. Alaska became a permanent US territory only after 1967 legally. Currently in Russia, there have been many popular calls to take back Alaska, and its lease remains a sore topic debated while drinking.

<p>The negotiations concluded in an all-night negotiating session that resulted in the signing of the treaty at 4 o'clock in the morning of March 30, with the purchase price set at US $7,200,000 (equivalent to about US <b>$1.67 billion</b> 2006 dollars).</p>

<p>Alaska was only admitted to the United States in 1959. This is peculiar in comparison with California: Another a remote terretory, California was admitted to the Union immediately after the discovery of gold.</p>
<p>Had 'granting' statehood been under active discussion at an earlier date? Can anyone comment on the considerations that were decisive for the timing for admission?</p>

<p>Statehood is based on population, and then aproval by congress. California was admitted to the Union so quickly because a) Congress had intended to annex CA for sometime and b) because immediatley after the gold rush CA's population grew more then enough for it to become a state, this did not work out the same with Alaska. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooldoug111_858f.html" title="User:Cooldoug111">Mac Domhnaill</a> 00:27, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; can't remember how I came across this, maybe in a websearch for the Russian American Fur Company, or even in External links in another Wiki article, but when I saw the image of the check used to pay Russia (teez that's weird to spell it that way for me...I'm Canadian, and we use "cheque"), I found <a href="http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2006-39-1" class="external text" title="http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2006-39-1" rel="nofollow">a recent article from the Moscow News</a>, an English-language paper:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"However, the money never reached Russia. Legend has it that the banknotes were converted into gold bars and loaded aboard a ship that sank in the Gulf of Finland. The reality is much more prosaic.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Baron Eduard de Stoeckl received a $21,000 award from the emperor, and purportedly spent around $100,000 to bribe U.S. journalists and congressmen who were opposed to the deal.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The rest of the money was used to buy steam locomotives and other essential equipment that was vital for Russia's booming railroad industry.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure how or where to fit that into the Wiki article, as there's a few places it could go; there's other tidbits in the Moscow News item suitable maybe for other articles, but I'm over-extended Wiki-wise as it is, but just handing over the link, and the juicy quote above - even that there's a Russian legend that the money never reached the Russian treasury (when it seems to have reached private pockets) is in itself interesting. The MN article also barely mentions BC or the Hudson's Bay Company supplying the RAC with foodstuffs and other staples, which is an interesting and kind of glaring omission, but other than that it's always interesting to hear another perspective, no?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 02:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
