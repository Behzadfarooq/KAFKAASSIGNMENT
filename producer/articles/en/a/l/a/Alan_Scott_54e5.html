<p>He was created by young struggling artist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Nodell_e9e9.html" title="Martin Nodell">Martin Nodell</a>, who was inspired by the sight of a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Subway_0e16.html" title="New York Subway">New York Subway</a> employee waving a red lantern to stop a train for track work and a green lantern once the track was clear. With the name in hand and borrowing heavily from the story of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladdin.html" title="Aladdin">Aladdin</a>, Nodell created a mystical crimefighter who got his powers from the flame of a strange lamp.</p>
<p>Nodell was teamed with writer <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Finger_66ef.html" title="Bill Finger">Bill Finger</a>, who wrote the scripts for stories, which were often drawn by Martin Nodell and sometimes by ghost artists such as Irwin Hasen. Scott made his debut in <i>All-American Comics</i> #16 (July 1940). The art was credited to Nodell via his pseudonym "Mart Dellon". Like many creators of the time, Nodell hoped to keep the stigma of comic books from tarnishing his career in commercial illustration.</p>
<p>According to Mordecai Richler, "there is no doubt... that The Green Lantern has its origin in Hassidic mythology" <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. However, Richler gives no reasons for saying this. Creator Martin Nodell has written that he originally intended to name the character Alan Ladd, after Aladdin, but changed the name to avoid confusion with the movie actor of the same name. Nodell mentions Wagner's opera cycle The Ring of the Nibelungenlied and the sight of a trainman's green railway lantern as inspirations.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scott was a charter member of the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">Justice Society of America</a>, beginning in <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Star_Comics_88eb.html" title="All Star Comics">All Star Comics</a> #3</i> (Winter 1940). He served as the team's second chairman, in #7, but departed following that issue and returned a few years later. He has been a key member of the group ever since, appearing in all three titles bearing the teams' name.</p>

<p>Thousands of years ago, a mystical "green flame" fell to Earth. The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death, once to bring life, and once to bring power. By 1940, after having already fulfilled the first two-thirds of this prophecy, the flame had been fashioned into a metal <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lantern.html" title="Lantern">lantern</a>, which fell into the hands of Alan Scott, a young railroad <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineer</a>. Following a railroad bridge collapse, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal, to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopted a colorful costume (setting himself apart from his successors, as he wore both red and purple in his outfit, besides the standard green) and became a crimefighter.</p>
<p>Scott used his ring to fly, to walk through solid objects (by "moving through the fourth dimension"), to paralyze or blind people temporarily, to create rays of energy, to melt metal as with a blowtorch, and to cause dangerous objects to glow, among other things. He has occasionally used it to create solid objects and force fields in the manner usually associated with fellow Green Lantern <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Jordan_6278.html" title="Hal Jordan">Hal Jordan</a>, and to read minds. His ring could protect him against any object made of metal, but would not protect him against any wood or plant based objects. This was said to be because the green flame was an incarnation of the strength of "green, growing things".</p>
<p>During the 1940s, Green Lantern seemed to alternate between serious adventure - particularly when his arch-nemesis, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Grundy_%28comics%29_fa1b.html" title="Solomon Grundy (comics)">Solomon Grundy</a>, appeared - and light comedy, usually involving his sidekick <a href="../../../d/o/i/Doiby_Dickles_7e3a.html" title="Doiby Dickles">Doiby Dickles</a>. Toward the end of his <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_comics_412c.html" title="Golden Age of comics">Golden Age</a> adventures, he was even reduced to the role of a sidekick to Streak the Wonder Dog, a heroic <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canidae.html" title="Canidae">canine</a> cut from the mold of <a href="../../../r/i/n/Rin-Tin-Tin_a076.html" title="Rin-Tin-Tin">Rin-Tin-Tin</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lassie.html" title="Lassie">Lassie</a>.</p>

<p>Scott was a member of the JSA in 1951 when the team was investigated by the "Joint Congressional Un-American Activities Committee," a fictional organization based on the real-life <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Committee_on_Un-American_Activities_63a6.html" title="House Committee on Un-American Activities">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> but stated to have been created after the death of Senator <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> on <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28DC_Comics%29_d45a.html#Earth-2" title="Multiverse (DC Comics)">Earth-2</a>. They were accused of possible <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> sympathies and asked to reveal their <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_identity.html" title="Secret identity">identities</a>. The JSA declined, and most of the membership retired in the 1950s.</p>
<p>One piece of <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retroactive continuity</a> fills out Scott's early history: <i>All-Star Squadron Annual #3</i> states that the JSA fought a being named Ian Karkull who imbued them with energy that retarded their aging, allowing Scott and many others (as well as their spouses) to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity. The events of that incident also lead to his taking a leave of absence from the JSA, explaining why the character vanished from the roster for a time.</p>
<p>Also, during this period, he and his friend <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Garrick_ad86.html" title="Jay Garrick">Jay Garrick</a> (also known as the Flash) had an encounter with <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abin_Sur_b114.html" title="Abin Sur">Abin Sur</a>, the Green Lantern who preceded Hal Jordan; tracking a criminal to Earth, Sur's ring was immobilised by his foe forming a yellow barrier around the ring, necessitating Sur to borrow Alan's ring when he and Jay were knocked unconscious. With the new ring, which lacked a weakness to yellow, Sur was able to take his foe by surprise and defeated him, before returning the ring to Alan and leaving Earth.</p>
<p>The team re-formed in the 1960s with Scott as a member, though little is known of their adventures during this time save for their team-ups with the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League of America</a>, of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel world</a> Earth-1, and a few cross-universe adventures Scott shared with Earth-1's Green Lantern, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Jordan_6278.html" title="Hal Jordan">Hal Jordan</a>.</p>
<p>From the late 1940s to the 1970s, Scott ran the Gotham Broadcasting Company (GBC), which was ruined by creditors. He was temporarily driven mad by the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psycho_Pirate_f678.html" title="Psycho Pirate">Psycho Pirate</a>, and the rest of the JSA helped him recover. Jay Garrick helped him start a new career as a scientist, although he eventually regained control of the GBC and is still running it to this day.</p>

<p>It was eventually revealed that in the late 1950s or early 1960s, Scott married the woman with the dual identity <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_and_Thorn_1697.html" title="Rose and Thorn">Rose and Thorn</a>, and the two had a pair of children who would grow up to become the superheroes <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_%28comics%29.html" title="Jade (comics)">Jade</a> and <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsidian_%28comics%29.html" title="Obsidian (comics)">Obsidian</a> of the team <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Inc._2580.html" title="Infinity Inc.">Infinity Inc.</a>.</p>

<p>Following <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></i>, which merged all parallel realities into one, the source of Scott's power would be <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> to be the mystical "Starheart", the gathered <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">magical</a> characteristics of the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28DC_Comics%29_d45a.html#Earth-1" title="Multiverse (DC Comics)">Earth-1</a> Universe by the <a href="../../../o/a/_/Oa.html" title="Oa">Oan</a> <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardians_of_the_Universe_b580.html" title="Guardians of the Universe">Guardians of the Universe</a>. This collective force was hidden in the heart of a star and became <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentient.html" title="Sentient">sentient</a>, and also helped retard Scott's aging process. Another story implied a connection to Yalan Gur, an ancient member of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Lantern_Corps_4605.html" title="Green Lantern Corps">Green Lantern Corps</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, Scott and of the rest of the Society disappeared for years, transported to another dimension fighting in an eternally recurring <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnarok.html" title="Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a>. They were eventually rescued, and continued activity until a disastrous battle with the villain <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_%28comics%29.html" title="Monarch (comics)">Extant</a>, during which Scott was physically aged to a point closer to his actual age, prompting him to semi-retirement.</p>
<p>For a time, the Starheart became part of Scott's body and he adopted the name <b>Sentinel</b>, becoming a founding member of a new <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">JSA</a>. Thanks to the rejuvenative properties of the Starheart, Scott's physical body was again temporarily revitalized so that he resembled a man in his 30s or early 40s. He has since has been physically altered again so that he more closely resembles his true chronological age. He continues to fight crime in his original costumed identity, using a ring again, serving as an elder statesman to the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">JSA</a> and to the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a> community in general.</p>

<p>During the <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a></i>, Scott and his daughter <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_%28comics%29.html" title="Jade (comics)">Jade</a>, along with many others, traveled with <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Troy_5a8c.html" title="Donna Troy">Donna Troy</a> to the center of the universe to save the universe from an unknown threat; later revealed to be <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Luthor%2C_Jr._55d3.html" title="Alexander Luthor, Jr.">Alexander Luthor, Jr.</a>. Jade died on that mission. <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Year_Later_fa46.html" title="One Year Later">One Year Later</a>, Scott appears to be still active, still relatively youthful in comparison to his true age, but now wears an eye-patch due to losing his eye in a <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Strange_17a7.html" title="Adam Strange">Zeta beam</a> transporter accident while returning from space. During the missing year, Scott has joined <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkmate_%28comics%29.html" title="Checkmate (comics)">Checkmate</a> at the rank of White King. Scott assigned his JSA teammate <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Terrific_%28Michael_Holt%29_d7e2.html" title="Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)">Mister Terrific</a> as his bishop.</p>

<p>Scott soon finds himself in a moral conflict with <i>Black Knight</i> <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sasha_Bordeaux_62ee.html" title="Sasha Bordeaux">Sasha Bordeaux</a> over the violent nature of Checkmate, particularly after Bordeaux and her team slaughter dozens of Kobra operatives during a raid on a facility. Bordeaux contends that the ends justify the means, while Scott adheres to the principle that heroes should not kill unless absolutely necessary; Bordeaux responds to this by suggesting that Scott resign. Concurrent with this internal conflict, Scott and "White Queen" <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Waller_81d9.html" title="Amanda Waller">Amanda Waller</a> are trying to keep the organization from being discontinued by political forces.</p>
<p>The fourth issue of the <i><a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comics%29.html" title="52 (comics)">52</a></i> maxi-series reveals that Scott lost his left eye during a period when he and several other superheroes had been declared missing (approximately 11 months prior to the events of <i>Checkmate</i> #1). The Zeta Beam that <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Strange_17a7.html" title="Adam Strange">Adam Strange</a> was hoping to use for teleporting the heroes in space away from the time-space ripple caused by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Luthor%2C_Jr._55d3.html" title="Alexander Luthor, Jr.">Alexander Luthor, Jr.</a> actions was splintered by the ripple itself, mutilating the heroes in various ways.</p>
<p>His missing eye was later replaced by a portion of his daughter Jade's mystic green energy. After being put into a comatose state during an attack by the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentleman_Ghost_6dd4.html" title="Gentleman Ghost">Gentleman Ghost</a>, Jade appeared to him, told him goodbye and granted him another portion of her green energy. His missing eye is currently replaced by a green glowing orb that, due to its mystical origins and connection to Jade, allows him to track astral and mystical energy forms such as ghosts.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Ross_21f8.html" title="Alex Ross">Alex Ross</a>'s <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Come_%28comic%29_16f4.html" title="Kingdom Come (comic)">Kingdom Come</a></i>, Alan Scott has reclaimed the mantle of Green Lantern and forged green armor seemingly powered by the Starheart. Throughout the course of the story, it is revealed that Alan has established a city that orbits the Earth, which he has dubbed New Oa. Alan joins with Superman in the new Justice League and saves a number of heroes from an atomic explosion at the end of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> by shielding them with his Green Lantern powers. In the epilogue of the miniseries, Alan is shown joining the United Nations as the ambassador of the sovereign nation of New Oa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another version of Alan Scott was seen briefly in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/JSA%7E_The_Unholy_Three_ba47.html" title="JSA: The Unholy Three">JSA: The Unholy Three</a></i> as a post-WW2 agent called the <b>Lantern</b> whose use of his power ring was invaluable to the intelligence community for its ability to discern truth from lies. The ring and Alan's hand were destroyed by a Superman gone rogue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_%28animated_series%29_2edc.html" title="Justice League (animated series)">Justice League animated series</a> episode <i>Legends</i>, the producers used characters similar to the Golden Age Justice Society of America.

Green Guardsman's real name is Scott Mason and his ring is ineffective against anything made out of <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminum.html" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the Elseworlds tale, <i>Green Lantern: Evil's Might</i>, Alan Scott is depicted as the young leader of a gang called the Bowery Greens.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the Elseworlds series "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Age_%28comics%29_4d37.html" title="The Golden Age (comics)">The Golden Age</a>", Alan Scott finds himself under investigation from the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Unamerican_Activities_Committee_3f41.html" title="House Unamerican Activities Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> because of his refusal to turn over employees suspected of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communist</a> activities.
