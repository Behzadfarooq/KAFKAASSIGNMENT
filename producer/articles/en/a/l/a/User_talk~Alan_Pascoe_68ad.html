<p>Dear Alan Pascoe</p>
<p>This is Edward Lucas, Cristina's husband. I am trying to clear up the problem with her place of birth. I have written to Wikipedia and received the following answer</p>
<p>Dear Edward Lucas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your mail.</p>
<p>The essential problem is that Alan Pascoe cannot know whether you are really the person who you pretend to be, or some prankster. That is, he prefers a statement in a magazine to some messages left by people he has no means to identify.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should try having an email exchange with Mr Pascoe using Mrs Odone's official email address in her newspaper. This would settle it.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience, but we receive claims by pranksters fairly often, and we have guidelines on biographies of living people not to include information without credible sources.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, David Monniaux</p>

<p>Hi -I've noticed your edits recently across some of the Penwith geography pages, and hope you're having fun editing. A lot of these pages need quite a bit of work and I recently set up a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_geography_of_Penwith%2C_Cornwall_39f4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject geography of Penwith, Cornwall">wikiproject</a> to deal with it. Just wondered if you would consider joining us and pooling efforts? take care <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 08:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would also like to welcome you to the Penwith Project, and to comment that I used to belong to the same athletic club as your namesake (although we never met). <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:18, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan, thanks for all the detail regarding Gwithian - much appreciated. I would recommend however that the info box be changed to be more in line with other Cornish info boxes ie <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newlyn.html" title="Newlyn">Newlyn</a> as the display of flags will lead to another inevitable edit war. take care 195.92.67.75 10:38, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is good that you want to avoid an edit war, however I notice from User Contributions that you are likely to be the person who removed the infobox from the Gwithian article yesterday, with the edit summary "rv England infobox not required on Cornish articles". So, if you want to avoid an edit war, don't remove justifiable content. <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newlyn.html" title="Newlyn">Newlyn</a> does not have an infobox, just a map. The infobox in <a href="../../../g/w/i/Gwithian.html" title="Gwithian">Gwithian</a> has been arrived at by the consensus of many editors. There are variants for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Cornwall is a county in one of these, England. You may wish that were not so, and you have the right to hold that view. You also have the right to promote that view, but not on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a soapbox. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Pascoe_ece4.html" title="User:Alan Pascoe">Alan Pascoe</a> 11:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please desist from adding new info boxes to every Cornish town and village before a general agreement has been reached! There is a discussion on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Talk%7ECornwall_586c.html#New_Cornish_Town.2FVillage_info_boxes" title="Talk:Cornwall">Talk:Cornwall#New Cornish Town/Village info boxes</a> concerning implementing the established UK infobox pattern - please discuss before any more amendments - thank you. 217.134.71.58 17:58, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think an approach that was more civil than a 'demand to desist' wouldn't have gone amiss.

<p>Hello. I see you made an article <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_%28district%29.html" title="Reading (district)">Reading (district)</a>. It says "it is named after its main town, Reading". can you tell us what other towns area in the district?</p>
<p>actually, that's a rhetorical question: the answer is, there are no other towns in the district. this makes that sentence nonsensical. the borders of Reading have remained identical since Caversham and other bits were added in 1911, as far as i can tell, so we are presented with somewhat of a problem here. With cases such as <a href="../../../w/o/k/Wokingham_%28district%29.html" title="Wokingham (district)">Wokingham (district)</a>, obviously this latter article only covers the 1974-present district&#160;: however, what exactly is the scope of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_%28district%29.html" title="Reading (district)">Reading (district)</a>? is it covering the post-1974 district of Reading, which had exactly the same borders as the county borough of Reading from 1911 to 1974? is it covering the Reading county borough after 1911 until 1974? what about the county borough of reading between 1889 and 1911, what article is about this? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 22:46, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further to this, I have posted a question at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_UK_subdivisions_1394.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject UK subdivisions">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_UK_subdivisions</a> about this issue and invite comments. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 23:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, could you please explain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unreformed_boroughs_in_England_and_Wales_1835_-_1886&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83501783" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unreformed_boroughs_in_England_and_Wales_1835_-_1886&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83501783" rel="nofollow">edits like this</a>, which in this case makes an anachronistic link to the post-1974 non-metropolitan district of Wokingham from a list of boroughs in the 19th century. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 09:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, sorry for the slow reply, I've been away for a few days. I take your point; we do have no proof that it actually is Paul/Guido posting as himself. However, if it were a hoax, it'd be a pretty dull and pointless one; as such, I'm inclined to make the assumption that User:Paul.staines is actually him. I agree that Guido has in the past been dismissive of attempts to unmask him, but it could be simply a matter of curiosity or blasé arrogance that led him to post under his own name. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 21:29, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! I read your vote in the Arbitration Committee election and appreciate your feedback. Are there any questions that I might answer that will help you trust me for a position on the Committee? If so, I will be glad to answer them here or you can place them on my Election Question page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements/Questions_for_FloNight" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements/Questions_for_FloNight" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Take care, <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 21:45, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello and thank you for answering my query. I appreciate you taking the time to explain your vote. First off I want to assure you that I am very serious about my bid for a seat on the Arbitration Committee. I decided to make my Candidate Statement concise because by the time I threw my hat it ring (about 11 days into the nomination process) there was already a large number of questions and a growing concern about the volume of information that the voter needed to read. I felt that my statement covered all of the basics and that my user page and question page would provide details. But different people have different preferences and I can see your perspective also. I do hope you will reconsider because I think I have the qualities that you are looking for in a candidate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to clerking (which has given me a good nuts and bolts understanding of Request for arbitration) I also have both on wiki and off wiki experience that should give me the skills to be a good arbitrator. I have made comments on the workshop pages of arbitration cases and proposed principles, findings of fact, and remedies. I have helped with mediation in cases that were brought to RFAr and rejected. (will provide some details by email if you so desire), served as a juror in 3 real life trials, and have training and experience dealing with difficult people in difficult situations through my occupation. I have honed my research and assessment skills which I plan to use to help write decisions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I noted in more detail in question # 4 here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements/Questions_for_FloNight#Questions_from_Mailer_Diablo" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements/Questions_for_FloNight#Questions_from_Mailer_Diablo" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, I feel that transparency is important, and in question # 1 here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements/Questions_for_FloNight#Questions_from_AnonEMouse" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements/Questions_for_FloNight#Questions_from_AnonEMouse" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> that policy is best made by the community not through arbitration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again thank you for your reply and I hope my follow up will give you confidence in my ability to fill this trusted role. Take care, <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 18:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have made some comments on the talk page regarding why I think the project is not made redundant by the Cornwall wikiproject, and mentioned you as the catalyst. As such, you may wish to read (and comment if necessary) on what I said. In any event, thanks for the work you have done for the Penwith project. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 00:15, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
