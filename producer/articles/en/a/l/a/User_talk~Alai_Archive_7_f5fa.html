<p>As struct stubs generally seem to be treated as subcats of geo stubs, should I be double-stubbing all the Scotland struct stubs (and the new Scotland castle stubs) with the new local geo stubs, eg. as I have done here at <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elsie_Inglis_Memorial_Hospital_2ed8.html" title="Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospital">Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospital</a>? (If we do that it will assist with any future split of that growing cat, but even if we never split, it could still be useful for people interested in their own local area.) I ask because I was wondering if I start someone may object.

<p>Hi, I never came to thank you for the message you left for me a month ago when I stepped down from being a bureaucrat. Thank you for the things you said, it's good to know there are still plenty of good people about in this project. I do not see myself standing for bureaucrat again anytime soon though who knows what the future may bring!

<p>Well, it has been over a year and I finally did a complete rewrite of an article I knew nothing about before I looked her up on Wikipedia. Can you review this <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Oldham_Kelsey_73ce.html" title="Frances Oldham Kelsey">Frances Oldham Kelsey</a> article - here is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frances_Oldham_Kelsey&amp;diff=51010471&amp;oldid=44644660" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frances_Oldham_Kelsey&amp;diff=51010471&amp;oldid=44644660" rel="nofollow">changes</a>. I also had to start a brand new article (so I wouldn't have an ugly red link in the rewritten one) - see <a href="../../../p/r/e/President%27s_Award_for_Distinguished_Federal_Civilian_Service_32b4.html" title="President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service">President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service</a>. I also added everything after the first paragraph to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Civilian_Service_Awards_Board_c329.html" title="Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board">Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board</a>.

<dd>Thx for reviewing - I don't like the short choppy sentences in the sections: "Birth and education" and "Early career and marriage."

<p>Hi Alai, Saw that you were the one to generate this notice template, do you know what the rationale was behind it becoming a redirect. I want to start populating this but don't want to waste my time or step on anyones toes. Is it a redirect with a view to becoming a full seperate stub notice at some stage once fully populated? Which is not going to be too hard, I don't think.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 09:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Panama-stub uses my standard code. The short answer to the noinclude bit is that I'm just a bit allergic to them (at least after the category). What's the advantage on including them within category brackets? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 02:13, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for any constructive criticism you may have given in my recent unsuccesful RFA. I will strive to overcome any shortcomings you may have mentioned &amp; will try &amp; prove myself worthy of your vote in the future.</p>

<p>I've had a change of opinion on this. Because of Gibby's relentless incivility and personal attacks on other editors, and his edit warring, but in particular because of the unbending nature of his approach to subjects on which he has strong feelings, I think it may (either now or soon) be time to consider invoking the General Probation in his case to ban him from Wikipedia completely. I don't think he's shown any sign of trying to work with other Wikipedians, and instead he's treating Wikipedia like a corner of Usenet. I no longer cling on to the hope that he has both the capacity and the will to reform.</p>

<p>Hi Alai The correct usage of country, nation, sate, nation state, sovereign state, sovereign nation etc is difficult to come to grips with. If you'd like to give me a single diff where you feel Instantnood may have used a term incorrectly, I'd be happy to give an opinion.

<p>Please keep an eye on the reverts by 158.143.162.111 and 172.177.218.36. I will automatically revert —to whatever the previous signed version is— any unsigned edits due to the latest batch of sockpuppetry incidents in the article. This whole situation is unbearable.

<p>Dear Administrator: I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are. The world owes you. I owe You.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>Hi Alai.</p>
<p>I can't help it but the mess with {{IOM-stub}} keeps annoying me. Although people seem to agree that it should be renamed to {{<a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIsleofMan-stub_953b.html" title="Template:IsleofMan-stub">IsleofMan-stub</a>}}, nothing seems to happen. I've created the missing category, but would you do me a favour and rename this template to {{<a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIsleofMan-stub_953b.html" title="Template:IsleofMan-stub">IsleofMan-stub</a>}}&#160;? This thing has been a mess since February and I'm just afraid it'll stay that way. I know it is a trivial matter, but it just annoys me. (Hmm, perhaps I'll apply for the mop one day, so I could fix stuff like that myself.)

<dd>Yes I noticed. I could easily have moved the template myself, but I simply figured it was easier to kill the redirect at the same time. If some people love the redirects then I can live with that as well. It just looked to me as if the posts swayed more towards a complete move.

<p>Hi, can you have a look at the startling career of newbie <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">User:Mallimak</a>. He is on a one man mission to utterly divorce Orkney from Scotland. The plain fact is that Orkney is a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_area.html" title="Council area">council area</a> of Scotland, nothing more nothing less, it has no special status whatsoever compared with Clackmannnanshire, Moray or East Renfrewshire. It does not even have an active autonomist or secessionist political movement (errr... except for User:Mallimak that is).</p>
<p>Eg, have a look at this article, which he just created from a redirect: <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orcadian.html" title="Orcadian">Orcadian</a>. Now, how NPOV is that little rant? He is going about adding redundant supercats (Category:Orkney people when they are already in Category:Natives of Orkney, removing nationality links (and trying to create a new nationality called "Orcadian": Orkney has never, ever been a state, nor a country, nor a nation), stubbing non-stubs, creating a whole pile of substubs (which should all be redirects).</p>
<p>I'm getting sick of the wee [insert expletive of choice], and would appreciate admin intervention.

<p>Hi Alai,</p>

Any thoughts? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 07:07, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for that. They do look mainly US. Perhaps a continental split for Europe, or one for Australia may be worthwhile, but a lot of these will be in the country-geo-stub categories rather than in the protected area one. It's may be more a case of keeping it monitored rather than going for too many immediate splits. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Alai, for the past few months I've been writing a new <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross_44fe.html" title="International Committee of the Red Cross">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> article. I'm finally satisfied enough to propose its move into the main namespace, though it's far from perfect. That article is at <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraeco_ICRC_daeb.html" title="User:Draeco/ICRC">User:Draeco/ICRC</a>, and I've proposed a move <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EInternational_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross_e9f7.html#Move_to_create_separate_ICRC_article" title="Talk:International Committee of the Red Cross">here</a>. I hope you can take the time to give your opinion, because I see you've commented on the subject before. - <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraeco_17e8.html" title="User:Draeco">Draeco</a> 18:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just had a look at the stub sorting pages, proposals and saw that you do a fantastic job.
