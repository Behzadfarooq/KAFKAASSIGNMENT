While it is indeed a short article, I don't feel it warrants stubification. Wikipedia states that one way "to define a stub is an article so incomplete that an editor who knows little or nothing about the topic could improve its content after a superficial internet search or a few minutes in a reference library". I have been interested in this person for years, and I must say that six sentences is all I can come up on him. I doubt there is much more information available. And so, I am respectfully destubify this article. -- Chris</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the warning. I have put some comments on my own talk page, and would have no problem putting it through the right channels. The UK category is a bit broad, and I believe it would also take care of various Scottish stubs which don't fit too neatly into other categories e.g. Curragh (both a Scottish and Irish related article maybe).--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 16:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for going through the extremely dull work of sorting the stubs categories of the heap of articles I've created recently, my dear Alai! You deserve a rest and a cold beer for the task. So come to the table and have one! I doubt that you remember me, but we had the chance to talk back in April regarding the edit war at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Germany_4fd2.html" title="History of Germany">History of Germany</a> with <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimdal_7e14.html" title="User:Heimdal">Heimdal</a>.

<dd>I'm glad you liked the beer, Alai&#160;:) In fact, the stubs I was referring to are related to the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Ranger_Division_b0e2.html" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Rangers</a>, like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Coffee_Hays_d372.html" title="John Coffee Hays">John Coffee Hays</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Hamilton_Walker_5eb0.html" title="Samuel Hamilton Walker">Samuel Hamilton Walker</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leander_H._McNelly_46ca.html" title="Leander H.

I went on a stub-creating spree on these guys because I greatly expanded the Rangers' article and FACed it... which fortunately ended up successfully!&#160;:) I'll add the proper stub category to other ones that I made in such preparation.

<p>Thanks - I have much less time to edit now - and will be doing some stuff on Physics since it is less emotionally charged for me. I have been cleaning up my watchlist of LDS articles so I can focus better. Therefore, please let me know if there is an issue in the LDS community where I could be helpful. I am a little disappointed to see my Infobox removed from Joseph Smith - but I agree with some of CODGEN's reasoning - perhaps an edit to Joseph Smith, Jr./Infobox could address his concerns while keeping the style similar to the other LDS prophets. I must say that I absolutely hate the toccolours style and its derivatives that are used in the biographical template - yuck! <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 11:52, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd suggest first splitting it into players, coaches, and other figures. That could cut it down from the 900 to something more managable. After that, maybe look into league, decade, and whatnot...but that seems the most logical to me.<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> 15:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I've explained my answer to that question (#6) at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Ronline_bdb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ronline">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ronline</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 04:22, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the point I'm trying to make is that, in a dispute I am actively in, I would not use my admin powers in any way that would disadvantage the "opposition". However, I don't see anything wrong with continuing to apply objective things such as 3RR, simple vandalism, etc. So the answer is "No, except for things that are blatantly and objectively against policy." <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 04:35, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I understand how those things can be conflicts of interest. Which is why I would never protect a page I'm disputing in. Which is why I wouldn't block users on these pages for inserting information, even if it's false and tendentious. Is my answer OK now (see the candidature page)? <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 04:54, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, what you've done is perfectly fine. Administrator abuse is a terrible thing because it leads to alienation on the part of users, which is what lack of communication also leads to. And alienation is a major factor in leading to conflict, not only in Wikipedia but in the world in general. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 05:27, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No offense, but please give me another option, having it in permanent limbo is unacceptable. The stub is posted on <a href="../../../n/h/_/WP%7ENH_3242.html" title="WP:NH">WP:NH</a>(kind of as a point of pride), and that little "This Stub Is Up For Deletion" makes our state's transportation network to seem not worthy of its own stub despite the fact that there are nearly 100 in that stub cat. People looking at that little template on top of the stub may decide not to use it in the belief that it's temporary even though the worst possible thing that would happen here is that another, almost identical one would take its place. If SfD can't resolve this issue, i'm tempted to send SfD to MfD. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 08:35, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's no prank, and quite frankly, the reason why I said that is most likely the reason you put closing the discussion in hyphens. No progress has been made in <i>two months</i>. The average afd takes a week, and has clear rules on closing.

<dd>Hello Alai, yes I do have to wonder about that as well. I thought I made my actions pretty clear in my comments of the histories when reverting, such as <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino-South Tyrol</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/z/Bozen-Bolzano_9a0a.html" title="Bozen-Bolzano">Bozen-Bolzano</a>. I kept on reverting the edits by the anon users, however got tired of it therefore I tried to get the opinions of other users, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pgk#concerning_User:Gryffindor" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pgk#concerning_User:Gryffindor" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ViolinGirl#concerning_User:192.45.72.27" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ViolinGirl#concerning_User:192.45.72.27" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nightstallion#concerning_User:192.45.72.27" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nightstallion#concerning_User:192.45.72.27" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberevil#concerning_User:192.45.72.27" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberevil#concerning_User:192.45.72.27" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, as well as leaving numerous warnings on the talk page of anon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:192.45.72.27" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:192.45.72.27" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I also reported the case on the Wikiquette alerts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#January_11.2C_2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#January_11.2C_2006" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Since the users kept on doing it, I decided to report at least one case. I also pointed out to the other cases in my report <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:192.45.72.27" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:192.45.72.27" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I'm really not sure what else I needed to have done in order to avoid getting blocked myself. I appreciate and thank you for your help in blocking anon and defending me. Maybe you could be so kind as to point out to me what was done wrong and how it can be avoided in future, because I find it unjustified to block me as well. I received no warning of impending breach of rules, which would have sufficed I think. with kind regards <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 19:27, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Violingirl, what doubts about validity do you have, exactly? "Reverting POV" isn't an exception to the 3RR, and I don't think the reverts were simply of vandalism as such. (They don't look like <i>good edits</i> to me either, mind you.)</dd>
<dd>Gryffindor, my suggestion on not getting blocked for the 3RR is simple: don't revert so often! Wait and see if someone else reverts the changes: if they're as bad as you think, surely they will. By all means contact other people, or noticeboards, etc, but those are intended to be <i>alternatives</i> to serial reverting, not simply prerequisites to doing so. Please note that the 3RR applies <i>per 24 hours</i>, not per calendar day, as your own numbering of your reverts seems to reckon it. If you'd misunderstood that, I have even more sympathy for you, which I have rather a lot of in any case, as I'm sure your edits were in good faith. But none the less they were indeed reverts, and an excessive number of them at that, and I felt it wouldn't have been supportable to block one party and not the other, when both are equally guilty at least in technical terms. I'd probably have lifted your block early on the basis of the checkuser results, since the sockpuppetry at work here seems to have been a large part of what provoked you into breaking the rule, but unfortunately I wasn't online much yesterday (pesky broadband regime has left me in the lurch again). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally, I didn't warn first as firstly, it's not a requirement; secondly, as I assumed that if you were familiar enough with the rule to file 3RR violation reports against others, you'd be familiar enough to avoid infringing against it yourself; and lastly and most importantly, so as to deal as equitably and impartially as possible between two parties guilty of essentially the same "offence", regardless of any personal opinions or sympathies I might have on the matter. Note also that if you disagree with a block, you're free to email the blocking admin, and in any case, you're free to admin your own talk page even while blocked, so you can make whatever commentary you wish there. In any case, glad you're back, all the best. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh lord this is so confusing to me. Ok, because my understanding was you need to warn someone about the reverts, that's why I was warning the anon. user. Considering that user was probably using multiple account (if I may dare say so), I was only able to warn one address, not the others. you are right about the one day/24 hour thing, I must have gotten that one confused. Ok, so am I getting this right: next time, see how many reverts have been done in 24 hours, not one day (meaning from morning till evening), and inform other users first about the going on's. see if they think it needs to be reverted, or let others do them. But I thought that reverts by other users do not count towards the limit on the three-revert-rule, only if I do the reverts do they count. Is that correct, or it does not matter which users do the revert? IMO the changes done constituted vandalism, because whole sections of the article were simply being sliced away (see South Tyrol), it wasn't just about names. Please correct me if I'm wrong or forgot something, thanks. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 20:13, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Warning's a very good idea, and I entirely applaud you for having done so, it's just not part of the blocking policy as such. I may have been somewhat severe in my assumption that if you warned and reported someone else, you were fully aware and didn't need to be warned myself, but at any rate such was my thinking at the time. The rule is: no more than three reverts <i>per person</i>, per article. Reverts by others don't count, reverts by sockpuppets do. (So ideally your antagonist would have been blocked sooner, and more thoroughly, but hopefully this is resolved now at any rate, if a little later than would have been ideal.) I didn't notice any other "vandalistic" changes at the time, nor any reports that they were such. Looking back I can see half of paragraph was being removed from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino-South_Tyrol</a> (but nothing similar on <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>) though that's not necessarily "blanking vandalism", or at any rate, isn't clear-cut as such. As other people were indeed making reversions sim8ilar to your own, all the more reason to stop when you reach your own "limit". Of course, even better to resolve the dispute otherwise, without "using the reverts"! (Though I admit this seems unlikely to have been possible here.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, gotcha. So in case something like this happens again, can I ask you for your opinion so that everything is legit?

<dd>I'm still slightly confused...So, if it's a case of POV, don't revert more than once(?), but if it's vandalism, then you can revert however many times the vandal vandalizes.&#160;:) Right?

<dd>No, you can in principle revert POV, or anything else you think needs to be reverted, up to the maximum number of times (i.e. 3). I'm just offering the commentary that reverting may not be the <i>best</i> action to take, esp. repeatedly, as it'll often just lead to further retaliation in kind. But on vandalism, yes, however many times however many vandals vandalise.&#160;:) And, you're welcome! <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is with regards to the very public edit war in the cosplay articles regarding the filcosplay forums, and the pinoycosplay forums. I would firstly like to apologize for the behavior of the Filipinos involved, and would like to ask not to take the actions of a few for the actions of us as a whole. I speak for several members of Filcosplay, who asked to apologize to the administrators caught up in the fighting, and they would like me to explain to you that they were not intentionally encouraging the edit war; they only wanted to have their own webpage up on the site, and fought back only when the user |Mikeabundo began constantly deleting their link without explanation.</p>
<p>I have posted on the discussion page of the Cosplay article, asking for your help in this matter, if you are available (and will be deeply in your debt!) As I have mentioned there, Mikeabundo has been something of a thorn on the cosplay community's side since late 2005, when he first began causing a ruckus. He takes photos from pretty female cosplayers and posts them on his site without permission, implying that he is on close terms with the women despite repeated overtures by the latter to stop using their pictures. In 2005, he bought pinoycosplay.com (there is a mailing list that has existed since 2000 called "pinoy cosplay", in no way affiliated with his forums, and in fact was opposed to taking a similar name as theirs); we believe that one of the reasons for his taking that domain name is that he can claim his boards to be the extension of the oldest filipino cosplay community. Some people have posted on his forums to point that fact out but, like what he has done here with regard to the filcosplay link in wikipedia, simply deletes the posts that contradicts his own without bothering to reply.</p>
<p>Recently, he bought filcosplay.com, and then re-directed that domain name to his pinoycosplay.com site, in the hopes of taking away potential new members who had heard of and were curious about the name "filcosplay". While this is not illegal in itself, it nonetheless smacks of immorality and a lack of netiquette. Filcosplay was never informed by |Mikeabundo about his taking the filcosplay.com domain name; they were only made aware of it through the discovery of one Filcosplay moderator trying out domain names on his browser.</p>
<p>I can provide proofs regarding all I have mentioned above as further evidence of his character, along with further proofs that filcosplay has been in existence far longer than pinoycosplay (which only began in late 2005 as well), that filcosplay has more members, and that filcosplay is supported by many of the online filipino gaming and anime communities (while pinoycosplay is not; it is in fact shunned by some communities because of its owner's actions). Quite frankly, many people have been very irritated by his ongoing behavior, along with his inability to make compromises - people not just in the cosplay community, but also many other people in blogging communities, gaming communities, and even some in the Philippine Technology field. While we have very little success to date in solving many of our problems regarding him, we are hoping at the very least, not to have the wikipedia incident added to our list.</p>
<p>(At the very list, we are hoping to remove the "old" descriptions labelled with the filcosplay link in the protected cosplay page, because it is both untruthful and misleading; we have no complaint against having the pinoycosplay link up as long as we are given fair treatment in the page; unfortunately, the other party does not share the same views.)</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and I apologize for taking up much of your time. I am relatively new to the inner workings of wikipedia, though I visit the site and read articles there often, and I would appreciate any help you can give regarding the situation.&#160;:)</p>

<p>Hello! I noticed you were on the list of members in the <a href="../../../l/d/s/WP%7ELDS_7c0c.html" title="WP:LDS">LDS WikiProject</a>, and I was wondering if you were still interested in helping out there. You see, over the past few months, it appears that it has slowly drifted into inactivity. But you CAN help. Please consider doing both of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take ONE thing form the To-Do list and do it. Once you're done with it, remove it from the list, and from the&lt;&gt;{{Template:LDSprojectbox}}&lt;&gt;, so we know its done. Keep the page on your watchlist. We have a backlog going for more than half a year. Please help to work on it, and remove it.</li>
<li>Vote on the LDSCOTF, and work on it!</li>
<li>Tell your friends (esp. LDS friends, &amp; esp. Wikipedian friends) about this WikiProject, and enocourage them to join (and be active).</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: your involvement in this WikiProject is just that - involvement! Please help us out.</p>
<p>(Note: I'm sending this out to everyone who's name was on the membership list, so I will NOT be watching this page for a response. If you want to contact me, do it on MY talk page, please.)</p>
<p>Thanks for all that you do -<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevdna_20cc.html" title="User:Trevdna">Trevdna</a> 15:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
