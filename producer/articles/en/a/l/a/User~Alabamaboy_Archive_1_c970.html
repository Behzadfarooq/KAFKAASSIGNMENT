<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>It's a kinda gray area, but those don't really seem appropriate to me either. Besides the points you mention (fairly general compared to the specific articles they were added to, as well as appearing to be self-promotion), the site seems to be mostly links to other sites (sometimes referred to as a 'link farm', and generally not considered worth linking to), and commentary which seems to fall under the definition of 'original research', which is also frowned upon. The fact that those three edits are the only ones that user has made on Wikipedia, the user's intentions/motives seem a bit suspect, altho' Wikipedia policy is to '<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>' whenever possible. The not particularly high <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.piperreport.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.piperreport.com/" rel="nofollow">Alexa rank</a> seems to indicate his site's not a 'leading journal' in its field. Also, with <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28United_States%29_b379.html" title="Medicare (United States)">Medicare (United States)</a>, since many piperreport.com links go to kff.org, it is arguably redundant with the direct kff.org link above it.</p>
<p>Anyway, some policy/guidelines that are documented related to all this include "Adding links to one's own page is strongly discouraged." from <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_not_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External_links#What_should_not_be_linked_to</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> (which I consider to include people's own websites and other works in principle, tho' I don't know how widespread that interpretation is), <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox</a>, items 5 and 6. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> (although again this is a bit open to interpretation, since it only specifically talks about contributed text--but it seems to me that since Wikipedia's mission is not to disseminate original research, linking to it is about as bad). While the Edit window doesn't mention it, clicking any redlink to start a new article very specifically states "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business (see Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not).", which again addresses the issue more in principle than specifically with external links.</p>
<p>So, in this type of situation, I would remove the link(s), with clear but concise edit summaries of what's being done, and the main reason(s) why (EG "Removing overly general, self-promotional external links"). Then, either pre-emptively go to the articles' Talk pages and give a more detailed explanation, including links to any guideline/policy articles you're citing, or just add the articles to your watchlist and wait until if/when he tries to add the links again, and make the case on the Talk page then. If he persists, it would be best to get input from more Wikipedians by putting a summary of the issue, and links to the article(s) and discussion(s), at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:06, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">African American literature</span></h2>
<p>I don't want to be picky, so do understand that the comments I've put on the FAC page are intended to protect the article from what's going to happen when it gets to be an FA and gets on the main page. When <i>that</i> happens, all hell breaks loose from the editors. Anyway, the last part of it now <i>looks</i> like opinion. It's in sections like that that you really have to cite like mad. It'll protect the article from the edit wars that come later. Also, the 2nd half opens with a consideration of the definition and difference of African American literature. That's a vexed discussion for all of us, and it's probably not a bad idea to admit, in the first section after the lead, that there is disagreement about its exact limits. (I've had to do that every time I've talked about the history of the novel. Most recently, I've had to admit that no one knows exactly what they mean when they refer to <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_literature.html" title="Augustan literature">Augustan literature</a>.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 30 June 2005 11:50 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">32 KB is too small!</span></h2>
<p>I'm joking, but do <i>not</i> worry about the 32 KB warning. It's there because some very, very, very old browsers (prior to Netscape 4.2, for example, which was 1998) choked on anything longer than that. I can't imagine that anyone is still using browsers that can't handle beyond 32 Kb, and, if they are, they certainly <i>don't have to</i> use anything that archaic. The warning is helpful for casual editors making casual articles on buildings or food, but it should be joyfully disregarded when even thinking about considering planning an FA. That said, we all ought to have some pity on the FAC voters and not subject them to anything like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augustan_literature&amp;oldid=17960233" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augustan_literature&amp;oldid=17960233" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augustan_literature&amp;oldid=17960233</a> which was 90 KB. (<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">bishonen</a> is now spinning off the sections into stand-alone articles, and I'm trying not to look, because otherwise I'd have a stroke.) My <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_literature.html" title="Restoration literature">Restoration literature</a> (written with bishonen) was about 50 kb or more, and I thought it was just about the perfect size for an overview of a substantial literary topic.</p>

<p>I dont know whats going on, but it looks like a few people got together and came up some logical structure on how things should be and then decided to go ahead with it without having anything official to back it up, like a consensus, and now its breaking 100s (1000s) of articles.

<dd>I wouldn't be surprised if it became a fight. As I said, I didn't want to cause a fight, just raise the issue.

<p>Sorry, Alabamaboy, but you don't know your state's history. That white women drove their black domestic servants to work is a well-documented historical fact. Just a quick google, and there are ample examples of documentation. Here's just one: <a href="http://unbrokencircle.org/programs.htm#S8" class="external autonumber" title="http://unbrokencircle.org/programs.htm#S8" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Further, the so-called "edit war" -- not! -- was about some silly, hazy statement inserted by someone with a fixation on traffic that served no useful purpose because it imparted absolutely no information whatsoever. Go back and read the exchange. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 7 July 2005 13:43 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the offer of support, but the subject under discussion is a widely known historical fact. I've provided the link.

<dd>I am aware of my state's history. I'm also aware that lots of so-called facts lack documentation. Lot's of "widely known historical facts" turn out to be legends. As I said on your discussion page, I wanted to see documentation on this. Since you proved it, I support you on the issue (I also inserted the reference). I also left a statement on the other users discussion page that there should not have been any traffic issues back then b/c the city wasn't that big. Traffic patterns in this article are irrelevant. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 7 July 2005 14:03 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Clearly, you were not aware of your state's history in this regard, which was the subject under discussion -- and that was my point. Lots of "widely known historical facts" are precisely that -- as, again, in this case. About the irrelevance of traffic issues vis-a-vis the boycott -- precisely the point I made. This "edit war" was little more than a skirmish. The kuncklehead who had the complaint about the insertion of the information regarding white women and domestics was simply being petty because he had no legitimate comeback to my response. Your deletion of the information was in error and certainly premature. Had you not done so, the matter probably would have dropped. But all's well that ends well. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 7 July 2005 14:11 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Wareware</span></h2>
<p>Well, after I (and the others who helped me) went through all that trouble, I found out long after the fact that the Arbitration Committee dropped the case because the racist coward left the web site (as near as we can tell) -- and only then after I inquired. It seems no one felt it necessary to inform me, so I have no idea exactly how long ago the matter was dropped. (Not terribly efficient or competent on the part of the Arb Com, I'm afraid; it doesn't speak very well of them.)</p>
<p>But I can't say the exercise was a complete waste of time. It provided an opportunity for a lot of good people to come forward and speak their minds about the situation. And I achieved <i>some</i> of what I wanted -- for that sick, little b*st*rd to disappear. I'm fortunate/blessed to know who I am, and so I wasn't the least fazed by the racist vitriol. (I've heard it all before. *yawn*&#160;:p) But I wanted to make a point by drawing attention to the problem and indirectly confront those Wikipedians who'd known of the situation but who had remained silent -- these people who want to pretend they're decent and all that crap, but who won't utter a peep when some sleazoid mental cretin spews racist venom. Shameful -- and typical.&#160;:p</p>
<p>Anyway, it's over and done with. Wareware is nowhere to be found, and I don't miss him one bit.&#160;:p Peace 2 u. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 23:57, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversi Article - change I made today about the chess refererence</span></h2>
<p>Hello Alabamaboy. I made the change to the Reversi article today.</p>
<p>I'm obviously new, and didn't realize that doing an edit would be summarily deleted without explanation if it wasn't agreed with if I didn't become a member. Sorry for any unintentional rules infractions, etc. Well, now I have joined. I have a wide ranging and long term interest and a fair amount of expertise in the area of computer pure-knowledge games (programming, history, evolution, theory, etc.) I hope I have something constructive to contribute to such articles. I stand behind the factual correctness and the documenting link I made in my edit today. The change seemed to be handled fine - just as it appeared in the preview. If you can help me understand your objection(s), offer suggestions, point out which pages I should study (there is a LOT of data in the help, etc. sections), that would be great. At this point I'm pretty clueless about any detailed style rules, etc. If I should have posted this query elsewhere, such as the Reversi discussion page, please let me know that too. (I wasn't sure if you'd see it there). Also, if you'd prefer to disuss this Reversi article issue elsewhere, such as on my "talk" page -- whatever works. I'm still learning to navigate around... Thanks in advance. Outcast Searcher</p>
<p>My bad on the revert--it was a simple srewup that happened while I was reverting vandalism. Please see the message I left on your talk page.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:31, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It pretty much all comes from the one chapter of Lott's book that I mention explicitly in the References section. I'd be inclined just to footnote the whole section to the chapter, rather than anything more precise. If there are any particular facts that you think need more specific citation, let me know and I'll do my best: I don't own a copy, I was writing from notes made from a library copy, and I may or may not have specific page number at hand. Some of my notes are specific to page number, but a given paragraph may actually combine information gleaned from different places in the chapter. For example, Stowe's reaction to Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy comes from a different part of the chapter than her not authorizing a performance, and I'm not even sure Lott gives Caroline Howard's first name (I think he says "Mrs. Howard"), but the Howards were one of the leading theater families of the era, and I'm sure that I could come up with an independent citation for that if needed. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:17, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Beecher_49a7.html" title="John Beecher">John Beecher</a> article is still substantially the same as the link that I found, including both wording and organization. There are only minor changes, and some sentences are still verbatim from that article. As it currently stands, it is still a copyright violation. You will need to work on rewording, reorganizing, and expanding the article before it is no longer a violation.</p>
<p>Your other choice would be to contact the publisher and/or editor (Steven Ford Brown). Presumably that text is either from the book's intro or the back cover copy. You could ask their permission to reprint the text under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.</p>
<p>Some suggestions: The current info in the article is begging for some expansion. Where did he go to school, and did he go to college? How did he develop an interest in poetry, and what were the influences on his poetry? Did he work in the mills by choice, or because of his parent's changing economic fortunes because of the depression? As a contemporary of Woody Guthrie and John Steinbeck, did he ever meet either of them (if he didn't, I would say that info should be excised from the article—just say that his poetry was about the problems of the depression)? What was the name of the court case, and why was his firing overturned? Where did the troop transport Booker T. Washington serve (Europe or Asia), and where there any major incidents aboard the ship while he was a CO? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 03:21, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm aware that the article needs expanding--it has just been a low priority for me. I disagree that the article is still a copyright violation but since I didn't originally write it (and only cleaned up the language and added additional info at a later point) let's go ahead and let it be deleted. Once the article is gone, I'll write a new, non copyright violation article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blacks</span></h2>
<p>Hey thanks for the positive feedback regarding <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks.html" title="Blacks">Blacks</a>. I agree with others who feel that "Blacks" is an inappropriate term, but my inexperience makes it hard for me to find a better way than using <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_%28people%29.html" title="Black (people)">Black (people)</a>. Also, I do not know how to end each comment with my name and time without typing it out. Is there a shorter way? - Zaphnathpaaneah August 14th 1:02 PM</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't agree that the term is inappropriate--as I'm sure you know, this is an old debate with valid arguements on both sides. I guess I'd see what the consensus on the issue turns out to be. As for the name tag, you can either hit the second button from the right above the box where you write your comments (the button looks like someone signed their name there) or you can type four tildes (they look like this ~, usually on the upper left of a kepboard) all in a row. If you ever need anything, or possible support on an issue, just drop me a line.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 17:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History of South Carolina FAC/FARC dispute</span></h2>
<p>I'm trying to avoid acrimony, not terribly successfully, which is why I wasn't so blunt on the FARC page as I am here. I think user:Toothpaste was purposefully gaming the system to avoid doing the work needed to get the article up to standards. She said (pretty directly on the peer review page, not quite as explicitly on the original FAC page) that she was going to do major work on the article, and that it was "much too soon" to renominate it. She then did minor work on the article (added a couple of superficial paragraphs that show no sign of serious research) and renominated it the next day. I don't see why it's my obligation to repair somebody else's bad work just because I've pointed out defects in it, especially when the repair work will be time-consuming. I don't even have the time to work on the articles I want most to work on. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:01, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I've added a ton of references, can you please check them for me to make sure they're acceptable? Also, I've had an experienced user help me tag the images. Can you please check those for me, too and see if anything more needs to be done. I think I can still find more refferences online, so feel free to leave me a list on my talk page of paragraphs/sentences/sections that need more refference coverage.</p>
<p>Also, the article is now at 45KB and I think that may be too big, please suggest what part of the article I should make into sub-page, unless 45KB is ok? (I've seen several featured articles reach 50, but the top of the edit page says 32 is acceptable).</p>

<p>To be honest, I did take your comments that wrong way, but it was just me overreacting. I was cranky from not sleeping (I had spent like 12 hours working on the article and didn't want to go to bed until I found it just right) and on top of that one of my friends had pissed me off right around the time to read your objection so it just added to my anger. Later on, I read the objections again and realized it was all done to better the article, so I apologize for the dumb comment I made on the columbine talk page. Should I submit it through peer review, or just go straight to the FAC page? Also, do you think once its on the front page it'll be almost completely changed by edit from "everyone and their mother?" Or will it just be minor stuff? Thanks for your help! - <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a></p>

<p>Thank You, it was my goal from day one to have this article be probably the best source of information on this event in the internet. I noticed that a lot of websites rely on myths, and don't give detailed accounts concerning Columbine. Of course, I can't take all the credit. Many users have contributed to this, including you. I just put a little extra effort in stabilizing it, and adding details. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">Prueda29</a></p>
<p>Image 2 is the actual Columbine Library. Its a picture of it during the investigation, if you look closely you can see the yellow labels they placed for shell casings, and sadly, bodies of the deceased (including blood stains). I do think that image 3 is good, but it might be a little graphic. My favorite is Image 2, especially if we place a caption that it is the Columbine Library after the shooting, but if you preffer #3, i'll go with it. - PRueda29</p>

<dd>

<dd>Ok, Image 3 it is. I'll add it, and I guess I'll copy the rationale from another picture. The image 2 picture is the Columbine library, not with bodies, but with yellow labels that show where the bodies were located, the bodies have already been removed. Image 1 is just the door of the library and i don't think that's blood, but it might be, who knows. I don't think image one should be it so it's betwen 2 and 3, and I think 3 is the best to replace the current image for the library massacre. If we get complains, we can change it for 2, how about that?- <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a></dd>

Of course, I hope that this article will become featured. As for PRueda29, I think I might offer him a barnstar when this is all said and done (even though one user I respect, <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalBender_a5e1.html" title="User:RadicalBender">RadicalBender</a>, thinks they are stupid). <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 00:40, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought you might be looking for some more constructive feedback than what I was willing to open up on the talk page of the article. Here's what I was about to add; I think you can see why it would've destroyed the point I was trying to make ...</p>
<p>"If I were to reorganise the article, I would make the History section shorter. I would change the title of Critque to something like "Impact" and include the positive contributions that African American Literature has made to <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_culture_ce45.html" title="African American culture">African American culture</a>, to Literature as a whole, American culture as a whole, and to American Literature as a whole. Critiques could then be a sub. The Critiques are a more powerful piece than the History. It has more to contribute that is <i>new</i>. So, the thought is to keep it as powerful, add the positive elements, and make the whole section more prominent. If possible, I would de-emphasize Frederick Douglass. However prominent, this is glaringly out of place with the rest of the article."</p>

<p>I made a preliminary look at the discussion and article (for this issue, it might take me some time to think of a workable solution, given that I am in the middle of other projects and issues), but I would suggest you talk to the person objecting directly on his talk page. That way, there is a better chance at a more detailed response and explanation.</p>
<p>Though the user hadn't been contributing much on the English Wikipedia, I looked at his German page and saw (if I have read it correctly), that he has an interest in literature, though in what way I am not sure. He has brought up some valid points, but his asking for a "complete rewrite" is extreme to say the least, and something I wouldn't recommend unless several more (note <i>several more</i>) users other than him object to the point of (God forbid) nominating the article for FA removal.</p>
<p>You said you have tried adding some material that he said were missing - that is a start. I also saw that you have support (<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> seems to be someone who enjoys literature, so you should ask him for any advice short of a rewrite).

<p>==Disputes== (cross posted on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lord_Voldemort" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lord_Voldemort" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lord_Voldemort</a>)</p>
<p>I basically have two disputes of a differing nature. The 1st wd be on the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> talk page. I just think that the links to novels are ungodly long and have suggested a number of options, mainly due to the fact that some of the cited links are not to novels, novel precursors, some were written in verse- including a verse novel, and there is, to me, some manifest biases for certain ethnic groups. Aside from that there are over 101 links and growing. How can I try to get a quorum to simply make this better, more concise, etc? Looking around on Wiki I find some abominable entries- either in terms of redundant phrasing, grammar, punctuation, but even more in some flat out wrong factual areas, such as... This is dispute #2. I came across it in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a> entry 1st- the redundancy of stating that an urban legend was untrue. I then saw that the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> entry stated there could be true urban legends so went to the snopes.com website and pasted in its contradictory definition- which logically says that UL's, like any legend, cannot be true, by definition. It's ill worded but you can sort it out. In short, if a hallmark of a UL is that it has had information altered or distorted it is by definition not true. Logic dictates that one impure element corrupts the whole. A sea of pure water, fouled by a drop of blood is no longer pure. The same it is with truth. It can be partly true, based on a truth, etc., but it requires that qualifier- despite the idiocy of the Snopes definition. For example, if alligators were found in NYC sewers they wd no longer be a UL, but a fact. Just as gorillas were once legendary, but are now fact. The chronological qualifier of the past tense 'were', would be required; as in 'Alligators in NYC sewers were an urban legend until they were in fact discovered in 2008', or the like. Similarly, if I state 'George Washington was a tall white man who was the first President of the United States,' I am stating an unequivocal truth. However, if I change a single element, if I substitute is for was, short for tall, black for white, woman for man, second for first, Governor for President, France for US, the whole sentence is untrue, despite truths within it. It may be partly or mostly true, but it is in the whole false. Similarly, any legend- urban or not- is untrue. If proved true it ceases to be legend, and becomes fact- like the gorilla. This is basic logic, and semiotics. Another user states that it is a vital point that ULs can be untrue. I agree it's vital, but the lad has lost his head- and I don't care what some website or book says. No cited source is above logic and truth, and as a claimed encyclopedia Wiki should be held to higher standards than any old website. I would like to lay out my case before whatever powers that be on these matters. I realize this may not be as 'sexy' a battle or issue as President Bush, abortion, the war in Iraq, or the death penalty, but if this org cannot even stabd up for impeccable logic and truth, thaen what's the point? I've other points to make, but this is my basic case, and I think both are worthy. The first for simple functionality, and the second for logic. Forgive me if I seem picayune, but these seem to me to be the essence of what a source of knowledge shd be about. Please advise me.

<p>Now I see your points. Except for blogs (while I hate to use them as sources, but in this case we have to) and GNAA published stuff, there is no third party source. I can also see why yall think this group does not deserve an article on Wikipedia, thus why I gave up the FAC. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 16:48, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Date changes</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that they've suddenly changed all the dates to the british style. It's automatic. Do you know anything about this? I preffered the old style where depending on the type of article you could choose the date format (like US articles had US formats) but now, if you put [[April 20]] on the editing page, it comes out as <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>. I don't think they should force us to use that style of dates? Any idea what's going on? Or how to stop it? <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a></p>
