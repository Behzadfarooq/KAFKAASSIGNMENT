	    <p><b>Manu Alamein Kopu</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>) is a former <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> politician.</p>
<p><a name="Birth_and_early_life" id="Birth_and_early_life"></a></p>

<p>Kopu was raised in <a href="../../../o/p/o/Opotiki.html" title="Opotiki">Opotiki</a>. Her family was not wealthy, and Kopu characterises her youth as containing "much hardship". In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, her family moved to <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. In Australia, Kopu became involved with community programs aimed at drug users and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitutes</a>, something that she continued after arriving back in New Zealand in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. Kopu also had considerable involvement in <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehabilitation_%28penology%29.html" title="Rehabilitation (penology)">rehabilitation</a> programs for <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">criminals</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alamein_Kopu_76ed.html" title="Edit section: Political life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political life</span></h2>
<p>In addition to this work, Kopu was also involved in various <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/o/M%C4%81ori.html" title="Māori">Māori</a> cultural and educational programs. She quickly joined <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mana_Motuhake_62ac.html" title="Mana Motuhake">Mana Motuhake</a>, a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political party</a> based around promoting Māori interests and welfare. When Mana Motuhake joined with several other groups to establish the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%28New_Zealand_political_party%29_535f.html" title="Alliance (New Zealand political party)">Alliance</a>, Kopu became involved in the new organization. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1993_b59e.html" title="New Zealand general election 1993">1993 election</a>, she stood as its candidate for the Eastern Māori, but was unsuccessful. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1996_2f48.html" title="New Zealand general election 1996">1996 election</a>, the first to be conducted under the new <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_Member_Proportional_a5a4.html" title="Mixed Member Proportional">MMP</a> system, Kopu contested the Te Tai Rawhiti seat, and was ranked twelfth on the Alliance list. While she did not win Te Tai Rawhiti, the Alliance received enough votes for Kopu to enter parliament as a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_MP_a1fd.html" title="List MP">list MP</a>.</p>
<p>She gained widespread public recognition when she resigned from her party and gave support to the government, a move which was widely criticised. She was also widely controversial as she previously had been a long time welfare beneficiary before entering parliament.</p>
<p>Kopu gradually came under increasing criticism, however, both from political opponents and from her own party. Much of the criticism stemmed from her apparent lack of participation - many Alliance colleagues complained that she was rarely seen in parliament, and believed that she was not doing sufficient work. Other causes of criticism stemmed from internal tensions between different factions of Mana Motuhake. Kopu resented the criticism, and voiced the possibility of leaving the Alliance.</p>
<p>In July <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Kopu finally resigned from her party. This generated a great deal of criticism from many sides. The issue was of particular relevance due to her status as a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_MP_a1fd.html" title="List MP">list MP</a> - she had been elected to parliament by virtue of her position on the Alliance list, not through any votes she had received personally, and as such, many believed that Kopu had no right to remain in parliament. Moreover, Kopu (like all other Alliance MPs) had previously signed a pledge affirming that if she ever left the party, she would resign from parliament. Kopu had, in fact, reaffirmed this pledge only a few days before she quit. The leader of the Alliance, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Anderton_86b1.html" title="Jim Anderton">Jim Anderton</a>, said that Kopu's actions "breach[ed] every standard of morality and ethics that are known".</p>
<p>Kopu defended her decision by saying that she was only doing what was best for Māori. Upon leaving the Alliance, she also received strong support from several other Māori MPs, notably <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau_Henare_af2f.html" title="Tau Henare">Tau Henare</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_First_de0c.html" title="New Zealand First">New Zealand First</a> party. Henare, who had often criticised the Alliance's (and Mana Motuhake's) approach to Māori affairs, said that Kopu was welcome to join New Zealand First, although this was later rejected by other members of the party. Kopu quickly aligned herself with the governing coalition.</p>
<p><a name="Independence" id="Independence"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alamein_Kopu_76ed.html" title="Edit section: Independence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Independence</span></h2>
<p>After spending some time as an independent, Kopu decided to establish her own political party, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mana_Wahine_Te_Ira_Tangata_edc9.html" title="Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata">Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata</a>. The party was ostensibly based on promoting the welfare of Māori women. Many of Kopu's critics, however, claimed that the party was established primarily to ensure Kopu received more generous parliamentary funding. Mana Wahine became significant when, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, the governing <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_National_Party_f015.html" title="New Zealand National Party">National Party</a> found itself reliant on Mana Wahine's support (along with that of various former New Zealand First MPs). National, left with a precarious majority when its coalition with New Zealand First collapsed, needed as much support as it could find, and managed to obtain Kopu's backing.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1999_830d.html" title="New Zealand general election 1999">1999 election</a>, Kopu stood as her party's candidate in the Waiariki electorate. Eleven other Mana Wahine candidates also stood. The party had also intended to submit a party list, but Kopu failed to submit it before the deadline. This eliminated the possibility of Kopu remaining in parliament as a list MP - she would need to win her electorate race in order to keep her seat. In the election, however, Kopu won only 1.7% of the vote in Waiariki, placing sixth. Moreover, the national vote for Mana Wahine candidates indicated that Kopu would not have been returned as a list MP in any case. Kopu lost her parliamentary seat.</p>
