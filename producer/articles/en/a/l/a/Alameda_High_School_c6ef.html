<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_High_School_c6ef.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>It was at the Alameda Board of Education meeting held on March 6, 1874, that the suggestion to open a ‘Preparatory Department of a High School' was first presented. On April 17, 1874, C. Y. Johns was elected the first principal. Classes began with 52 students, in July 1874, in a rented room over a drugstore on Park Street known as "Boehmer's Hall". The building still exists today as the China House restaurant.</p>
<p>Boehmer's Hall was only temporary. Already a new building was being built on a site on Santa Clara at Chestnut, completed and occupied in 1875. The high school shared space with the Grammar Department in what became known as ‘Haight School', a site still occupied by this school today. The class of 1878, totalling nine students, was the first to graduate from Alameda High School.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the number of students enrolled in the high school outgrew the space available at Haight. Temporary quarters were located at the Porter school, located on Alameda Avenue, by 1900. A campaign was started for a new separate high school building.</p>
<p>With the help of the high school student body, a bond was passed in the city for the new school. The cornerstone was laid in 1902 on the new site at Central and Walnut. The building was dedicated in 1903 and occupied in time for the December 1903 term.</p>
<p>Continued growth in enrollment required an even larger campus. In 1925 a new bond issue was voted on. The new school, dedicated in 1926, comprised three connected buildings, including the original 1903 structure which was refurbished to blend with the architectural style of the other two. The architecture, designed by local architect Carl Werner, is early-twentieth-century <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_architecture.html" title="Neoclassical architecture">Neo-Classical Revival</a> in nature, evoking images of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Ancient_Greece_8ea1.html" title="Architecture of Ancient Greece">ancient Greek temples</a> with <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionic_order.html" title="Ionic order">Ionic</a> columns in front of the Kofman Auditorium, a facility known throughout the Bay Area as one of the best of the local playhouses.</p>
<p>By 1955, the ‘old building' had outlived its usefulness and was replaced with what became known as the ‘new building' by subsequent students until 1977.</p>
<p>Campaigns to replace old public buildings with newer earthquake-safe structures led to the construction of the newest high school building, across the street from the established campus, on Encinal at Walnut.</p>
<p>Original plans involved tearing down the 1926 buildings and replacing them with a sports complex, the only building to be kept being the ‘new building' of 1955. A dedicated group of alumni and citizens saved the venerable buildings and the planned new construction was scaled back to what exists today.</p>
<p>The newest building was first occupied in 1978 and included the site of the former Porter school. At present, the office of the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_Unified_School_District_0858.html" title="Alameda Unified School District">Alameda Unified School District</a> reside in the Kofman Buildings. The west wing now houses Language and Fine Arts, as well as the Frederick L. Chacon Little Theater. The school was made an Alameda Historical Monument in 1976 and listed in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1977.</p>

<p>Alameda High School is an ethnically diverse school, reporting, for the 2004-2005 academic year, a composition that is 41% Asian, 33% non-Hispanic White, 10% Hispanic/Latino, 8% African-American, 6% Filipino, less than 1% American Indian/Native Alaskan, and less than 1% Mixed/Not Reporting.</p>
<p>The school has received <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_School_c077.html" title="Blue Ribbon School">National Blue Ribbon</a> recognition and <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Distinguished_School_d7bc.html" title="California Distinguished School">California Distinguished School</a> and Digital High School awards.

<p>AHS competes in the Alameda/Contra Costa Athletic League (ACCAL) and is part of the Northern Coastal Section (NCS) of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Interscholastic_Federation_0e10.html" title="California Interscholastic Federation">California Interscholastic Federation</a> (CIF). The athletic programs are generally well-regarded.</p>
<p>The track and field, cross country, tennis, golf, and badminton teams, in particular, have enjoyed recent success. Likewise, the baseball program has historically been competitive at AHS. Led by Ken Arnerich, the 2006 Varsity baseball team recorded four consecutive upset wins in the playoffs to bring Alameda High its first ever <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Coast_Section_ac10.html" title="North Coast Section">North Coast Section</a> title in baseball.</p>
<p>Alameda was a perennial regional football power back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and won a state championship back in 1918, but the program struggled through the 80's and 90's. The football program has been improving steadily in recent years, however, due to Kevin Hennessee, who assumed the head coaching duties, rebuilt the program and led the team to four consecutive winning seasons, four consecutive Island Bowl victories against crosstown rivals <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encinal_High_9397.html" title="Encinal High">Encinal High</a> and two playoff appearances in three years, 2003 and 2005. Hennessee departed in 2006, however, and was succeeded by former Offensive Coordinator George Calandri. Calandri continued the winning legacy in 2007, leading Alameda to its 5th straight Island Bowl victory and back into the post-season playoffs. But Calandri's tenure was shortlived, as time/work commitments forced him to step down after one season. Former Hornet assistant Steve Rochlin has now assumed the Head Coaching duties.</p>

<p>Alameda High is the first school in Alameda to appear in a Japanese anime. The school and its former vice principal were both animated for the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animatrix.html" title="Animatrix">Animatrix</a> short film <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kid%27s_Story_5a61.html" title="Kid's Story">Kid's Story</a>. It is interesting to note that the school was renamed to Clearview High while the likeness of the former vice principal was used as the teacher seen in the episode.</p>
