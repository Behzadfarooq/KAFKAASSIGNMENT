<p><b>Alaric Anthony Morgan</b> was born on September 29, 1091, the eldest son and heir of Sir Kenneth Morgan and his wife, Lady Alyce de Corwyn. He acquired the titles of Duke of Corwyn and Earl of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earldoms_of_Gwynedd_%28Fictional%29_1e9b.html#Lendour" title="Earldoms of Gwynedd (Fictional)">Lendour</a> at birth, both of which were inherited from his mother. In November of 1095, King <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donal_Blaine_of_Gwynedd_73e9.html" title="Donal Blaine of Gwynedd">Donal Blaine Haldane</a> used his own magical powers to grant the four-year-old Morgan the ability to activate the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deryni.html#The_Haldane_Potential" title="Deryni">Haldane potential</a> of Prince <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brion_of_Gwynedd_db0a.html" title="Brion of Gwynedd">Brion Haldane</a> should the need arise. Prince Brion succeeded his father as King of <a href="../../../g/w/y/Gwynedd_%28Fictional%29_58ac.html" title="Gwynedd (Fictional)">Gwynedd</a> a short time later, but Morgan did not meet the new king until 1100, when Morgan traveled to the royal court at <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhemuth.html" title="Rhemuth">Rhemuth</a> following the death of his father. Initially serving as a royal page, Morgan soon became Brion's personal squire, and he accompanied the king on his campaign to put down the rebellion of Earl Rorik III of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earldoms_of_Gwynedd_%28Fictional%29_1e9b.html#Eastmarch" title="Earldoms of Gwynedd (Fictional)">Eastmarch</a> in 1105. After Brion was personally challenged by Duke <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogan_Gwernach_of_Furst%C3%A1n-Festil_ea55.html" title="Hogan Gwernach of Furst치n-Festil">Hogan Gwernach</a> of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torenthi_Fiefdoms_4cce.html#Marluk" title="Torenthi Fiefdoms">Marluk</a>, the Festillic Pretender, Morgan activated the king's Haldane potential on June 21. Brion defeated the Pretender in a Duel Arcane the following day, and returned to Rhemuth victorious shortly thereafter. Ironically, Morgan's efforts to protect Brion resulted in the enduring hatred and mistrust of Brion's wife, Queen <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehana_of_Gwynedd_e504.html" title="Jehana of Gwynedd">Jehana</a>, who blamed Morgan for corrupting her husband with forbidden magic. Upon reaching his legal majority on September 29 of that year, Morgan was officially confirmed as Duke of Corwyn.</p>
<p>Morgan never concealed his <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deryni.html" title="Deryni">Deryni</a> heritage, and was openly shunned and ostracized by many of the courtiers in Rhemuth. Nevertheless, he remained one of Brion's closest friends and advisors, and the king's public support secured the young duke's position at court. Over the years, Morgan's unswerving loyalty to Brion earned him several additional allies and friends, though there were still many at the royal court (especially Queen Jehana) who distrusted the Duke of Corwyn.</p>
<p>In September of 1120, Morgan was sent to the city of Cardosa to analyze the local Torenthi incursions, but he returned to Rhemuth in November upon learning of King Brion's murder. With the assistance of his cousin, Monsignor <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_McLain_4b5b.html" title="Duncan McLain">Duncan McLain</a>, Morgan successfully activated the Haldane potential of Brion's son and heir, King <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelson_of_Gwynedd_2f0f.html" title="Kelson of Gwynedd">Kelson Haldane</a>, which enabled the young king to defeat the most recent Festillic Pretender, Duchess <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charissa_of_Furst%C3%A1n-Festil_b6d1.html" title="Charissa of Furst치n-Festil">Charissa</a> of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torenthi_Fiefdoms_4cce.html#Tol.C3.A1n" title="Torenthi Fiefdoms">Tol치n</a>, during his coronation the following day. Morgan and Duncan also discovered that they both bore the ability to Heal, a Deryni talent that had been lost for two centuries. During the schism of the Holy Church in 1121, Morgan was captured and almost burned at the stake before being rescued by Duncan, and he lost his capital city of Coroth for a short time to the rebellious forces of Archbishop Edmund II Loris. However, he soon regained control of Coroth, and was at Kelson's side on July 2 when the king emerged victorious from a Duel Arcane with King <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wencit_of_Torenth_61d2.html" title="Wencit of Torenth">Wencit of Torenth</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, as Kelson matured into a skilled king, Morgan served as his primary mentor and advisor. He accompanied the king on a daring December raid to the Mearan city of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratharkin.html" title="Ratharkin">Ratharkin</a> in 1123, and stood at Kelson's side during the king's ill-fated marriage to Princess Sidana of <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meara.html" title="Meara">Meara</a>. After assisting Kelson in setting the Haldane potential in Prince <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Haldane_of_Gwynedd_8178.html" title="Nigel Haldane of Gwynedd">Nigel</a>, Brion's brother, he served as Kelson's senior commander in the southern Gwyneddan army during the Mearan campaign of 1124. At the decisive battle against the rebellious Mearan forces, Morgan's Deryni powers enabled him to save Duncan from dying at the stake, much as his cousin had previously saved him. When Kelson was believed killed in a tragic accident in March of 1125, Morgan performed his duty to Gwynedd by activating the Haldane potential of Prince Regent <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conall_Haldane_of_Gwynedd_fefb.html" title="Conall Haldane of Gwynedd">Conall Haldane</a>, but he refused to accept that Kelson was truly dead. He and Duncan continued to search the Lendour Mountains after the official search had been abandoned, and they succeeded in finding the king alive on April 12. In 1128, Morgan traveled to the Torenthi capital of Beldour with Kelson to witness the official installation of King Liam-Lajos II of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torenth.html" title="Torenth">Torenth</a>.</p>
<p>Much of Morgan's life has been spent in service to the House of Haldane, and his loyalty to both Brion and Kelson has never wavered. Just as Brion served as a mentor to the young Duke of Corwyn, Morgan served as a mentor to Brion's son, often instructing Kelson in the finer points of statecraft and leadership. Even though Kelson has matured to the point where he no longer relies quite so heavily on Morgan, the Duke of Corwyn remains his primary advisor and his oldest friend. Although he deliberately cultivated an aura of mystery around himself during his youth, his increasing authority and influence, in addition to becoming a husband and father, have matured him into a polished and temperate courtier. Known to be loyal, intelligent, and honorable, Morgan has displayed a keen grasp of numerous tactical and political situations, whether dealing with foreign powers, domestic issues, ecclesiastical debates, or his contentious relationship with the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberian_Council_ea6a.html" title="Camberian Council">Camberian Council</a>. He received very little formal training for his magical talents, but he has recently acquired additional training from his wife, Duchess Richenda of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earldoms_of_Gwynedd_%28Fictional%29_1e9b.html#Rheljan" title="Earldoms of Gwynedd (Fictional)">Rheljan</a>. Nevertheless, his Deryni powers are formidable, and he is one of only three Deryni known to possess the talent for Healing.</p>
