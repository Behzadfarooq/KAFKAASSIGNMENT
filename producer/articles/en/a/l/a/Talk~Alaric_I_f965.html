<dl>
<dd>"After much bargaining, the famine-stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of more than a quarter of a million sterling, (question for reviewers: did sterling have a meaning in late Roman context, or has the 1911 author helpfully converted some Roman amount to <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> British pounds sterling? This should be checked against other sources) besides precious garments of silk and leather and three thousand pounds of pepper. Thus ended Alaric's first siege of Rome."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I stumbled across the primary source that provided this figure for the 1911 EB author today, &amp; it stated that the Romans paid Alaric 2000 pound of gold -- pounds as in measure of weight, not the currency.</p>

<p>The "Alaricus" article, which now redirects to "Alaric", contained the following text before it was redirected:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alarico - the Barbarian who Humiliated Rome</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Between the Visigodos heads who assediaram the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, none was of the dimension of Alarico. The principle gave services to the Emperor of the Ocidente, Honório, in exchange for an annual soldier's pay. But Alarico early became a threat. Its true name would be Ala-Reik and would have lived of 376 the 410. Coming to grips itself with the Emperor of the East, Arcádio, Alarico it reached with its troops the peninsula Greek and intended to destroy Constantinopla.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks to the troops of Estilicão (another Barbarian the service of the Empire of the East), Alarico was withheld with its thousand of soldiers. Defeated, it is turned toward west and it advances through the Alps, of the plain of the Dust and the Apeninos, in direction <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Its troops had been increased with the Barbarians of Estilicão, after the murder of this, the control of Arcádio.Alarico besieges Rome, leaving it without foods. Beyond the hunger, it starts to spread over the city a plague epidemic, result of the thousands of insepultos corpses. The Romans, desperate, suffocate its pride and beg the Alarico that if removes. The Visigodos head demands, for this, all the other and silver of the city as rescue, beyond the release of about 40 a thousand barbarous slaves. To disappointed ambassadors Roman, that had asked to it "that in you leave them, therefore", he answered simply: "the life...".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Later, another time Alarico besieges Rome, that falls in day 24 of August of <a href="../../../4/1/0/410.html" title="410">410</a>. 3 days of booty and bloody slaughter are followed, of which had participated the 40 a thousand freed slaves of the previous small farm.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To follow Alarico one leaves for the south of Italy, intending to attack Sicily. It dies, however, to the 34 years, without reaching its objective. It was embedded, together with great addition of gold and silver,in the riverbed Busento, deviated of its course for the slaves, for the burial. After the return of waters its normal course, the slaves had been beheaded, guaranteeing itself, thus, the final rest of Alarico against the breaking of the sepulture for the enemies.</dd>

<p>I have moved this article from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaric.html" title="Alaric">Alaric</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaric_I_48f4.html" title="Alaric I">Alaric I</a>, and made <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaric.html" title="Alaric">Alaric</a> into a disambiguation page, because Alaric can refer to more than one person. Granted, Alaric the Goth who sacked Rome was the most notable person of that name. However, Alaric I is an appropriate title for this individual -- even Encyclopedia Britannica uses "Alaric I" as their name for him on Britannica.com . All links to Alaric have been fixed in the corrsponding articles. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 12:00, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read the presentation and i find that there is a geographical confussion&#160;: Alaric place of birth- Danube Delta - mouth of the Danube- this is, as I know in Romania not in Bulgaria and in the south part is also a region - Dobrogea- wich is also romanian teritory. The huns were coming in that period in Transilvania. Looking at the map I imagine that alaric was born probabily neer Tulcea- Romania.</p>
<hr />
<p>Could someone please try to rewrite the passages referring to Honorius? I myself don't know that much about him, but calling him "timid and feeble" and speaking of his "impenetrable stupidity" really doesn't sound like NPOV to me. Probably leftover from the original 1911 text, this really should be revised to what the current historic view of Honorius is. The same is true for the Honorius article itself. I read some other sources that speak about this emperor a whole lot less negative. Don't have the time nor the knowledge to rewrite this myself, unfortunately. --<a href="../../../a/m/m/User%7EAmmaletu_83b4.html" title="User:Ammaletu">Ammaletu</a> 14:52, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are numerous factual errors or "possible"s presented as facts. I'll touch just two:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article states that Alaric lived 370-412, but within the article it is stated that "He died in Cosenza soon after [August 24, 410], probably of fever, at the early age of thirty-four" -- This means that his age data at the beginning of the article is faulty (which it is); and that at any rate, he could not be thirty-four. This should read: fourty.</li>
<li>The chief authorities for Alaric are not as mentioned: Claudian and Zosimos are probably the two of which about 95 per cent of the material is based. Jordanes, especially, is of marginal value.</li>

In the process of adapting the All Experts website entry for use in Wikipedia, the contributor copied directly from his or her source, but misidentified the antecedent for "He" in the source's sentence "He crossed the Gulf of Corinth . . ." The prior edition of this article stated that "Arcadius crossed the Gulf of Corinth." In fact, it was Alaric who did so. I verified this from Chapter XXX of Volume 3 of Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which can be found at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext96/3dfre10.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext96/3dfre10.txt" rel="nofollow">Gutenberg Project Gibbon</a>.

<dd>"'<b>Alaric I'</b>(ăl`ərĭk) lived around 370–410 and was a Visigothic king. It is thought his tribe migrated ahead of the Huns into Roman lands when he was aged 11. He later headed the Visigothic troops serving Emperor Theodosius I. After the emperor's death (395) the troops rebelled and chose Alaric as their leader. The Visigoths were one of the most important groups of Germans tribes of the time. Having settled in the region west of the Black Sea in the 3rd century AD, the Goths soon split into two divisions, the Ostrogoths (East Goths) and the Visigoths (West Goths).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the 4th century, Alaric had devastated Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece. Stopped, but not defeated, by <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stilicho.html" title="Stilicho">Stilicho</a>. He was the chief general of Theodosius I , whose niece he married.</dd>
<dd>In 401 he invaded Italy, where after some indecisive warfare, he agreed to withdraw. Stilicho persuaded (407) the Romans to buy Alaric's alliance, but shortly afterward Emperor Honorius Honorius, 384–423, Roman emperor of the West (395–423). On the death (395) of Theodosius I, the Roman Empire was divided; Arcadius , the elder son, received the East, and Honorius, the younger son, received the West. This division proved to be a permanent one. The general Stilicho , as guardian of Honorius, at first controlled the government of the West and defended the empire against the Visigoths.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alaric again invaded (408) Italy and laid siege to Rome. Raising the siege after an agreement with the Roman senate, Alaric again turned on Rome (409) and forced the city to accept a puppet emperor, Attalus, whom he himself deposed the next year for disregarding his advice. After the failure of renewed negotiations with Honorius (who all the while held out at Ravenna) Alaric stormed and sacked Rome (410) and then marched south to attack Sicily and Africa. His sacking of Rome did <i>not</i> include the mass destruction of Rome - a city he much admired. He wished for fair treatment and good quality land for his tribe promised earlier by the Romans. A storm later destroyed his fleet, and Alaric, having turned back, died of an illness. His brother Ataulf was elected his successor. It is said that Alaric was buried with his treasures near Cosenza in the bed of the Busento River, which was temporarily diverted from its course. That the secret of his burial place might be kept, the slaves employed in the labor were killed." <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 10:34, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having watched the BBC <i>Ancient Rome</i> series, I turned to this article for more info. Interestingly the BBC takes up the story in about 408 and does not mention the previous bloody campaigns by the Goths. The viewpoint of the BBC's historical advisors is that the murder of Stilchio was because the Emperor disagreed with the deal that Stilchio had made with Alaric. The programme also emphasises that Alaric was continually betrayed by Honorious and his advisers. It also claims that he not want to take Rome at all, merely to threaten it to get the land he had been promised. Thinking he had a deal about land, he voluntarily lifted the seige. (Having been given much of the city's wealth without fighting for it, he also had less incentive.) The Romans then tried to reinforce Rome and Alaric realised that he had been double-crossed again. After further attempts at negotiation were unsuccessful, Alaric had no option but to make good his threat and to take Rome. <a href="../../../j/m/c/User%7EJmcc150_196b.html" title="User:Jmcc150">JMcC</a> 08:54, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't actually know how Alaric died, but I feel certain that wombats were not involved. 129.170.202.226 12:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone made a call for a citation after the following statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd>During the fourth century it had become common practice with the Roman emperors to employ federates or <a href="../../../f/o/e/Foederati.html" title="Foederati">foederati</a>; Germanic irregular troops under Roman command but organized by tribal structures.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Besides the fact that this is an uncontroversial statement--attested to by Gibbon, Bradley, and every other familiar historian who has written about Alaric--a link is provided to the <i>Wikipedia</i> article, <b>Foederati</b>, within which the necessary citation appears. Therefore the citation call has been deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredwords_522f.html" title="User:Fredwords">Fredwords</a> 15:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
