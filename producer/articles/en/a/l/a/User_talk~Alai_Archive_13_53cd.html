<p>Why did you undo my MoS punctuation fixes on this article? Since this is not a "U.S. topic", I see no reason for this to be written in a punctuation style particular to (some instances of) American style. (Even if these were not supposed to be consistent across all topics, which in this case they are.) Alai 09:26, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not a matter of UK vs. US punctuation usage. There are what people believe is right and what is right. Official publications (not blogs and unofficial publications), such as books and newspapers, teach how to use punctuations within quotation marks properly by their very storytelling. Having an eye for detail, I've noticed and learned this throughout my life, and noticed the breaking of these rules on unofficial publications. Colons, semicolons, questions marks, and exclamation marks would always go outside the quote marks if it wasn't part of the original quote. Periods and commas go inside, whether originated by the subject or not. I wanted what was right for this page -- not what people thought was right. I saw the MoS page, and it's wrong, despite popular belief. Popularizing an idea doesn't make it right. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by galileo5 (<a href="../../../g/a/l/User_talk%7EGalileo5_09e7.html" title="User talk:Galileo5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_galileo5_d83d.html" title="Special:Contributions/galileo5">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

Galileo5, please see <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_prescription.html" title="Linguistic prescription">Linguistic prescription</a> and then see <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">Linguistics</a>. At any rate, the punctuation-inside-quotes style a) is not used by most English-speaking cultures; b) is not used universally in the US, even in major publications; c) is an aesthetic <i>typographical</i> (i.e. typesetting) convention, and nothing more, and has nothing to do with grammatical "correctness" (which is an subjective concept to begin with); and d) is dying out, because it leads to critical ambiguities and misquotations (this is especially important when it comes to computing — <i>type "rm -rf foo".</i> is emphatically <i>not</i> the same instruction as <i>type "rm -rf foo."</i> — but is significant in other areas too. Lastly, Wikipedia is culturally not very tolerant of spelling and grammar fights. Just let it lie, please. If you continue going around making edits like that they will largely just get reverted. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 01:46, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No nonsense, please. It is indeed pretty universal in the U.S. But we have decided in our MoS to go against the U.S. style for punctuation with quotation marks, unlike the situation with national varieties of English where variations are acceptable. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 16:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's hardly original research to be working from a published map created from US Census Bureau designations&#160;:-) I certainly had been thinking for a while about your idea for "Southwest Ohio geo-stubs" analogous to Northwest Ohio, which made sense except for the idea of putting Trumbull and Highland together, and therefore I'd been wondering if we had some way to divide eastern and southern. I'm still reluctant to agree, since there's little definite boundary between these two areas — Noble, Guernsey, and Harrison counties are rather similar, as far as I know — but if you're uncomfortable with doing one for counties with Ohio River shorelines and another for those without, this would be the best that I could think of. Selected as best as we can do from official sources, this idea will be able to divide the counties without putting dissimilar counties together like my idea would have. Thanks for finding a division line&#160;:-) <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 14:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the state website you cite is a better division. Please don't think me as vacillating, being blown about by every wind of ideas; I'm simply not the kind of person that does much research — preferring instead to improve Wikipedia internally, such as by producing all those county templates. Therefore, I'm open to any well-defined way to divide the undefined areas of Ohio. I should note: thanks so much for considering my opinions on this matter, especially since I have done virtually nothing with stub sorting! <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 16:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've created and begun to populate the Southern Ohio, Southeastern Ohio, and East Central Ohio stub categories. There are about 150 articles and stub templates between the three, but there are perhaps 400 or more township articles to move over. Could you turn the bot's attention to them? Thanks! <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 19:51, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! I moved Clinton County because I thought that it wasn't in any of the other categories. Sorry for putting it in the wrong place; I must not have been paying attention. I must say, I thought it was rather odd to have it apart from anything else, but I thought I had it in the right place. I'm glad that I was wrong&#160;:-) <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 21:48, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>As someone who is not into stub sorting, what should be done? Should things such as Houston Woods (or however it's spelled) State Park be left as Ohio-geo-stub, or be put both as ButlerOH-geo-stub and PrebleOH-geo-stub? <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 22:46, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could stubs be created for the regional articles so that articles such as Hueston Woods don't have to be multiple-county or statewide? <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 00:17, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Alai,</p>
<p>What is the matter with me?</p>
<ul>
<li>RV; you are right,I did.Like as other's Rv without any consensus in these articles.</li>
<li>If it is normal/acceptible to delete a template(Due to its SfD) from an article during discussion, also its normal to add to some articles.</li>
<li>It is not acceptible; to wait, to stoped work in wiki, during the period of discussion of SfD. If there will be a concensus/decision on this template, it is very easy to take it back/delete from related articles.( I will do,myself).</li>
<li>I am not trying to disturb any body including you, just to develop Turkish related articles with my limited time and not-perfect English.</li>
<li>For your comfort/relax, during following two days, I will not deal with cuisine related articles, I will be in Turkish districts.</li>

<dd>If you are referring to a bot that removes (or links) fair use images from any namespace other than main, which I think you are, this was on my todo list or rather my TodoAfterTheEnDatabaseIsFixedOnTheToolServerAndIBotherToLernSQLList but if you can provide a list I will code the bot. MECU has been bugging me about this and this most likely will create tons more fair use orphans to be tagged. As for the flak, I think I can handle it, I just will have to put on my flame proof suit before checking my talk page.

<dd>Yes, I was thinking of running a secondary copy of the uncategorized tagging bot, but it would not be full time (24/7).

Is there any special requirements I must have before running the bot? Am I able to run it and would you have a problem with it?

<p>Would it be possible for your bot, while tagging articles as un-categorised, to look at the size of the article and/or the length of time the article has existed. The reason is that I was working on an article your bot had tagged as lacking categories when I noticed the categories had been removed in an earlier edit. If the bot could then dump a list (at say User:Alaibot\Possible missing categories or something like that) of articles that were large or had been around for 6 months or more. The list could be reviewed by a human to see if the categories had been removed and then could be restored easily.

<dd>Thanks! If it would not be too much trouble, could you do the same for the US-tv and US-film actor stubs, including the creation of the 1900s and 1910s templates as you did for the US-screen actor stubs?

<p>No problem about the Wikibreak. I've been doing some more wiki things lately, and I contemplating removing it today. Perhaps I should.</p>
<p>Regarding Taiwan, if most of the templates say Taiwan, there's no real need to bot them all over to ROC. Creating redirects wouldn't be too unreasonable though.</p>
<p>Regarding Mainland China, my personal opinion is to not have a stub for it. I know there are valid points in keeping historical locations (Ancient Greece, etc), but that tends to cause more trouble than its worth. I'm pretty sure it's obvious that we need a stub for PRC because that is the current status, yes? I would also say that we'd need <i>something</i> for historical China, such as a China-hist-stub scoped as Mainland China. Hong Kong and Macau are still upmergeable (is that even a word? well, it is now), so that shouldn't cause too many problems.</p>
<p>Regarding the permcats, sadly that's mostly out of our scope at WSS. There's not much we can do except follow those. If there aren't any specific "Mainland China" permcats, then there's no reason to have a corresponding stubcat. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmalas_f8d6.html" title="User:Amalas"><font color="maroon"><b>~ Amalas</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmalas_8c3c.html" title="User talk:Amalas"><font color="navy">rawr</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amalas_7b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amalas"><sup>=^_^=</sup></a> 20:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>From what I can tell, PRC=Mainland China + (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau). Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau are already split out nicely and are not really a big problem (except in the case of upmerging, which, even then, is trivial). So, what's left is: Are the PRC and Mainland China the same <i>as far as stubs are concerned</i>? I'm trying not to argue politics about it, but there's not a huge distinction. However, I'm pretty sure my closure at that old SFD is inline with this: PRC is an umbrella cat which holds both Mainland China and the SARs (which would be upmerged back into PRC). Perhaps PRC should just be one of those no-template cats. China-X-stub would then be scoped as Mainland China only. Or rename as MainlandChina-X-stub, but that's rather wordy. Or perhaps I'm just tired of this debacle and I need to take a nap... <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmalas_f8d6.html" title="User:Amalas"><font color="maroon"><b>~ Amalas</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmalas_8c3c.html" title="User talk:Amalas"><font color="navy">rawr</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amalas_7b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amalas"><sup>=^_^=</sup></a> 21:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh-oh. The PRC includes HK and Macau, but excludes Taiwan as far as status quo is concerned. As per endless debates here, the term "Mainland China" should not be seen as politically equal to HK and Macau. The current permcats more or less follow this hierachy (except for the Taiwan/ROC cats, which is in a bigger mess):</dd>

<p>I would like to draw your attention to <a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPrivacy_fa71.html#Controversial_edits" title="User talk:Privacy">User_talk:Privacy#Controversial_edits</a>, and to his recent edit histories. As per the ArbCom's rulings, I want to avoid having to revert such controversial edits myself, hence my plea to admins to access the situation too. Thanks!--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 22:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
