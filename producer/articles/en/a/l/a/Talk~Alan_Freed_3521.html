	    <p>Who did coin the phrase "Rock and Roll"? <a href="../../../p/m/e/User%7EPMelvilleAustin_39b5.html" title="User:PMelvilleAustin">PMelvilleAustin</a> 11:37 Feb 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've heard that there is a connection between Freed's "Moondog Coronation Ball" and the musician <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondog.html" title="Moondog">Moondog</a>. Does anyone know more about this? <a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGravin_07be.html" title="User:McGravin">McGravin</a> 00:00 Mar 3, 2004</p>
<p>Yes this correct. Freed used the name Moondog after he used a piece of music called Moondog Symphony by the street musician <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondog.html" title="Moondog">Moondog</a> as his repeated opening music for his radio show. Moondog subsequently sued Freed on grounds that he was stealing his name. Since Freed was no longer allowed to use the term Moondog he needed a new catch phrase. After a night of heavy drinking he and his friends came up with the name "The Rock and Roll Party" since he was already using the phrase "Rock and Roll Session" to describe the music he was playing on his radio show.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that it was in fact Freed to coin the phrase "Rock and Roll" to describe a form of music. It is true that the phrase appeared in many songs before Freed but this did not describe a type of music. Freed is also credited with popularizing the phrase through his show "The Rock and Roll Party". --Manik52 08:15, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This needs lots of work as it is very pro-Freed POV and not at all objective (even though I very much agree with a majority of the points made). I'm not going to "tag" it yet, but it certainly needs lots more work to come up to Wikipedia standards â€” as currently written it is just a defense of Freed and not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 00:20, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tend to agree.</dd>
<dd>I've been with R&amp;R at least since Alan came up to the desert, and before; and I don't think the whole story is told here.</dd>
<dd>What about the bit with Morris Levy, the Music Mafia dude? That's where he really got ripped off.</dd>
<dd>They told me that they only made $10.00 out of all that; even the Jews themselves spoke out against Morris Levy, he was a real schmuck.</dd>
<dd>And I don't think Clark faired that well either, as I remember. He really got stuck when they literally forbade him to own his own stuff; he got around it, though, with some kind of by-proxy ownership thing or something.</dd>
<dd>And then there was Peter Tripp. They really socked it to him, but like Freed and Clark, he moved out to California where "miraculously" Rock &amp; Roll was reborn.</dd>
<dd>As for as the name "Moondog"; he was sued back in 1953 for stealing that name from some blind dude: Louis "Moondog" Hardin who was a street poet who had been going by that name for at least 10 years. Alan apologized and changed the name to "rock &amp; roll", but Louis has never been properly credited for his accomplishments, including being the true father of "Moondog Music" as Alan had at first called it.</dd>

<p>Was Alan Freed an anarchist? In what sense? Positive or pejorative? I've never heard anything about Alan that suggested to me that he was an anarchist. HUAC types might feel that way about it. But if Alan had any politics (other than play what the kids want to hear and make a buck at it), that's certainly been kept on the down-low. Motives were a lot simpler back in those days. Well, ok -- simpler. -- Anonymous user</p>
<p>I deleted him from category "anarchists"... better to keep that for self-described ones 02:55, 8 February 2006 (Moscow time)</p>
