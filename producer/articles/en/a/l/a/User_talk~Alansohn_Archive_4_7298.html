<p>Thanks Alan, someone vandalized Dover Township history and just wrote "Dover Township no longer exists". It is appalling when random people vandalize and getting their facts wrong.</p>
<p>I found a page online that said how the official renaming works after it has been approved. But, I can't find the page anymore and I will continue to search for it again. Supposedly the official results are to be read at the next council meeting and then it becomes official, thus the November 14. Here's one source but not the same source I am talking about: <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006611070390" class="external free" title="http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006611070390" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006611070390</a></p>

<p>This is admittedly a minor issue, but "Guilbert &amp; Betelle" (with the ampersand) is the correct spelling of the firm name, as opposed to "Guilbert and Betelle" as you have been editing; this is corroborated with contemporary ads, magazine articles and their own letterhead. I'd like your thoughts before I go around correcting it.</p>

<p>Hi Alan. I've decided to reorder the list of notables on the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpine%2C_New_Jersey_26d6.html" title="Alpine, New Jersey">Alpine</a> page. For individuals listed with a fist and last name, they are ordered alphabetically by last name, and with individuals listed with a pseudonym, they are ordered alphabetically by the first letter of their pseudonyms. (I don't think it made sense for "Jay-Z" to be last, as that is not his first/last name). <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairJQ_b2cd.html" title="User:AlistairJQ">AlistairJQ</a> 23:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alansohn - while I understand the virtue of brevity - and indeed how wikipedia expedites this, I don't agree with the removal of fellow schools on the page <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Augustine_College_Preparatory_School_ab2e.html" title="St. Augustine College Preparatory School">St. Augustine College Preparatory School</a>. Your hyperlink to the North American foundation is good, and so is the hyperlink to Augustine (though tempted, I haven't reverted these, even though my preference is for fuller information). The building up of the Augustinian schools will probably be assisted by the tempter of seeing how others have done it. I have watched over the months how this has happened and people have modelled their Augustinian school pages on each other. The order is international. The schools belong to an international movement - and I am keen to see them build their sites. Please leave the interschool links. By the way - are you a former student? I went to the Sydney school of the Augustinians. <a href="../../../n/j/a/User%7ENjamesdebien_e6c2.html" title="User:Njamesdebien">Cor Unum</a> 11:09, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan, I just noticed you added a References and Sources sections to one of the articles on my watchlist...my question is, what's the difference between those two article sections?

<p>Hi Alansohn, since you participate in editing a lot of articles about schools, I thought you might be interested in this discussion. Personally, I don't think an article on every school in the world is needed, but I strongly feel that AfD is not the place to make a change in policy.

<p>Alan, thank you very much for improving my contributions to these two articles by wikifying them, adding links, etc. I appreciate your careful editing and affording me the opportunity to learn how to do a more professional job.</p>
<p>I had one suggestion for you regarding an edit you made yesterday to the Sweeney article, however. It was not an edit to an addition of mine but someone else's, regarding an apparent Gloucester County policy of paying county workers during a shutdown. The original added text was hard to follow and needed editing, but the final result does not appear to be what you intended. It would be great if you could take another look at it when you get a chance. Thanks. (Comment added July 31, 2006). Rblaster 02:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alansohn. I read the discussion, and I was thinking about how to handle it. On its surface, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guideline seems to support delete. However, there is also a proposed guideline, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, which seems to go beyond the current WP:BIO guideline. It states, <i>"As a compromise between those who would keep all candidate articles and those who would delete all articles on yet-unelected candidates, this guideline states that articles on elections should be written before articles on individual candidates. Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written."</i> Well, if an article can be written about a <i>candidate</i> that satisfies these criteria, then surely by extension, an article can be written about the <i>election winner</i>, i.e., officeholder/incumbent. Although the proposed guideline seems to contemplate state-level elections, given the examples that are provided, the policy is still open to discussion and could be extended to county-level elections. Generally, I have an aversion to deleting articles in the absence of a clear policy or guideline, so I'm leaning towards <b>keep</b> pending resolution of the proposed guideline. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 19:14, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Alan, I've started a discussion section on the Deletion Policy page regarding reality television contestants</b>. My main point is this: the ABC.com homepage does a perfectly fine job of sorting out who is a contestant on Survivor, and their background.

<li>The reason i chose to do it on the county level rather than the municipalities is that as you may know, new jersey's municipal boundaries have a history all their own...for instance, if someone were say born in 1753 in Newton, NJ (That is Newton Township) when Sussex County was formed, they could be born in practically two-thirds the current county...which would be modern day, Andover borough, Andover Township, Branchville Twp, Byram Twp, Frankford Twp, Franklin Twp, Fredon Twp, Green Twp, Hampton Twp, Hardyston Twp, Hopatcong Borough, Lafayette Twp, Montague Twp, Newton town, Ogdensburg borough, Sparta Twp, Sussex Borough, and Wantage Township. And the municipal lines are redrawn every few years (the last that i know was in 1996). Setting it up by municipality could be deceiving. I don't know about putting such lists on county sites, but practically every university has a list of notable (and some not-so-notable) alumni. I used that as an example. I think as far as municipalities go, there should be lists of notable people for major cities and towns, but for each and every one of New Jersey's 566 municipalities...it could, given the historical oscillations of boundaries, be confusing and demand too much research. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 03:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correction, Montague Township wasn't part of Newton Township (1751-1864), it was split off from Walpack Township (which had the other 1/3 of the present-day area of Sussex County in 1753) in 1759. Sandyston was split off in 1762, and Pahaquarry in Warren County in 1824. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 03:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry, but that was my immediate reaction when I saw the infobox that you had added to Route 35. The major junctions section is for <b>major</b> junctions, that's why it's called that. Just, you know, for future reference. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 18:58, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, there's no quotable policy on any project that I've seen except for New York -- which includes junctions only with U.S. and Interstate routes, as well as limited access state routes. Frankly, I'm not sure that's going to work for us, as that would leave a great many routes with approximately 0 junctions.</dd>
<dd>The <i>guideline</i> that I and SPUI have been working on is to cap the junction list at 10 (I actually kept I think 12 on Route 35) and just use common sense to determine which 10 are the <i>most</i> major. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 19:44, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not looking forward to trying to develop an actual policy on the major junctions, mainly because I don't think we can neatly divide them into three neat categories as you suggested. It doesn't seem fair to put a sixty-mile highway like <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_47_%28New_Jersey%29_7613.html" title="Route 47 (New Jersey)">Route 47</a> into the same category as something like <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_12_%28New_Jersey%29_a1e6.html" title="Route 12 (New Jersey)">Route 12</a> that doesn't intersect any other state routes except at its termini. IMHO, the only way to determine whether a junction is major is according to the scope of that specific highway. For instance, CR 537 is listed as a major junction on I-195 as it should be (b/c of Six Flags) but is not on Route 33 (b/c it's superfluous to the other junctions in Freehold).</dd>
<dd>As for routes like 11, 14, and 18N on the master list, they are listed because that was the compromise we came to on <a href="../../../n/j/s/WT%7ENJSCR_4e0c.html" title="WT:NJSCR">WT:NJSCR</a>, and you would have a hard time convincing SPUI to remove them. Basically, every <i>article</i> is covered in the master list, but <i>redirects</i> are not. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, the only time (I believe) I revert regarding inclusion of minor junctions is when <a href="../../../n/e/x/User%7ENextbarker_40c2.html" title="User:Nextbarker">Nextbarker</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/x/User_talk%7ENextbarker_1769.html" title="User talk:Nextbarker">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nextbarker_c894.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nextbarker">contribs</a>) or 24.228.70.72 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.228.70.72.html" title="User talk:24.228.70.72">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.228.70.72_3f1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.228.70.72">contribs</a>) is involved, as they have a history of making random edits to highway pages -- changing shield image dimensions from 100px to 99px or 111px, adding junctions like NJ 29 to the main US 1 list -- and on the rare occasions they do actually add a major junction to the list, it's not formatted properly.</p>
<p>Am I mean? Perhaps, but it's all I can think of to do, and I'm not the only one guilty of reverting them. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good, glad you didn't necessarily think I was mean. I just really don't think a policy would work in this situation, however. It's not something that we could define in such a cut and dry manner.</dd>

<p>To expand on my previous comment, the current master list is already the result of people on <a href="../../../n/j/s/WP%7ENJSCR_394f.html" title="WP:NJSCR">WP:NJSCR</a> working together.

<p>You were right, I was wrong. I'd like to delegate to you the task of leading a discussion trying to determine some guidelines as to what is a major junction because we NEED those guidelines.

<p>Well, considering that he was a member of two anti-Arab designated terrorist organizations (<a href="../../../k/a/c/Kach.html" title="Kach">Kach</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Defence_League_2467.html" title="Jewish Defence League">Jewish Defence League</a>) and that he massacred 29 Arab civilians, putting him in category:Terrorists is just common sense. Also it's widely considered an act of terror, even amongst Israelis: <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=19058" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=19058" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Outside of the far-right fringe that he was a part of, Baruch Goldstein was roundly condemned by Israelis as a terrorist who had killed innocent people, and who had acted in blatant contravention to the principles and ethics of the Jewish state and the Jewish people. Three days later, the Knesset voted overwhelmingly to condemn the Hevron massacre. Then, two weeks later, the Kach and Kahane Chai movements were outlawed. In a 2001 Truman Institute Israeli/Palestinian Arab Joint Opinion Poll, a full three-quarters of Israeli Jews surveyed defined Goldstein's mass murder attack as an act of terror.1.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> 02:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's pretty obvious what Goldstein's plan was, considering that the attack was part of <a href="../../../k/a/c/Kach.html" title="Kach">Kach</a>'s campaign to terrorize the Arab population and halt the peace process. This quote from <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre_859b.html" title="Cave of the Patriarchs massacre">Cave of the Patriarchs massacre</a> makes it clear the attack was part of a plan: 'However, immediately after the attack, Mike Guzofsky, spokesman for <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahane_Chai_4648.html" title="Kahane Chai">Kahane Chai</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a> and a close friend of Goldstein said, "He wanted to stop the <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo_Accords_6e48.html" title="Oslo Accords">peace process</a> dead. He couldn't have picked a better day – <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purim.html" title="Purim">Purim</a>, when Jews fight back."'</p>
<p>I find it extraordinary that I'm having to argue that Goldstein was a terrorist; he slaughtered 29 civilians in cold blood! Would you argue that a Palestinian suicide bomber can't be designated as a terrorist unless we are 100% sure they had a plan to do so? <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> 01:12, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was no intention of referring to you as a "stooge." I can't find any reference to that, and it should not be implied. That said...</p>
<p>I'm tired of the whole process, of the bickering. I voted for Principle I, not Principle III, for reasons cited within the initial discussion. My mind was made up long ago, and I am not going to back down - and neither are those that voted for that principle - because we have moved onto Part II.</p>
<p>If you were so inclined long ago to do so, you would have added in your contributions to Part I discussion, so that perhaps more could have been swayed towards that for Part II. You did not, however, and as a result, it was not included in for discussion on Part II.</p>
<p>What <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> did was question the fact that the admins and the majority voted for Principle I in Part I. He tried to disrupt the process, and has clogged up the discussion for more relevant comments. Now he has unleashed more of the same, this time by dragging in others that he has requested from the NJ roads project (no offense to you). But this is too late, in that the time has passed for discussion on the various Principles.</p>

<dd>I apologized if I offended you in any way, that was far from my intention. I only meant to say that I was going to respond to your e-mail on WT:SRNC rather than through e-mail, and that I preferred to keep debate in a central location.</dd>
<dd>You also misread my wikibreak notice. I have no planned departure from Wikipedia, but have been on Wikipedia much less since the end of August, and will not be back at my regular rate until I am back in Bellingham on September 24.</dd>
<dd><i>Now to answer your questions. I do believe that the process that created this "consensus" (you are of course correct to put it in quotes) was fair, etc. Messages were left on the talk page of</i> every <i>user that has listed him/herself as a participant on a state highway WikiProject. The onus is then on that user to respond to that message and participate. I did not participate up until now because of my limited internet access, and also because I do not have a vested interest in what the final outcome is, although I would prefer Principle I.</i></dd>
<dd><i>WP:NJSCR has a</i> naming convention <i>that I published and that is applied to articles on every state route in the New Jersey highway system. However, this naming convention does</i> not <i>reflect a</i> stable consensus <i>for reasons I have given several times on <a href="../../../s/r/n/WT%7ESRNC_0e22.html" title="WT:SRNC">WT:SRNC</a>. Does NJSCR benefit by accepting the consensus? Probably not, but it is not harmed by accepting it either. The Wikipedia community as a whole, however, does benefit (IMHO) by having this poll accepted by all states. Michigan and Kansas are the only exceptions to Principle I because their "common term" cannot be disambiguated by putting the state name first. Accepting this principle would create more work for the project, but it is work I am more than willing to take on for the benefit of the Wikipedia community. It would create conflict with the county routes, but oh well... not accepting the proposal would create conflict with every other state in the nation.</i></dd>
<dd>I'm just eager to put this whole mess behind us. I started editing Wikipedia on the Washington state route articles just before things got really messy. Letting this poll reach its conclusion smoothly will allow that to happen. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 17:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one can outbully SPUI. It's simply not possible. It's mean of me to say, but it's also (IMHO) the sad truth.</dd>
<dd>The reason you and SPUI saw ugliness from Rschen (and in SPUI's case, the judging admins) is because you are attempting to debate things that were decided a month ago. According to <a href="../../../s/r/n/WP%7ESRNC_8601.html" title="WP:SRNC">WP:SRNC</a>, from August 8th to August 11th the process was debated, and from then until the 18th, principles were debated. That was the time to bring up these issues. A majority of approximately 100 editors chose to adopt Principle I, and while it is far from a consensus, it is by far the most people we have had participate in a discussion like this, and since the main editors are too stubborn to see things any other way, it is the closest to any sort of consensus we will ever get.</dd>
<dd>I did not respond to you through private e-mail because <i>that</i> goes against the Wikipedia ideals of working together as a community that you seem to hold so dear. Any issues we have are the exact same ones that the other editors working on this poll have, and in order to get to something more closely resembling a consensus, they need to be discussed as a group. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 18:21, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have explained <i>ad nauseum</i> why I chose not to open a debate on the naming convention immediately after starting the NJ WikiProject. A couple weeks after opening the project I attempted to open a similar discussion in Washington, and my fears were realized as not a single editor contributed to the discussion. I did have it in the back of my mind to start a discussion in New Jersey, but by the time I was going to, Rschen had started the nationwide poll, and I knew it was unnecessary.</dd>
<dd>It is also a blatant lie that I have never answered the questions you posed.

<p>First of all, I posted on Rschen's talk because the vast majority of the bitching going on in this poll should have been brought up as concerns a month ago. Second, in retrospect, I wish I'd voted for P2 because now that I've thought it over, it makes the most sense; but I'm not bitching about it now. Third, this whole thing still hasn't created a standard that will be obvious to those not in the know. Every state (pretty much) has a different convention; P1 has submitted greatly to the proponents of P2, which I now believe is to the detriment of normal readers because the article may not necessarily match up with the title. Fourth, the problem with saying "I've lived here for a gajillion years and therefore am the end-all know all about roads in such state" is we have to rely on referenceable material, which probably will be on the Internet. Sure you can hit up the library, but can you get evidence on here in time? While a Google Test™ might be crude, it's one of the best ways for us to gather info for something like this. And finally, my personal opinion is that through all of this we'll still be exactly where we started two months ago as far as article titles and terms used. The only progress we've made is a potential convention that's non-binding to prevent possible move wars. It's hardly worth the time invested. -- <b>Stratosphere</b> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratosphere_f367.html" title="User:Stratosphere">U</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStratosphere_52d9.html" title="User talk:Stratosphere">T</a>)</sup> 14:04, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll keep working on it, but I noticed a discrepancy - the intro says there are 32 schools, but I think there are only 24 listed.

<p>Thank you for your many contributions of NJ articles. Just so you'll know, I just removed from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Department_of_Education_509a.html" title="New Jersey Department of Education">New_Jersey_Department_of_Education</a> article the mention of the NJ secretary of education's name, which I could not verify. It also used the word "currently" which doesn't have a permanent meaning in an encyclopedia. I think it's generally more helpful, rather than naming officers which will be out of date sometime in the future, to link to an official site where people can find out that kind of thing. If an officer must be named, perhaps you could add "as of 2006" to give readers an idea about when the information was indeed current. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarborsparrow_113b.html" title="User:Harborsparrow">Harborsparrow</a> 21:41, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alright, thanks. Like I said, I was just curious. My personal habit when I'm editing is usually to always link them when creating new articles, and maintain consistency when editing existing articles (either always link them or never link them within each article). Now that you've pointed me in that direction, I'll probably refrain from adding new links, but couldn't be bothered enough to unlink ones that are already linked. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 23:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know why you have such a problem with so many of these articles, that you need to devote so much of your time to seeing them deleted. My preference is to work as hard as I can to improve articles, especially when faced with individuals such as yourself who seem to be determined to delete them, regardless of the validity of the arguments presented in their favor. I can assure you that I will fight tooth and nail to preserve worthy articles in the face of your attacks. It seems that you have a presistent failure to realize that starting an AfD with a claim that "The last afd was "no consensus" due to inclusionists claiming two church publications make it notable." is not only false, but shamelessly inflammatory. You have a tremendous amount of nerve to open your AfD with an insult and then blame others for behavior issues for responding to your nonsensical arguments. I sincerely hope that you will make an attempt to improve articles in the future, rather than persist in your efforts to destroy them and use logic and appeals to Wikipedia policy, rather than personal attacks, when articles must be proposed for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:58, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you don't think your a school inclusionist nor those same people have a history of only voting keep on "school" articles? Then why add it to the school watch list? Do you deny having a history of canvassing for keep votes? If you took some time you'd see that I start articles on notable unaccredited schools, and clean up massive amounts of those articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also perhaps if you knew anything about education you'd spend time working on real institutions instead of digging up some local new mentions to ensure an unaccredited place without a campus has a wiki article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 03:02, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not a school inclusionist. If an article is worth keeping, I vote keep, and if it would benefit from improvement I make the additions. Are you telling me that your constant edits -- with numerous negative and disparaging comments -- at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning">List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning</a> is not part of a deletionist pattern and a shameless attempt at vote stacking to get these articles deleted? The Talk page goes into even more details, most of it coming from you, about articles that are targets of your attacks. Do you refuse to acknowledge that your second crack at deleting <a href="../../../b/2E/_/B._H._Carroll_Theological_Institute_4450.html" title="B. H. Carroll Theological Institute">B. H. Carroll Theological Institute</a> was not in bad faith and that your opening insult in blaming "inclusionists" for your previous failure to get the article deleted were not an insult? You failed yet again, but I can count on you to keep on taking more cracks at this and other articles for schools that you have arbitrarily decided are not worthy of inclusion, using your same pattern of personal attacks, misstatements, false interpretations, imaginary Wikipedia rules and vote stacking to get your way, regardless of the facts.

<dd>Agreed. I had not located these source earlier and (as indicated in AfD 2) would have listed them in the article if I had. As stated above, I have seen no guideline that would require national coverage, and I still feel strongly that the sources provided from Baptist news services and publications fully meet the qualifications required. I am still surprised that there has been any coverage of this school in any major newspaper, and the fact that it has been covered by these five publications, both in the area (Dallas and Fort Worth) and far away (Kansas City, 500 miles; and Atlanta, 800 miles away) is proof of notability. While all of the references are not trivial, the fact that it has been covered at all is demonstration of fulfillment of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Every single source you mentioned comes from the same month of the same year about the same four people hoping to open a new institution. They are identical articles. Not independent claims on different subjects. Is this all you have?</p>

<li>Is there a standard that requires that multiple articles can't be about the same event published in the same time frame. Or that continuous ongoing coverage must be provided?

<dd>Again, you've chosen to impose your own personal interpretation on what <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> actually says, in which an explicit definition of "trivial" is provided: "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations except for the following: <b>1) Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. 2) Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories.</b>" While you deem these multiple verifiable published works from independent and reliable sources as "trivial", the standard that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> sets is clearly met. These are not reprints of press releases, it's not selef-referential and it's not advertising, and they include details regarding the school's philosophy, curriculum and methodology that go far beyond address and phone info or hours. No standard specifies that articles have to be spaced out over a period of time or must be ongoing to meet this criteria, at least that I have ever found. If you do have a source, please refer me to that policy.

<p>nice work on this page mr. sohn - my correction of Van Aken was an assumption as many of the Van Aken's that were around here, descendants of the Mr. Van Aken who planned out this 'city', were of dutch heritage and the cemetery stones(from the Harlingen Church)list them as Van Aken, a common dutch spelling. I live in Belle Mead, across from the RR station, 3rd generation here, and am intrigued to look into this further to find out some more history on this subject, obviously a very local one for me. I will report back with what i find from the Harlingen Historical Society and other long time residents familiar with this subject. The Hillsborough website that you've cited, while useful, has a number of small factual errors.</p>
<p>Your work on all the towns in our state on Wikipedia is to be be commended.</p>

<p>Mr. "Alansohn",</p>
<p>I am writing to you in regards to your constant editing of the Village of Cedarhurst page. I am the person that changed the Five Towns to exclude Hewlett, however, I did not realize that it was part of it. Considering that I lived in Cedarhurst for 20 years, I should know what other towns are part of the Five Towns so I thank you for the correction.</p>
<p>However, I am very irritated by the fact that you keep changing the article to state it is an "Orthodox Jew" community. From looking at your contributions, I am wondering if you are being biased or that you clearly do not realize it is not a "Orthodox Jew" community. I added that many Irish- and Italian-Americans also contribute to the Cedarhurst community, yet, you deliberately deleted that. I consider that an insult to all the non-Jews that live in Cedarhurst.</p>
<p>The Jewish community (and I say "Jewish" in that not all of the population is Orthodox) is a very important part of Cedarhurst and I think you have established that in the Wiki. However, you are clearly not giving credit to the other ethnic or religious groups that live there.</p>
<p>I ask that you consider changing the Wiki to make people aware of that or kindly stop deleting my remarks and facts about my town. Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for the editing of the Cedarhurst page. In regards to your response, there does not seem to have ever been any mention of other ethnic and religious groups in the Village of Cedarhurst. Though there is a growing population of Orthodox Jews, I feel that other people should be represented as well. By the statistics you added, you can clearly see that over 40% of the population of Cedarhurst are not Orthodox. Calling it an Orthodox Jewish community, to me, is misleading in that it gives off the idea that it is a strictly Jewish community. Personally, I think those types of labels should be deleted from all pages unless the population is 100% of a certain faith. Thanks for understanding!</p>

<p>Thank you for the correction on the St. Joachim's school. However, I deleted the Orthodox Jewish community link again. For the second time that I have mentioned this, I DO NOT find it appropriate to label Cedarhurst as an Orthodox Jewish community. Yet, you find the need to continue to include this. The mayor, himself, is an Italian-American and members of the school board are typically not Orthodox. If you are going to include facts in a Wiki (which you should), then include them. Is it NOT a fact that Cedarhurst is an Orthodox community. I have forwarded the Wiki to many members of the Cedarhurst community and they are outraged at this. I'm not sure why you find the need to continue to update the Cedarhurst page, but kindly please leave it as it is. You have upset many Five Towners.</p>

Thank you JoshuaZ. Though you can easily see the contribution the Orthodox Jews play in Cedarhurst, it is NOT an Orthodox-Jewish community. That can be mistaken by some to be of only consisting of Orthodox Jews.

<dd>I think part of the concern here may be for our anon that when people think of Orthodox Jewish communities they think of places like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Square%2C_New_York_f15e.html" title="New Square, New York">New Square, New York</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiryas_Joel%2C_New_York_cf19.html" title="Kiryas Joel, New York">Kiryat Yoel</a>. In any event, I think we need some sort of citation before put the category there. (As to the question of my connection, I have some amount of familiarity with the five towns but have never been in Cedarhurst itself. I would agree from my understanding that the classification of it as an Orthodoxo community is probablty not inaccurate but this is essentially <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.) <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:08, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ok so this is how its going to be? You and your friend IZAK are just going to inundate the Cedarhurst page with as many Jewish items as you can b/c I had a problem with the category?? Ok I guess two can play at this game. You two are seriously being immature people. I don't see why you have to find the need to continue to do this. People have been already commenting that this needs to stop. I think we get the point. Leave it alone.

<p>Honestly, I really don't care anymore. If you want to turn Wikipedia into a forum to promote Judaism, then go right ahead. I have noticed your name on many Jewish websites so it seems like this is something you take personally. Listen, you really shouldn't. You are not "The voice of Judaism," don't even pretend that you are. As to the Cedarhurst page, do whatever you like to it; it really doesn't matter to me anymore. I have noticed the class of people in here and its people such as yourself, that has made this experience horrible. I am no longer editing anything on Wikipedia again b/c all it takes is a cowboy such as yourself to ruin it. You and IZAK are very "typical" and its a shame because many of the Jews I know are very nice people. I guess it only takes a few bad apples..huh? <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelical_Rift_177d.html" title="User:Helical Rift">Helical Rift</a></p>

Dude...enough with the warnings! I am no longer editing on Wikipedia anymore and have started going through the procedures to delete my talk page so quit bugging me. It is immature people like yourself who really have nothing else better to do than hassle people on here that made me decide to get off of Wikipedia.

<p>Honestly, I was very upset at you for the way you treated the Cedarhurst page and the deletions you made and I felt that your actions were very ethnocentric. Any edits I may have made to your pages were most likely done before you apologized and I forgot that I did it so sorry for that. In terms of my comments, I have never once in my life been called an anti-Semite. I have the utmost respect for people of the Jewish faith. If I didn't then I wouldn't be at Yeshiva University. The comments I made were meant to be directed at you; not against Jews as a whole. I have dealt with many Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews in my life and yes, I have found a large percentage of Orthodox Jews to be very stubborn and biased compared to non-Orthodox Jews; hence, my comment to you. I will apologize if you found it anti-Semetic, it was not my intent. Honestly, this whole thing was a complete mess. All I wanted was to edit the Cedarhurst page so I have no idea how it got to this. I did explain my feelings to you regarding your edits so I think you also need to realize that you may be a little bit too overbearing with your own edits. Let other people have some fun on here instead of monopolizing many of the pages. About Arbusto, just ignore the guy. Yet, I see that you find the need to retaliate for anything he says. That was kind of how you were with me as well. Instead of making your edits or presume that it is vandalism, email the editor and ask him his reasons (unless its a blatant act of vandalism). This whole thing would have been avoided if you just did that with me. Anyway, like I said, I'm done with the whole editing process on here. It's not worth the aggravation. Again, I apologize if you found my comments anti-Semetic. It was never my intent. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelical_Rift_177d.html" title="User:Helical Rift">Helical Rift</a></p>

They are rarely withdrawn, rather the result is usually that a consensus is quickly formed that it should be kept, which is what looks like will happen here (remember Wikipedia rarely uses votes to decide things, and the original Delete comments in the AfD will now appear irrelevant in what is a <i>debate</i> on the AfD) Originally this article was prodded and that prod removed without much thought for why it was added which while not against Wikipedia policy isn't a very sensible thing to do, it appears as if the AfD nomination encouraged a speedy clean up and fix of the article which at the end of the day is a good thing. Thanks for your help cleaning it up, it was a good save.</p>

<p>Hi, what I did was remove a few revisions from the page history because they contained personal information and libel, and those things should not be online for all the world to see. Most vandalism is "harmless", we simply revert and let the vandal revisions stay in the history, but when someone named is falsely accused of dealing with cocaine, or personal phone numbers with name and address are given, those revisions need to be taken off line. There are basically two ways of doing this for administrators without oversight access (oversight access is rare, most who have them are current or former arbitrators).</p>
<ul>
<li>The simple way is to simply delete the article, and then restore all the non-offending versions. The problem with this approach is that the <i>next</i> time someone adds personal stuff into an article which needs to be deleted, chances are the next admin who deletes revisions will overlook that there are previously deleted revisions with libel, and may wind up restoring those by accident.</li>
<li>What you saw me doing was the complicated approach. It consisted of first deleting the article, then restoring the "offensive" versions so that I can move them out of the way (in this case to a subpage labelled "/dump"), and then delete them again. Then I can go back and restore the article without the offensive revisions remaining in the page history (the final step is reverting away the a vestigial redirect from the move, that is the edit with "restore content"). It is a laborious process, and it is rare that I do it. In this case I considered the issue serious enough that I blocked the IP which added the libel for a week and e-mailed the school to report it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mr. Sohn, I started the Berhalter thing by digging up the Boston Globe quotation. I wonder who's been writing from these anonymous IP addresses. How hilarious would it be if they come from "New York University" or "U.S. Soccer HQ" or "Energie Cottbus.de" or someplace like that? Anyway, thanks for your support.

<p>Alan, I am sorry but you are completely wrong, Llewellyn Park is not in an unincorporated area, it is within the borders of the Township of West Orange. West Orange <b>DOES NOT</b> have any unincorporated areas. For your general information I have friend and business associates who have live in Llewellyn Park probably more years then you've been alive, couple that to the fact that I've lived in West Orange my entire life (Almost 40 years) I have been involved in the Township of West Orange on a business and political basis for close to 25 years so I think I have a better prospective on the situation here then you do. Please don't change the article again. Misterrick 23:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand what you are saying but my main concern here is that people will misinterpret your statement that Llewellyn Park is an unincorporated area as it not being part of the Township of West Orange and in a census-designated zone which it is not, In my humble opinion it is just better to keep it listed as part of the Township of West Orange that way there will be less confusion.

<p>Just FYI since you are the Chief Wikipedian of New Jersey, I have just created articles (very small stubs actually) on two Chief Justices of the New Jersey Supreme Court, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_T._Vanderbilt_4f46.html" title="Arthur T. Vanderbilt">Arthur T. Vanderbilt</a> (1948-57) and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Weintraub_41c1.html" title="Joseph Weintraub">Joseph Weintraub</a> (1957-73). I had recently created one on Weintraub's successor who lasted only a few weeks, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_P._Garven_e171.html" title="Pierre P. Garven">Pierre P. Garven</a> (1973). This clears up some red links in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Supreme_Court_831a.html" title="New Jersey Supreme Court">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> article as well as extending the succession box back in time a bit. It also completes the series on Chief Justices that New Jersey has had since the Supreme Court became the highest court in 1948 (Constitution of 1947). Although the title Chief Justice existed before that, I think it is a natural break-point, before which substantial research would be involved. In the succession box on Vanderbilt's page I did not put a predecessor but rather indicated he was the first CJ under the 1947 Constitution. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutron_462a.html" title="User:Neutron">Neutron</a> 21:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your continuous insertion of information, without established talk page consensus, is the <b>ONLY</b> vandalism taking place on the Gregg Berhalter page.

<p>Continue to insert it and it will be treated as vandalism. See the wikipedia page for consensus about adding information. You and your Sock puppet have no consensus for adding the material, thus it will not remain. If you choose to report it as vandalim that's fine, an administrator will see your obvious ploy and disregard it.

<p>I can understand if malls are considered too "trivial" for Wikipedia, but malls are topics of cultural, social, and economic significance. But I can also understand if some malls are more worthy than others for inclusion based on the secondary sources available to back up the articles. But this is a touchier subject than I anticipated.</p>
<p>There seems to me to be a lack of clarity regarding whether or not any articles on individual malls even qualify for Wikipedia at all; several different official policies seem to apply to these articles and there isn't a single, solid, consistent applicable standard other than use "reliable secondary sources" and "Wikipedia is not a directory," and even that's not a guarantee that someone who doesn't like the article will want to keep it even if every effort was made to write the article acording to the standards. An article written in completely good faith may not pass muster based on what two or three people think, and how they interpret a loosely connected set of rules which by definition are not even themsleves totally set in stone.</p>
<p>I'm all for these articles going on a Wikia site or somewhere else on the WWW if they are not worthy of Wikipedia, but I question whether a case-by-case analysis is the correct approach. There needs to be a defining rule, maybe an amendment to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or something that addresses this. If malls can be targeted, what's to stop the targeting of any notable article on any business enterprise such as sports franchises and major corporations - many of which have articles in conventional print-based encyclopedias and many that have also had scholarly books and articles written about them.</p>
<p>I've only been editing on here a little over a year or so and I'm still learning the ropes. But a thousand thanks for your stand on this, it is encouraging.--<a href="../../../m/s/r/User%7EMsr69er_1000.html" title="User:Msr69er">Msr69er</a> 18:30, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan. I forgot to respond earlier. Apologies for that.

<p>To be honest, I understand why you reinserted the paragraph regarding borough park's public schools. However, I must tell you that the information for that paragraph (which I placed in originally) are terribly out of date. The entire "drain" is a true phenomenon; however, the data regarding PS164's "only 89% capacity" is overblown at best and it has not been followed up since then. Only 89% capacity is far from a large drain.

<dd>Aren't we supposed to keep current events off of the pages (except for sports teams and things like that)? Besides, it's all vandalism, so you shouldn't pick and choose what parts of it to keep, right? As of right now I've removed everything about it, but if you feel too strongly about it, put it back. Myself and another are watching the page so that we can remove vandalism as a result of all this, but if you put it back in I won't stop you.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigShock_c166.html" title="User:BigShock">BigShock</a> 00:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a newsworthy event about the school. I'd suggest keeping it in and editing it to fit the facts provided in the article. Excluding it will almost certainly create more problems than keeping in a paragraph that's properly worded.

<p>Alan, I saw your changes to the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County_ad7b.html" title="Bergen County">Bergen County</a> article to change the columnation to be CSS-based. This is pretty cool, and works well on Firefox, but I was not able to get it to work on any of the other browsers I tried (Opera 8.5, IE 6, Mozilla 1.7). Unless you have a way of getting this to work for more browsers, I'd suggest going back to something more widely supported. Another option is to use a div with a float. Example:</p>
<div style="float:left; width:50%;">
<ul>
<li>column 1</li>
<li>column 1</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:right; width:50%;">
<ul>
<li>column 2</li>
<li>column 2</li>
</ul>
</div>

<dd>I had grabbed it elsewhere and it works great for me, as I use Firefox. I agree that a solution has to work across platforms and will be more cautious in using this technique.

<p>You'll notice that I haven't re-reverted your edit yet, but at the same time, I'm not sure that this is within the scope of the article. The article deals with broad categories of information about the school, not about individual incidents, regardless of how interesting or scandalous they may be. The Stadtmauer story is good for shock value, but doesn't really add anything to an encyclopedia article about the Yeshivah of Flatbush, which was a thriving institution decades before Alan Stadtmauer was born. I want to remove the section, but I'd like to hear your thoughts first. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 22:20, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. The LI Exchange site isn't a "Community interest" site, but rather a vehicle for advertorial and link exchange. The Astoria profile page provided little more than promotional content for a handful of neighborhood business -- I suspect (and I'm still trying to find out for sure) that these business have paid for that coverage. Also the page itself is pretty sparse in terms of information about Astoria; and I question it's overall value to the article. (As for sites like amazon.com, I don't think they should be linked to from wikipedia, either.) <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcarillo_8ef2.html" title="User:Alcarillo">Alcarillo</a> 17:33, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>you are not even catholic and you have the nerve to destroy our website. if we did this to one of your temple descriptions you would call the media and portray us as racists but you still do it to us. the nerve of you unacceptable-spartanoffensive07</p>
<p><br />
you are truly unacceptable. and you have the nerve to berate me on my kings english spelling using our instead of your yankee or for wourds such as favourite. you have hardly edited this page at all and your work has not been vandalised. we dont appreciate your comments and/or contributions!</p>
<p>stop vandalising our page you are not even christian and even thought there is no requirement it is unacceptable to vandalise an institution that you have no connections with.</p>
<p>all you are doing is trying to bash a catholic organization. its bad enough that you can edit it but worse that you keep editing it.</p>
<p>you made a boner trying to correct it saying that it isnt cited. a good 3/4s of this article is not cited. so why dont you delete everything else. thats what i thought</p>
<p>and then you have the audacity to criticise who i write and spell because i am of english heritage. you have the wrong spellings of words not me mate ok. stop editing this page!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>you may try to make this seem like you are trying to better wikipedia but this is another way to bash catholics and make us out to be the bad guy.</p>
<p>STOP VANDALISING OUR PAGE</p>
<p>PS since you have no grammar usage you idiotic yank: words with or are spelled as our as in favour or favourite and z is a s in words like criticise and organise.- spartanoffensive07 on the correct abv. date 29/12/06</p>
<p>This is the only warning you will receive. Your recent vandalism will not be tolerated. The next time you vandalize Immaculata High School's page, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You are correct when you say she is as notable as David Quinn. So why would you take his entry down and leave her's up? It's hypocritical.</p>

<p>Alan reverted this page to correct a citation. But he also reverted the page to say that many mansions were built during the US Civil War. According to my citation, mansions were built during WW I. This is consistent with Kenneth Jackson's <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>. The Civil War claim does not even pass a consistency test. Ocean Parkway was not even built until after the Civil War. I undid the changes.</p>
