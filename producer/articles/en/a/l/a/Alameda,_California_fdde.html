<p>The island which Alameda occupies was originally a peninsula connected to Oakland. Much of the peninsula was low-lying and marshy, but on the higher ground, the peninsula and adjacent part of what is now downtown Oakland were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world and the area was therefore called "<i>encinal</i>", Spanish for "oakland". "<i>Alameda</i>" is Spanish for "grove of poplar trees" or "tree-lined avenue."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> This name was chosen in 1853 via popular vote.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The inhabitants at the time of the arrival of Spanish explorers in the late 1700s were a local band of the Ohlone tribe. The peninsula became part of the vast <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rancho_San_Antonio_%28Peralta_Grant%29_cfe5.html" title="Rancho San Antonio (Peralta Grant)">Rancho San Antonio</a> granted to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California. The grant was later confirmed by the new Republic of Mexico upon its independence from Spain. Early European settlers at the onset of the Gold Rush in the 1850s included French lumberjacks supplying lumber to the quickly expanding San Francisco and Chipman and Auginbaugh, major landowners who founded the village of Alameda near the corner of Encinal Avenue and High Street in Alameda.</p>
<p>The city was founded on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_6.html" title="June 6">June 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>. Originally three small settlements grew in town. "Old Alameda" referred to the village at Encinal and High, Hibbardsville was at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and Woodstock was on the west near the ferry piers of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Pacific_Coast_Railroad_f146.html" title="South Pacific Coast Railroad">South Pacific Coast Railroad</a> and the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Pacific_4e78.html" title="Central Pacific">Central Pacific</a>. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the "Alameda <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_%28architecture%29.html" title="Mole (architecture)">Mole</a>" while the Central Pacific itself became the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Pacific_89d4.html" title="Southern Pacific">Southern Pacific</a>. The Alameda pier was the site of the first train across the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_Railroad_4348.html" title="Transcontinental Railroad">Transcontinental Railroad</a> into the San Francisco Bay Area. The terminus was moved to Oakland a few years later.</p>
<p>In 1917, an attraction called <a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune_Beach_e8a2.html" title="Neptune Beach">Neptune Beach</a> was built in the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Coney_Island_ee30.html" title="Coney Island">Coney Island</a>, the park was a major attraction in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners of the facilty, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create tastes unique to Neptune Beach. Though many do not know it, both the snow cone and the popsicle were invented at Neptune Beach. The Kewpie doll, handpainted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games at the beach - another Neptune Beach invention. The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own, even filling in a section of the bay to add an additional olympic-size swimming pool and an exceptional roller coaster which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay.</p>
<p>Neputune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by famous swimmers like Olympian Johnny Weismuller, who later starred as the original Tarzan, and Jack LaLane, who started a chain of health clubs. Unfortunately, the park closed down in 1939 because of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, the completion of the Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price and in general, the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and travelling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side, just by swimming around the fence.</p>
<p>While some of the resort homes from Neptune beach still exist and can be seen near Crab Cove, the vast majority of the structures - the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the ferris wheel, roller coaster, and other rides - were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today, an Alameda resident looks to preserve some of the historic artifacts from the Neptune Beach era in a museum specifically dedicated to the resort and all "amusement machines." While the existing and more general Alameda Museum has quite a few artifacts from Neptune Beach in its collection, this new museum would focus more on the games, rides and other machines that brought amusement to Alameda's bay shore.</p>
<p>As Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare of the city and the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. As a result they designated their mutual border as Park Street.</p>
<p>The need for expanded shipping facilities led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda in 1902, turning Alameda into an island. Most of the soil from from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author Jack London was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone. The <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_Works_Shipyard_9466.html" title="Alameda Works Shipyard">Alameda Works Shipyard</a> was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the estuary, where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used. Today, the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_of_Oakland_3d10.html" title="Port of Oakland">Port of Oakland</a> across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Alameda is a "Coast Guard City," one of seven in the country.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific) which were later transformed into the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Bay_Electric_Lines_866d.html" title="East Bay Electric Lines">East Bay Electric Lines</a>. Souther Pacific's electrified trains were not <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetcar.html" title="Streetcar">streetcars</a>, but full-sized railroad cars which connected to the mainland by bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Long_Wharf_4046.html" title="Oakland Long Wharf">Oakland Mole</a> and the Alameda Mole. In fact, one line which ran between the two moles was dubbed the "Horseshoe Line" for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after the completion of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_e5fc.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">Bay Bridge</a>, Alameda trains ran directly to San Francisco on the lower deck of the bridge, the ferries having been rendered unnecessary.</p>
<p>In the 1930s <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_Airways_1e3c.html" title="Pan American Airways">Pan American Airways</a> established a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaplane.html" title="Seaplane">seaplane</a> port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the famous <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Clipper_a5e5.html" title="China Clipper">China Clipper</a>. With the advent of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Air_Station_Alameda_d3b7.html" title="Naval Air Station Alameda">Naval Air Station Alameda</a> established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield as well as docks for several <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carriers.html" title="Aircraft carriers">aircraft carriers</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Air_Station_Alameda_d3b7.html" title="Naval Air Station Alameda">Naval Air Station Alameda</a> was decommissioned and is in process of being turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as Alameda Point. Portions of this area are now in commercial use, but the transfer process has been slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land. In late July of 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with Navy that would turn the land over to the city for $108M. The preliminary development concept calls for 1700 housing units to be developed at Alameda Point. In September, 2006, the developer, Alameda Point Community Partners, withdrew from development of Alameda Point.</p>
<p>After two previous failures, voters in the city passed a ballot measure in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> authorizing a <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bond_measure.html" title="Bond measure">bond measure</a> for construction of a new library to replace the city's <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnegie_library.html" title="Carnegie library">Carnegie library</a>, damaged during the <a href="../../../l/o/m/Loma_Prieta_earthquake_c7b6.html" title="Loma Prieta earthquake">Loma Prieta earthquake</a>.

<p>Alameda's first newspaper, the <i>Encinal</i>, appeared in the early 1850s and the paper's editor was instrumental in the movement to incorporate the city. Following the <i>Encinal</i>, several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the <i>Daily Argus</i> would eventually rise to prominence. Around 1900 the <i>Daily Argus</i> began to fade in importance and east and west papers <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Star</i> combined to take the leading role as the <i>Alameda Times-Star</i> in the 1930s. Under the ownership of the Kofman family, the <i>Times-Star</i> thrived until selling to the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_Newspaper_Group_68fb.html" title="Alameda Newspaper Group">Alameda Newspaper Group</a> (an out-of-town news corporation) in the 1970s.</p>
<p>As a response to the lack of a local news source, Alameda realtors John Crittenden and John McNulty decided to combine their two publishing efforts into a new East End voice, <i>Alameda Journal</i>, in 1987. Crittenden had published a real estate homes list to real estate agents, while McNulty was known for the Island Journal, which focused on local news, history, humor and advertising. The new publication found itself the hometown paper of choice. It sold to the Hills Newspaper chain owned by Chip and Mary Brown. The Browns, Oakland residents, had assembled a chain of five East Bay weeklies and biweeklies: the biweekly <i>Alameda Journal</i>, The biweekly <i>Montclarion</i> (serving the Montclair district of Oakland), <i>The Piedmonter</i> (Piedmont), <i>The Berkeley Voice</i>, and <i>The Albany/El Cerrito Journal</i>.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_Ridder_39e4.html" title="Knight Ridder">Knight Ridder</a>, at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally-based newspaper, the <i>Alameda Sun</i>, in 2001. In 2006 Knight Ridder announced its impending sale to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_McClatchy_Company_56d3.html" title="The McClatchy Company">McClatchy Corp.</a>, a Sacramento-based publishing firm. McClatchy Corp. has put the <i>Contra Costa Times</i>, which under the Knight Ridder reorganization included all five of the original Hills Newspapers, up for sale. The current owners of the <i>Alameda Times-Star</i>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaNews_Group_cb58.html" title="MediaNews Group">MediaNews, Inc.</a>, based in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, have announced a strong interest in buying both the <i>Contra Costa Times</i> chain and the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_Mercury_News_715d.html" title="San Jose Mercury News">San Jose Mercury News</a></i>, consolidating the daily newspaper market of the East Bay, effectively under one owner. The California State Attorney General, as of June 2006, has been investigating the sale of the former Knight Ridder properties to MediaNews in the event of a potential breach of anti-trust laws. The upshot of the sale to MediaNews would be the original victor of Alameda's newspaper wars losing in the end, being bought out by the newspaper company once considered vanquished.</p>

<p>Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power and telecommunications service (Alameda Power and Telecom) that delivers services directly to consumers.</p>

<p>Like almost all cities in California, the municipal government and the school administration are two separate entities. The <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_Unified_School_District_0858.html" title="Alameda Unified School District">Alameda Unified School District</a> has the same boundaries as the City of Alameda, but has a separately elected board to oversee its operations, and its funding comes directly from the county and state governments without oversight by the city council. The AUSD educates approximately 10,000 students each year, in eight <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_school.html" title="Elementary school">elementary schools</a>, three <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_school.html" title="Middle school">middle schools</a>, two traditional <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high schools</a>, two <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_Community_Learning_Center_a214.html" title="Alameda Community Learning Center">alternative learning schools</a>, one continuation school, and one high school within the College of Alameda. Most high school students attend <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encinal_High_9397.html" title="Encinal High">Encinal High</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda_High_37c9.html" title="Alameda High">Alameda High</a>. The district also operates an Adult School and a Child Development Center. Two elementary schools were closed at the end of the 2005-2006 school year. However, a new elementary school, <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_Bridges_901f.html" title="Ruby Bridges">Ruby Bridges</a>, opened for the 2006-2007 school year.</p>
