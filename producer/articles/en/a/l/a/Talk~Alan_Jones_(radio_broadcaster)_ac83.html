<p>Hello</p>
<p>I've added an information box at the bottom as part of the Wiki RL project. Would anybody here know, by chance, who succeeded Jones after he was dismissed from the Tigers in 1993? I've put down Pearce for 1994 but I know (at least, I think I do) that he wasn't appointed straight away. Any help would be great. Cheers</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it was Wayne Pearce according to <a href="http://www.nswrl.com.au/index.cgi?sID=35&amp;det=1&amp;intArticleID=7" class="external free" title="http://www.nswrl.com.au/index.cgi?sID=35&amp;det=1&amp;intArticleID=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.nswrl.com.au/index.cgi?sID=35&amp;det=1&amp;intArticleID=7</a>: "<tt>Junior took over from Alan Jones as Balmain coach in 1994 but with only a handful of top players they finished with the wooden spoon in his first year.</tt>" Msmyrk 12:19, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Melbourne's Fairfax broadsheet newspaper The Age subsequently denounced Jones' remarks on his breakfast radio programme as inflammatory, possibly seditious, and largely responsible for those riots.</i> The reference offered doesn't actually support that - for instance, the word 'sedition' appears nowhere in the article. I'd have deleted the unsupported bits, but I seem to recall articles that *did* make such judgements on Jones; perhaps somebody could dig them up and add them here? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 23:41, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Removed characterisation of the Age's coverage, since no response to the above, but left the actual article link. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 23:06, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>220.239.4.237 recently removed this paragraph ("removing subjective opinion that Jones urged on violence in cronulla"):</p>
<p>"In December 2005, in the lead-up to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Sydney_race_riots_91e6.html" title="2005 Sydney race riots">Cronulla</a> riots, Jones used his breakfast radio programme to read out a widely-circulated <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_message_service.html" title="Short message service">text message</a> calling on people to "Come to Cronulla this weekend to take revenge... get down to North Cronulla to support the Leb and wog bashing day". While telling listeners not to take the law into their own hands, he also gave lengthy and sympathetic coverage to callers urging violence and vigilante action and called for a "community show of force".<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/alan-jones-i-led-this-charge/2005/12/12/1134236003153.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/alan-jones-i-led-this-charge/2005/12/12/1134236003153.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>."</p>
<p>After I reverted, s/he then re-deleted this sentence ("opinion - suggesting he gave more sympathetic coverage to those who urged violence"): "While telling listeners not to take the law into their own hands, he also gave lengthy and sympathetic coverage to callers urging violence and vigilante action and called for a "community show of force".<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/alan-jones-i-led-this-charge/2005/12/12/1134236003153.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/alan-jones-i-led-this-charge/2005/12/12/1134236003153.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>."</p>
<p>The Age article linked in that sentence quotes Jones as calling for "a rally, a street march, call it what you will. A community show of force." It also reports an exchange between Jones and a caller:</p>
<p><i>When John called on Tuesday to bluntly recommend vigilante action — "If the police can't do the job, the next tier is us" — Jones did not dissent. "Yeh. Good on you, John." And when he then offered a maxim his father had picked up during the war — "Shoot one, the rest will run" — the broadcaster roared with laughter. "No, you don't play Queensberry's rules. Good on you, John."</i></p>
<p>If Jones has denied this reported exchange, that dispute would certainly be worth acknowledging in the article. If his remarks have been taken out of context, he certainly has the wherewithal to make a full transcript available. But if he hasn't disputed that representation, it's hardly 'opinion' to characterise folk like John as 'urging violence and vigilante action' or Jones' repeated "Good on you"s as 'sympathetic'. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 10:07, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not quite sure if you've ever read a real encyclopaedia, Calais, but your entry is overtly opinionated and destroys any neutrality that section had. It's a loaded quote, and it's objectionable, even from David Marr's piece, that the "good on you" was in direct reference to the condoning of 'wog' bashing. Your insertion of the quote further implied there was a direct correlation, and if one wanted to be equally as fanciful, they could insert the other piece from Marr's article, unqualified, by suggesting that he responded to said callers by saying "No" - and this if anything, was the part of the quote that was linked to the caller, not merely the concluding goodbyes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note these two exchanges, as reported by Marr:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>John: "If the police can't do the job, the next tier is us"</i></dd>
<dd><i>AJ: "Yeh. Good on you, John.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>John: "Shoot one, the rest will run."</i></dd>
<dd><i>AJ: "No, you don't play Queensberry's rules. Good on you, John."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Marr's representation of those exchanges is disputed by Jones or anybody else at 2UE, that should certainly be acknowledged in the article. (Marr's account was run fairly widely, IIRC, so presumably Jones is aware of it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If that representation is <i>not</i> in dispute, then I don't think it's POV-pushing to point out that Jones responded "Good on you" to a call for vigilantism and again to a call for violence; if that's a loaded quote, it's because Jones himself loaded it. But I'll throw this over to the Australian Wikipedians' notice board and see if other editors have anything to say. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 12:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm still not convinced there's a real question of interpretation here - it's hard to see how those responses can be taken as anything other than approving, IMHO - but I've converted it to a "Marr accused Jones of..." format.

<p>To assume that Jones approved the riots is far fetched at best, particularly if you are only going by the small excerpts provided by David Marr. The edit is an improvement on what was there before, as it encourages the reader to make up their own mind, rather than be persuaded by your interpretation of his intentions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To interpret that as Jones approving the <i>riots</i> would indeed be stretching it, since they hadn't yet happened. Construing it as Jones approving of the <i>comments</i> is rather less of a stretch.

<dd>General rule of thumb, Calair. A person reading a proper encyclopaedia excerpt should be unable to tell which side of the fence the author stands. With your edits, it was obvious that you are indeed a critic of Alan Jones' comments, even though you claim you were directly quoting a media analyst (and also drawing conclusions from said quotes) and therefore it was poor editing. However, what is up there now looks far more professional.</dd>

<p>Hi, I'd just like to point out that at the moment that the article refers to "tapes leaked to Triple J" as happening in the late 1990s. As far as I am aware, this occurred in either 2004 or 2005, on JJJ's '<a href="../../../h/a/c/Hack_%28radio_program%29.html" title="Hack (radio program)">Hack</a>' show. They were dubbed "The Closet Recordings of Alan Jones" and featured plenty of swearing by complaints by Jones, included his constant frustration with 'fucking dust in the studio'. So, unless anyone is aware of other tapes that were leaked in the late 90s, this date should be changed. Stuart mcmillen 01:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reworded some material about other people involved with the show, but I'm not sure this is really notable; if it is, it should probably go to a separate section on the show's format rather than sitting in a chronology. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rule 1? Not familiar with that one.</dd>
<dd>The new reference is better, but it still doesn't quite support the material it's attached to. Carlton is quoted as using qualifiers like "I haven't read the book but I believe it says X" and "I understand X is in the book".</dd>
<dd>This is a bit weaker than implied by the "Carlton claimed the book contained allegations of gay sex" offered by the SMH and repeated in this article. (To see why, observe that if the book turned out <i>not</i> to contain such allegations, Carlton could still claim those qualified statements were true - after all, they're just about what he <i>thought</i> was the case.)</dd>
<dd>And the previous sentence is still unsupported. It is a fact that the ABC Board decided not to publish, and Carlton certainly <i>suggests</i> that the book contains allegations of gay sex. But as far as the cited article goes, he does <i>not</i> allege that the latter was the reason for the former; he <i>asks</i> if it was the reason (and then immediately asks about a different possible reason), but a question is not quite the same as an allegation.</dd>
<dd>I suspect Carlton would very much <i>like</i> to make those allegations, but the quotes have the sound of a man who's just obtained legal advice; that 'I understand X' and 'is it perhaps because of Y?' format is standard for somebody trying to suggest such things without actually presenting them as claims of fact, which could potentially be fodder for a defamation suit. As it is, I don't think either of those two sentences are completely supported by Carlton's quotes in that article.</dd>
<dd>(It's also not clear from the article whether the sentence about allegations as to the ABC board's motivations <i>is</i> referring to Carlton's statements, or somebody else's; it needs clarification either way, and in the latter case a source of its own.)--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 23:31, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why have you done this? Jones's homosexuality has been on the public record for some months and has been widely known for years. He was outed in a poster campaign in Sydney's Paddington and district some years ago when the authorities went to a great deal of trouble to remove the offending material. In recent months Andrew Marr has stated categorically in radio broadcasts that Jones is "gay" on several occassions the latest on RN Breakfast this morning. I would ask that you revert your clearly vexatious category deletion.<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 02:54, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is certainly <i>very</i> widely rumoured that Jones is gay. (Personally, I would be astonished to discover that he wasn't.) But categorisation needs a solid citation, and I'm not sure the fact that somebody has alleged it, without any information on the basis for that allegation, is enough. (BTW, googling on '+"andrew marr" +"radio national" +"alan jones"' got no relevant hits - do you have a transcript link or something?)</dd>
<dd>But <i>Jonestown</i> will be out soon enough. I think it is very likely that it <i>will</i> be an adequate citation - if it does (as has been suggested) detail gay relationships on Jones' part, and he doesn't challenge those claims, I for one would be happy to re-add the category on the strength of it. So rather than have this argument just now, why don't we wait a few months and see whether it gets resolved for us?
