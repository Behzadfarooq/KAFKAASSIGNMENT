<p>I removed that paragraph from the Revolver Magazine article because it shows massive negative bias towards the other publications mentioned:</p>
<p>"[Revolver] is a successful departure from hard rock/heavy metal publications that had dominated the scene; the articles are well-written and well-researched."</p>
<p>"Circus was poorly edited and frequently had grammatical errors and there was criticism from metal fans that the publication focused more on style than substance by continually covering bands such as Orgy, Slipknot, and Marilyn Manson."</p>
<p>"In 2001, [Hit Parade] came under fire from fans because the magazine was featuring bands that clearly were not metal ( i.e. Three Doors Down)."</p>
<p>In addition, none of these statements are sourced.</p>

<p>Just FYI, if you slap uw-vandalism3 on an all-new IP user page, especially for a two-character "=)" edit which may well have just been experimentation (uw-test) series, <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> is highly unlikely to take any action, and may even look strongly askance on this. Please see <a href="../../../u/w/t/WP%7EUWT_9d62.html" title="WP:UWT">WP:UWT</a> for full instructions on the use of these templates. The 3- and 4-level warnings <i><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume bad faith</a></i>, after evidence of a pattern of intentionally disruptive behavior. The uw-templates are made to be used in numerical series, and except in cases of incredibly egriously vandalism, AIV won't act if they are not used in 1-2-3-4 order and the disruptive user does something disruptive again after the 4th level warning. E.g., if someone experiments in an article their first day, they'll get uw-test1. If they next add unsourced unlikely information, they get uw-unsourced2. If they then vandalize, they get uw-vandalism3, and so on.

<p>Thanks for all your hard work on the school assessments. I am delighted that you have been much more sympathetic to our old English schools than previous assessors who classified <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_School_e906.html" title="Reading School">Reading School</a>, founded in 1125 and the tenth oldest school in England, as being of low importance. I've just put in a request for a re-assessment of this school in light of your recent ratings. There are however a very large number of old schools in England and I'm not sure if a school such as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Margaret%27s_School%2C_York_688b.html" title="Queen Margaret's School, York">Queen Margaret's School, York</a>, which is only one hundred years old, necessarily qualifies for a mid-importance rating. Schools of this age are very common in the UK. Other older schools, eg, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_School_%28Walthamstow%29_be9e.html" title="Forest School (Walthamstow)">Forest School (Walthamstow)</a>, have only been classified as of low importance by other assessors, though perhaps this assessment was mistakenly low. I'm quite happy for old UK schools to have higher importance ratings based on their age but I just thought you should be aware of the potential numbers involved. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahliarose_da64.html" title="User:Dahliarose">Dahliarose</a> 15:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most certainly. I pointed that out on Dahliarose's page, where I said <i>I'm considering downgrading some of the recent assessments with the notion that they need to have <b>something else</b> making them important, other than the age.</i>, so I agree with you in that regard. It is simply illogical to have age as the main measure, because United Kingdom schools aren't the only ones being ssessed and heman beings didn't get to the New World until well after 1000. Acoordingly, there will be no schools in the United States older than European schools in all likelyhood, but a good number of them are more important. <b><a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix2_6148.html" title="User:Phoenix2">Phoenix</a></b><a href="../../../p/h/o/User_talk%7EPhoenix2_b8f4.html" title="User talk:Phoenix2">Two</a> 18:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Age in itself should not get you a high rating but if you are around for a thousand years then its likely that your alumni will be higher. Obviously it depends on the country you are in. English schools and universities are all very recent compared with arabian educational institutes. Any school in the USA that is 300 years old .... is very old. 300 years in the UK is not very remarkable. Oh and the barnstar - its not imaginary. Look up barnstar in wikipedia. I.m just "being bold". If you agree then pass it on .. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictuallers_dc4b.html" title="User:Victuallers">Victuallers</a> 09:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for rating TKS's article-it gave an insight ot what other people think about it. I was wondering, when you say there are no references, what would you need us to put if we didn't use references? Thanks for that! Bassoonist123 21:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

As someone who has worked on the page, I found your comments helpful. I've tried to respond to them by doing some wikificiation and reorganization and taking a few small steps towards NPOV. If you have time and if you feel like it, could you take another look and see whether or not you think these changes move the page in the right direction?

<p>Do the Schools Project have a categorical listing of schools by state/province? Perhaps I'm typing in or simply not finding the correct links, but I don't see that such a database exists, but I could be wrong. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipperClipper_7df0.html" title="User:SkipperClipper">SkipperClipper</a> 02:35, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you review the assessments I completed on April 1st? I'd like some feedback before I do anymore. Want to ensure I seem to be rating things in line with yourself and others. I've basically finished out the non-assessed "x" and "Z" lettered schools.

<dd>Most the articles in the category were already there before I changed anything. I just made it uniform. I can ditch the category easy enough. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanbly_4a9c.html" title="User:Alanbly">Adam McCormick</a> 22:09, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, I see what happened. It looks like the small rectangular template: {{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECat_class_2e33.html" title="Template:Cat class">Cat class</a>}} being used on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProject_Schools_articles_by_quality_8cf1.html" title="Category:WikiProject Schools articles by quality">Category:WikiProject Schools articles by quality</a> pages added them to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchool_articles_by_quality_51a6.html" title="Category:School articles by quality">Category:School articles by quality</a> instead of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProject_Schools_articles_by_quality_8cf1.html" title="Category:WikiProject Schools articles by quality">correct category</a>. Is there any easy way to fix that? Once that's fixed, we can go ahead and ditch the extra category. Lists of schools are covered pretty well with the mainspace categories at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchools_8c54.html" title="Category:Schools">Category:Schools</a>; I just hope we're making it easy for people to find these --<a href="../../../j/h/1/User%7EJh12_6830.html" title="User:Jh12">Jh12</a> 03:36, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank for your assessment of the Preuss School article. I have since added a few references, added a section, and expanded the clubs and athletics section. I also added another picture. I was wondering if you could be a little more specific about what areas I could expand to make it better. I was also wondering if you could read through the article a bit and make sure the prose sounds alright.
