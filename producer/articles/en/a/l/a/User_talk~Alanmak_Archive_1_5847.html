<p>Hello, and welcome to the Wikipedia community. I am here to say that your edits to the Hong Kong-related articles have frequently been extremely disruptive to the articles. Since you are new here to wikipedia, you may or may not know how things are done here, however your deletion of certian information does not follow protocols. For example, when you deleted the word "national" from Hong Kong, were you aware that this is the standard template for all semi-independent countries?</p>
<p>Also, when you removed the image of the Hang Seng Index, which was done without any relevant discussion because I am quite fond of that image, you also deleted the link to the History of Hong Kong article.</p>
<p>On another note, while you have been uploading many images related to Hong Kong, you have not listed the source for any of them. Please do not forget to include the source of every image, as Wikipedia makes a concerted effort to use non-copyrighted images only. If you took the images yourself, please state as such, otherwise without a source the images could very well be deleted. Thank you. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">Páll</a> 23:31, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I appreciate what you have done to the transport section. But as you know the article has been nominated as an FAC candidate of late, and some guys are just saying the paragraphs are too lengthy and tedious to read; summerisation, in other words, is urgently needed. I would remove part of your edit, but please do not think your data is of no avail. That's the rule of game, and I hope you can understand.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../m/c/y/User%7EMcy_jerry_4dae.html" title="User:Mcy jerry">Jerry Crimson Mann</a> 3 July 2005 14:05 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan Mak!</p>
<p>So happy that we have our <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> article promoted to be an <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, gaining an overwhelming popularity. I think it's not the time to cool down our ambition. The page <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Hong_Kong_ec96.html" title="Flag of Hong Kong">flag of Hong Kong</a> is now asking for your helping hand! I have greatly modelled it on <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_South_Africa_c357.html" title="Flag of South Africa">flag of South Africa</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_India_88f1.html" title="Flag of India">flag of India</a>, plus some brand-new illustrations added which is drawn by me with <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_Flash_1a63.html" title="Macromedia Flash">Flash</a>, and the standard of the article has been greatly boosted, and, nearly, lived up to the feature article's standard. Still, some crucial information is absent, and that's whay your help is urgently needed!</p>
<p><a name="What_you_can_help" id="What_you_can_help"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlanmak_Archive_1_5847.html" title="Edit section: What you can help">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What you can help</span></h3>
<p>The following information are still missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbolism, e.g. the meaning of the design, the bauhinia flower, the red-coloured background, etc.</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Photos, e.g. Flag raising ceremony at <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Bauhinia_Square_9940.html" title="Golden Bauhinia Square">Golden Bauhinia Square</a>, Flags in parade, desecration cases (I think <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Hair_723c.html" title="Long Hair">Long Hair</a> have tried that before&#160;;-P), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being an active and endeavourous wikipedian, you are now asked to collaborate on this project at full stretch — and to show your pride of being a HK wikipedian!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, <a href="../../../m/c/y/User%7EMcy_jerry_4dae.html" title="User:Mcy jerry">Jerry Crimson Mann</a> 6 July 2005 15:25 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it's your choice, isn't it? Anyway, I love your photos very much. Maybe you should take a picture of flag raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square if you wish.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>PS Surely we can nominate more HK-related articles for nomination -- if they have the standard of an FAC. If you're unwilling to help with <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Hong_Kong_ec96.html" title="Flag of Hong Kong">Flag of Hong Kong</a>, maybe you can help in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> later on, giving opinions or doing some proofread.&#160;:-D -- <a href="../../../m/c/y/User%7EMcy_jerry_4dae.html" title="User:Mcy jerry">Jerry Crimson Mann</a> 8 July 2005 14:26 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you show me the example of a Taiwan city? Many thanks. Actually the main purpose of the map is to show where a Hong Kong district is within the territory, but not to tell others where Hong Kong is with in the PRC's territory. The zoom-out map is somehow redundant, as it has been shown in the page of <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Very likely, the zoom-out maps in every district map would be exactly the same, which has in fact lost its significance. Paleness is not a problem; after all, we need to stick to the standard routine. You can contact me via icq @ 48299807.&#160;:)

<ul>
<li>First your colour scheme is no good, to be honest: khaki can's go with pink like that. =.= Perhaps we should make a reference of some web design websites, and see whether we can grab some stunning inspiration.&#160;;-)</li>
<li>I think we should make a discussion later on with all HK wikipedian, which is of grave importance, collecting their opinions and, subsequently, reaching a consensus. Everything else is a comprise.</li>
<li>Your image format, i.e. JPEG, is not really suitable for map making. Pixerisation and loss of quality would be the outcome if you reduce the size of the picures. I think PNG format would be much better off in creating district maps.</li>
<li>I like your modification of the template. Btw, is "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" just a bit lengthy?&#160;:-)</li>

<li>OK, hope we can have a discussion on map-drawing within days.</li>
<li>Despite a wide-ranging colour scheme supported, there's a serious pixerisation and a loss of quality when reducing the size of a Jpeg image. Gif images have no such problems, but can store 256 colours. No distortion of image quality would happen in PNG while possessing numerous colours.</li>

<p>The naming conventions and manual of style of Wikipedia advise editors to include at list one way of romanisation in brackets for equivalent of titles in other languages if it is non-roman letter-based. Unlike Mandarin and Pinyin, there is no standardised and widely-recognised romanisation method for Cantonese, and therefore I include both. IPA is advised by Wikipedia for pronunciation, while Jyutping is, in my opinion, one of the most well-established for Cantonese. The only solution to avoid the long length would be moving towards the Korean-related topics style, that is, to have an infobox for different written forms and romanisation methods on the right hand side of the page. I'm actually working on the template of a similar infobox (well, you know what I'm occupied by lately), and I'd love to hear your comment and opinion. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 08:28, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's see what will the community prefer. I myself prefer the infobox style to inline text. Pinyin is recognised by the UN, and as far as I remember, ISO. Jyutping is not having the same status as Pinyin is to Mandarin. There are other also well-established systems, such as Yale. In comparison, IPA is a universal standard that everyone can read. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 08:53, August 7, 2005 (UTC)

<p>With regards to your comment, I wish to point out that no <i>native English</i> speaker would pronounce "dai hay" as the curseword because ay is always pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ei/</span> in English, not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ai/</span>. Anyone who can read a curseword from "dai hay" is not a native English speaker (and I, a native Cantonese speaker, spent almost an entire minute figuring out why you said it’s a curseword; I would say that if you insist of <i>English</i> pronunciations, the true problem is in the pronunciation of "dai", not of "hay"). The rationale for your edit is that "hay" would be read as the curseword <i>in English</i>; this, however, is not true and is thus not a valid reason.</p>
<p>Not that I agree with the use of transliterated Cantonese words, nor have I anything to do with the original version, but the word was in parentheses.

<dd>Hi. I know there is a problem with the maps. The problem is that we have too few cartographers. (I know that map of mine is unclear, a lot of my old ones are). I have had fruitful discussions with <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">user:ran</a> <a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnkur_0fc1.html" title="User:Ankur">user:Ankur</a> and we've agreed to have all maps of Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh NPOV'd. I suggest we create blank NPOV maps of India, China, Pakistan in svg format and make it a template for others to use. I've already released my states of India images as NPOV. What if we create a wikiproject to deal with such issues?

<p>Apologies for the late reply. Yeah, I know, we do have a lot of POV maps floating around. we have to leave the past behind and concentrate on getting NPOV maps in WP. First we'd need NPOV political maps of Asia, India, China and Pakistan. I'd strongly suggest we use the .svg format for maps. Once we do that, we can use those to create blank maps of states/provinces. We'd also need do the same to maps of Myanmar, Bhutan and Afghanistan since they border the disputed areas. Once we get this basic infrastructure in place, we should advertise it so that it can be used as the template.</p>
<p>On the topographic front <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Blood_d290.html" title="User:Captain Blood">User:Captain Blood</a> has been kind enough to supply NPOV topo maps of India, Nepal and Bhutan.</p>

<p>I'm the one who originally added the jyutping, and I disagree that this is "flooding" the article. First, you cannot know how to pronounce "Kung Kao Po" in true Cantonese. Second, such kind of thing (an anglicized romanization annotated with a more precise romanization) happens with non-Chinese articles too, e.g., articles regarding Jewish culture. I have never heard of anyone complaining over there that people are "flooding the articles with romanizations".—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 09:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't make any silly points. The reason why Mandarin Pinyin was added, was because the name "Kung Kao Po" is not a transliteration from Mandarin. It is not the matter of whether the pronunciation of Mandarin is accurate or not. It is the because the title of the article tells people nothing about the Mandarin pronunciation. That is the point for adding Pinyin. - <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">Alanmak</a></p>

<ol>
<li>In Hong Kong, there <i>are</i> some Westerners who prefer to mimic the real Cantonese sounds (minus the tones) when pronouncing Cantonese romanizations. For these people, jyutping would be useful (and IMHO better than ambiguous Wikipedia-style phonetic IPA).</li>
<li><i>Outside</i> Hong Kong (and maybe Britain), the probability of a Westerner pronouncing "Kung" correctly is close to zero, and it almost certainly (at least the case here in Canada) would be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kʰʌŋ]</span>.

<dd>For the second point, if we include jyutping, the correct information is at least there if the reader cares.

As I've said some time before, there's no single and universal standard in Cantonese (Pinyin is not a truly universal standard for Mandarin too, but that's beyond the discussion here). IPA is useful for readers who have some basic training in that system. Yale is popular in Cantonese teaching in the west, while Jyutping is a system developed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong. All these system possess some certain authority, and I find no reason that any one of them is superior to the other two when applied to Hong Kong-related entries.</p>

<p>As for Pinyin, I agree with Wing that what's flooding the first line of articles is Pinyin, not Jyutping, Yale nor IPA. Nevertheless I don't think there's any harm to include Pinyin since Putonghua is de facto official in Hong Kong. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:49, 29 November 2005 (UTC) (modified 09:03, 30 November 2005 (UTC))</p>

I see no points for not including the Mandarin pronunciation whenever a Chinese terms is mentioned here. Standard Mandarin is the official language of the entire nation. Even most foreigners that learn "Chinese language" is actually learning Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin has a very high importance, but some sino-phobia guys oppose any use of Mandarin, just because Mandarin is also used in mainland China. This is strange. - <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">Alanmak</a> 04:37, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do not make any silly points. No one is a sinophobia here, and no one is saying "we should not include Mandarin because Mandarin is also used in mainland China". However, for articles whose titles are Cantonese in origin, correct Cantonese pronunciation is valid etymological information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(In contrast, besides Mandarin being the national language, the Mandarin pronunciation would have no <i>direct</i> relation to an article whose title is obviously not derived from a Mandarin pronunciation. This [i.e., lack of direct relationship to the article] is the reason why I say "the pinyin is the flood, not the jyutping".)—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 05:09, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not a silly point. People with sinophobia won't know / admit that they are. I was not intended to mean that <i>you</i> are sinophobic, but some other people.</p>
<p>I didn't say Cantonese was unnecessary, but it was somebody who said "Mandarin is not necessary". Anyway, Kung Kao Po is Cantonese, Gong Jiao Bao is Mandarin. That simple!</p>

<dd>Well, there is no such thing as an NPOV; thus I completely agree that “People with sinophobia won't know / admit that they are”. Everything that everyone says has one or more unstated POV’s (that is, of course, including me, and you), and even "all views are accepted" is itself a POV (that all views are equally valid). Realizing that what <i>everyone</i> says is POV, in turn, helps us to approximate, if we want to, something that might look like an NPOV, though whether such an approximate NPOV is a good thing or not is debatable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What our discussion has done, at the very least, is to make us see the other person’s unstated POV’s: Or at least I hope you can understand my POV’s; hopefully I have understood yours. Obviously, understanding does not, however, imply agreement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(Actually, it may be even more important that we can see <i>our own</i> unstated POV’s from the discussion. Which brings us back to your comment, that “People with sinophobia won't know / admit that they are”.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, in insisting on an absolute NPOV—i.e., failing to realize that NPOV does not actually exist—Wikipedia can never attain NPOV because its foundation is ultimately POV’d. Paradoxical, yes, but true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
