<li>Coredesat, I have reviewed <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html#Disruption" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK#Disruption</a> and it clearly states that cool down blocks are discouraged.

</ul>
<p>Coredesat supported the RfA of dysysopped Chacor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong Support. Chacor should not have been desysopped before. He's an excellent editor, with loads of experience as a normal user and an ex-admin, and I've worked with him a great deal.

<dd>Perhaps not to you. I have an IRC log that says differently, though. It's Chacor's call on whether it's made available or not. Note that he did subsequently apologise for part (but not all) of it. ++Lar: t/c 18:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Coredesat, I just want to get back to editing articles. If you read the discussion you will see that I was trying to get out of the conversation.

<p>Hi, I would appreciate it if you could review my statement regarding the block I received. If you could e-mail your thoughts on the statement I would appreciate it. User_talk:Alan.ca/block Alan.ca 08:18, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, you wrote this well after your block had been removed. Second, it is inappropriate for me to discuss this matter with you off-wiki. Third, after reading over the material you pointed to, I do not feel much sympathy for you. For instance, in the following passage, you make a veiled accusation of sock puppetry:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>I don't think pointing out that Coredesat was a supporter in Chacor's RfA was inappropriate for me to post on my talk page after the block was so quickly issued for such a long time. In summary, I feel that the block was misapplied as there were plenty other avenues that were available. I find it suspicious that a user, Chacor, who has been de-sysoped for sock puppetry among other things, had a former supporter pop up and block my account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following passage you suggested that you would just keep arguing until either being blocked or being told to stop arguing, which is not a positive indicator that you can contribute constructively to discussions:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>If anyone had intervened in the AN/I discussion and said: Alan and Chacor, please stop arguing here, let's just move on. I would have been more than happy to withdraw from the argument.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have been asked to independently review this situation and decide whether <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlan.ca%2Fblock&amp;diff=96392728&amp;oldid=96382520" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlan.ca%2Fblock&amp;diff=96392728&amp;oldid=96382520" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> constitutes a violation of your self-imposed probation. While in itself it's not exactly disruptive (although might be viewed as adding fuel to the discussion), the fact that you have subsequently taken it to <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a>'s <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Redux" class="extiw" title="m:User_talk:Redux">meta talk page</a>, certainly is. Therefore, I have reinstated the 72 hour block. You may of course request yet another administrator to review the block by placing an {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>|reason}} template on your talk page.

<p>Following our e-mail discussion, as well as some discussion with other admins on the topic, I've decided to shorten your block to 48 hours, including time already spent blocked - it will expire in 36 hours. However, the probation still applies for now.

<dd>It's somewhat at a standstill. Redux left a neutral remark, Coredesat reduced the block time.

However, if you would like a review of the actions taken by the different admins involved, I would request that you start a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">Request for Comment</a>, or, if you would like to keep it simpler, make a public request for comment on the English-language Wikipedia, in a venue such as the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">Administrators' Noticeboard</a>. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 13:58, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your block was reinstated because you successfully requested to be unblocked on the condition of letting the issue go and returning to normal editing of articles, but then attempted to contact someone (in this case, me) outside of Wikipedia. I see now that your block has been shortened following further talks between yourself and Coredesat. If you feel that the matter is resolved by this, wait until the block expires and go back to your normal business as usual. If not, then you can always do as I suggested above and request community review of the entire situation. But essentially, keep the discussions public and on Wikipedia, or people will end up perceiving your actions as an attempt to circumvent the discussions and the block itself, which will not earn you any points. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 11:46, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately I have been advised that I cannot discuss the matter after my block expires as that would constitute violation of some kind of probation. If you could help me clearly understand when I can discuss this subject I would appreciate it. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 12:37, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Previously De-sysoped <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">user:Chacor</a> reported me for misuse of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=95705911#User.27s_overzealous_.7B.7Bprod.7D.7Dding_of_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=95705911#User.27s_overzealous_.7B.7Bprod.7D.7Dding_of_articles" rel="nofollow">PROD tagging to the AN/I</a>. I subsequently entered into a open debate to respond to his concerns. I subsequently noticed that Chacor had gone through and removed all of the PROD tags on every article I had tagged. I posted a note on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chacor&amp;curid=7072744&amp;diff=95806052&amp;oldid=95735731" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chacor&amp;curid=7072744&amp;diff=95806052&amp;oldid=95735731" rel="nofollow">Chacor's Talk page</a> pointing this out. Chacor responded by accusing me of threatening him by filing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95841304" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95841304" rel="nofollow">this complaint</a> on the AN/I page. I was finding that this discussion had become more personal than about Wikipedia, so I attempted to refactor my talk page and split the discussion into the releveant sections by creating a discussion on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> and removing the dispute from my talk page. Instead of following my lead, Chacor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95847052" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95847052" rel="nofollow">responds on AN/I</a> by claiming I am being disruptive for doing the move. Administrator <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">user:Ceyockey</a> advised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95852761" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95852761" rel="nofollow">Chacor to drop it</a> as he could see that I was simply trying to move on. I advised everyone that I was just trying to move on and asked Chacor to please respect my wishes.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95855974" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95855974" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> After another Administrator seconded my plan this brought an end to the problem for Dec 21/06.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Day 2, argument returns</b> At 2006-12-22T10:45:50, <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_81f8.html" title="User:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington">user:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington</a>, known as Nick, reopened the matter on my talk page with this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alan.ca&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95934787" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alan.ca&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95934787" rel="nofollow">posting</a>. His statement was rather professional, but he was asking me to cease and desist from further PROD tagging and AfD discussions. I, in fact, had not done any further PROD tagging, but I was participating in AfD discussions. I was concerned that he had threatened to block me and it seemed to be related to the Dec 21/06 discussion, so I transcluded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96027999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96027999" rel="nofollow">the notice (2006-12-22T20:58:57)</a> on to the AN/I board. Instead of letting a fresh set of eyes review the posting, Chacor was quick to get involved at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96029824" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96029824" rel="nofollow">2006-12-22T21:13:14</a> by mentioning my alleged harassment of him and so on. At this point I was perplexed as to why Chacor was spending so much time commenting on the AN/I board as he is not an administrator. Once agan Ceyocky tried to bring the conversation back to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96035351" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96035351" rel="nofollow">2006-12-22T21:55:17</a>. However, Chacor disregards this attempt and responds by stating that I should accept that I am wrong because 4 admins have disagreed with me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96035684" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96035684" rel="nofollow">2006-12-22T21:57:43</a>. It seemed that no matter how hard I tried to discuss policy, it was always about who was right. This was further demonstrated when Chacor suggested I was accusing him of <i>meat puppetry</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96038728" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96038728" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He further went on to accuse me of trolling and being irritating on the AN/I. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96045841" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96045841" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I responded by encouraging him to participate in the policy debate. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96045998" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96045998" rel="nofollow">2006-12-22T23:17:37</a> Realizing that this discussion was getting out of hand, I made an attempt to contact the user Nick on his talk page as he had posted the warning on my talk page. Chacor, monitoring my contributions, noticed this post and dragged it on to the AN/I page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96047964" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96047964" rel="nofollow">2006-12-22T23:33:34</a></li>
<li><b>Coredesat joins AN/I Discussion</b>: At this point, <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">user:Coredesat</a>, for the first time in this AN/I discussion, got involved by stating that I shouldn't be posting elsewhere, essentially rebuking my attempt to contact the original complainant and suggested that I be blocked from Wikipedia for 72 hours. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96059739" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96059739" rel="nofollow">2006-12-23T01:10:37</a> You will note, he makes no reference to policy, nor does he make a personal request on my talk page for me to cease doing anything that would warrant a block. In fact, my only activity on wikipedia at this time was responding to the concerns in the AN/I discussion. Chacor responded by suggesting that I was a vandal for refactoring my talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96060541" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96060541" rel="nofollow">2006-12-23T01:18:39</a></li>

If anyone had intervened in the AN/I discussion and said: Alan and Chacor, please stop arguing here, let's just move on. I would have been more than happy to withdraw from the argument. I only felt compelled to argue on the AN/I page as I was concerned that I would be blocked. The discussion was very accusatory towards me and I felt that responding was neccessary to preserve my freedoms on Wikipedia. I don't think pointing out that Coredesat was a supporter in Chacor's RfA was inappropriate for me to post on my talk page after the block was so quickly issued for such a long time. In summary, I feel that the block was misapplied as there were plenty other avenues that were available. I find it suspicious that a user, Chacor, who has been de-sysoped for <i>sock puppetry</i> among other things, had a former supporter pop up and block my account.</li>
