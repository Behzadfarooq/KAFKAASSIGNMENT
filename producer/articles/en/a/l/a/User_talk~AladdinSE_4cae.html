<p>Hi Alladin</p>
<p>Thank you for putting up a picture of the Babri Mosque I have also addeded pictures of the beautiful Interior. It is important that this mosque is rembered. It seems some ardent RSS followers keep changing the commentry on the page with is from a neutral point of view and often vandalise it. As a favor Could you read the Babri Mosque Page page and if you agree that its neutral can you keep an eye on it the version is 16 DJan 2005 I add this date as it keeps getting reverted to some partsian rubbish</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
<p>Lalit shastri</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think partisan bias from both sides have sullied the Babri article. I just did an extensive revision, in which I toned down rhetoric on both sides, and reorganized the entire structure of the article. I deliberately left the Disputed Neutrality tag, because I think my version could benefit from some further editing. I have noticed a few worthy contributors whom I trust to continue the task.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 01:22, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm the Coordinator of the AMA, and I am wondering if anyone has contacted you regarding you request for assistance. If not you might want to take a look at our list of members and also the Member Statements and see if there is anyone in particular you want to ask to help you. You can usually contact advocates on their talk pages or by sending them an email. If you have any problems getting assistance, please do let me know and I will try to coordinate something. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— ©</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex756_8b95.html" title="User talk:Alex756">Alex756</a> 06:11, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for your initiative. I put in a Request for Comment, and the resulting rejuvenated <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArab-Israeli_conflict_2c93.html" title="Talk:Arab-Israeli conflict">Talk</a> discussions resulted finally in a consensus, and the caricature that was repeatedly deleted has been finally agreed upon and will stay.

<p>Thanks for your edits on this page, Just to let you know I have replaced your picture with a similiar but much clearer one and added a further picture of the front gate and a caption. I have added a quote from Uma Bharati from the Sunday Times whose correspondent witnessed the destruction. I have also corrected some spelling and grammer. Continue to keep an eye on this page and also the page on Jaffa Isreal which comes under similiar attacks from the right wing</p>

<dd>I realize that you are passionate about the Babri matter, but I must tell you that in my opinion you are not being vigilant enough to keep the article <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. After careful consideration, I reverted several of your edits. The leading picture is a fine addition and I thank you for it. The second picture is really very superfluous, as there is already several pictures of angry Kar Sevaks, and more pictures are beginning to clutter the arrangement. Please see the Babri Talk section for more information on revert reasoning. Thank you.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<p>Hi AladdinSE. In order to link to the sections you have edited, you have to include the Wikitext itself in the summary. So, if I wanted to have an edit summary which linked to this section, I would include [[User talk:AladdinSE#Edit summaries]] in the summary field. If you have other questions, or this isn't clear, please don't hesitate to ask. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:31, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
If you want there to be a little arrow and link, you have to edit a specific section, not the whole page. Wipiedia will automatically insert /* */ characters around the section headers, which will convert to the linked arrow in the Edit summary. You can enter the characters yourself if you want, but there is no guarantee the link will work then. Does that help? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:16, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>About the left-right image format, i feel that if all images are right justified then the article is easier to read and follow through. This is especially true of people using smaller resolution for their browsers, as they will have to constantly use the scroll bar during the beginning of the article. Also all images on one side makes the article look much better formatted. I hope i have convinced you about this and if you have any comments please leave a message on my talk page (<a href="../../../k/a/a/User_talk%7EKaal_135f.html" title="User talk:Kaal">talk</a>).

<dd>According to what I read in Wikipedia about recommended picture layout styles, the alternating right-left method is optimum. In the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_tutorial_cbf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture tutorial">Picture Tutorial</a>, the recommendation reads: "Perhaps the easiest way is to make floating images alternate left then right - this way they don't come into contact with one another, and so can't stack up in an unattractive way." In my opinion all pictures alligning right wold be unattractive. There are all sorts of people with all sorts of monitors, we can't optimize for all of them, so I suggest following Wikipedia guidelines.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>I was mulling the idea of transwikifying the full text of the resolutions into Wikisource, but that requires some research on my part because I am not yet knowledgeable in this area. My first work on a UN resolution article used as a guideline another Wikipedia article on a UN resolution which had the full text of the resolution as well as some commentary and analysis, if I remember correctly; therefore I just followed that format by including the full text. The recent initial creations on UNSC resolutions I made were only because they were linked (to Wikipedia not Wikisource), but not created, by other editors in articles I was working on. I created them so that they would not be broken "red" links. If these articles were to be transwikified, or rather, the full text of the resolutions were to be transwikified (into Wikisource), then articles that link to these resolutions can link to Wikisource not Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<p>Aladdin,</p>
<p>I looked at the page -- it seemed rather LUMPY, and tit-for-tat. It doesn't immediately scream BIAS, except perhaps in the last section, where the pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli content of the UN resolutions is analyzed and the UN resolutions are said to be more pro-Palestinian. Yes, well, so? If the Palestinians have a better case, wouldn't they get more support? The analysis purely in terms of power politics, avoiding all the ethical and philosophical issues involved, is really quite misleading.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not sure that I want to jump into the maelstrom of Israeli-Palestinian debate. My own political position (I'm anti-Zionism, anti-Palestianian-nationalism, anti-nationalism of ANY sort) is so far from the norm, and my distance from both sides so great, that I'm not sure I want to make the effort. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:05, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AladdinSE:</p>
<p>I myself am an historian and am am beginning a concentration on an area I know little about, Islamic history &amp; civilization. I began a page on Ibn al-Tiqtaqa, but I only have 1 source in English thus far. I would like to attach the page to Ismail I, however my source, Toynbee uses the phrase "forcible conversion". perhaps you can give me some help. My efforts are to arrive at facts etc, not to peddle a point of view. Thanks <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">nobs</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure forcible conversion is accurate. The Encyclopedia Britanica's article on <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismail_I_f414.html" title="Ismail I">Ismail I</a> says: "The Shia sect of Islam was proclaimed by Ismail l to be the established religion. The fact that much of the population considered him a Muslim saint as well as shah facilitated the process of conversion." As for other sources, I'm afraid I can only direct you to a library and also to google the man. Try alternative spelling <i>Ibn al-Taqatqa</i>.

Your own extreme pro-Israeli and anti-Arab bias is so evident that it is just hypocritical make these statements. As for being mostly opposed to the policies and actions of the State of Israel, I stand by my <i>individual</i> edits and contributions. I oppose the illegal occupation, annexation and colonization of Arab lands by Israel (News-flash: The rest of the word does too), as I oppose the systematic oppression of an entire people.

<dd>AladdinSE: To say that you "can't get a word in edjewise" because I "keep tweaking and reediting...posts" is most facetious indeed. The fact that I try to <i>edit</i> my posts so that spelling errors are corrected (for example, if I were you I would be "tweaking" my spelling and esuring that "edjewise" should correctly be spelled as "edgewise" with a "g" and not a "j") and to ensure that my thoughts and arguments are clearly and accurately conveyed to the reader, (all of which) have NOTHING to do with <i>your</i> ability or means to "get a word in edjewise".

<dd>You edited and re-tweaked your post on my talk page <b>eight times</b> for one single paragraph.

About my own writing style and number of edits, you may be curious, that generally I write one (lengthy) response, but then when I re-read it I may find tiny errors, usually related to spelling, that I try to correct, even if it takes a few times of re-edits. I am not the world's best typist. Somehow I still maintain that it is crazy to say that the number of times I correct my spelling mistakes in any way influences or disturbs your ability to say anything anytime on Wikipedia to me or anyone else.

<p>I shall not answer your latest diatribe. The response form other editors regarding those images speaks for itself. I am very proud of the anti-nazi stance expressed by that picture. As for editing and tweaking your posts for errors, <b>we all do that</b>. I am not only a bad typist, but also a criminal speller. That is why I use a spell checker. I also review my posts several times before I save. Perhaps you can follow this example. That is why Wikipedia has the <i>PREVIEW</i> button when editing. You should preview and tweak, spell check, etc, <i>before</i> you save. This way you significantly reduce the confusion that results when someone is trying to reply to your posts, or is working on the same articles as you. I will be deleting any more rhetoric you place on my page. Proper new topics relating to Wikipedia articles or issues, are always welcome. Otherwise, <i>please</i> <b>MOVE ON</b>. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a></p>

<p>Ridiculous. An image is an illustration, and this image illustrates the POV in question admirably. I notice you've been being hounded a bit lately; don't let it faze you. Getting rid of the bias that pervades so many Israeli-Palestinian conflict related articles is an enormous task in the course of which you can expect considerable opposition; but it's essential if this encyclopedia is ever to reach a state where it can be taken seriously. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 10:30, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aladdin, I want you to know that I'm very happy for your presence on Middle East articles as your viewpoint is underrepresented at Wikipedia. Cogent, reasonable editors like yourself are needed to keep the articles balanced and NPOV and it's a pleasure seeing your work in those areas, even though I may not always agree with all your edits.

<p>This article in Haaretz may indirectly help tie the wall with Bush's statement, here's an excerpt: "Once disengagement was on the table, Israel enjoyed wider freedom of military action, culminating in the assassinations of Hamas leaders in 2004. From Sharon's perspective, the biggest prize of disengagement has been George Bush's letter of April 14, 2004, in which the president acknowledged: "In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949." Sharon portrayed this as a pledge to keep the large West Bank settlement blocs "part of Israel forever."" <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/613391.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/613391.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Unfortunately it does not associate the wall itself with Bush, and it is only an opinion article.

<p>Welcome back, colleague, hope it gets better!

<p>I don't think they really should get the Islam template... they are related, yes, but they are much political rather than institutionally Islam.

<dd>I disagree. The office of the caliphate has behaved differently over the centuries, at times a temporal papacy and at others a powerless figurehead. But it has always symbolized the succession to the authority of the Prophet. The link "Caliphate" is in the template itself; surely it follows that all caliph articles will contain the Islam template. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 01:50, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You say you "found no evidence of the capital being moved to Harran". Where did you look? This is stated as having happened by Hugh Kennedy in his "The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates".

<dd>I looked in 2 encyclopedias, it was not an exhaustive search. That tidbit of information, if accurate, is not generally known. As best as I can recall, most histories I've read place the capital at Damascus until the massacre of most of the Umayyad royal family by Abbas and the beginning of the Abassid caliphate. I have never heard of the Harran relocation. Nevertheless, if you are confident of Kennedy's information, by all means revert my edit and include the citation. I agree that unless someone comes across a contradictory source, it should stand, and I shall have learned something new. Also, while you and others are always welcome to share your thoughts about articles on my Talk page, I think that for the benefit of other editors working on the Damascus article, this entry would have been more appropriate in the Damascus Talk page.

<p>It surprised me as well when I came across it, but Kennedy is a pretty well-respected historian so I was inclined to believe him without looking for a confirmatory source.

<p>Hi Aladdin, I've left a few comments on the talk page about the disputed Bush quote. I do see this as original research (in fact, a classic example of it) and I've tried to explain why on the page. The reverting over it has been going on for some time, and I've tried to stay away from it because you're a good editor, and I don't want you to feel you're being ganged up on, but I've decided I may revert it myself now, if only to help see an end to the dispute. I wanted to let you know as a matter of courtesy. I'm sorry we can't agree about it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:55, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Slim: Your courtesy is admirable and very much appreciated, and quite unnecessary. Rest assured that I reciprocate my respect for your abilities as an editor, and would not see your reverts or disagreements in Talk as ganging-up. Nevertheless, thank you for your thoughtfulness. I have carefully read your comments and others' in the article Talk section, and responded accordingly. I am also sorry that we are not able to agree, and that past compromises have not held.

<dd>Aladdin, I entered into the debate a while ago with a suggestion that I thought would be helpful, but wasn't. I would like to make it again, though. I would really like to know <b>precisely</b> what you are trying to say, allowing all the original research and naughty things you want to make up your ideal encyclopedia article on the subject. I think that part of the problem with this interminable debate is that everyone involved is a reasonable and intelligent person who knows and respects Wikipedia rules; this is making the debate on it theologically complex and abstract and frankly putting me, and I think others, to sleep. It might have been actually easier to solve if there were more flagrant POV pushers involved - their contributions can be easier to neutralize in a consensus way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In particular, as Ramallite for instance noted, why not see if we can make the points you want to make without introducing Bush's quotes, or putting them in the particular place you want them. I urge flexibility on the second point, and I do agree with you that the introduction of Bush's 2004 and 2005 coments have the same amount of relevancy and OR ness. I would also agree that the reason why Bush said the barrier should not be considered a border is because it so obviously is very easy and liable to be so considered; it should be easy to find encyclopedic references interpreting his comments this way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I see it , their are three main linked topics barriers, borders and settlements. "Barriers and borders" and "barriers and settlements" clearly belong in the article. "Borders and settlements" which is what the 1st Bush quote unfortunately only directly addresses is more problematic for this article. However, there are things involving the first two uncontroversially relevant things which are not in the article and which might help to fill the needs you see and obviate the necessity for including Bush in the place you want - for instance, it mentions that Sharon originally opposed the barrier, but not why. He opposed it because it would be a de facto border, and a limit on his territorial ambitions - he opposed it because he wanted more land. This goes to seeing the border as a barrier. Concerning "barrier and settlement" something that springs to my mind is the fact that even the dissenting US judge Buergethal, noting that much of the barrier was manifestly there to enclose settlements, declared that these parts of the barrier are ipso facto illegal because the settlements themselves are absolutely illegal. Anyway I hope that these observations help somehow. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a></dd>

<p>John, these observations and threads are very interesting and have possibilities, but I am not in a position to vouchsafe their usefulness, for the following reason. As these suggestions and threads are not mine, I have difficulty envisioning a "final product" as it were because while they have been suggested, none of the people suggesting them have actually made any edits along those lines. If Ramallite or you or whomever else who sees potential here would actually propose an actual concrete edit, I would be greatly intrigued to study it.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 11:15, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ny unsolicited 2 cents again - Aladdin, I know I might be annoying you, but I have to say again, I don't really understand 100% what you are trying to say, probably from my own laziness. I would really appreciate seeing a more concrete and comprehensible if POV edit from you. As I said, it can be easier to deal with POV pushers who know the TRUTH (maybe protecting the article from admins and only allowing say RK, Yuber and Plautus Satire edit it would help - it needs something about death ray lasers&#160;:-) ) - I think it might help if you could write down and post somewhere what you think is the truth without worrying too much about wikipedia restrictions, because it might be easier to modify it to everybody's satisfaction than if the debate keeps going on the way it has been now for months. After you did that it might be possible for others to see how to help get your points across using alternate citations or using the Bush quotes differently. I personally am refraining from putting anything substantive in the article right now, as I think there is a possibility it might make things worse or be wasted work and just get inadvertently or illogically deleted in the current atmosphere, and I just don't have the time to make an edit that might possibly resolve matters. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 22:40, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is pure nonsense. The order was: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, and then the Umayyad Dynasty and then the Abassid Dynasty and so on and so forth.

<p>Hi Aladdin, sorry to hear you're having these problems. CltFn shouldn't change the source or tag. If you say you took it, we have no reason to disbelieve you. Regarding using it in the article, CltFn's objection is that Nomani is grimacing, so do you have another one from the same event that you could use? We're not supposed to use photographs that in any way diminish a person unnecessarily, and it could be argued that using an image of her grimacing does that.</p>
<p>Regarding CltFn's screenshot, I personally have no problem using it and claiming fair use (though I'd prefer to use one of yours because it's a free licence). However, my understanding is that, strictly speaking, fair use cannot be claimed for a screenshot unless it is being used in an article about the television program or movie that the screenshot depicts. In other words, the screenshot of Nomani could be used in an article about the show she was interviewed on, but not in an article about her, and I believe CltFn has been told this before (though I'm speaking from memory).</p>
<p>Regarding the IP addresses, they resolve to the same area CltFn's have resolved to before. If she used them to violate 3RR, or to suggest in some other way that the IP was a second person, it's a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, and you can point that out to an admin and ask for a block (but it can't be me, because I'm involved in the editing). However, if CltFn and the IPs weren't pretending to be separate people, there was no policy violation.</p>
<p>I hope some of the above helps.

<dd>The review action I was referring to related to the unjustified alteration of my photograph licensing to a no-source-scheduled-for-deletion tag without notification. If you have any information on possible recourses that would be very appreciated. That's unjustified tag change as well as failure to notify uploader. As for the picture, no I do not have "better" ones, and I need no others because the picture is fine and she is not grimacing. You yourself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asra_Q._Nomani&amp;diff=33735945&amp;oldid=33734539" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asra_Q._Nomani&amp;diff=33735945&amp;oldid=33734539" rel="nofollow">inserted</a> that picture into the article.

<dd>Hi again, I reinserted your image because we're not supposed to claim fair use for an image if a version with a free licence is available, so strictly speaking we should use yours. I do think it's caught her at an awkward angle, however, and could certainly be seen as a grimace. You're right that she shouldn't have changed your tag, though that happens a fair bit, but probably the only recourse is to start a request for comment on CltFn in general, not just the change of tag. Perhaps you could start a poll on the Nomani talk page as to whether your photograph is suitable and invite interested editors to comment? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:10, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You and Khalid! seem to be having various edit wars on the inclusion of qualifiers in various articles. Surely there must be some compromise you can make with him. Nonetheless, I am just letting you know that you have reverted 3 times (as my understanding of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">rule</a>) now in the Yazid article. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 04:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you had been a bit more thorough in your investigation you would have realized that we have already reached compromises regarding qualifiers on two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caliph&amp;diff=34388175&amp;oldid=34381025" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caliph&amp;diff=34388175&amp;oldid=34381025" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Siddiq&amp;diff=34393280&amp;oldid=34388894" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Siddiq&amp;diff=34393280&amp;oldid=34388894" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> separate articles. We are still at variance regarding others. I am perfectly aware of how many times I have reverted, and have never exceeded the limit, which is 3, not 2. It's curious that you would take the trouble to warn me about the 3RR since I myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hasan_ibn_Ali&amp;diff=32836517&amp;oldid=32835279" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hasan_ibn_Ali&amp;diff=32836517&amp;oldid=32835279" rel="nofollow">warned</a> you and <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParadoxic_8b6d.html" title="User:Paradoxic">Paradoxic</a> about it when we had a disagreement in late December regarding the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasan_bin_Ali_5c51.html" title="Hasan bin Ali">Hasan bin Ali</a> article.

<dd>Perhaps if you were more thorough in your "warning" of me, you would have realized that I had only reverted <b>once</b> when you had warned me. Secondly, you sound as if the 3RR rule is an allowance to revert three times. Perhaps you may understand the policy, but you may not (or you may) understand the intent of the rule:
<dl>
<dd>The three-revert rule is not an entitlement, but an "electric fence"; the 3RR is intended to stop edit wars. It does not grant users an inalienable right to three reverts every 24 hours or endorse reverts as an editing technique. Persistent reversion remains strongly discouraged and is unlikely to constitute working properly with others.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nontheless, my warning you of the rule was not to claim that you violated any such rule. Rather, to let you know if you were unaware. Were you to revert 3 times in another article a month from now, I would similarly feel compelled to let you know of the situation, regardless of no break in policy. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 17:24, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To feel compelled to do so after knowing my mind so clearly is odd behavior indeed. Also, your lecturing exposes an ignorance of the article history in question.

<dd>I just happened to come upon this rebuttal of yours. In fact, you are wrong on your time observation. My initial mention of your 3rd revert was at 4:09 UTC on the ninth. Your edit on the ninth was at 9:12 UTC on the ninth. Clearly your initiation of the talk was over five hours later. And I never did say the the disagreement was hopeless. Had the disagreement taken place in the talk page rather than in countless reverts, I never would have felt "compelled". And another thing, in hindsight, your comment about being "fully aware of the policy" proved to be incorrect as well as your were unaware of the 24 hour timeframe that 3RR depends on. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 22:01, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ironically, you were just as unaware. You assumed the exact same time-stamp application of the 3RR that I did. And I can't get over how people can consistently misread the edit histories. I initiated the Talk "over five hours later"?? My Talk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AYazid_I&amp;diff=34477445&amp;oldid=31907342" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AYazid_I&amp;diff=34477445&amp;oldid=31907342" rel="nofollow">entry</a> was completed and posted (04:22, January 9, 2006, <i>not</i> 9:12) within 10 minutes of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yazid_I&amp;diff=34476874&amp;oldid=34475366" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yazid_I&amp;diff=34476874&amp;oldid=34475366" rel="nofollow">revert</a> (04:12, January 9, 2006). You will notice that my edit summaries were more explanatory and descriptive than Khalid's, who sometimes did not provide revert justification at all. That, along with the compromises achieved with other articles (linked above) should certainly have relieved any reasonable editor of this curious "compulsion" of yours.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 22:39, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your edit was at 9:12 <b>UTC</b>, not 4:12. 4:12 may be the time in your time zone, however, since UTC is the timezone used by Wikipedia, please don't justify your edit times using your own time zone (go to your prefrences, change your offset to 0, and then save, and then see if you made your edit at 4:12). Secondly, you stated in your previous comment that you stated you started the talk <b>after</b> your edit on the ninth, and I similarly mentioned your edit. Reread my last comment, nowhere did I make that claim you started the talk at 9:12. I merely followed mentioned that your last edit was at 9:12. And now, lets take a look at the first message in this section. It clearly says that I made the comment at 4:09 <b>UTC</b>. And making edit summaries that provide justification is not reason enough to violate 3RR, unless dealing with vandalism (which 3RR does not apply to).<a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 22:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My settings have been at <b>Wikipedia default value</b> since I joined. Since they have been at default value consistently all this time, then the only frame of reference possible is the default time-stamp provided me by Wikipedia itself. You can't come in several days after the edits and say "change your preferences and then re-examine". That throws a monkey wrench into the whole process. The settings have always been consistent, that's what's important. I'm a bit confused about what you are syaing in your last post, but as far as I can tell, you were just plain wrong, the Talk section was posted right after I performed the revert, not several hours later but <b>within 10 minutes</b>. Regardless, the salient point is that compromises have been and are continually being reached regarding qualifiers.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 23:13, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. S. I have just taken your advice and altered that offset value, not for the purpose of revisiting this discussion which is completely impractical, but so that I can avoid time zone confusion in the future. This should have been the default value, in my opinion. The time-zone default as it is now potentially creates a lot of confusion.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 23:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you have clearly admitted by telling me you altered the offset value, you contradicted yourself by saying you have always been at the "Wikipedia default value", as the default value is does not change until you either change the offset value manually or you use the browser settings on the preference page. Nonetheless, the timestamp on the talk page reads as follows, <b>AladdinSE 09:22, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</b>, whereas the first timestamp in this discussion reads <b>Pepsidrinka 04:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</b>. Unless we are arguing two different things, you clearly initiated the talk page discussion over 5 hours of my message. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 01:16, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your "clear" sense of perception is as convoluted as your rambling and confusing second-to-last post. No, Wikipedia default value was <i>not</i> UTC. It did <i>not</i> have an offset value of 0. I have never altered <i>any</i> Wikipedia preference at all before today, neither offset value or browser settings or even skin etc. I was using Wikipedia's default values all along. I only changed it today for the benefit of future edits. For the last time, your time-stamp reading is wrong as we must use a uniform consistent setting for the edit history, not revisit the same with altered preferences. I made my edit and the corresponding Talk entry exactly when I said I did. I do believe we may well be arguing about different things, but it is long since this discussion outstripped any useful discourse on the original subject matter. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:39, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have blocked a user who did not violate the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">3 revert rule</a>, and who was actively involved in Talk discussions in attempting to reach a solution. You did not block the other party, "Khalid!", which is completely unfair. Note that I do not think Khalid! should be blocked, because the user did not violate the 3RR either, but I am illustrating your bias in this matter. As far as the <a href="../../../y/a/z/Yazid_I_3655.html" title="Yazid I">Yazid I</a> article is concerned, if you will direct your attention to the Talk <a href="../../../y/a/z/Talk%7EYazid_I_a363.html#Sunni_Qualifiers" title="Talk:Yazid I">discussion</a> that <i>I</i> started regarding Qualifiers, the reason Khalid! and I were reverting. Let me quote: "May I suggest looking for compromises along the lines of those developed in the Caliph <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caliph&amp;diff=34388175&amp;oldid=34381025" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caliph&amp;diff=34388175&amp;oldid=34381025" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and El Siddiq <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Siddiq&amp;diff=34393280&amp;oldid=34388894" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Siddiq&amp;diff=34393280&amp;oldid=34388894" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> articles." If you follow those links, you will see that we were reverting on those articles as well because of qualifiers, and reached a compromise. It is outrageous to block a user, and only "warn" the other, who has never violated the 3RR and who was actively engaged in Talk discussion, who in fact STARTED the Talk discussion in an effort to reach a compromise, and who has demonstrated a proven record of discussion and compromise. If you review your actions and my record in a neutral light, you will remove the block immediately and apologize.

<p>If I were attempting to "game the system" my pattern would not be <b>one</b> for January 3, <b>one</b> for January 6 and <b>one</b> for January 9. January 8th was an exception at which time I started a Talk discussion to help reach a compromise. The "excessive reverts" blocking policy does not state that calendar days are excluded from consideration. The very fact that different time zones are involved makes the 33R only practical for the calendar time-stamps provided by Wikipedia's own servers, not the editors' time zones. Moreover, you are supposed to <b>warn</b> an editor if you think he/she is misconstruing the 24 hour time period, and use your blocking sysop powers <b>sparingly</b>. So <i>kindly</i> remove the block and provide warnings in the future. Also please state/link the Wikipedia policy where you claim that not exceeding the 3 revert limit but still reverting up to the <b>allowed</b> 3 times is actually a "blockable offence." That would be an extremely curious subject for my own edification.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 23:24, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, I was busy and couldn't get to a computer sooner. That lecture would be more suitable for an editor who did not engage in extensive talk discussion, and who did not have a proven record of compromises and even outright concessions, when convinced by other editors in Talk. If you had done a little research, you would have discovered this about me. And talk about being a "Wikilayer!" You may well have a case for the 24 hour interpretation, which you certainly have applied very strictly, and moreover <b>without warning</b>, which is required by policy. I on the other hand did not count the seconds and scheme to revert the moment my version was changed. I simply saw that <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhalid%21_ab0a.html" title="User:Khalid!">Khalid!</a> had made the edit on January 9, whereas my last edit, according to the Wikipedia edit history time-stamp, was January 8. I have always gone by the calendar day time-stamp, as I have seen umpteen editors do on all sorts of articles. I reverted and explained my reasons in Talk with no suspicion whatsoever that I had only to wait some 3 hours to comply with your strict 24 hour interpretation of the 3RR. The previous days show a very relaxed attitude regarding reverting on both my part as well as Khalid!'s, hardly an "edit war". That alone, not to mention that <b>I</b> started a Talk discussion regarding our differences and <b>proposed specific lines of compromise</b> similar to our related differences in other articles (linked above), should have at <i>least</i> given you pause about a block, and instead lead you to give me a warning. I would have appreciated that very much, as I have followed the Wikipedia day time-stamp innocently since I joined this marvelous project. But no, ignoring the policy about using your sysop powers <b>sparingly</b> and with <b>warning</b>, you slap a 24 hour block, not even the customary 4 hour block for a first offense (if it indeed was even an offense).</p>
<p>You have also failed to quote the policy that backs up your statement, quote: "attempting to 'game' the system or be a "wikilawyer" by reverting 3 times a day is a blockable offence also." I really would like to read where that is stated, because it seems an odd contradiction. Please quote your source.</p>
<p>And yes, <i>there was only one revert on the 9th</i>, I fail to see how you can consistently misread the edit history. The time-stamps from your <b>own links</b> are:</p>

<p>This is getting stranger by the minute. Listen to yourself. You have just invented rules and guidelines not present in the page and claimed that if anyone disagrees with <i>your</i> interpretation by the simple recourse to policy pages (an integral part of user discussion found the length and breadth of Wikipedia), they are "violating the spirit" and wikilawyering. Absurd almost beyond belief. The policy page is very helpful about this. It applies mostly to arbitration cases. It gives a very good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=30673532&amp;oldid=30669349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=30673532&amp;oldid=30669349" rel="nofollow">example</a>, which bears no resemblance to the current discusison.

<dd>You must be new. <i>Contested</i> or <i>contentious</i> information is often reverted and a source is requested by the reverting editor. That's what sources are primarily for. All editors have every right to do this, including yourself. We do not have to go to the user's "talk page" to request sources, we request sources in the article page itself. Requesting sources and contesting information is not the same as calling someone a liar. Moreover, your language and attitude here is inappropriate, I suggest you cool down. No one is out to "get you." As for "dodgy," that means tenuous, incorrect, etc, as I'm sure you guessed from the context. You really must be new, if you think you can march into anyone's Talk page and "order" them not to revert your edits. You'll learn eventually. And by the way, this is the <b>English language Wikipedia</b>, you may not use foreign language websites as sources. I will start a Talk section regarding this revert in the article Talk page, so that all editors can help resolve the dispute.

<dd>I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I didn't want you to "spare" my edits. My suggestion was more general - I suggested you won't do those "reverts" at all, or at least not without proper explanation, and a way to resolve the problem. The grammar is "tenuous" because English is to be so much hard for I, and I guessed that tenuous is better than a far more "aggressive" version of the same things, esspecially considering that less "tenuous" phrasing would be surely POV(and the fact that I needed to translate it on my own)...<br />
Indeed, you don't need to go to my talk page and request for sources. You could have done it on the article's talk page(as you HAVE done, finally...). It's a shame you didn't in the first place. It would have saved some space on your talk page...&#160;:)<br />
Finally, when the rest of the English wikipedia will base solely on English sources, so will I. That is not the case, and I feel no need to be special. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexKarpman_e676.html" title="User:AlexKarpman">conio.h</a> • <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexKarpman_e51a.html" title="User talk:AlexKarpman">talk</a> 12:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did give an explanation for my revert in my <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a>, shown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan&amp;diff=36754411&amp;oldid=36743636" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan&amp;diff=36754411&amp;oldid=36743636" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This follows Wikipedia policy about edit summaries; allow me to quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Even if short, an edit summary should strive to answer the question, "Why did you make this edit?"</i></dd>
<dd><i>"Proper use of edit summaries is critical to resolving <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">content disputes</a>. Edit summaries should accurately and succinctly summarize the nature of the edit, especially if it could be controversial. If the edit involves <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">reverting previous changes</a>, it should be marked as a revert ("rv") in the edit summary. Avoid using edit summaries to carry on debates or negotiation over the content or to express opinions of the other users involved. Instead, place such comments, if required on the talk page. This keeps discussions and debates away from the article page itself."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As you know, this was my first revert, and I filled out the edit summary succinctly. Right after your rather agitated objection, I started a Talk section, also in line with policy. Please see the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> about foreign-language sources in the English-language Wikipedia. I'm afraid that your reasoning cannot be used to utilize foreign-language sources in this manner. We cannot continue to violate policy simply because "others are doing it." Actually, citing foreign-language sources with no translation in the English-language Wikipedia is not common, and when it happens and the edit in question is contentious, it is not allowed to stand. If you come across any violations feel free to revert and require an English source, if you find the edit in question to be contentious. However, we are all obligated to follow the policy. As for the grammar content, I'm sorry that it is very hard for you. That is a difficulty inherent in attempting to edit an encyclopedia not in one's own native tongue. Nevertheless, other editors will be glad to correct your grammar etc, as long as we can have access to the source <b>in English</b>, so that we have the original text to compare against. If this was not a contested-information edit, we would not need a source, we could simply correct the grammar on-the-fly, as it were. Since it is contested, a verifiable source in English is essential. I will continue to participate in the article talk discussion regarding the actual disputed information. Please let us continue any discussion there.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 00:55, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Everything about the dispute I'll write there, but here's something you should think about:
<hr />
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_revert_a_page_to_an_earlier_version_2f85.html#Explain_reverts" title="Wikipedia:How to revert a page to an earlier version"><b>Explain reverts</b></a></dd>
<dd>Being reverted can feel a bit like a slap in the face—"I worked hard on those edits, and someone just rolled it all back". However, sometimes a revert is the best response to a less-than-great edit, so we can't just stop reverting. What's important is to let people know <i>why</i> you reverted. This helps the reverted person because they can remake their edit, but fixing whatever problem it is that you've identified.</dd>
<dd>Explaining reverts also helps other people. For example, it lets people know whether they need to even view the reverted version (in the case of, eg, "rv page blanking"). Because of the lack of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralanguage.html" title="Paralanguage">paralanguage</a> online, if you don't explain things clearly people will probably assume all kinds of nasty things, and that's one of the possible causes for <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit wars</a>.</dd>
<dd>If your reasons for reverting are too complex to explain in the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a>, drop a note on the Talk page. A nice thing to do is to drop the note on the Talk page <i>first</i>, and <i>then</i> revert, rather than the other way round. Sometimes the other person will agree with you and revert for you before you have a chance. Conversely, if someone reverts your change without apparent explanation, you may wish to wait a few minutes to see if they explain their actions on the article's talk page or your user talk page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>
<hr />
It's better to first talk - then revert. If you at first revert, it's still good to talk. You may revert without talking at all, but that just sucks. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexKarpman_e676.html" title="User:AlexKarpman">conio.h</a> • <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexKarpman_e51a.html" title="User talk:AlexKarpman">talk</a> 03:07, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's entirely unnecessary to quote policy to me that you know I have already clearly followed. I provided a clear explanation in my first revert edit summary, and when you objected, I immediately started a Talk discussion.

<p>If you're going to go round changing era names on spurious grounds, at least get it right! Change [[10 BC]] to [[10 BCE]] not [[10]] BCE which mistakenly links to a date twenty years later. And CE goes after the date, not before like AD, so AD [[44]] must be changed to [[44]] CE. But really, it would be better not to edit-war over this. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 11:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They are not spurious grounds. I began to change "Anno Domini" to "Common Era" etc when I noticed it was being done routinely on all sorts of articles, and I agreed with the reasoning. "In the Year of our Lord" and "Before Christ" are overtly Christian and religious and "Common Era" designations are neutral. Moreover, I find your post here on my Talk page to be straange. Why couldn't you say your peace in the actual <a href="../../../a/g/r/Talk%7EAgrippa_I_55b3.html#Anno_Domini_vs._Common_Era" title="Talk:Agrippa I">article Talk section</a> I started deliberately to discuss this matter? What's more, why did you not explain your reason for reverting in the first place? As for changing <i><a href="../../../1/0/_/10_BC_21e5.html" title="10 BC">10 BC</a> to <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_BCE_474b.html" title="10 BCE">10 BCE</a> not <a href="../../../1/0/_/10.html" title="10">10</a> BCE</i> that is a typo you could have fixed yourself, without reverting. Since you did not, I will fix it myself. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 16:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, I prefer to respond to questions and comments placed on my talk page <i>on</i> my Talk page, because it can get extremely confusing and hard to follow when questions and answers and posts and retorts are conducted on two different pages. The short answer is to your question is no. What you are looking for here, I gather, is <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration</a>, and you've jumped the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_Resolution_7799.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute Resolution">Dispute Resolution</a> gun, as it were. There are other steps before that. You don't just pick an admin and ask them to "rule" on the matter. Some useful procedure is to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Request a comment</a> and ask for <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">mediation</a>. Also, despite your repeated mistaken interpretation of the 3RR, no policy violations have taken place, and this remains a <b>content dispute</b>, I'm not sure how admins can be drawn into this. However, they may certainly shed light on the disagreement, and add their opinion, as can any other editor. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 09:56, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I did not want to make anything formal. My wish was to informally have a neutral party help to resolve the issue before anything even more unpleasent takes place. Due to the fact that neither of us are likely to give in to the other, and already it seems the conflict has been reduced to an edit war it seems that my idea is quite rational at this point.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 20:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having third parties join a content dispute is nothing new on Wikipedia.

<p>I finally got off my rear end and did some research about Wikiquotes. Since WikiQuotes is part of WikiMedia, it is not usually listed as a URL under "External Links." To link to Wikiquotes, a hyper-linked "Wikiquote" graphic is placed somewhere in the article body itself. I just put it in. I'm glad you decided to stop censoring Findley's remarks, by the way. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 10:14, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you didn't notice, I was trying to adobt a concilitory attitude, and I was hoping you would as well, as such I find that last comment incredibly rude and disrespectful, It is obvious I never saw it as "censoring" I felt it didn't belong there and I still don't.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 10:36, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was censorship from first to last. If I had wanted to be difficult I would not have helped with the Wikiquote process. You have a flare for hyperbole, and have thrown around accusations like "rude and disrespectful" more than once, while at the same time telling me to "get over it", if I recall correctly. Also, I have made my own gestures of friendliness, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dissident_Voice&amp;diff=42651814&amp;oldid=42611711" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dissident_Voice&amp;diff=42651814&amp;oldid=42611711" rel="nofollow">defending you</a> from personal attacks in other articles during the height of our disagreement.

<p>You performed more blind reverts than I did. I merely restored the contiguity of my own posts. If you continue to do this despite my objections, it is vandalism and the 3RR does not apply.

<p>Vandalism is not "anything I don't like". But is <i>is</i> interfering with another editor's post style despite his/her objection.

<p>Hi. Just a friendly notice that, against the consensus you and others had achieved earlier in the page, JayJG and company are intent on deleting the Carter quote from the page. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Talk%7EIsraeli_settlement_69c4.html#Carter_information" title="Talk:Israeli settlement">See talk</a>.

<dd>Why would you regard ignoring consensus as a "shame" when it was precisely what you were doing with the Stone comment, and may have been the reason the Carter material was removed, given that it was there only as a consession to you? Your intransigence has caused this situation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:58, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are absolutely wrong. You perceive the situations the same, do you? When Jayjg first tried to remove the Carter comments he was opposed in Talk where absolutely no one supported him. See <a href="../../../i/s/r/Talk%7EIsraeli_settlement_69c4.html#President_Carter.27s_comments" title="Talk:Israeli settlement">Talk:Israeli settlement#President Carter's comments</a>. He made one post, was opposed by 3 editors, then abandoned his edit and withdrew without further comment. THAT is consensus at work. With Julius Stone, there has been a constant discussion where several editors have opposed you side of the argument without interruption. Moreover as I have pointed out repeatedly to you, you and Jayjg have been particularly negligent in replying to pertinent threads as the record clearly shows. There has been intransigence in this disagreement, but you'll find that pinning it on the one editor who has been consistent in discussion, whereas other have either shifted their emphasis or failed to answer other editors entirely, will not stand up.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 16:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're going too far. These things boil down to good editing, which is a hard thing to sum up, but one of the things it precludes is the kind of sneaky, side-of-the-mouth remark you're insisting be inserted. In the whole time you've been editing, I've never seen you make a pro-Israel edit, Aladdin. Perhaps you have and I've missed them, but if so, could you point some out to me? I make edits all the time that I disagree with, but you come at Wikipedia from one position only so far as I can see, and it's very tiresome, particularly when you engage in this kind of disruption, going so far as to insist that all your talk page comments be answered in precisely the format you choose, while picking and choosing which points you'll address and skirting round the others. If you were serious when you said you regarded me as a good Wikipedian, then please take the implication of that seriously too, which is that someone you see as a good Wikipedian is telling you there's a problem with your style of editing and interaction. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:55, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly hope that I have never made a pro-anything edit, Israeli or otherwise. But if you want an example where I made a pro-<i>neutrality</i> edit which happened to coincidentally favor an Israeli position, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Miller_%28filmmaker%29&amp;diff=12336826&amp;oldid=11944278" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Miller_%28filmmaker%29&amp;diff=12336826&amp;oldid=11944278" rel="nofollow">this</a> is where I edited to remove a claim stated as fact that a documentary proves an anti-Israeli position regarding the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Miller_%28filmmaker%29_4950.html" title="James Miller (filmmaker)">James Miller (filmmaker)</a> incident. When I uploaded the picture of the Hamas bus blast you and I both defended when its copyright status was questioned, that was because I oppose terrorism against civilians, and blowing up kids at bus stops, and I wanted to show evidence and affects of terrorism. I did not upload the image because it is "pro-Israeli" or "anti-Hamas", but because it is a neutral pictorial record of terrorism against civilians.</dd>
<dd>You must stop being holier than thou and start admitting that this is a serious disagreement. "Disruption" is not failing to agree with <i>you</i>, Slim! Disruption is constant reversion without explanation and without a proven record of attempting to work it out. You have seen time and again how I have been supported by several other editors. You have snidely dismissed my voluntary 1 revert a day limit while you continue to avail yourself of as many as you can get away with (along with your supporters). Still, Slim, I will not label you disruptive. I will pay you the compliment of reverting on the merits of the arguments you believe in, despite the fact that I have had a lot of trouble trying to get you to reply to my discussion posts. I know, you will claim that there is nothing new and you don't want to repeat yourself. I would invite all who wonder to examine the discussion for themselves, and see where I pleaded with you to answer specific threads, and judge for themselves if they were worth answering or merely "repetitive".--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 16:34, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was not present on Wikipedia when you made your comments here. I think you must know that I would not knowingly expose myself to blockage and 3RR criticism, and was in fact taking great care to limit my reverting as we had a serious disagreement with that article. I was under the strong impression that the 3RR did not apply to separate edits, only to repeatedly reverting the same contested edit. Obviously I have been very wrong, but I have reread the policy, and it could stand to be made more clear in this respect. I will make this suggestion at the policy page discussion soon. I'm sorry you found it necessary to take such pains to have me blocked. Seldom have I been so wrong in my estimation and respect for an ideological adversary.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:35, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can't expect to engage in the reverting you've been doing and for there to be no consequences. This one-block-a-day thing is disruptive, and five reverts in two hours goes way too far. The policy page is clear (emphasis added): "Do not revert any single page <b>in whole or in part</b> more than three times in 24 hours," and "[r]everting, in this context, applies to <b>undoing the actions of another editor in whole or part</b>, not necessarily taking a previous version from history and editing that." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:46, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin, for some reason I can't fathom, you seem to place yourself me in some sort of higher ethereal plane untinctured by us mortals. Disruptive? You have been reverting <i>more</i> than I have been for the duration of these disagreements that first emerged at the end of March. What's more, more than one editor has asked you to stop reverting without contributing to Talk, and to stop citing non-existant talk posts in your revert edit summaries. I know you disagree with me, but I have always been extremely faithful to the discussion process, and often disappointed in your lack of faith in the same. When I limited myself to the one revert per day, you scoffed and reverted more than once when my edit was reverted back by supporting editors. I accept consequences for my mistake with the 3RR, and I know <i>you</i> know I made this <b>honest</b> mistake in good faith and not willfully. The policy is technically complete, but I hope you will not oppose that, to prevent mistakes like mine, some language be added to make clear that unrelated edits are not exempt. In any case if you <i>do</i> want to oppose it, perhaps you will wait until I make the suggestion ere long.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 05:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want to make clear my agreement that the 5 reverts in 2 hours <i>did</i> go too far, regardless of the three distinct threads, as it was still a violation. I also want to repeat my unequivocal apology, offered in my reply to your post to have me blocked on the Administrators' Noticeboard, as far as this lapse on my part is concerned. It does not affect my effort to have the policy made a little clearer, but I did not want that effort to be in any way misconstrued as an effort on my part to pretend that I was not wrong in this instance.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 05:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you have fixed a couple of copyright issues on some pictures. Note that images liscensed for non-commerical use (as those Babri mosque related pictures are) cannot be used on Wikipedia without a fair-use rationale. They are eligible for speedy deletion, but I'll hold off to give you an oppurtunity to make a fair use assertion.

<dd>Please explain further. I contacted the website and they gave permission, as detailed in the upload notes. Are you saying that the copyright tag policy has been revised, or that it was an incorrect tag all along? I never claimed fair use, as the website and copyright holder explicitly granted permission. Is an attribution tag more applicable?--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:50, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How cheap of you. I made no change to the NOR policy, as 16 experienced editors on the page have confirmed.

<dd>Your recollection leaves much to be desired. As you may have noticed, some editors clearly perceive a change. Also, you are in no position to talk about "cheap". I don't even recognize you anymore. All I see is anger an incivility and a refusal even to follow through with good-faith discussion. You have taken a content dispute and turned it into a personal contest of wills and carried it into the sacrosanct arena of policy pages. You are even going so far as to Stalk me to revert my edits on Talk pages with which you have no connection whatsoever.

<dd>Aladdin, I have bent over backwards to show good faith to you and have helped you find compromises with other editors even when I agreed with them and disagreed with you. All I've seen from you in return is intransigence; always pushing one POV and one POV only; engaging in disruptive slow reverts until you get your own way, sometimes over many weeks; showing no understanding at all of content policies; insisting that a photograph that is <i>clearly</i> insulting to the subject because it shows her grimacing <i>must</i> be used because you took it; wikilawyering with several admins over 3RR when you got blocked; and now inserting yourself into a discussion on NOR started by trolls, simply because I disagree with you in another area. I'd prefer not to engage with you anymore, so this is my last comment. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:26, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"You have taken a content dispute and turned it into a personal contest of wills and carried it into the sacrosanct arena of policy pages." DO NOT repeat that personal attack again. There is no truth in it whatsoever. I've been editing the NOR page for over a year and helped to write the draft. There has been <i>no change</i> to it. I'm in a position to judge that and you are not, because it's a policy you don't even understand. If you think I'd allow a content dispute with you to affect my editing of a policy page, you're sadly overestimating your own importance. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:29, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Intransigence. Bending over backwards. Good faith. Personal attacks (Who was it that called the other "cheap"?). All so egregiously misapplied and hypocritical. Disruptive slow reverts? As opposed to non-disruptive 3 times a day reverts? Voluntarily limiting oneself to one revert a day is a recommended cooling-down measure. I don't care how much you scoff at it or pretend that somehow <i>I</i> am intransigent while you, with your lackluster (at best) participation in Talk, are the patient one. Showing no understanding at all of content policies? Can you get any <i>more</i> condescending? Have you not seen how even editors who did not support the inclusion of some material openly disagreed with you as to OR and well-poisoning? Can you finally not see that there is a serious content disagreement that just because someone does not come round to your perspective, it is not deliberate intransigence or <i>failure to understand?</i> I don't need to pick through all your Talk archives to see how many editors have criticized you and complained about you, but I'm betting its a sight more plentiful then the comments you seem to think support you over me. Fantastically, you cite the <a href="../../../a/s/r/Asra_Q._Nomani_5a99.html" title="Asra Q. Nomani">Asra Q. Nomani</a> picture incident as an example of <i>my</i> intransigence! I explicitly aquieced to other editors' consensus that the picture be withdrawn, and <a href="../../../a/s/r/Talk%7EAsra_Q._Nomani_0f1a.html#Ridiculous_picture" title="Talk:Asra Q. Nomani">said</a> (bold emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>I do understand what you're saying</b>. I was thrown for a loop with that absurd and fabricated attack on the source of my photograph; and <b>mistakenly</b> grouped the other objections in the same light. I never personally saw anything like a grimace in the picture. I suppose this is because in my mind's eye I remember the pleasant speech she gave. It's just an unfortunate timing of the shutter in other people's eyes, I suppose. I don't have any other pictures of her that will do, but like I said in the previous section, I will be making some enquiries. <b>I apologize</b> if anyone was offended by the picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> replied, "Well, you're right, the claim that your image source was unverifiable was absurd and outrageous, and the labelling of it as such even more so; I can well understand why it upset you." And this, you claim, is evidence of my intransigence! SlimVirgin, as ever, you will find that I am eager to fully admit my mistakes, apologize when I err, and concede publicly when I am convinced in rational discussion. Also, it's comical to see you post a new paragraph right after declaring that you "will not engage with me any more" and that the previous was your "last paragraph". Lastly, take your threats elsewhere. If you believe a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a> was made against you then report it, because it is outrageous that you should seek to intimidate me into something so wholly unreasonable as to refrain from the legitimate voicing of my concerns. You have as widely mistaken my character, by supposing me susceptible to such intimidation tactics, as I have mistaken yours before this content dispute opened my eyes.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 10:31, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I noticed on your user page that you have an interest in this conflict, so I was hoping you might be able to lend a helping hand. Myself and another contributor are having some disagreements over the timeline of the israeli-palestinian conflict, I strongly feel that many entries of this timeline display a clear bias and simply do not conform to a NPOV. If you have time here or there, maybe you could check it out, thanks.</p>

<dd>I just noticed your request, my time is very limited and it's worse when pathetic individuals and even some administrators reverse good stuff here, but what is your question, what do you want to know abotu Palestine and the conflict? I am a historian. Few questions at a time.

<p>Hey again,</p>
<p>I don't have any questions per se, however, I'm trying to get more involved in the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_b033.html" title="Timeline of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">timeline of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> page, as I feel that due to overwhelming edits by a few people, the "timeline" as a whole, exhibits systematic bias. Really what I'm looking for is a little help in trying to make the timeline conform better to a NPOV, if you have time or if you know of any other wikipedians who have an active interest in the history of this conflict and ensuring wikipedia's NPOV policy is maintained, it would be appreciated. I know this is a politically charged topic, so I'm hoping there are more people out there interested in helping out. But one user in particular I think, who spends a great deal of time editting the page, uses it to push his POV. Anyways, thanks for you limited time.</p>
