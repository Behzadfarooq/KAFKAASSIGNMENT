<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Pardew_81a8.html" title="Edit section: Playing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing career</span></h2>
<p>After several years combining a career in non-league football at <a href="../../../d/u/l/Dulwich_Hamlet_496b.html" title="Dulwich Hamlet">Dulwich Hamlet</a> with a full-time job as a <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glazier.html" title="Glazier">glazier</a> and a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabbie.html" title="Cabbie">cabbie</a>, Pardew signed for <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_F.C._accb.html" title="Crystal Palace F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> from <a href="../../../y/e/o/Yeovil_Town_F.C._29b9.html" title="Yeovil Town F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> for £7,500 in 1987. The highlight of his playing career came in 1990 when he helped <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_F.C._accb.html" title="Crystal Palace F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> reach the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> final, by scoring the winner against <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a> in a memorable semi-final at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Park%2C_England_f097.html" title="Villa Park, England">Villa Park</a>, a game that Palace won 4-3, just a year after helping them to promotion to the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_First_Division_6af3.html" title="Football League First Division">First Division</a> via the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Second_Division_82be.html" title="Football League Second Division">Second Division</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playoff.html#English_League_promotion_playoffs" title="Playoff">playoffs</a>. He later turned out for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Athletic_F.C._ce31.html" title="Charlton Athletic F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnet_F.C._112c.html" title="Barnet F.C.">Barnet</a>, where he acted as player/coach to manager <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Bullivant_1582.html" title="Terry Bullivant">Terry Bullivant</a>. That summer, Bullivant moved to <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_F.C._3883.html" title="Reading F.C.">Reading</a>, and took Pardew - who had returned to Dulwich Hamlet for a short stint as their centre half - with him as assistant.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Pardew_81a8.html" title="Edit section: Reading">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reading</span></h2>
<p>Pardew stayed as coach at Reading for the next two years, being promoted to manager of the club after a successful spell as caretaker in 1999. He turned the club around from relegation fighters to promotion candidates through players, such as <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Cureton_0a04.html" title="Jamie Cureton">Jamie Cureton</a>, and his régime to increase the fitness of the squad. Pardew also coined his motto "Tenacity, Spirit and Flair" to give his side a psychological edge. This resulted in a 3-2 Division Two playoff final defeat to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walsall_F.C._bc03.html" title="Walsall F.C.">Walsall</a> at the end of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000-01_in_English_football_da9d.html" title="2000-01 in English football">2000-01</a> season, but was redeemed the next season by achieving automatic promotion to Division One. Pardrew's first season in the higher division was outstanding, as the club finished 4th and lost in the play-offs once again, this time to <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolves</a>. Pardew was on the map as one of the game's best up and coming young managers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Pardew_81a8.html" title="Edit section: West Ham United">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">West Ham United</span></h2>
<p>Early into the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003-04_in_English_football_a95e.html" title="2003-04 in English football">2003-04</a> season, with Reading 2nd in the table, Pardew's relationship with the club turned sour when he reneged on a recently signed contract and accepted the manager's job at West Ham. Pardew had a clause in his contract that allowed him to accept offers from clubs in a higher league, but West Ham were in the same league as Reading at the time. As this was in breach of contract, Reading initially refused to let Pardew leave the club and attempted to obtain an <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injunction.html" title="Injunction">injunction</a> to prevent him from being employed by a competing club. However, Pardew made it clear that he wanted to leave Reading to manage West Ham. In a deal agreed just ahead of a court appearance on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">18 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, it was agreed that he could take control of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_London%2C_England_5437.html" title="East London, England">East London</a> club, on the condition that he take one month <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardening_leave.html" title="Gardening leave">gardening leave</a>, that West Ham pay £380,000 in <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damages.html" title="Damages">compensation</a>, and that West Ham sign no Reading players or staff before the end of the 2003-04 season.</p>
<p>Outside London's High Court after the situation had been resolved Pardew responded <i>"I am pleased that common sense has prevailed and the matter has now been resolved. I would first like to thank Reading for the 4 fantastic years I have had there and i wish them all the very best for the future but this is an opportunity too good to turn down. Being a Londoner I'm well aware of the stature and the history and tradition of the club and the need to play the style of football the supporters expect. I know how passionate they are about the club, they truly are the lifeblood and I can't wait to take over and continue the job in hand of getting this great club back into the Premiership where it belongs"</i><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Until his dismissal in December 2006, Pardew never brought a Reading player to West Ham. Pardew gained West Ham promotion to the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">Premiership</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004-05_in_English_football_093e.html" title="2004-05 in English football">2004-05</a>, and he guided the Hammers to a respectable start to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005-06_in_English_football_281f.html" title="2005-06 in English football">2005-06 season</a>. Pardew made headlines on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">10 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> when he criticised Arsenal manager <a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger_1f59.html" title="Arsène Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a> for not fielding any English players in the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Champions_League_a339.html" title="UEFA Champions League">UEFA Champions League</a>, a comment which Wenger responded to by calling Pardew <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a>. Pardew dismissed Wenger's claim by saying his wife is <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_people.html" title="Swedish people">Swedish</a>.</p>
<p>Pardew had the ability to add value to players who have been let go by others, strikers <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Zamora_3076.html" title="Bobby Zamora">Bobby Zamora</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Harewood_89ec.html" title="Marlon Harewood">Marlon Harewood</a> being but two.</p>
<p>Pardew's claim that West Ham Utd taught Everton a 'footballing lesson' after a game in the 2005/2006 season was astonshing but accurate. Jerry Emmett was said to be devastated by the news. Unfortunately, Pardew suffered the injury to Dean Ashton which many believe contributed to their demise more so than Pardew's managerial skills or lack of them.</p>
<p>Pardew's greatest achievements at West Ham include winning promotion to the Premiership in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004-05_in_English_football_093e.html" title="2004-05 in English football">2004-05</a> season and reaching the FA Cup final in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005-06_in_English_football_281f.html" title="2005-06 in English football">2005-06</a> season, beating four Premiership clubs on the way before losing to the-then European Champions Liverpool on penalties, after a thrilling 3-3 draw. He was also widely or maybe wildley tipped as the next <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> manager.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his reign at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham</a>, Pardew came under fire after seeing them through their worst run of defeats in over 70 years. Most supporters remained patient, but a small minority called for his dismissal as patience wore thin. Before kick-off and during West Ham's 2-1 win over <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C._07df.html" title="Blackburn Rovers F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_29.html" title="October 29">29 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> fans showed their support for Pardew by chanting "There's only one Alan Pardew". After the game, West Ham's first win in 9 games, Pardew said <i>"I'm not the most emotional of people but I was a little bit choked at the start, with the way they backed me, and I thank them for that."</i> On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">5 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, after West Ham's goal against <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a>, scored by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Harewood_89ec.html" title="Marlon Harewood">Marlon Harewood</a>, Alan Pardew's touchline celebrations led to a confrontation with Arsenal manager <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsene_Wenger_2ff5.html" title="Arsene Wenger">Arsene Wenger</a>. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, Pardew was cleared by the Football Associaton of a charge of improper conduct regarding this incident.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">11 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, following a 4-0 defeat away at <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C._f176.html" title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> the previous weekend, it was announced as a press conference that Alan Pardew had been sacked as West Ham United. The club statement read <i>" The chairman Mr <a href="../../../e/g/g/Eggert_Magn%C3%BAsson_c6fa.html" title="Eggert Magnússon">Eggert Magnússon</a> and the board have been concerned by the performances of recent weeks and feel that it is the right time to make a change in the best interests of the club."</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The news broke of Alan Pardew's appointment as struggling <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Reed_%28football_coach%29_5fcb.html" title="Les Reed (football coach)">Les Reed</a>'s successor at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Athletic_F.C._ce31.html" title="Charlton Athletic F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> at 19:27 on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_24.html" title="December 24">24 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Sports_News_3b98.html" title="Sky Sports News">Sky Sports News</a> digital television channel claimed Pardew had signed a three-and-a-half year deal at the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">Premiership</a>'s second-bottom side. <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Reed_%28football_coach%29_5fcb.html" title="Les Reed (football coach)">Les Reed</a>'s position as manager came under fire from Charlton's fans after an initially dubious appointment, as well as having to suffer a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Cup_66aa.html" title="Football League Cup">Carling Cup</a> quarter-final exit at the hands of <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wycombe_Wanderers_F.C._62f4.html" title="Wycombe Wanderers F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a> at home, and a Premiership defeat at <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_F.C._284c.html" title="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> the day before Pardew's appointment. He took over with Charlton in 19th place in the Premiership having played 19 games and earning just 12 points with a -20 goal difference, the lowest in the league. His reign began with a 2-2 home draw against <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulham_F.C._53e7.html" title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_27.html" title="December 27">27 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Charlton lead the game at 90 minutes when <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franck_Queudrue_e514.html" title="Franck Queudrue">Franck Queudrue</a>'s stoppage-time volley, following a dubious free-kick decision in which no Charlton players touched the ball or the player, denied Alan Pardew a winning start as Charlton's new boss. But Pardew enjoyed his first win with Charlton in the following match, after a dramatic 2-1 home victory over <a href="../../../a/s/t/Aston_Villa_F.C._7190.html" title="Aston Villa F.C.">Aston Villa</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">30 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Hughes_0f4d.html" title="Bryan Hughes">Bryan Hughes</a> scored the winning goal with a header in injury time.</p>
<p>However the win was followed by a run of unfavourable results including a 4-0 loss away to <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a> and defeats away to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham_Forest_F.C._cb2c.html" title="Nottingham Forest F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> and home to <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_F.C._284c.html" title="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> Hope here was high, and Darren Bent was not sold. All was not lost and the team followed these losses up with their first victory away from home in 15 months, against <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth_F.C._de65.html" title="Portsmouth F.C.">Portsmouth</a> at Fratton Park where <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amady_Faye_ad8c.html" title="Amady Faye">Amady Faye</a> scored his first goal in English Football, this game also marked new signing <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Thatcher_508b.html" title="Ben Thatcher">Ben Thatcher</a>'s return to Fratton Park where he had received a lengthy penalty for a reckless challenge on <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Mendes_cfd0.html" title="Pedro Mendes">Pedro Mendes</a>. The new signing stood up well to the taunts he received from the Pompey faithful and in doing so endeared himself to the Addicks. A game at <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C._f176.html" title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton</a>'s Reebok Stadium resulted in another point away from home thanks to a trademark <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talal_El_Karkouri_3373.html" title="Talal El Karkouri">Talal El Karkouri</a> free kick and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Athletic_F.C._ce31.html" title="Charlton Athletic F.C.">The Addicks</a> had kept in touch with the teams around them. The next two games <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_F.C._c6c0.html" title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a> at home and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> resulted in expected losses, but the performances against both boosted confidence further. The <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> game meant debuts for <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Song_87b7.html" title="Alex Song">Alex Song</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madjid_Bougherra_a10a.html" title="Madjid Bougherra">Madjid Bougherra</a> and <a href="../../../z/h/e/Zheng_Zhi_eebd.html" title="Zheng Zhi">Zheng Zhi</a>, all of whom impressed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Athletic_F.C._ce31.html" title="Charlton Athletic F.C.">Charlton</a> played their next league game at home to fellow strugglers <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham</a> in what was <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Curbishley_ef71.html" title="Alan Curbishley">Alan Curbishley</a>'s first return to his former club, and Alan Pardew steered <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Athletic_F.C._ce31.html" title="Charlton Athletic F.C.">Charlton</a> to a 4-0 thrashing over his former club. The West Ham faithful were heard chanting chanting " Theres only one Alan Pardew " and " To the door, Curbs! " for Pardew, obviously not agreeing with Pardew's sacking.</p>
