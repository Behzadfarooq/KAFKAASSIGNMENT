<p>Hi, Alan. After moving this article, I realized that I accidentally included a period at the end of it, and when I tried to move it to a new title without the period, I found that I couldn't, because WP kept saying that a page with that name already exists. Any help? Thanks. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 01:47, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>Maybe you've already seen it but I just came across an <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2MDcmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY5Mjk4MDMmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkz" class="external text" title="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2MDcmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY5Mjk4MDMmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkz" rel="nofollow">article</a> concerning the upcoming Teterboro election, this Tuesday. I don't know if you'd like to incorporate any of it into the wiki-article. I'd do it myself but I'd rather remain neutral on election items that directly relate to me. I figured that you might want to see it though, even if it's not used in the Teterboro entry. It gives a better idea of the larger population issue too, stating that, in 2002, 33 of the then 38 registered voters actually came out to vote. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnBWatt_fe6f.html" title="User:JohnBWatt">JohnBWatt</a> 19:20, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good catch with the typo. I'm so used to seeing people add an S to it, that I completely missed it this time around. As far as the population growth mention, I meant it more as a reference points for others that may question the population and not so much you. Thanks for the well wishes for Tuesday. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnBWatt_fe6f.html" title="User:JohnBWatt">JohnBWatt</a> 22:41, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The same person who updated <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Vale%2C_New_Jersey_c2fb.html" title="River Vale, New Jersey">River Vale, New Jersey</a> has added a Politics section to all of the Bergen County municipality articles. I agree that there needs to be asource for this information. But, even with a source, I question whether presidential election results from one year show a meaningful tilt in one direction or another. For example, registration statistics would add some more context. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I saw. I left a message on the user's talk page, see <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.44.149.97.html" title="User talk:68.44.149.97">User talk:68.44.149.97</a>. I agree, the politics sections as they stand are not very useful as they discuss one fact in isolation, but I think the section could be expanded to be useful. I would not object to those sections in the current form being removed. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 17:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I checked the Bergen County wwb site for statistics on registration, but no luck online. They do have printed reports I will pick up listing registration by municipality, listing party affiliation counts. Again, not perfect, but a politics section that read: "River Vale has 3,000 registered voters (as of April 2006), accounting for 37% of the 2000 Census population of 9,449. of registered voters, 1,200 (40%) are registered as Democrats, 900 (30%) are Republicans, 150 (5%) are registered to other parties and 750 (25%) are Unaffiliated or Independent. In the 2004 presidential elections..." This would give a more meaningful indication of political leanings by municipality. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, that sounds good. This would be more useful and encyclopedic data. If we could get aggregate data for the county page also, that would be good. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 18:32, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think that the statistics I provided, for the most part, are indicitive of the political leanings- i.e. the wealthier suburbs- Saddle River, Alpine, etc.- lean Republican, while the poorer suburbs lean Democrat, and there are some wealthy suburbs, such as Demarest and Ridgewood, that lean (slightly) Democrat, etc. <a href="../../../c/g/4/User%7ECg41386_6304.html" title="User:Cg41386">Cg41386</a></dd>

<dd>The section on voter registration looks good. Thanks for going to get the data, Alan. Thanks, CG, for giving the source for the 2004 election numbers. I've made some changes to that section on the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Vale_f091.html" title="River Vale">River Vale</a> article. If those changes look good to you guys, I'd like to use that form for the rest of the municipal articles. Comments? Further changes?

<dd>Thanks, but I've just noticed a problem with the 2004 election results. The numbers don't add up (literally). For example, if I sum the votes for each candidate for Allendale, I get 3538 votes, but the number of listed ballots cast is 3545. There were 7 ballots which are missing. Perhaps they didn't count absentee ballots or there was ballot spoilage (hanging chads!). You can see the same thing under the county totals, for a total of 1601 ballots not counted on this list. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 22:25, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you do me a favor and keep an eye on the DMHS page. People from random IP addresses keep adding POV and racist statements, the latest being</p>
<p>"However, students outside of Englewood who attend the Academies also feel discriminated against. Students from A@E usually get remarks such as "F*** you academies" from Dwight Morrow Students. Many also believe the two schools should remain separate because they earned the right to attend the academies (by applying) and A@E shouldn't be "just another regular public school."</p>
<p>I reverted it back to the old version. Earlier vandalism included:</p>

<p>The district is headquartered in the borough of Princeton, and serves both the borough and the township.

<p>Hi. Since the Web page referenced for the FY 2005 Amtrak boardings boardings also includes the FY 2004 statistics side-by-side, I'm thinking the reference to the page with just the 2004 stats is redundant. (And with the Clockers gone, the Amtrak boardings for FY 2006 will show a huge drop.) <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_schwartz_91c8.html" title="User:Bob schwartz">Bob schwartz</a> 18:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alan, I was just wondering why you changed (for only some stations) links from (NJT station) to just "Station". If you look, for example, on the <a href="../../../r/a/r/Raritan_Valley_Line_d84c.html" title="Raritan Valley Line">Raritan Valley Line</a>, all the stations have the "(NJT station)" suffix on them.

<dd>Well, look at this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gladstone_Branch&amp;curid=1280450&amp;diff=58870729&amp;oldid=58869634" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gladstone_Branch&amp;curid=1280450&amp;diff=58870729&amp;oldid=58869634" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Look at lines 50 &amp; 70 in the diff - you did the reverse of what you wanted to&#160;:)! Also, for Mountain Station, I say we keep the "station" part in the link title (not in the article title), because while the other stations are town names, the word "mountain" by itself seems sort of strange. Let me know. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELensovet_4866.html" title="User:Lensovet">lensovet</a> 02:32, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Alan, just wanted to give you a heads-up, I've made a new template for NJT rail routes.

A particular editor has done nothing but spam links to veotag across many articles, leading me to believe he's affiliated with the site and his sole purpose here is to promote the site. Either way, he's violating <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> by adding the same link across many articles.</p>
<p>However, if you feel that the one particular link you mention is worthy of addition, feel free to re-add it. My issue is only with spammed links. If an impartial editor later decides the link is worthwhile, it's no longer spam as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>My only suggestion would be to mention on the article's talk page a brief explanation for your re-adding it, so future editors will see a valid reason for leaving the link in place.

<p>I think you were unlucky to have this deleted. It's certainly a close call whether this is encyclopedic or not, it's was clearly verifiable. I suspect that if you keep up the good work on articles about New Jersey cemeteries, then the time will come when the lists become more obviously worth keeping. I've been very imperssed with the New Jersey cemetery articles - and indeed with the New Jersey wikiproject in general. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 21:06, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lists get a whole bad time in general. Some people have the rather bizarre view that if not every single member of a list is notable, the list should be deleted. In fact, the completeness element of lists is one of the best things - red links (or no links for obviously non-notable entries) provide context and also the opportunity to make new articles! I actually think that lists are so different from most articles in terms of content, and so many people are confused by <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> (lists vs categories etc), that there should be an entirely distinct "Lists for deletion" page. After all, featured lists and featured articles are dealt with differently, I don't see why they shouldn't be dealt with differently at the other end! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 02:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
