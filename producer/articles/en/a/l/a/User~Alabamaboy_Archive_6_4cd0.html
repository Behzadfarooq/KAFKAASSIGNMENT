<p>On Friday, you deleted my article on Shermco Industries. This article met the requirements of being noteworthy, as it has been the subject of several third party news articles. In the article, I listed the links to verify this.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it you would please clarify why you deleted this when it meets the criteria.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<dd>Per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, Shermco Industries is not notable. There are barely 800 Google hits for "Shermco Industries" which indicates the lack of notability. In addition, several of the "news" links you provided were to sources (Occupational Hazzards magazine, Electrical Wholesaling Magazine) that merely mentioned Shermco in the author's byline, while two other links were reprints of company press releases. There was only one true news article about the company and that was a short blurb in the Dallas Business Journal. I'm afraid at this time the company is not notable.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 16:22, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited this article and redid it in my own words even though I am the one who wrote the original article that is on our webpage. It is no longer the same, though there may be a sentence that remains the same. This article is new and verifiable through the cited material. It is also not copywritten as it doesn't appear the same on our webpage. I am not trying to be difficult but what more can I do to take care of this?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks for your help, but even with the rewrite the article was deleted. I made it noteworthy and cited sources. I would like it undeleted. This woman is a martial arts pioneer and one of the highest ranking women in Karate in the world. What more do I need to do? I was unable to find the deletion in the deletion log. I have contacted Zoe as well, since that is the editor who deleted the article. I would like, if you could, to either help me by giving me feedback on what I need to do to get this article recreated. There are many other people who are somewhat notable in Shuri-ryu Karate that are still in Wikipedia. It seems that the head of the system should be there too. Thanks for any help that you can provide. Lesshadow</p>

<p>I just want to let you know how much I appreciate your edit to medical malpractice. I disagree with the motivations and arguments of 'tort reformers'. However, your NPOV inclusion of criticism of med mal cases is the first truly NPOV discussion of this I have yet seen on WIkipedia. The number of rants I have seen on WIkipedia against lawyers and tort law has turned my stomach. It's refreshing to see a criticism that is actually balanced.jawesq 23:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Shakespeare article seriously misrepresents the facts. Please read the Shakespeare Authorship article and you will see why. If you're going to moderate the article then I recommend you read The Shakespeare Puzzle because some of the article's assumptions are not correct. Having read it this book, I can vouch that it is an investigation executed with rigor and depth. <b>QBrute</b></p>

<dd>And you shouldn't vandalize pages (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Shakespeare&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73275568" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Shakespeare&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73275568" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). If you can gain consensus for your changes on the Shakespeare talk page, then more power to you. But you must gain consensus for such controversial changes before making them.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 20:19, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, maybe I was naughty adding my message to the Shakespeare article. But I am thinking that you only believe it is controversial because you have not investigated widely enough on this issue, probably confining yourself to the oft-repeated feel-good fairytale that Mr Shakspere did it all, propagated by scholars who have no scientific/theoretical training. Wait though ... Marlowe was murdered, Oxford died in 1604, and Bacon was a dry-styled Lord Chancellor surrounded by hidden ciphers that spiritualists claim to have found. So who does that leave? Shakspere of course! ... Rewind. The books by Cockburn, N., The Bacon Shakespeare Question (1998) and Clarke, Barry R., The Shakespeare Puzzle (2006) have changed the Bacon theory to a sane and rigorous argument. Ban me if you like, but first read one or both of these if you're really interested in having an authority over Shakespeare authorship. Then I shall look forward to debating these issues with you in the Talk section! Oh, and as an olive branch, I'll give you a link to a FREE download I found of the latter book <a href="http://barryispuzzled.com/zshakespeare" class="external autonumber" title="http://barryispuzzled.com/zshakespeare" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><b>QBrute</b>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In cases such as this, Wikipedia tries to represent the general historical concensus, which is that Shakespeare was real and wrote all the stuff attributed to him. In cases where there's significant dispute, such as with Shakespeare, the appropriate course of action is to point out the dispute on the page, and, if the dispute is notable in and of itself, to create a page about the dispute itself and link to it. Both of these things have been done in the case of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. Surely you understand why Wikipedia cannot advertise minority viewpoints as the truth - it would soon turn into a repository of conspiracy theories and lose all credibility.

<p>In looking into the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies</a>, I see the following: "People who satisfy at least one of the items below generally merit their own Wikipedia articles . . .: &lt;&gt; Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." Rob Arnott serves as editor of the Financial Analysts Journal and has received five Graham and Dodd Awards for excellence in financial writing. In addition, he has received two Bernstein-Fabozzi/Jacobs-Levy Awards and a William F. Sharpe Indexing Achievement Award in 2005. Also, under the Alternative tests section, I feel he passes the professor test, having published over 70 articles. And regarding the Google Test, he generates numerous hits. Lastly, he is already mentioned within Wikipedia itself! Please see <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market_index.html" title="Stock market index">Stock_market_index</a>.</p>

<p>The computers at school all share a common IP address, so when I found a message saying that I should refrain from vandalizing or be blocked, I found it a slight bit unfair. It's not my fault if someone else at school vandalizes, and the idea of blocking the entire school from using Wikipedia just because of one idiot whose mistakes are fixed in a matter of clicks doesn't sit well with the legitimate users here.

Lyon is notable due to his involvement in a new form of legal reporting - the usage of the web to distribute actual legal documents and additional analysis as legal documents are filed in notable legal actions. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a12.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion">Speedy deletion</a> is only applicable in instances where there is no plausible assertion of notability.</p>

<dd>Actually, Mark Lyon has "no plausible assertion of notability" (although the definition of notability at Wikipedia is slightly different. Lyon is a law student. He is not notable. Just because another article links to Lyon isn't proof of notability.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 15:29, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't asserting his notability because of the linking of a single article to him (because I am the one who put the link there) but because of his methods of presenting information about the legal aspects surrounding the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Sony_CD_copy_protection_scandal_92c1.html" title="2005 Sony CD copy protection scandal">2005 Sony CD copy protection scandal</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flip_This_House_bc63.html" title="Flip This House">Flip This House</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7EServand_ec57.html" title="User:Servand">Servand</a> 15:36, 7 September 2006 (UTC) I think the use of speedy deletion was inappropriate in this instance, proposing it for deletion would have allowed the opportunity for further editing and consideration. As it stands, since you've speedy deleted it, I can't recover the content that I researched and posted earlier today. Your blanket assertion that a law student cannot be notable is not consistent with logic or reason. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7EServand_ec57.html" title="User:Servand">Servand</a> 15:41, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response (like in 2 minutes), very efficient!</p>
<p>I hope you havent deleted my article. it was written in my own words and not taken from elsewhere. I have permission to use the pictures used in the article.</p>
<p>As for the re-directs (I am new and learning!) but I did that as when I searched for my article it couldn't be found, unless I typed in the EXACT title, including capitals, meaning it would never be found.</p>
<p>I hope my article hasn't been completley deleted as it took a while to create, and does not violate any rules/laws. I have been delighted at finding many old games such as this on your website, and think this is worthy of being on as well. It is a non-profit making group of Brisca stock car fans.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Threat of libel?</span></h2>
<p>Ok, I'm going to be straight with you. I think you are over-reading my comment. The Singing Badger said "Incidentally I notice that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brain-Busters-Mind-Stretching-Pu-Mind-Stretching-Puzzles-Math-Logic/dp/0486427552/sr=1-2/qid=1157899363/ref=sr_1_2/202-8262031-2863828?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brain-Busters-Mind-Stretching-Pu-Mind-Stretching-Puzzles-Math-Logic/dp/0486427552/sr=1-2/qid=1157899363/ref=sr_1_2/202-8262031-2863828?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">you have written a 5-star review of your own book on Amazon</a>, and yet you claim you're not into self-promotion!" which is a libellous comment because it is not true and he is broadcasting that my book is being falsely commended. I haven't found a warning from you to him on his Talk page. I replied "I have to respond to this libel." and my response was "Reading the review carefully, it is by Angela Newing of The Daily Telegraph, she submitted it to me, I uploaded it for her." This is not a threat of libel action but a statement that it is a libellous comment. Obviously, I wanted to avoid bad feeling so changed it. Perhaps the US is far more obsessed with litigation than we are in the UK. We tend to avoid it. Sorry, but I don't trust you, and I can cite several examples why including deleting my edits twice without explanation, adding a deletion tag to my 'vanity' article (when there is a much better case for deletion for one or two others in the Puzzle Designers section), and now suggesting that I should make amends for The Singing Badger's damaging public accusation. "I know you think I'm trying to gang up on you but I honestly am not trying to." To me, it's what people do not what they say.
