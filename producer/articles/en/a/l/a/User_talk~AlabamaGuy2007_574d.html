<p>You must have gone to Decatur High.&#160;;-) I went to Austin, and we always said just the opposite — that the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Decatur_Daily_a755.html" title="The Decatur Daily">Daily</a></i> was biased towards Decatur High. That said, I'm not sure it's really appropriate to mention that in the <i>Daily'</i>s article. I do admit it's possible that this has become a common view and saying since I graduated (in 1998); though as a lifelong reader of the <i>Daily</i>, I haven't noticed any change, and still see the opposite bias. I guess we see what we want to see.&#160;:-p —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 02:20, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Haha, actually I still go to Decatur, but, hmm, I've never heard of the <i>Decatur Daily</i> being biased towards Decatur High. I guess it just seems that the paper is bias towards Austin cause it gave one paragraph to our marching band, and 6 to Austin's.

<dd>Well, that's because we're <em>better</em>.&#160;;-p Are you a band person, too? Band bias was always something I was sensitive to, also. It seems like in athletics, the <i>Daily</i> favors whatever school is doing better in that particular year (which was almost always Decatur when I was in school), but band is so much more subjective. I remember one time being upset that the Decatur band got a full-page spread for its state contest superiors, without even any mention of ours. I was reading your <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decatur_High_School_%28Alabama%29_a4e1.html" title="Decatur High School (Alabama)">Decatur High</a> page today, and got a little indignant at first at the claim about the band having the state record for superiors. We were always told <em>we</em> had the state record. Then I read it more carefully, and checked my facts, and you're right. Decatur has the record for <em>cumulative</em> state superiors (54 total, I think), but Austin has the record for <em>consecutive</em> superiors (40 last year). And you're correct that Decatur has the record for consecutive district superiors. I was in band at Austin with Robbie Stout, BTW. And I actually worked at the <i>Daily</i> for a year, and can say with confidence that most of the apparent bias has more to do with who calls the reporters to be interviewed than with any prejudice on their part. They don't know things unless people tell them, and they don't go out of their way to interview people unless it's something really big. Most publicity has to be drummed up, and I guess the Austin band must just have a good publicist right now. BTW, I really appreciate all of the hard work you've put into articles about the North Alabama area. Keep up the good work. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 05:58, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you not think you might have discussed your recent move of Birmingham to Birmingham, England before going ahead? Most people in the world think of Birmingham in the UK when "Birmingham" is mentioned, not "Birmingham, Alabama".

<p>Hi, I was just wondering what your opinion on <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> being part of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">South</a> is.

If we can get the opinions of people from the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_South_fdf7.html" title="Deep South">Deep South</a> about Texas, it would help.

<dd>I understand why you ask that. I believe you are asking because of the talk page on the Decatur page. I said that <i>people in Alabama</i> do not consider most (land area) of Texas as Southern. I mean by that, pretty much everything west of Austin, and Abilene. And everything north of Abilene. If there is anything else that I might have said that needs more clarification, please just say so.&#160;:~) I'd be happy to help. The opinions I have just expressed are pretty much what everyone else in the Decatur area thinks, so, that's what goes on the web pages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or, if that's not what you were talken about here's a an explanation. I don't know much about population distibution of Texas but, I'd say that what's west and north of those cities (Austin, and Abilene) is pretty much the remaining 12%. I do consider parts of Texas southern, I have family in FW. I consider San Antonio kinda western, but also kinda southern, it's hard to say. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaGuy2007_e71a.html" title="User:AlabamaGuy2007">AlaGuy</a> 04:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't referring to the talk on the Decatur page, but thanks for your help. Fort Worth is a great town...I'd say one of the most Southern in the state. Houston is very Southern indeed. As for Dallas...it's a bit Southern, but more of a modern city. You're right, most of the Texan population is concentrated in the areas Alabamians consider to be Southern.
