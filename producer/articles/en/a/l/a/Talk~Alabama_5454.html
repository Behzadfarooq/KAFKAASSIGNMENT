<p>I'm adding about 1/5th the info from the P.G. encyclopedia's entry on Alabama; the rest (finances, agriculture, population, etc.) is horribly dated and I think it would probably be easier simply to write a new entry on the topics people want to know about than to try to update the old information. I am, however, including the "history" and "geography" sections, as the history can simply be extended and the boundaries of the state have not (to my admittedly imperfect knowledge) changed in the last 100 years. --KQ <small>—The preceding comment was added on 25 February 2002 or earlier.</small></p>
<hr />
<p>Why two tables? What's wrong with just having one? Also, "The Heart of Dixie" doesn't tell us anything. Is it the state motto? If so, should it be labeled as such? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> <small>—The preceding comment was added on 00:05, 9 February 2003</small></p>
<hr />
<p>OK, I added a brief footnote to the phrase "The Heart of Dixie" explaining it. If anyone wants to expand on it, please do. I'm not sure 100% of the background, but the law was passed in the 1950s I believe, and until a few years ago the phrase was quite prominent. However, the governor at that time (Don Siegelman) wanted to downplay the supposed "offensive" nature of the phrase, but couldn't remove it because he couldn't get the law changed (the population wanted to keep it), and when new license plates were issued the phrase was shrunk dramatically to fit in an area approximately the size of a quarter. This caused a lot of controversy in the state. -- dave <small>—The preceding comment was added by IP 131.44.121.252 on 13:22, 28 June 2004</small></p>

<p>I fixed the sports team section. The steeldogs are not a baseball team&#160;:) I also added Huntsville's af2 team. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.26.152.129 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.26.152.129_9de4.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.26.152.129">contribs</a>) 138.26.152.129.</small></p>

<p>The square milage area of Alabama in the sidebar on the right is incorrect, but I'm not sure how to edit the sidebar. Instead of dividing the area in kilometers by 1.6 squared it was only divided by 1.6. Square milage listed in the Geography section of the main text appears correct.</p>

<p>Let me say at the outset that some people find my style a bit harsh. I don't mean it that way, but it comes out that way. I think it happens because I become impatient with things I can't understand. I have a tendency to blame the text (not the person who wrote it!) for my difficulty understanding it. So don't take this the wrong way, <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilliamjf_2341.html" title="User:Gilliamjf">Gilliamjf</a>.</p>
<p>You made four changes to the History section, which I would like to discuss here. My main issue with these changes is that they are too short—or insuficiently wikified—to stand on their own. Specifically,</p>
<p>1. Added: <i>The memory of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> presence is particularly strong in Alabama.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>What does <i>memory</i> mean in this sentence? Certainly not the recollections of any individual. Do you mean the collective recollections of all Alabamans? Or, instead of <i>memory</i> of their <i>presence</i>, do you mean <i>influences</i> left over from their having been here? This sentence needs to be clarified if it is to add any meaning to the paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. Added: <i>Trade with the Northeast via the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 700) and continued until European contact. Meso-American influence is evident in the agrarian Mississippian culture that followed.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you have any sources for this? A number of tribes were mentioned in the part of this paragraph that was not changed: <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chickasaw.html" title="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choctaw.html" title="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, to name three. Did these tribes trade with tribes in the area we now call the northeast? The Meso-American reference should be changed and wikified to <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesoamerica.html" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerican</a>. Then, if you follow that link you'll see a list of Mesoamerican traits, such as the three-stone hearth, for example. Are these traits evident in present-day Alabama? If so, then the sentence is a good start, and should be made solid with one or two examples of this kind.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. Added the word "officialy" in <i>Alabama was officialy readmitted to the Union on July 14 <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a minor point, but I'm not sure the word is necessary, even if it were spelled right. Was Alabama readmitted to the union in some manner that was not official at some other time? Is there even such a thing as unofficial readmission to the union?</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. Added: <i>The cradle of the Confederacy during the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Civil_War_988f.html" title="United States Civil War">Civil War</a>, Alabama was at stage center in the civil rights movement of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Although this one sentence can't stand on its own, a paragraph on the civil rights movement in Alabama isn't a bad idea. It should be a very brief summary, heavily wikified (see <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_55ab.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)</a>—especially the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_55ab.html#The_Birmingham_campaign" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">Birmingham Campaign</a> section, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Bus_Boycott_181d.html" title="Montgomery Bus Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Nixon_16d1.html" title="Edgar Nixon">Edgar Nixon</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches_f19f.html" title="Selma to Montgomery marches">Selma to Montgomery marches</a>). There's more than enough material already in Wikipedia that can be summarized and added to this section -- go for it! By the way, although the name, "cradle of the confederacy" is claimed by <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery%2C_Alabama_2176.html" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery</a> (because it was the first national capital of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>, from its founding on February 4, 1861 until May of that year), you should know that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> also claims that name.—<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeMcRae_c41c.html" title="User:GraemeMcRae">GraemeMcRae</a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeMcRae_c41c.html" title="User:GraemeMcRae">talk</a></sup> 19:25, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not being unreasonable and I am not attacking Rjensen. I'm stating simple facts as I see them. No one said that I base my facts on a AAA map.

<p>While I agree with you, <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>, I don't think it's appropriate to cry vandalism here. What we have here is difference of opinion. That's bound to happen on Wikipedia, it's not vandalism, and I trust we can work it out amicabaly.

To sum it up, I don't think there's anything inappropriate about calling Alabama a "Southern" state, as the South is a widely recognized geographic entity as well as a social one. I unfortunately don't have time to say any more at present, as I'm right in the middle of studying for finals. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 01:18, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't see a difference in point-of-view between "southern" and "southeastern" in discussing Alabama's region. I encourage Bookofsecrets to explain any concerns he or she has with the neutrality of the article here on the Talk Page instead of engaging in an edit war. There are enough rational editors with this page on their watchlist that we can sort out a dispute peacefully.

<li>I agree that name-calling is rather pointless, but I do agree that the Southeast should be acknowlged to have a history before the Neoeuropean/African culture traditionally referred to as "Southern". Also, as I am from Alabama, I appreciate the neutral language use I have found on wiki. for those of us who identify ourselves as both southern and intelligent.

<li>I remain unconvinced that the phrase "Southern state" is a primarily cultural description and "Southeastern" geographic. There is certainly no need for Wikipedia to give Alabama a cultural characterization. In my experience, the normal geographic appellation for the region is "the Southern United States" (unless you're specifically trying to exclude Texas for some reason.) and I really don't see how stating that simple geographic fact gives short shrift to the Moundbuilders, Muskogeans and Moravian miners who predate Skynyrd. I could understand that the article itself does that and would welcome active contributions from those whose grasp is greater than mine to expand the article. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 04:23, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Forgive me if I am wrong, but I'm fairly sure there is a mistake in the Presidential Election table on this page. According to this table, in the 1976 election the Republican candidate <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a> won Alabama and with a considerable majority. However I'm pretty sure Democrat <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> won Alabama in 1976 and the 76' election Wikipedia page seems to confirm this. This is a kind of serious mistake if I'm right. Would anyone care to check for certain and correct this? <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.103.html" title="User:195.93.21.103">195.93.21.103</a> 16:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems you are correct. Jimmy Carter won Alabama in 1976 with 55.7% of votes compared to Ford's 42.6% according to <a href="http://www.multied.com/elections/1976state.html" class="external text" title="http://www.multied.com/elections/1976state.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, as well as several others.

<dd>OK cool. I just changed the background colour in the 1976 box to blue as well, as this appears to be the correct formating as the only other election in which the Democrats won Alabama, 1960, also has the year box coloured blue to indicate that. Thanks for sorting it out, as an unregistered user I just wanted to ensure my suspicions about the mistake were 100% correct and check it with registered users on the talk page before making such a change to the article.

<p>Fbegnaud 22:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)== Metropolitan Areas == Hey guys, I'm new to this, so I won't try to edit it myself, but if someone could check it out and make any necessary changes, I would appreciate it. I would not consider Cullman in the Birmingham MSA, and have never even heard of it mentioned as such. It is about 50 miles north of Birmingham. Anyone know where the Birmingham-Hoover-Cullman reference is from? I checked the Bureau of Labor Statistics OMB 06-01 bulletin and it shows the Birmingham MSA consisting of Bibb, Blount, Chilton, Jefferson, St. Clair, Shelby and Walker Counties only.

<p>"The lowest point east of the Mississippi River lies in Dekalb County along a creek cutting tower ridges, and creating Buck's Pocket State Park." I'm pretty sure this isn't accurate.

<p>After reviewing this article I have decided to fail it for now. I think that it is actually quite a good article, but before conferring GA status formally I think the following issues should be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html#Climate" title="Alabama">Alabama#Climate</a>: This subsection does not cite sources for the information offered. This section is unlikely to be disputed, but a GA should allow readers to follow the data to the person notably asserting it.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html#Economy" title="Alabama">Alabama#Economy</a>: This section does cite sources, but some claims (like those about tax rates) could stand to have some source(s) provided with them.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html#Religion" title="Alabama">Alabama#Religion</a>: This subsection, which could become contentious, does not cite any sources for the figures offered. Having lived in Alabama the numbers sound right to me, but we need to follow <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> on this.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html#Local_and_county_government" title="Alabama">Alabama#Local_and_county_government</a>: This subsection discusses the controversial (in Alabama, at least) topic of home rule. We need to cite sources here because this is likely to be a source of contention in the future.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html#State_politics" title="Alabama">Alabama#State_politics</a>: This subsection is okay, but this sentence seems both poorly worded and unsourced: "This ended up hurting Alabama's image and making it out to be a hotbed for racism."</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, I think that, aside from the issues noted above, this is a fantastic article of good quality. I would strongly encourage involved editors to re-submit once the problems above are resolved. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 16:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
