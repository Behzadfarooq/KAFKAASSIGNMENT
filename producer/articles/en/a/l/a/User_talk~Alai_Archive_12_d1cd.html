<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Could you have a look at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Slavick_8b4b.html" title="Bill Slavick">Bill Slavick</a>? An editor is insisting that, despite the fact that it is only a few sentences, it should not be stubbed. The editor also deliberately created the stub conditions by drastically shortening the article and even nominaged it for AfD, which it passed. I don't remember ever reading about a short article that is notable but should not be expanded.

<p>Ok. That was weird. I guess I copied and pasted the stub name from the category name and forgot to put in the dashes. Thanks for catching it.</p>
<p>Take a look at {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESoft-drink-stub_c555.html" title="Template:Soft-drink-stub">Soft-drink-stub</a>}} in the bottom area. I have started using a standard (without the Food &amp; Drink space anyway) of checking if categories should be automatically added or not:</p>
<p><small><i>On a userbox:</i></small></p>
<pre>
&lt;includeonly&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{categories}}}|no||[[Category:WikiProject Beer participants|{{PAGENAME}}]]}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
</pre>
<p><small><i>In a stub tag:</i></small></p>
<pre>
{{#ifeq:{{{categories}}}|no||[[Category:Drink stubs&lt;noinclude&gt;| &lt;/noinclude&gt;]]}}
</pre>
<p>That ifeq test checks to see if the attribute <i>categories</i> is set to <i>no</i>. If it is, is suppresses the category from displaying on the page where it is transcluded. This is very helpful when the stub (or any template that uses this feature) is displayed on a page listing WikiProject (or other) templates. Before using that trick, the sample templates pages were showing up in all sorts of weird places that did not make sense (the WikiProject is a member of the WikiProject, the WikiProject is a stub, the WikiProject enjoys beer, etc.)</p>
<p><small><i>Example:</i></small></p>
<pre>
{{Soft-drink-stub|categories=no}}
</pre>
<p><small><i>Produces:</i></small></p>

<p>Notice that this page is not listed as a stub, even though there is a stub tag added to it. With most stub tags, this would have identified your talk page as a stub, which probably is not desirable.</p>
<p>Why plural (categories) instead of singular (category)? Well, because several templates I design can generate multiple categories. I thought it would make more sense to keep the attribute named the same across all templates I develop. Also, there might already be an attribute named "category", but hopefully less chance of a conflict with the plural (if integrating this feature in with an existing template).</p>
<p>How do you like it? Is there a place to discuss that as a possible recognized (but not mandatory, of course) feature or standard in template designs?</p>

<dd>I see your point about editing and feature creep, and I greatly respect your input. If it's alright with you, I will keep using it within the WikiProject Food &amp; Drink (and it's subprojects) since it is already in use in several other templates there, but not promote it outside of that Project space. If it catches on, ok. If not, ok. Sound like a plan to you?

<p>Hi; I'm guessing that Alaibot is your creation; I've not been aware of the First Nations stub before, so maybe you can tell me - does it index/sort into the Indigenous people's Wikiproject the way the NorthAm-native stub did? If not, is there a way to make sure it does so, as the point of placing the NorthAm-native stub in the first place was to identify Indigenous people's Wikiproject-related articles. I realize the talkpage template may do the same thing, but without identifying articles as stubs. Or is this a new template; or just one that wasn't being used as it apparentl should have been? Whichever; I'm just concerned about coordinating BC First Nations content with Indigenous peoples project content.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 07:36, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, that does answer my question (your latest on my talkpage); so long as it's already part of the Indigenous project, that's fine; I didn't have time to discuss the stubsorting agenda there, or I probably would have recommended there be a separate BCFirstNations category/stub, as BC has about 60% of all Canada's governmental First Nations, plus the same proportion of indigenous languages; this category may require further division, as there are distinctions between government articles (bearing "First Nation" or "Nation" in the title, or that are tribal councils or other bodies, e.g. treaty groups, educational organizations etc) and those that are "pure culture/history" articles (which would be without "First Nation" or "Nation" etc in the title, or otherwise non-governmental in content); are the na-lang stubs still intact (various languages spill across national boundaries, for one thing....).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not systematically eliminating them myself, but I think that User:RobertG has a robot that's doing something-or-other with them. If you (or he) would like an updated list, please let me know.

I'm tagging categories with interwiki links and cross connecting commons categories to main articles, plus sharing templates with newer sisters (see {{<a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EInterwikitmp-grp_beba.html" title="Template:Interwikitmp-grp">Interwikitmp-grp</a>}}) and consolidating our templates documentationwise (see <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_doc_page_pattern_3144.html" title="Wikipedia:Template doc page pattern">Wikipedia:Template doc page pattern</a>) before exporting those. The adminsistrative needs are similar on most wiki's, save perhaps wikinews, and to a slight extent wiktionary, neither of which use categories extensively. I also don't imagine wiki-media needs my blessings, but putting a uniform system in place as far as predictable tools template category names and schemes, plus sharing the tools with backlinks to a master copy will make those of us that work 'There' more productive, and vice versa when we cross the interwiki divide.<br />
<br />
So now and then I create a new category. I usually make sure I've tagged 5-10 somethings before generating an actual page. I'd seen one of those on that page, as another backlink showed the page to me. I've had some links like that edited out, pre-implementation. NBD, but 'tis silly for one to work such they undo what work someone else has done. Since you had the list, I thought I'd ask. Haven't dealt with you before, so nice to do so. Definitely seen you around... I tend to lurk more than post on the forum pages... I'm usually several weeks behind the threads! Sigh!

<dd><i>Thanks for the kind words. I'm still not sure I quite understand: the page you link to doesn't seem to have any</i> category <i>redlinks, just a template and a mainspace redlink. Is that what you mean, or were there previous category redlinks there? Sorry if I'm being slow here. As I say, I'm not doing anything about these directly, as if there's a small number of cat-redlinks for a relatively short time, I can't see it running into problems in general. Hopefully anyone "fixing" category redlinks will be trying to make an informed decision as to which cases to edit or remove the link, and in which cases to create the category. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 03:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Apologies... I'm not sure where I swerved so you didn't follow, as I wasn't citing any page with redlinks that I recollect or can see on either talk page. The 'links' were just to give you a rough idea of the scope of the preliminary experimental trial tagging—with a working system, others are using it, and so has begun burgeoning. No publicity yet, either. (I'll take that as an endorsement... others are finding it useful!)<br />
<br />
But I was talking about how I might be creating some redlinked cats in general... such as (1) below (with a name error), contents pending an change in templates I am working with, and (3) below, the 'good' destination... [(2) also has a redlink cat... see below]
<ol>
<li>Goof creation: <a href="../../../e/x/p/Category%7EExported_templates_used_only_on_Mediawiki_commons_8ef2.html" title="Category:Exported templates used only on Mediawiki commons">Category:Exported templates used only on Mediawiki commons</a> currently awaiting departure of it's contents via judicious changes in a few templates.</li>
<li>and <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECategory_redirect2_23ef.html" title="Template:Category redirect2">category redirect2</a>|Shared templates used only on Wikimedia Commons}}</span>
<ol>
<li>Category redirect2 however has a redlink category, haven't yet gathered enough experience whether to keep and initialize said category, or delete it. Hence, it's a 'proto-stub', if you'll allow, and one day may blossom or get edited away to the big bit bucket in the sky.</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The second (newly created) cat is filled with redlinks using {{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECat_see_also_cd49.html" title="Template:Cat see also">Cat see also</a>}} such as I was discussing... planning and writing templates, part of the 'design cycle' is figuring how they fit into the category scheme. Whether you need such tracking and the like. These are now planned additions, and have to be coded into {{<a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EInterwikitmp-grp_beba.html" title="Template:Interwikitmp-grp">interwikitmp-grp</a>}} inside the appropriate {{#if: statements}}, which will also populate them, save unreliably. There is another particularly useful template {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Template%7ETemplate_list_2af5.html" title="Template:Template list">Template list</a>}} which is like '<span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECat_see_also_cd49.html" title="Template:Cat see also">cat see also</a>}}</span>' will allow the same names in a list to be used to navigate across to other sisterproject's equivilent page by specifying a single additional parameter.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Such allows tagging, building a list's contents from a category page, then (Alas!) manually checking each link to verify it's contents are indeed where I said they were when tagging and porting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If not defined, the tool has reached the right page on the right sister, and I can back navigate to our source template using the 'Sistertmp' templates in preview screen (in this case <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiPtmp_e831.html" title="Template:WikiPtmp">WikiPtmp</a>}}</span>, navigate back to our template, enter edit mode, copy it, back up to the sister and paste it in... call it taking about a minute flat from check failure to resuming the checking at the next in the list. Tedious, but feasible.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I pretty much follow the same process from the auto-links in the interwikitmp-grp (below) when originally tagging a tools template for exportation, assuming I'm exporting and/or updating at that time. Whenever I do the exporting, the links are going to the correct page on the sister. The case above was verification of that, as it's all manual, and one can make a mistake, or be interupted (Say the phone rings, the kids have a fight, what ever...) and loose one's place, and so on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My newest generation tagging scheme uses a fairly sophisticated template <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EInterwikitmp-grp_beba.html" title="Template:Interwikitmp-grp">interwikitmp-grp</a>}}</span> which has the capability to individually track which sisters are 'enabled' when tagging a shared template, and so to also categorize them... Hence the redlink cats in (2) became feasible whereas in the old version everything went into one tracking category and there was no way to tell whether it was accurate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So that's the long short of when I create relinked cats... usually when coding templates or scheming how it all fits together. After a while that gets implemented, and the redlinks go blue or get eliminated.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, other than an explanation about why that page was, I wasn't asking you for anything, an you needn't be concerned. I do have to get around to having a chat with User:RobertG, as I've planned for a while now. I'm hoping we can get him to run his bot over on the commons once a week or so... we're rescheming and reorganizing maps categories in a top down heirarchy [an entirely different project, but an indirect ancestor of this one] and we've lost access to the bot we used when last persuing that task the end of last summer. So thanks for the interest and concern.

<dd>Ahhhh- you're one of those nefarious script people! They didn't even have a dream of one back when I went to school. Well, maybe for my second masters. RegEx parsing was all the rage in all of computing, and there was this funny little language called C that came out of nowhere and kind of took over many things. It beat the heck out of assembler, and so we used it for embedded systems from then on. I've only run across one company since that uses another language--Good old Pascal. The CS types probably had some kind of course discussing work on scripts... but DOS ran on IBM-PC's, not PCs. &lt;G&gt; A few computer generations later I kind of remember waiting forever for windows 2 to boot--was a real drag as my best man/friend was (and is still) a MAC expert and watching his old Mac boot was amazing... my how things have changed. I need to get back to work! But if I can think of anything I need a script for, I'll pick on you! Or are Bots smart scripts? Do you have to understand one to run it?

<p>The bot so far has been a great success, tagging 10,044 images out of the list you posted. I just had a few questions about how you are querying the database dumps and such:</p>
<ul>

<li>What databases are you using to generate that list?</li>
<li>What queries are you using? (you were saying something about a DB you had to generate to do it)</li>

<p>I have to apologise because I created another large number of cricket season templates in bulk before I realised that you had run your Alaibot. The articles are all Indian and West Indian seasons, about 120 in all and they are in cricket-stub, which you were trying to reduce. I have made sure that the Australian and New Zealand seasons I've added subsequently went to the new stub categories.</p>
<p>If it's not too much trouble, could you please do another sweep of cricket-stub to move the Indian and WI seasons? Incidentally, we now have a stub or article for all first-class seasons worldwide so there won't be any more.

<p>Great catch!!! I'll work on getting rid of a few of them... I've crossed them off the list - hope that's what you wanted (or just remove them?).</p>
<p>In the process I noticed that there was a bit of discussion on the redirect page, so I've offered a simple caution to put there in place of the album template. Hope that was ok... if not, just take them out.</p>

<p>Hi Alai - I seem to have missed one of the SLT stub types when I nominated the other three for deletion a few days ago, and for some odd reason I'm hesitant to add this to SFD myself - any chance you could? The reason I missed it is that it's an article pretending to be a template (so it wasn't on the newpages template log). It's SLT bio stub. Unused, unusable, probably speediable, but if I did something about it there'd probably be hell to pay from one editor in particular... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 10:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alai. I am not sure what happened with this. I created the Botswana-bio-stub and Botswana-politician-stub templates and was sorting them. However, now that I put the Botswana-bio-stub template on an article, it disappears from the Botswana-stub cat, even though that cat is upmerged to the Botswana stub.

<p>I'm not sure how much you're already aware, so I'll tell you in short: some Ohio counties already had township articles, but most had either none or very few. A week or so ago, I decided to create a template for my <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan_County%2C_Ohio_94dc.html" title="Logan County, Ohio">home county</a>, featuring both municipalities and townships, since it already had well-developed township articles. Since this went well, I decided to do the same for other counties with all township articles already created. Since this went well, I thought "why stop with counties that already have them? They're not hard to create!" Therefore, I began creating these articles on a copy/paste format. I'm hoping to get the rest of the state done in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Currently, of the 88 counties in Ohio, 61 counties have all township articles in existence, although many of them (mostly the counties whose townships I added this week or so) have just "__ Township is a township in __ County, Ohio" or "__ Township is one of the __ townships of __ County, Ohio" as their actual text. Of the other 27 counties, almost every county has some articles created, but most have very few. With a few exceptions (such as <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_County%2C_Ohio_7a1c.html" title="Lake County, Ohio">Lake</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/y/Cuyahoga_County%2C_Ohio_9767.html" title="Cuyahoga County, Ohio">Cuyahoga</a> with few, and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_County%2C_Ohio_22a8.html" title="Washington County, Ohio">Washington</a> with 22), most Ohio counties have between twelve and twenty townships. We can say that, for each county for which I created plenty of articles (24 in number), and for each of the remaining counties, there would be somewhere in the mid-teens (perhaps 15 for a pure estimate) of such articles. Let's say, therefore, that I created perhaps 360 such articles, and that perhaps 400 more remain.</p>
<p>As far as the stubs themselves: might I suggest something like {{Ohio-twp-stub}} for all Ohio townships? Since there are almost always fewer than twenty of these per county, and since each county generally doesn't have too many articles other than its municipalities (which generally aren't stubs) and townships, it might well be overdoing it to give each county its own stub. I'd prefer not to have to do all the re-stubbing; could we perhaps give that task to a bot? I understand that somebody would have to do it otherwise, so if we can't give the task to a bot, I'd be willing to start. <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 14:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, with almost no exceptions, municipalities are not stubs. Virtually all municipalities have detailed geographic information, a map pinpointing their location within their county and the state, and detailed census information. There really isn't too much of anything that is seen in all Ohio counties in large numbers other than municipalities and townships, so townships are the only plentiful type of stub articles. <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 01:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you're meaning with "per-county templates", whether you mean a per-county stub or a template like {{<a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogan_County%2C_Ohio_4a16.html" title="Template:Logan County, Ohio">Logan County, Ohio</a>}}, so I'll just give you what you're asking for, the list of counties to be worked on:</dd>

<p>All other counties have had all township articles created and templates (such as the aforesaid Logan County template) created and applied to township and municipal articles. Many of these counties already have Logan County-style templates, and some already have all township articles created (Ashtabula, Butler, Geauga, Medina, Portage, Warren), but not yet applied to all such articles. Moreover, other people have been creating a few township articles recently, and virtually every county has at least one township article. I hope this is what you're hoping for; if not, please let me know!</p>
<p>By the way, I really think we should place Ashland and Richland in a region, even if it means being arbitrary; it would seem odd not to have them anywhere. <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 15:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Back when the server would automagically fix the problem it wasn't one, but now that it doesn't, it is.
