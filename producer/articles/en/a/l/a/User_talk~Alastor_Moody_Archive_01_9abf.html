<p>I reverted your edit, as you deleted a lot of information I added about the storm. Could you go back and write in the changes? In addition, you need a source that the Saffir Simpson scale uses 1 minute averages. Furthermore, do you have a source saying it was a Super Cyclonic Storm? <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> 13:01, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, I said I reverted your edits, because you deleted information I added. All I asked was for you to write your information back in. I never said I didn't believe you. All I want is a simple source saying it was a super cyclone. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> 11:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And you ignore what I said. First, you reverted my edits, though probably accidentally. What probably happened was I submitted my post shortly before you submitted your post, so no biggie there. This is why I reverted your edit. You accidentally removed a lot of information I wrote, including an update on the death toll and more damage info. In addition, the reason people keep removing your information is because you don't have information that the storm was a super cyclone. All I am asking for is a simple link, an advisory maybe, that said Mala was a super cyclone. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> 00:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you look at what you did as compared to what I did, you removed the new information about the death toll and the new damage info. Finally, I too don't know why this is becoming so difficult. All I asked from in the beginning was a source that said it was a super cyclonic storm, and you still haven't done that! All information given in the article states that Mala had winds of, at the most, 135 mph. Super cyclone status is 140 mph and above. If you want, we can continue the discussion on the Mala talk page, as I too haven't seen a definitive statement on Mala's peak. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> 02:25, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the link clearly shows that you removed some of my information. For the last time, I don't know if you are wrong or not. Could you just provide a link saying it was a super cyclone? If you don't have evidence to back it up, then this whole conversation will have been a complete waste (it's pretty close already). <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> 11:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would love to help, but Userboxes are the one thing I don't know about too much. In case I can help, what exactly is the problem? <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> (<small><a href="../../../h/u/r/User_talk%7EHurricanehink_8130.html" title="User talk:Hurricanehink">talk</a></small>) 11:37, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I fixed it, sorta. I added a table end formatting thing, which was one problem. However, the main problem was, for some reason, the clock. For some reason, if I just removed that, the userbox table would be fine, so I removed that. Like I said above, Userboxes aren't my speciality, but, in case you can find someone else who knows what they are doing, here is the format for the clock.
<dl>
<dd>{| cellspacing="0" style="width: 238px; background: {{{2|#f0f8ff}}};" {{Userbox|white|lightgreen|[[Image:Windup alarm clock.jpg|40px]]|Today is [[{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}]], [[{{CURRENTYEAR}}]]}}</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Sorry I couldn't keep everything, but now you can add stuff beneath the userboxes.

<p>I do understand your reasoning; however, Golbez did not want it there (quote: that is given by the opening paragraph. it only matters in cases like, oh, 2006 atl, when there were storms PRIOR to the start of the season). I left the start of the season though in the main timeline article (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_ace0.html" title="Timeline of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season">Timeline of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>). If you still want it in the season article, tell me or Golbez.</p>

<p>It needs no backing up, it's simply a not statement we should be making. It adds nothing to the analysis and will either be gone or confirmed within a day. There's no reason not to wait. This is a general thing - you never know what the storm will do, or if another will pop up before it's named. The statement has too high a volatility and too low a value to include. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 01:50, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I have no evidence another storm is about to form. However, imagine if there were. Suddenly, our statement that "if it becomes a TS, it will be named Alberto" is incorrect - it could well be named Bertha, because the other system strengthened earlier. This may just be my opinion but I see no reason to have to juggle these various issues over a minor comment. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 02:12, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for checking the Nor'easter page out. And to answer your questions; Cyclone1 wrote Nor'easter Danielle for me; I told him he could help out. You know, I guess you can too, if you want. And the whole subtropical resemblance thingy I guess its ok there. Just because it doesn't have an eye doesn't mean it's not a subtropical storm. But if you compare it to Nicole of 2004 and the unnamed subtropical storm last year, they do look a <i>little</i> alike. And the whole Nor'easter in June thing isn't impossible, infact Cyclone1 has an image of one in 2003. It looks quite organized. But trust me, Danielle was definetly a nor'easter; I had to go through it for quite a long time due to its size. I hope that answers your questions. Also, thanks for saying how useful I am; it means a lot to me. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelandic_Hurricane_dd07.html" title="User:Icelandic Hurricane">íslenska hurikein #12</a><sub><a href="../../../i/c/e/User_talk%7EIcelandic_Hurricane_e53f.html" title="User talk:Icelandic Hurricane">(samtal)</a></sub> 11:41, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That is very likely a part of the Monsoon Trough.

<p>Mind you, 2005 was a once in a lifetime season. It is natural for seasons to have a late start. 2004 had 15 storms, and the first didn't even form until July 31. Having 17 storms is still possible. Provided conditions are favorable in August, September, and October, we could reach that. Consider this. The average start date for the first tropical cyclone is July 4. We already had one, so we're ahead of the average already. However, the EPAC normally has an earlier season. You're right, the EPAC is below average, but things can change quickly in the tropics. For the WPAC, this year is ahead of last year's, which saw its 5th storm on July 11. The North Indian is off to a good start with three storms. Some entire seasons don't even have three storms. In all, you generally can't judge the early season for the rest of the season. 1995 and 1997 both had 5 storms before August 1, but 1995 went on to have 19, while 1997 only had 7. 2000 and 2004 both had very late starts, with both A storms forming near the first week of August. However, they both went on to have 15 storms. Once mid-August comes around, you should be able to tell whether it will be hyperactive, active, or slow, but until then, you have to keep watching. --<a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> (<small><a href="../../../h/u/r/User_talk%7EHurricanehink_8130.html" title="User talk:Hurricanehink">talk</a></small>) 23:44, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, you are reading it wrongly. It says "MXWD 035KT" - 35 kt max winds. The extratropical low is the 24-hour forecast.

<p>Just jumping in to help here. Chacor is right, it's still active, but barely. See the <a href="http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/" class="external text" title="http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/" rel="nofollow">JMA page</a>, and you'll see that the latest advisory has it as a 35 knot storm. "24HF 120000UTC 44.2N 139.4E 100NM 70% EXTRATROPICAL LOW" means that in 24 hours, (on the 12th at 0000Z) the forecast position is 44.2N, 139.4E, and there is a 70% chance that the storm's center will be within 100 nautical miles of that point (the percentage will always be 70%, and the distance depends on how far into the future the forecast is). By then, it should have transitioned to extratropical status. -- <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattleMan_8014.html" title="User:RattleMan">RattleMan</a> 01:48, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Imagine, for example, if I was talking on the 2008 Presidential Election talk page, and I said that John Edwards is going to win because he is leading some polls right now. Other users would probably be annoyed by that because it is too far in advance and we don't know what's going to happen until it does.

I appreciate your discussing them with me first, but I do not have time to argue with you over a few tiny edits. — <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper-Magician_ef51.html" title="User:Super-Magician">Super-Magician</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuper-Magician_1e62.html" title="User talk:Super-Magician">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Super-Magician_ea19.html" title="Special:Contributions/Super-Magician">contribs</a>&#160;•&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Super-Magician" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Super-Magician" rel="nofollow">count</a></span>) ★ 20:04, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I noticed you reverted the anons removal of the Harry Potter pic on your user page. That was not a case of vandalism but a good edit by an anon upholding wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_Use_d71b.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair Use">Fair Use</a> imagery. To quote from the policy page, "Fair use images should be used <b>only</b> in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are often enough not covered under the fair use doctrine. <i>They should never be used ... on user pages</i>". As such you should remove the image from your userpage.--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilfanion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 20:49, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed on your userpage that you wanted to know if there were any users younger than you, though I am older than you, I know of some younger users. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_willie_e913.html" title="User:Free willie">User:Free willie</a> was born on I think <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolman13_bae4.html" title="User:Coolman13">User:Coolman13</a> was born in mid <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a>, 1994. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaugusta_81a1.html" title="User:Ninjaugusta">User:Ninjaugusta</a>, User:Pantera Miranda, and <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelandic_Clementine_e27f.html" title="User:Icelandic Clementine">User:Icelandic Clementine</a>, who are all the same person, was born in late August of 1994. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowcam_9907.html" title="User:Cowcam">User:Cowcam</a> was born <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, which means he is the youngest user I know of.

<p>Mind you, this section may actually constitute violation of policy, as it is against policy to give out private info on others (even if they have already let it be known)...
