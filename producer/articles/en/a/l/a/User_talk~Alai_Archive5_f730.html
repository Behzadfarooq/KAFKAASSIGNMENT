<p>Hello! I wonder how does one obtain listings like User:Alai/Small stubs2. I want to update category sizes at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_ST_1717.html" title="WP:WSS/ST">WP:WSS/ST</a>, so I'd like to have the full list of stub categories with their sizes. So, two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the some place to read on this? (On downloading the database dump and extracting the data, or on making a proper database request.)</li>
<li>If you already have such a list, would you please send me a copy / provide a link?</li>

<p>If there's a case to be made about the "common name in English" of this place, it should surely be done in a renaming request of the main article itself (and perhaps there is, my only "dog" is consistency). Arguing for Instantnood's supposed position, in having some categories named one thing, and some named another -- expressly contrary to the naming conventions -- surely isn't a good idea either way. Alai 05:10, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think your suggestion that the main article is the place to discuss which usage is more prevalent is quite right. To do so would maximize the input of knowledgable and interested editors. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayerG_a4be.html" title="User:MayerG">MayerG</a> 17:27, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes I already saw and responded to your objections.

<p>What Alai did was run a progrma to get the article counts, than he took each count and put the counts in by hand. hence why his method was called semi automated.

<p>I will have to get with consious about the script, but in all honesty the page is readable to the bot, and readable to us humans. Have a look at it yourself!! If you don't like what I did just let me know and I can change it. But right now it is consistant. Sorry, but when I watched that going on, I thouth it was manual, as it took place over the span of multiple edits.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 06:00, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can you tell me about the db feed?? My bot may be able to make use of it. as it is now though the only major problem is the redlinks, once that is fixed we are in the clear. (Updates to format, ect can be made after that. Did you look at what the bot got?? up a couple headings.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 06:00, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For now I will restrict the bot to saterdays. I may put a larger sample on the WP:SC on saterday. (perhaps half) and without major objections automate the proccess by(on) the following saterday.</p>

<dd>B) All Categories that are to be counted be in <b>bold</b>.</dd>

<dd>From what I've seen of his edits, I wouldn't call his recent nomination bad faith. The wording (e.g. "anyone fancies a rummage") is very unlike anything he's written--it looks more like something Grutness would write. I couldn't find anything in a Google search, but I am guessing that someone has used that phrase in a CFD, TFD, or SFD nomination in the past.

<dd>Ronald has done the same cut and paste for a nomination at either TFD or CRD (I don't remember which one), but I think that it is much more likely that both actions were imitations of the other nom, rather than bad faith or retaliation.

<p>I've done some very significant and "bold" editing of the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Traditionalism_16c4.html" title="Gaelic Traditionalism">Gaelic Traditionalism</a> article. I'm telling you because I value your input on improving the content and form of the article. Anyway, if you have a chance to pop by and give some feedback, I'd appreciate it. It's more NPOV now. Not perfect, but much better, IMHO. I hope no one screams that I've eviscerated it but it needed drastic editing work to bring it in line with Wikipedia standards as I understand them. I believe what remains is a relatively workable core article. I've also archived a good bit of the talk page so it isn't such a monster to navigate. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_MacBride_8c76.html" title="User:Sean MacBride">Mac</a> 23:43, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your input tonight on the Gaelic Traditionalism page. Some of your comments paralleled my own thoughts and questions but I was unwilling to completely say them. I'm new enough to Wikipedia that I didn't want to "slash and burn" the article. I thought my above mentioned "bold" edits (which cut about four/fifths of the content) might begin to pave the way to salvaging the article. I'm much less certain now. Anyway, thanks again. I believe your comments have offered very clear indications about the problems with the article. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_MacBride_8c76.html" title="User:Sean MacBride">Mac</a> 08:47, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd also like to thank you for helping out with the page. What seems key to me, and I've just mentioned it on the Talk page, is that the authors of this piece are using "Gaelic Traditionalist" and "Traditionalist Gael" to mean something very different than what is usually meant by those words. It seems like a very small group trying to redefine terms that have a totally different meaning to an entire culture of people. I can't see how that conflict in meaning serves an entry that is supposed to be encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_MacGrath_8df8.html" title="User:Martin MacGrath">Martin MacGrath</a> 09:10, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like I'm fawning with my continued compliments, I continue to be impressed and astonished with your quick skill at cutting to the heart of matters on the talk page of this article. "Gaelic Traditionalists are a tiny bunch of non-Gaelic non-traditionalists who insist that their neopagan reconstruction not be called 'neopagan' or 'reconstruction'." A marvel of counterpoint, that. I regret that I attempted to be a little too kind, a little too councilitory in the face of an avalanche of bafflegab. I really should have trusted my initial assessment of the page and acted accordingly. Consensus is fine but if the original concept and basis of the entry is flawed, even consensus will reach a flawed conclusion. *sigh* Live and learn. Undoubtedly, conviction and clarity about an article's goals and appropriateness would improve my editing and talk page skills. Once again, thank you. No wonder you pull down the big bucks as sysop. (I jest.) You are my shining exemplar. (Well, for the moment. I have a short attention span.) --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_MacBride_8c76.html" title="User:Sean MacBride">Mac</a> 02:35, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alai, wondering if I can ask a favor. Things have gotten quite heated at <a href="../../../j/o/s/Talk%7EJoseph_Smith%2C_Jr._4587.html" title="Talk:Joseph Smith, Jr.">Talk:Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> between <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">User:Bcatt</a> and a number of Mormon editors (we have moved a portion of the discussion to my talk page). I've tried to step in and help guide the discussion, but because I am a Latter-day Saint adherent, I am being accused of treating her differently than Mormon editors and abusing my administrative status (see my talk page) - both which I take very seriously.</p>
<p>Whenever I've tried to guide the discussion (which I have not been a part of for the bulk, except to try to help guide), she seems to have blown up at me, as if I am mastermining and encouraging discrimination about her. For example, a few months ago I suggested that she and Storm Rider work out their uncivility and take a break from the page, but she though I was being harsher on her than him (he took a break, she didn't). When I suggested we find out who the sock puppet is on the JS Jr, she said that I was holding double standards for LDS editors, and "engaging in questionable practices due to [my] bias." I don't know what I did to make her over-react like that, as my interaction with her was very limited up until that point, although she does have a history of controversy and antagonism towards personal beliefs (ie politics, philosophy and religion)(see her user boxes). As a non-Mormon admin who is trusted in the Wikipedia community, could you go to the talk page, read through and offer suggestions? In addition, and personally, I'd appreciate a critique of my handling of the situation and her. I do take these accusations seriously, as you know. Thanks in advance. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 22:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can I second this request - I removed JS from my watchlist for a week hoping things would calm down since she seemed particularly angry towards me - but returned to find things worse - and any attempts I have made to find middle ground or to help have been summarily dismissed - <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#F0F">Trödel</font></a> 22:57, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you both for the poisoned chalice^W^Wvote of confidence.&#160;:) I'll see what I do. As you've taken no admin actions at all on this, I don't see where any possible <i>mis</i>use would be (though I can only find indirect suggestions of this from bcatt, to be fair to her). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:15, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've left her a note on that, perhaps just wait and see if she responds to that, in the first instance. I assume you mean her "you aren't doing a very good job as an admin..." comment, which even if true (and I trust it's not) would not be a commentary on you as an <i>admin</i> if you've taken no admin action (or any "fear or favour" stuff as such, which I can also see no evidence of). If I were to speculate (though I really ought not...), perhaps it's an "admins should be held to a higher standard" argument, or merely a rhetorical connection between the two, rather than an accusation as such. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:31, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As to whether Visorstuff was acting in the capacity of an admin when he ignored rampant policy violations by Storm Rider: he says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39643597" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39643597" rel="nofollow">here</a>, "as an admin", referring to himself. Thus, proof that he was indeed acting in the capacity of an admin, not of an editor...not that an admin should be allowed to choose when they want to act as an admin or not, as this situation clearly demonstrates how that "I want to be an admin now, but not now" power can be abused...namely by "choosing not to be an admin" when editors in your own faction need to be kept in line, then "choosing to be an admin" in order to reprimand an editor who has finally responded to repeated abuse. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 09:16, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, sorry if I seem so absolute on the page in regard to requesting formal mediation or arbitration (knowing well that formal mediation, advocacy all come before arbitration), but we've got editors who don't want to edit the page, nor participate in the discussion due to the situation. Storm Rider had taken a wikiholiday <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Storm_Rider#Wikiholiday" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Storm_Rider#Wikiholiday" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> from the page until it gets resolved, Trodel doesn't want to engage in discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hawstom#Help_Request" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hawstom#Help_Request" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and I feel that my reputation is being marred - all smell of intimidation tactics - and Cogden hasn't edited anything since this edit war has begun - a huge loss of expertise - you'll notice his MO is to avoid conflict altogether. My reputation (and I know I'm probably taking this overboard, Alai) is important here, and I'll probably bring it up for RFC on admin conduct myself, as I want it made clear I've not abused any of my powers. The bottom line is the editors of the page are more monitoriing her edits rather then the article's content and the articel is looking mighty sad. Should I be bold and start editing the article (up to this point, I have not) with documented sources, removing those that are not documented? What do you suggest? In any case, you are right in your statement on the page in all you said. I completely agree. Bringing you and Wesley in was in hopes of an Informal mediation process or third party, and we already know that there are too many Mormons watching this page to do a survey/poll.

<p>There is an ongoing systematic pov pushing on kurd related articles.</p>
<p>We also have lots of useless categoties such as <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdish_culture_3c00.html" title="Category:Kurdish culture">Category:Kurdish culture</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdish_dance_3532.html" title="Category:Kurdish dance">Category:Kurdish dance</a>, Category:Kurdish language films, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdish_literature_3379.html" title="Category:Kurdish literature">Category:Kurdish literature</a>. List is quite endless. There are perhaps more categories than articles on kurdish culture and literature. Such categories are often created bu users whoes only contribution is creating them or by users who dont know english. On several occasions people who create these chains of imposible to navigate categories and sub categories can be observed POV pushing. I can cite spesific examples with little effort. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 19:22, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have made many(and probably too many) battle stub categories. (Category:Scottish battle stubs, Category:Finnish battle stubs, Category:Welsh battle stubs, Category:Anglo-Saxon battle stubs, and Category:English battle stubs. Some of these are very small, and, though good intentioned(battle stubs were coordinating with the battles categories), they are wrong stub categories. Kirill Lokshin told me to ask you for help, and thus, I will do that. Do you have any advice on how to better categorize these stubs.

<p>Yes, I got confused between you two.&#160;:-) Anyways, I can categorize the English, Scottish, and Welsh battle stubs back into the British battle stub category. <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERshu_2728.html" title="User:Rshu">Rshu</a> 03:08, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, since it was not too hard to make them, it will not be too hard to categorize them back. However, I will keep the templates, as suggested. <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERshu_2728.html" title="User:Rshu">Rshu</a> 03:18, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you know how to make subcategories? Maybe making those former categories for all of the parts of the UK could be used for subcategories. Just an idea. <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERshu_2728.html" title="User:Rshu">Rshu</a> 14:58, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I got another idea. Poland and Russia might have at least 50 battle stubs. Maybe a category could be made for those. Or even a category for all Slavic battle stubs. <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERshu_2728.html" title="User:Rshu">Rshu</a> 15:05, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are exactly 507 battle stubs the last time that I checked. For the battle stubs, I will do the marking of the stubs if you make the template and the category for the Russian ones. Please message me whenever you do so. <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERshu_2728.html" title="User:Rshu">Rshu</a> 22:39, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I have started on categorizing that stub category. Anyways, why not have the Russian flag for the stub template? <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERshu_2728.html" title="User:Rshu">Rshu</a> 11:41, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright...I was going to post for a delete untill I realized that one of the editors had posted problems about finding articles that they wanted to edit...Hence my keep vote...(I did change it, based on the rational posted by you and another person below...Who made a comment.</p>
<p>Please do realize that my vote is my vote...And that I posted that I would change, if good reasons were given...I'm like that. (trust me you will see more of that in the future). All you have to do is satisfy my questions and I will change to go with the majority...If my question has been anseared satifactorly. (I am not a big proponent of deleting things unless they are reeeally small or misnamed, ect. I like to base my vote on a bit more than just how many articles there are...(I ask things like is there an associated wikiproject???, Is it likily to see it fill up in the future...(provided that it is properly made ect.)).</p>
<p>Realize If I vote opposite of the consensous...It is merly to make the consenous give good reasons and to give the other side a chance...(After all we are all working on the same encyclopedia)</p>
<p>P.S. (Please don't go to my page disscussing my vote...Do so on the main page...And realize that my first vote is not my final vote...I like to see the two sides as best as I can...If voting agiast the majority provides me a chance to do that I will...Trust me I won't make it any harder for you to do rightfull deleate, but the questionable ones...or ones that I don't know much about...but seem legit...I like to poke and prod.)</p>
<p>P.S.S.

So Stable versions are not something to be rushed. Its still quite a new idea that people have not taken it up to yet. Its slow and steady like the earth evolves slowly through millions of years. It no longer uses protection so its no so anti-wiki anymore. Its not a huge and uncomfortable fork but a snapshot with minor revisions. There is no other way around the naming convention.

That is, there are no subpages such as <i>/Stable</i>. This means if people want to make major additions, they would have to end the Stable Version phases before they can reach the Wiki Version. Wikipedia/Stable and Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr./Stable are temporary articles to reach the final form of Stable Version implementation. We end up cycling between these three phases, and each iteration produces a useful Stable Version that are simple markers indicating whether this version with an oldid is a Stable Version or not. -- <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZondor_d557.html" title="User:Zondor">Zondor</a> 02:15, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

That he's paid to propagandize for young Earth creationist ideology is clear from the article as it stands. Doesn't that say it all? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 13:12, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, although I am now an atheist, I was raised a fundamentalist Christian and a young Earth creationist. The phrases that are used by people in the conflict over this article to prove who is who (that so snd so <i>is</i> Sarfati) were used in my youth by my pastors. It is sort of like claiming two wikipedians are the same person because they both throw around NPOV, WWIN, and IAR all the time. At least it strikes <i>me</i> that way. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 13:19, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Was, since I'm the one who seems to be making the strongest identity claim here, it would have been nice if you had relayed this opinion to me directly. That said, what do you think of the evidence that Sarfati is 220.*&#160;? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:01, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, JoshuaZ, if you feel slighted. I apologize. I'm far less into direct confrontation than many and I'm really not keeping score on exactly who said what when to who. It would be nice if everyone in this mess could just say all at once "my bad" and move on, but I guess arbcom will have to clarify a few things before this goes away. I think <b>all</b> the they-talk-alike evidence is nonsense because people in these group-think cults/enthusiasms talk alike to maintain group solidarity. Any three teenagers hanging together too much will develop their own lingo. It's human nature. As for other evidence, I have no clue. I <i>suspect</i> that the evidence is totally untrustworthy but that it probably was him anyway. The real issue is "So what?" Why not judge suspect article contributions by the source supplied with the contribution and not worry about real world identities? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:00, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't mean I felt slighted, but rather thought that it was an opinion that would have been worth hearing. As to your point, I did think about it briefly. Your phrasing is much more precise than my vague notions of the matter. While you are I think very correct that language would have been insufficient evidence. However, note that 220.* made a large number of chess related edits, some of which required good knowledge of positions (I noted that in the relevant evidence section). Also even among creationists and among AiG people for that matter the term "antitheist" is still comparatively rare. (Personally I think some of the accusations of meatpuppetry, especially in regard to Dennis Fuller have a strong chance of being wrong and I said as much in my evidence section).

<dd>Continuing my on-going lack of consistency on talk-page replies, I'll do so here (as there's more than one person to reply to). I'm afraid I can't supply any additional sources; I've really only done google-grade research on him, and I'm not, despite what you might have gathered, really any sort of active participant in C-E matters aside from having been in a couple of such disputes in WP. Personally I'd make no claims about 220.*, though I do admit the thought had occurred to me, even before others made the suggestion explicitly. (The instence of the use of the unusual, at least around here, and clumsy-sounding phrase "PhD scientist" as a descriptor struck me, initially.) I assume here the issue is not, like the "Socrates" issue one of whether this can be demonstrated to standards of Wikipedia bio verifiability, but of whether it's a strong enough possibility to warrant caution in spirit of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 14:46, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, that's a bad example (and I didn't use it in my evidence section you will notice) the phrase "PhD scientist" or a similar variant is actually quite common in creationist circles. They strongly try to emphasize that they have <b>scientiststs</b> on their side, never mind what the scientists actually do or how prominent they are in their fields or how many they have etc. In fact, the attempted emphasis on doctorates in particular seems to be pretty common in a lot of articles related to extreme evangelical Christianity. It seems to be part of their ongoing love/hate relationship with education. See for example the similar issues that occured at <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Ruckman_d784.html" title="Peter Ruckman">Peter Ruckman</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:55, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they'd simply said "scientist", "PhD", or even "scientist with a PhD" I'd have thought nothing of it. I didn't know that that particular noun-phrase attributive juxtaposition was a common creationist thing, but I did recall JS being quoted as having exclaimed something to the effect of "I'm a PhD scientist" in some face-to-face debate or other. Googling for it seems to get more false positives than anything else ("Mary Smith, PhD, scientist..."). At amy rate, I don't cite this as real evidence of anything, just as illustration of my own "alarm bells". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 15:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't recall any specific occasion when Sarfati has said that but now that you mention it, it does sound vaguely familiar. I'll try to look it up when I have time later (my comment about my section was actually originally meant to go to Was since he seemed to dislike those sorts of claims, but I find it highly interesting that you had similar suspicions). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My memory is hazy, I couldn't find it last time I tried to myself. My blurry recollection was that some snotty evolutionist punk teen (as it were) was baiting him about such and such a matter, and he replied in terms roughly congruent to my paraphrase above (perhaps feeling somewhat goaded or otherwise less than his usual temperate self). It may even have been directly in response to someone question his credentials, which would give him a reasonable excuse in those terms. I hope I'm not being <i>wildly</i> inaccurate here; my own lack of specificity is why I didn't bring it up on the article talk page, lest it look let throwing mud and hoping something would stick. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 15:43, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
