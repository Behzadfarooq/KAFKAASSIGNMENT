<p>The <b><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> Boundary Dispute</b> was a territorial dispute between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> (then a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> Dominion with its foreign affairs controlled from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>), and at a subnational level between the territory of Alaska on the U.S. side and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> and the <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon.html" title="Yukon">Yukon</a> on the Canadian side. It was resolved by arbitration in 1903.</p>
<p>In 1825 <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> and Britain signed a treaty to define the borders of their respective colonial possessions. Part of the wording of the treaty was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"...the said line shall ascend to the north along the channel called <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland_Channel_31ac.html" title="Portland Channel">Portland Channel</a> as far as the point of the continent where it strikes the 56th degree of north latitude; from this last-mentioned point, the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast as far as the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The rather vague phrase "the mountains parallel to the coast" was further qualified thus:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Whenever the summit of the mountains shall be at a distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This part of the treaty language was really an agreement on general principles for establishing a boundary in the area in the future, rather than any exact demarcated line.</p>
<p>After the United States bought Alaska in 1867 and British Columbia united with Canada in 1871, Canada requested a survey, but it was refused by the United States as too costly: the border area was very remote and sparsely-settled, and without economic or strategic interest at the time. In 1898 the national governments agreed on a compromise, but the government of British Columbia rejected it. U.S. President McKinley proposed a permanent lease of a port near Haines, but Canada rejected that compromise.</p>
<p>Around that time, the <a href="../../../k/l/o/Klondike_Gold_Rush_7dcd.html" title="Klondike Gold Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a> enormously increased the population of the general area, which reached 30,000, composed largely of Americans.</p>
<p>This increased the importance of the region and the desirability of fixing an exact boundary. There are claims that Canadian citizens were harassed by the U.S. as a deterrent to making any land claims. Finally, in 1903, the <a href="../../../h/a/y/Hay-Herbert_Treaty_43d8.html" title="Hay-Herbert Treaty">Hay/Herbert treaty</a> entrusted the decision to an arbitration by a mixed tribunal of six members, three American and three Canadian/British.</p>
<p>The main legal points at issue were which coastal range should be chosen as the basis of the boundary and whether the "ten marine leagues" (or 30 <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nautical_mile.html" title="Nautical mile">nautical miles</a>) should be measured from the heads of the fjords or from a baseline which would cut across the mouths of the fjords.</p>
<p>The British arbitration board member <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Everard_Webster%2C_1st_Viscount_Alverstone_332c.html" title="Richard Everard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone">Lord Alverstone</a> sided with the United States position on these basic issues — though the final agreed demarcation line fell significantly short of the maximal U.S. claim (it was a compromise falling roughly between the maximal U.S. and maximal British/Canadian claim). Canada was, however, entitled to a consolation prize in obtaining a triangle of land called <i>the Panhandle</i> (the <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatshenshini-Alsek_Park_d82c.html" title="Tatshenshini-Alsek Park">Tatshenshini-Alsek region</a> of British Columbia), nearly <a href="../../../e/n/c/Enclave.html" title="Enclave">enclaved</a> on the north of the coastal zone awarded to Alaska.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_boundary_dispute.html" title="Edit section: Canadian controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Canadian controversy</span></h2>
<p>Although the Canadian delegates had been out-manoeuvered by Lord Alverstone, in protest the Canadian judges refused to sign the award, issued 20 October 1903, and violent anti-British feeling erupted in Canada. The result was a surge in Canadian nationalism separate from an Imperial identity. (Munro 1965)</p>
<p>Irritated at the decision, Prime Minister <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfrid_Laurier_2808.html" title="Wilfrid Laurier">Sir Wilfrid Laurier</a> asserted that Canada's lack of treaty-making power made it difficult to maintain its rights internationally, but he took no immediate action and the situation remained essentially unchanged until Canada became a separate signatory at the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> and still later when the government of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King_85ed.html" title="William Lyon Mackenzie King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> took independent charge of foreign policy beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>. In the period immediately after the dispute, Canadian anger gradually subsided, although suspicions of the U.S. provoked by the award may have contributed to Canada's rejection of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a> in the 1911 "reciprocity election". Nevertheless, the Alaska settlement promoted better understanding between the U.S. and Britain that worked to Canada's advantage in World War I.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_boundary_dispute.html" title="Edit section: Unresolved issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unresolved issues</span></h2>
<p>Although the treaty stipulates the north side of the <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixon_Entrance_8083.html" title="Dixon Entrance">Dixon Entrance</a>, the United States has ignored this provision of the treaty and maintains the boundary is in the middle of the Dixon Entrance and has proceeded with drilling surveys and allocations in the area, which is believed to be oil-and-gas rich. Canadian maps show the treaty boundary, while American ones show a mid-channel boundary titled "Exclusive Economic Zone Boundary", with drilling leases in place, and on several occasions US Coast Guard and other official American vessels have, in violation of the treaty, arrested and impounded Canadian fishing vessels and other craft in the disputed waters. The line stipulated in the treaty is known as the A-B Line, being drawn from Points A and B (Cape Muzon at the southern tip of Dall Island, to the west of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_Island_57cc.html" title="Prince of Wales Island">Prince of Wales Island</a> to one of the Proctor Islands, at the opening of Tongass Passage. It remains an unresolved issue between the Canadian and American governments (the Canadian position is that it was resolved in 1903, with the Alaska Treaty). Also at dispute is the Portland Canal, where the treaty stipulates the west bank of the canal but the American government ever since has claimed the middle of the channel. Unlike the A-B Line, the Portland Canal issue does not involve potential oil and gas reserves, nor fishing rights. The Portland Canal's waters were to be exlcusively Canadian because of strategic concerns over access to the towns at the head of it, and adjacent Observatory Inlet.</p>
