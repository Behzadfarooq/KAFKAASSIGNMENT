<p>Aladdin was born 18 years before the events of the film and very little about his past has been revealed. Aladdin's father, Cassim, left the family shortly after his son's birth. Aladdin's mother died when he was very young. Aladdin never received a formal education. He learned much from his time on the streets of Agrabah.</p>
<p>When he was sixteen, he fell in with a group of circus performers. The performers sought a powerful diamond. They were eventually captured by the diamond. Besides Aladdin, the only other surviving member of the troupe was a monkey named <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu.html" title="Abu">Abu</a>. The two became life-long friends.</p>

<p>As he had since he was a small boy, eighteen-year old Aladdin ran from the Sultan's guard. The guards gave chase after the boy and his monkey friend, Abu, swiped a piece of bread. On this particular day, he used a hanging towel to glide to safety from his persuers. Escaping the guards, the pair hid in a dark ally. As Abu prepared to devour the bread, Aladdin noticed two starving, street children. He gave up his piece to the girl. Abu reluctantly gave up his piece to her younger brother.</p>

<p>Some time later, Aladdin meets a girl in the marketplace. It's love at first sight - but their meeting is interrupted by guards sent by vizier <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jafar_%28Aladdin%29_6760.html" title="Jafar (Aladdin)">Jafar</a> to capture Aladdin.

<p>In prison, Aladdin meets an old man (that's actually Jafar in disguise) that mentions a cave filled with treasure, and that he needs Aladdin to enter it. The old man reveals a secret exit, and Aladdin decides to follow him.</p>
<p>In the desert, Aladdin enters the Cave of Wonders, where he meets a sentient <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_carpet.html" title="Magic carpet">magic carpet</a> and is commanded to only get a magic lamp. He gets it - however, Abu gets a giant gem that causes the cave to collapse.</p>
<p>After the collapse, Aladdin, Abu and the carpet are in an emptiness. Abu delivers the lamp to Aladdin, and when he rubs it, a giant blue <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genie_%28Disney%27s_Aladdin%29_1702.html" title="Genie (Disney's Aladdin)">Genie</a> appears, telling Aladdin he will fulfill three wishes. After leaving the collapsed cave with the Genie's help (but not constituting a wish, since he did it at free will after being "discredited" by Aladdin), he decides to become a prince in order to conquer Jasmine's heart.</p>

<p>Aladdin is a very confident and clever person; his most common trait is his constant day dreaming about life at the palace and his beautiful princess Jasmine, and like most Disney male protagonists he is a selfless, brave and clever young man who seeks to win the affection of his princess. Though he can be a bit stubborn at times, he really does care about his friends, and will make sure to do whatever he can to protect them. In the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> manga he is characterised to have a bit of an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inferiority_complex.html" title="Inferiority complex">inferiority complex</a>, and prone to <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flattery.html" title="Flattery">flattery</a>.

<p>Aladdin appears as a major Disney character in the bestselling video game series <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_%28series%29_6270.html" title="Kingdom Hearts (series)">Kingdom Hearts</a></i>.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i>, Aladdin is a young man living in the desert city of Agrabah. He fell in love with Princess Jasmine, but he’s afraid to tell her about his humble background. With a little luck, he finds Genie in the Cave of Wonders. He had used his first wish to destroy the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heartless.html" title="Heartless">Heartless</a> that were attacking <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sora_%28Kingdom_Hearts%29_ef6c.html" title="Sora (Kingdom Hearts)">Sora</a>. Afterwards he, Sora, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Duck_14d1.html" title="Donald Duck">Donald</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goofy.html" title="Goofy">Goofy</a> became close friends, after Sora informed Aladdin that Jasmine had been kidnapped by Jafar they quickly go back to Agrabah to save her, and he used his second wish to do so, but while Genie saved Jasmine, <a href="../../../i/a/g/Iago_%28Aladdin%29_ecca.html" title="Iago (Aladdin)">Iago</a> had stolen the lamp and Jafar took control of Genie. Later Jafar, Iago and Genie along with the captive princess Jasmine went into the vowels of the cave of wonders searching for the <i><b>Keyhole</b></i>. When Aladdin and the others arrived at the cave, it turns out that the Heartless were controlling the Tiger head of the cave, which, after Sora freed it from the darkness, the cave allowed them to enter to stop Jafar. They successfully defeated Genie Jafar and sealed him inside his lamp, but by the time they went to get Jasmine she had already been kidnapped by <a href="../../../r/i/k/Riku_%28Kingdom_Hearts%29_a88a.html" title="Riku (Kingdom Hearts)">Riku</a>. After returning to Agrabah, Genie tells Aladdin to use his last wish to save Jasmine, but instead he uses it to free Genie and asked him if he could help Sora find Jasmine. Genie happily complied. At the end of the game, Jasmine and Aladdin were reunited and peace was restored to their world.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_II_23fd.html" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i>, Aladdin feels lonely and restless without Genie and is looking for some excitement which soon comes calling. Aladdin's <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limit_Break_7057.html#Kingdom_Hearts" title="Limit Break">limit</a> is Speedsters, where he and Sora zoom around the area, attacking enemies in a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> style attack.</p>
