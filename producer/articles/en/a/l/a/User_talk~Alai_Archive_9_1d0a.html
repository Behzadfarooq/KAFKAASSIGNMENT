<p>Hi Alai, many thanks for your kind answer. My Lombard is not so fine. Seemengly there is no 'Brèsa' article at Lombard wiki. According to lmo main page, that version started on september 2005, so maybe it's too soon. As far as I have understood, there is a certain effort of standardisation about ortography. My Italian is much worse than my bad Lombard, so I didn't read the Italian article (I am afraid I should admit I don't like that tongue at a first glance). Moreover someone told me about massive use of (not manually revised) machine translation there. There seems to be something strange within this question, but, if Lombardy is far enough from us, Italy is far away: some hysterical reactions from Italy seem nomothetic. But: <i>nomen omen</i>, so I should study a little about Lombardy. Cheers, --<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELombard06_618d.html" title="User:Lombard06">Lombard06</a> 15:31, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given my previously stated distaste for renaming the stub category at SFD to using the word placekicker, I would have appreciated some notice being given that you were nominating the non-stub parent for renaming at CFD, either in the SFD notice or on my talk page. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caer’s whines</small></a> 23:07, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was using the permacat to support my view that the stub category was correctly named. Still, the difference in terminology is not so great as to cause me to attempt to reverse what I consider to be a mistake. Placekicker isn't incorrect, it's just that kicker is more correct IMO, given that K and not PK is the usual abbreviation for the position. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caer’s whines</small></a> 02:51, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What Mcginnly means by that, I believe, is that Sarah hasn't significantly contributed to featured content.

<dd>There had to be one. No matter, we can see by the timestamps that Sarah reached her century before anyone opposed. Back to the point, however, agree that participation in featured articles is not an important criterion for admin. In any case, Sarah has written her share of good and consistently well-referenced articles.

<dd>Mcginnly has made over 6000 edits and is putting in a lot of work to raise article standards. He has earnt the right to his view, which merits respect, as it can only serve to improve the project by focusing attention on the primary purpose of creating a world class encyclopedia. (Nevertheless, of course, Sarah should still be an admin!) <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 06:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If Mcginnly believes that 1FA is crucial to being a good admin, it's necessary to point out how flawed reasoning that is. If he's doing it to "focus attention" on anything accept the suitability of the current candidate in each case, I refer you to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. In the absence of any clear statement from Mcginnly that it's the latter, I'm going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> that the former applies. The point of RfA is to reach a consensus, not to log "votes" that fly in the face of community standards. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:33, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Editors are entitled to apply such standards as they see fit, and this has previously been accepted, provided that it has been done in good faith. Consensus does not require unanimity, and community does not require conformity, or it could not evolve. 1FA has been applied by others in the past, but, as yet, not widely adopted. Further discussion would be best on RfA talk. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 10:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's true that editors may apply their own standards. I just believe, however, that the 1FA rule should not be the <i>only</i> thing to influence one's vote. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGray_Porpoise_faa8.html" title="User:Gray Porpoise">Gray Porpoise</a> 10:31, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then that is your standard. I dare say Mcginnly has other requirements in addition to that. Other people have different sticking points, some over edit summaries, for example, even if the candidate performs well otherwise. Consensus is arrived at through the sum of individual contributions, not through requiring conformance of every single one. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 10:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi there Alai, it says at the top that I'm allowed to 'Voice my opinion' on each candidates request for adminship. I must say I find it a bit of a stretch to suggest that because I register an oppose vote this is "fly[ing] in the face of community standards". I'm a member of this community and vote according to my conscience. I'm an editor, I contribute content; my conscience says that if I have a vote for those who will police me, then I would like to satisfy myself that the candidate understands what editing involves.<br /></dd>
<dd>If I were an apple farmer in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a> would I vote for a Aeronautical engineer from <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_New_Guinea_eb0d.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> to be my <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>, or another apple farmer in Somerset? The answer is I might well vote for the engineer if the field of apple farmers is scant or if he had a great insight into issues relating to Somerset, but I'm much more likely to vote for someone who understands how to grow apples and can sympathise with the difficulties and joys of apple production. For clarity I was refering to the number of quality encylopedia building edits, 1FA is not my only standard, but is my <i>main</i> standard (I'd even go for a few GA's or a good portal or well anything that shows this person can sit down with a book, type it up and help with content.) I'm really not interested in <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a> (and I'm actually quite annoyed at the suggestion) and I think that Tyrenius's suggestion to continue this on the talk page is a good idea.--<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 13:09, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mcginnly, we're not trying to deny you the right to your vote, we're just pointing out that the standard is, when used alone, flawed. Regardless, a single vote is not going to change the high likelihood of Sarah Ewart becoming an admin. I believe that she'll be a great admin, and that you may be happy with the outcome. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGray_Porpoise_faa8.html" title="User:Gray Porpoise">Gray Porpoise</a> 20:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Mr Porpoise, I think you're the second person who has pointed out that an FA standard is flawed but not explained why. I can imagine that single issue voting is flawed, and I can imagine other reasons why this person will be a great admin (see below), but I can't see why asking for evidence this user can contribute meaningful quantities of quality work to the encyclopedia is a flawed position to take. Perhaps you can show me where I'm going wrong.--<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 21:10, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the reply. It's not flawed to ask that a user can contribute meaningful quantities of quality work. However, what I'm saying is, the thing that <i>is</i> flawed is only looking at <i>featured content</i> contributions. Sarah has performed countless good reverts, restorations of content, interactions with users- important things that should be looked for in an adminship candidate- and occasional quality additions of content in the midst of those. I'm not going to bother you until you change your vote; I'm just sharing what I think. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGray_Porpoise_faa8.html" title="User:Gray Porpoise">Gray Porpoise</a> 21:31, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me first of all reiterate what I already tried to express, that my WP:POINT comment related to Tyrenius's "focusing attention" rationale supplied on your behalf, and not to your "vote" as such. Your MP comparison is far from the mark however: firstly, you're not selecting a legislative representative, in any sense whatsover; secondly, you're not electing a fixed number of positions, but filling a pool (or declining to) for which there's ever-increasing demand. If apple farmers only vote for other apple farmers, we'll have not just a highly undesirable degree of factionalisation, but before long, too few active admins. It's rather more like "voting" for a special constable and/or part-time roadsweeper in a city where the citizens are regularly rioting in the streets, and the litter has piled up to be about hip deep (and rejecting them on the basis of failing to have an apple tree). You should not be asking yourself, 'how much like me is this person as an editor?', but 'will they put the tools to good use?', and balance that against 'is there a significant risk that they will misuse the tools?'. It's one thing to ask "that the candidate understands what editing involves", but to equate that with being a major contributor to a FA is an entirely different matter. (Bear in mind that the FA process is at bottom a contest to get onto the main page, and thus subject to periodic ratcheting up of standard to reflect current best work -- as is reflected in the fact that for some time, we've had more admins than FAs (and nor can we be alleged to have too many admins).) Your suggested alternatives are less unreasonable as such (I was going by a second-hand characterisation of your criteria), but similarly fail to address the job description: why is the writer of several GAs better qualified than a "wikignome" to perform the many essentially wikignomish tasks on our many backlogged admin tasks? Or put another way: would you rather have admin tasks done by someone you consider to be an inexperienced editor in articlespace, or left undone by people you consider better editors in that regard? Or at best, to divert from from continuing to do so. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello Alai, there seemed little purpose in continuing our debate on the RfA page (and all from one little vote). In future I'll be modifying my question, not to insist on 1FA but to demonstrate some kind of commitment at some stage to the business of writing an encylcopedia, as you say "that the candidate understands what editing involves". I'll explain why in a moment, but first I'd like to comment on your last response:- The nub of your argument appears to be, that in taking this approach (Or a strict 1FA approach), we risk 1. some sort of factionalism 2. an ever falling number of admins. Well firstly I don't see the mechanism by which the factionalism will arise - there's plenty of admins out there now who don't have much interest in editing, and plenty that do, my argument is that Administrators needs to understand and have experience of the wide range of activities permissible within wikipedia because whilst they may stake out their turf at say "stub proposals" they are inevitably drawn into other areas of wikipedia and so they need to be generalists. Secondly, Adminship is often portrayed as a benign janitorial drudge, but my concerns stem from an increasing awareness that the admins are also our police force. Category deletion, page un-deletion and most of the other powers which admins are given I'm pretty ambivalent about but the power to block and ban users it seems, can cause serious problems for the project if mis-used. I wouldn't like to see the numbers of admins decline, but I'd like to see the quality of admins increase and if a decline in numbers is the result then so be it. I disagree with you about the level or severity of that consequent crisis in any event - particularly weighed against such crisis and ill feeling as were engendered at say the Carnildo 'events'. So there's my position staked out - I'd like to see intelligent calm generalists that can have some understanding for every contributors positions - not just RC patrollers who bring their 'take no prisoners' vandal fighting attitude to bear on established (and powerless) editors just trying to plough their furrow. Mostly for laughs have a chuckle at this diff. (Damn can't find the diff! give me a moment) Hypothetically if this person was a great wikignome (I'm sure he isn't) would you support his adminship? --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 12:45, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see your point, and I had considered that. However, I figured "or" was the lesser of two evils. The vast majority of the stubs pertain to Ottawa itself, where, as you said, the "and" makes sense, but I would also suggest the "or" would not. For stubs pertaining to topics outside Ottawa, the "and" arguably makes a little less sense, unless one views it as pertaining to Ottawa since it is in the Ottawa area. I figured "and" made sense in more cases than "or" (and made more sense on the face of the template itself, since the two are not mutually exclusive). Having said that, maybe using a backslash (Ottawa/National Capital Region), or an "and/or", would be the best solution? I'm not too bothered by the issue overall, if you believe "or" to be the best. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 15:47, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Alai. I've proposed that we open a public discussion about 'mainland China', and when referring to China economically and in sports events etc., whether China needs to be renamed to 'mainland China' or not. As far as I'm aware, only Instantnood is advocating distinguishing these too (is this violating WP:Undue_Weight?). In my discussions with him I've proposed that a footnote be placed next to the statistics, where in the footnote, the full reference and explanation will be placed. This way it won't detract from the flow of the main encyclopedic article, yet those who question the statistic can easily seek a more full explanation. What do you think? I do fear that Instantnood is launching an unencyclopedic, HK-is-not-PRC-in-almost-every-area crusade which may damage Wikipedia's credibility as a NPOV and encyclopedic source. <a href="../../../j/s/w/User%7EJsw663_4769.html" title="User:Jsw663">Jsw663</a> 14:28, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

   For each user skin there is a CSS file you can edit. If you edit the CSS file you can change the default color. For example, to go your monobook(the default skin) CSS file enter User:Aelfthrytha/monobook.css, edit the page with this:
</pre>
<p>A:link {color:green;} A:visited {color:orange;}</p>
<pre>
   This will change the new and visited links to green and orange, respectively. You can either write the name of the color, or use a hex triplet (e.g. #ff0000 = Red) if you want to try a wide variety of palettes. —<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelfthrytha_8770.html" title="User:Aelfthrytha">Aelfthrytha</a> 03:52, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I myself almost always type it in the way I spell it unless I'm paying special attention. I won't object if anybody insists to move it, but IMHO its usage on Wikipedia shall reflect the reality outside of Wikipedia that both are commonly used, and in some places and for some organisations -<i>o</i> is more commonly used instead. The colour/color rule may perhaps apply. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 20:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>HI Alai I am not an administrator, the instructions say once we empty a stub category (with approvals) to do a speedy delete. Please advise what is "normal fashion" for a speedy delete of a stub category? I am really lost on "craft" stubs, tried 2x to request its removal, using the instructions. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 15:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>oKAY thanks for your "speedy" help today. I think I'll make some proposed changes to the stub instruction page, one of the things it mentions is to propose speedy deletes, but let me review it in full as a newcomer I can see where its not easy to follow. You seem very experienced can I send you suggested edits for comment? <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 16:23, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Further to the recent discussion regarding Building and structure stubs - where the stub categories were renamed to the singular (or are in the process of being renamed). Do you think the root category <a href="../../../b/u/i/Category%7EBuildings_and_structures_762b.html" title="Category:Buildings and structures">Category:Buildings and structures</a> should also be renamed (and all sub cats) or is it normal for the root category to be plural (because it contains building<b>s</b> and the stubs to be singular - becuase each article is about just one buildings? By the way I never thanked you for our productive debate regarding adminship you made some good points which I've been chewing on.--<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 10:59, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I created the Albania-bio-stub and as I am stubsorting, I have encountered an even more significant problem than the one I stated on the proposal board. What should be done with Albanian diaspora? For example, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB.html" title="Arbëreshë">Arbëreshë</a> are ethnic Albanians that live in Italy. They are quite ethnically "Albanian", but not from the Republic of Albania in the modern sense. Should they be included under Albania-bio-stub or Italy? Neither one fits quite appropriately. Also, was there even a consensus as to a Kosovo-stub?--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 14:26, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>HI please set up new stub category for the Presov Region in Slovakia. There are hundreds upon hundreds in this region probably far more than nitra and banska bystrica. I will be going through them all so please set it up for me. Please do it is advance just look at all my entries for the Nitra region- the whole region to show that the category is well worth setting up. It will save time later changing from slovakia=geo-stub to presov-geo-stub <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 11:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK mate. Promise you will count the number of stubs exactly one month from now and I bet you £1 million that you will find well over hundred!! OK but I am not going to be the one going through them afterwards and changing them from slovakia to presov. Trust me. OK you have been told in advance. THis is like wondering whether it will ever rain again .It will inevitably happen <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 17:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey if I create 32 new entries this will allow it to have the new stub cat. agreed. I will use the main tag for now but shall I tell you when I reach 60. I am not just going to stop there. Please look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_villages_and_municipalities_in_Slovakia_3ddc.html" title="List of villages and municipalities in Slovakia">List of villages and municipalities in Slovakia</a> and see all of the entries up to the beginning of Presov.

<p>Do you mean e.g Bardejov-geo-stubs etc. hmm. I don't know I think it may be less confusing to have regional categories. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 17:52, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>HI again no at the time I dind't realise I had set up the presov geo stub what I was going on about was the fact that there will be almost 1000 entries fro the presov region and that it wasn't created only under Slovakia geo stub. That is what I meant!! I know it will be cluttered at the end but I shouldn't waste to much time on districtizing the stubs. After all its only meant to be a temporary category to write them into fuller articles quicker. All the best mate <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 19:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some districts like Popov District I think only have like 10 villages. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 19:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
