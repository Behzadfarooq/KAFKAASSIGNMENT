<p>I have received a very strong complaint about this article, and so I have protected this very short version for tonight.</p>
<p>Unlike the normal case where protected articles should not be edited, I want to try an experiment -- admins can edit this article. We need to verify very carefully, with documentable sources, every single fact in the article.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 00:09, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is just about unprecedented. "A very strong complaint" - I think we can guess who that is. Jimmy Wales has now pared back the article to show almost nothing, just D's works. What I think has happened is that Dershowitz has taken note over the controversy over the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr_3774.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr">John Seigenthaler Sr</a> article, and Dershowitz has realised that this gives him an opportunity to pressure Wikipedia into removing critical and unflattering info on him on Wikipedia. Over the last few weeks several anonymous users have slowly been removing any info which is critical to Dershowitz. It would be interesting to know where those IPs are coming from. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 00:48, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Checking some of the IPs reveals Harvard University. It's clear that someone at Harvard, probably Dershowitz, has been removing unflattering information about Dershowitz. A bit of an own goal. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 00:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Somebody should add back all the stuff that looks OK but keep that in HTML comments until it is sourced. --mav 01:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FWIW, everything that's currently there checks out. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 01:57, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is disturbing that admins have now been granted the right to decide what truth is. The page should be immediately unprotected. Any anonymous vandals (including Dershowitz himself) should simply be banned.

<dd>I agree with Mark, though I suspect that A.D. has better things to do than "vandalize" his own wikipedia entry. Jonshea 13:20, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sure he does. I wish he would. However, 4 of the contributors (3 with no usernames) who vandalised the article have been traced to Harvard. The only one with a username (<a href="../../../f/a/k/User%7EFakeName_0409.html" title="User:FakeName">User:FakeName</a>) has been banned for vandalism, which no doubt made Dershowitz desperate, and he complained to Wales. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 13:44, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, Mr. Dershowitz might not have better things to do than keep track of the Wikipedia entry. After all, if you type the words Alan Dershowitz into Google, this entry is the third link, after his own staff page and a CNN article on his views of torture. If the third link of your name was a problematic entry that touts itself as being part of an encyclopedia, you'd probably set aside a couple minutes to muck around. -- Guy</dd>

<dd>The form of protection being used here is a very, very bad idea, and fundamentally un-wiki. If this is to be used in this article, what stops it from being used in any other controversial article? Soon we will have a wiki where only admins can edit <b>any</b> controversial article. Adminship is supposed to be no big deal, but this will make it the most important thing on Wikipedia.

<dl>
<dd>I have to agree. It may just be an experiment, but it's not a good experiment. Furthermore, I think there needs to be a standard procedure for dealing with such complaints <i>in the community</i>. An example procedure would be this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Someone complains to the Board or to Jimbo that a Wikipedia article is libelous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) A standard letter will be sent back, noting that the complaint is being examined, and asking for permission to publish it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) The article is replaced with a template similar to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">Template:Copyvio</a>, which states that a complaint has been expressed that it contains libelous information. It links to the most recent revision, and encourages Wikipedians to check the facts and rewrite the article at [[{{PAGENAME}}/Libel check}]]. The article page is protected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) A template is added to the top of [[{{PAGENAME}}/Libel check}}]]. It says something like: "The Wikimedia Foundation has been informed that revision A of the article B may be libelous. Please only restore information from that revision here after it has been discussed and verified on the discussion page. Once the check is completed, the main article can be replaced with the newly edited version."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The wiki process can then take its course. By letting the rewrite take place on a subpage of the main article, we make it clear to the complainant that we take their concerns seriously. Visitors from Google will no longer be directly presented with the offending revision. In fact, it will only be in the version history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There may be cases where it is advisable to immediately delete an offending revision because it is <i>obviously</i> libelous. To be able to deal with such cases, it may be advisable to create a formal "libel team" that can perform steps 2-4, or take more drastic action if necessary. This could be done by means of a mailing list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The approach of "Jimbo blanks article, and admins rewrite it" is simply not scalable and too prone to be abused by anyone who doesn't like their bio in Wikipedia. There needs to be a wiki process to deal with these complaints.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 10:14, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I see some merit, in this limited case, of only admins being able to add info, because admins are editors whom the community trusts, I don't think this should be a precedent for how we should act in the future. Although pages like the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> are editable only by administrators, the difference is that it is for adminitrative expediency, saving much wasted time reverting obvious vandalism. If Wikipedia pursues the same course of action for further complaints, it could render the encyclopedia toothless and tame; although there may be cause for concern about some of the "facts" presented in the article(s) complained about, it opens the door to unwelcome influences, I believe. Eloquence's suggestions appear quite reasonable and workable. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">Enochlau</a> 11:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even though I can't edit this aticle, I don't think the removal of "uncited criticism" is a bad thing. This kind of thing encourages the removal of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and the addition of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">cited information</a>. What I don't like is that this kind of "squeaky wheel gets the grease" encourages praise while discouraging criticism. I don't know if we should condone the actions of someone who just removes information about himself without discussing it on the talk page itself. I'd imagine a good dose of legal threats was a part of the conversation with Jimbo as well. I just hope this isn't the way we'll do things in the future: it seems very unwiki to only allow admins to edit an article just because the subject started to complain about it. Pretty soon, people will know that's the way to have an article about them appear in the best possible light: just complain to Jimbo, and bingo!

The Wikipedia Vandalism policy explicitly exempts "Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered" from being vandalism. FakeName, it seems, cut and paste Dersh's bio from his own home page.

<p>I know this section is controversial, so I thought I'd put something up on the page before editing. The plagiarism charge is technically false according to the standard definitions of plagiarism. Check Wikipedia's entry on plagiarism. Finkelstein argues that Dersh should have cited to secondary sources instead of primary sources. Check out the Chicago Manual of Style's website online if you don't believe the wikipedia entry. Moreover, Dershowitz does cite to Peters, so it's not as though he's not acknowledging Peters. If this section is to be neutral, it must include the fact that according to the rules of citation, Finkelstein's charges are incorrect. According to Finkelstein's definition of plagiarism, dershowitz is guilty of plagiarism, but not according the academic community at-large. Cttck 14:46, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that's correct. Plagiarism occurs when the <i>author's source</i> is not cited. If Dershowtiz cited the primary sources when in fact he got his information from Peters then that is plagiarism. According to Avi Shlaim (the Oxford academic) in last week's <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>, the plagiarism charge is proven: 'Shlaim believes the plagiarism charge "is proved in a manner that would stand up in court." --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 15:08, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this confuses things unnecessarily. The source one uses should be cited otherwise it's a kind of fraud. By coincidence I have just added a quotation from the <i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i> to the article on Fatah <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah#History" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah#History" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah#History</a> here. I cited the author, Baumgarten, because that's the source I used. If I had cited the primary source, the Fatah publication <i>Filastinuna</i> that would have implied not only that I speak Arabic (I don't), but that I have carried out archival research on documents in that language (I haven't), i.e., I would be implying that I have skills and experience that I don't have. Not surprsingly, students have their examination results overturned and occasionally get thrown out of university for plagiarism, that is, for passing off the work of others as their own. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 15:52, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>right, but what you think confuses things and may be a certain type of fraud is not necessarily "plagiarism." You've got a definition, and Dersh's practices violate that definition. But according to the definition of plagiarism of the mainstream academy, this practice is not plagiarism. See freedman's analysis in dersh's response. www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dershowitz/Letters/accusationresponse.html . My point in raising this is that this is a serious charge and repeating it, even as someone else's opinion is misleading unless the full context is shown. Cttck 16:18, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dershowitz has claimed that he examined all the <em>original</em> sources, hence did not need to cite Peters as the source of the sources. While there may be a point that someone got sloppy along the way in the cite-checking, overall I'd say that seems to be pretty penny-ante stuff over which to be charging plagiarism.

<dd>I assume Finkelstein would say that it's not a case of poor cite checking, but of lifting false claims from a disreputable volume that was written, according to www.nybooks.com/articles/5249 Yehoshua Porath, "as if the Zionist myths were wholly true and relevant, notwithstanding all the historical work that modifies or discredits them". Finkelstein's point is that the claims detailed couldn't have come from the original sources as those sources don't contain them - they are from Peters. However, the plagiarism charge is a small part of Finkelstein's critique of Dershowitz's standards; hence it only appears in Appendix I of <i>Beyond Chutzpah</i>, pp. 229-254. The more general point Finkelstein's is making is that "his violations of elementary academic standards accordingly warrant exposure. In addition, they illustrate the complete lack of quality control when it comes to discourse on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dershowitz can appropriate from a hoax with impunity due to an environment that tolerates such derelictions so long as the conclusions are politically correct". --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 20:23, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Norman Finkelstein wants to say Alan Dershowitz relies on poor sources, welcome to another day in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If the claim is <em>plagiarism</em>, I'd say that's a different kind of charge, and which there should be far more backing here before it is considered even arguable. Being on the same side, very broadly speaking, is hardly being a plagiarist (and necessarily would entail some common sources). Dershowitz clearly acknowledges Peters, but that shouldn't be an implied guilt by association in a hoax. Cribbing some common cites can be a bit embarrassing, certainly, but hardly an indictment in itself. Seth Finkelstein 00:49, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are talking about a different claim, i.e., "If Norman Finkelstein wants to say Alan Dershowitz relies on poor sources". The point Finkelstein is making is that Dershowitz plagiarized a poor source (i.e., he didn't acknowledge Peters as in the rather easy to follow example of Peters' use of www.democracynow.org/static/dershowitzFin.shtml turnspeak) and that the subsequent acclaim for the book is an indictment of standards on this issue. In any case we can certainly quote Avi Shlaim that the plaigiarism charge "is proved in a manner that would stand up in court." --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 20:39, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

When he uses the words of others, he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources (Mark Twain, Palestine Royal Commission, etc.) [Finkelstein’s] complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source, in which Dershowitz may have come upon them.

<dd>This is precisely what Dershowitz did. Moreover, many of the sources quoted both by Dershowitz and Peters are commonly quoted in discussions of this period of Palestinian history. Nor can it be said that Dershowitz used Peters’ ideas without attribution. He cites Peters seven times in the early chapter of his book, while making clear that he does not necessarily accept her conclusions. This is simply not plagiarism, under any reasonable definition of that word."</dd>

"The plagiarism charge is technically false according to the standard definitions of plagiarism." -- You (and the others in the discussion above) are doing original research; it's inappropriate and irrelevant. What's relevant is what charges have been made and what rebuttals have been offered out in the real world, not what Wikipedians think of them. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 02:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I deleted most of this section because it struck me as a LOT of discussion about something that had been disproven. I almost deleted the whole thing, but since there is so much discussion about the meaning of plagiarism, I presume you need some reference to the controversy. Nevertheless, why would you include an accusation by Finkelstein that had been independently investigated by Harvard and proven wrong? To include it in a biography of Dershowitz seems fundamentally unfair. To wit: if I accused someone of being a child molester and their employer/the police/Wikipedia commissioned an investigation which resulted in their being completely exonerated of these charges, would it be fair to include the accusation in a biography of them (even with the reference to the exoneration)? Wouldn't the appropriate thing be to eliminate the accusation once it was established that it was false? It's kind of a soft McCarthyism: "You're a communist." "No, I'm not, and third parties have investigated and proven otherwise." "Well, we'll publicize the accusation and your defense and let the people decide."</p>
<p>There is a larger issue with this whole biography, in that it seems unbelievably long, and most of the discussion is devoted not to cases he worked on, or positions that he has taken, etc. (whatever their merits - and I concede he has made some pretty reckless accusations in his career), but to personal disputes between him and other people. Who cares? Why do these things belong in a biography? Should a biography of George Washington on Wikipedia include every accusation made by every contemporary of Washington against him (and every rebuttal by Washington and his defenders)? Is the reason that a Washington Bio excludes this info because it is hard to find given the historical timeframe, or because it is ultimately irrelevant to describing his importance as a public figure?</p>

<p>Dershowitz's controversial position on torture has been the subject of a great deal of discussion. It should at least be mentioned in the article. Here www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/17/60minutes/main324751.shtml is a mainstream reference for Dershowitz's expressed views on this matter. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 06:04, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This section still has some major npov problems. It's two paragraphs of reasonable synopsis of AD's position on torture, followed by three paragraphs of other people's opinion that torture is a bad idea.</p>
<p>A "point of view" doesn't become a "neutral point of view" just because someone else said it, and you "sourced" it.</p>
<p>This the 'Alan Dershowitz' page, and it should fairly depict his life and accomplishments. Being neutral means including the good with the bad, but it doesn't mean this page should be a showcase for his critics.</p>
<p>It's a fact that AD supports torture warrants. That should definitely be here.</p>
<p>"our legal system is perfectly capable of dealing with the exceptional hard case without enshrining the notion that it is okay to torture a fellow human being" is 100% point-of-view, opinion.</p>
<p>It isn't as if anyone is going to read this page and think "AD supports torture? Wow. I wonder whether anyone else thinks torture is a bad idea..."</p>
<p>If criticism of people who support torture is important enough to be in Wikipedia, then I propose that it go on its own page.</p>

One element of a wiki process can very much be a temporary timeout in which only trusted users are allowed to rebuild an article.

<p>Dershowitz contacted Jimbo with a "strong complaint". Dershowitz, or his assistant, edited his own article, removing unflattering info and adding flattering info. Then he was banned. Presumably, he then complained to Jimbo, who deleted most of his article and allowed only admins to edit it.</p>

<dd>It is equally probable that it was an eager research assistant of his or another Harvard fan of Dershowitz's. They might have then complained to Dershowitz, leading to him sending the letter. However, if Dershowitz himself made the legal threat posted on a user's talk page, I think this is very, very serious and a chilling sign for Wikipedia. Looking at the old version, it is not defamation that is the problem, but what Wikipedia users considered the most notable aspects of his biography. While Wikipedia is sometimes idiosyncratic, this has cultural origins and should not be a reason to exclude these elements. In fact, they are what make Wikipedia unique and valued. I hope they will be returned in a NPOV manner. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 17:01, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I concede that it might be Mitch Webber, his assistant. But the effect is the same. A legal threat in typical Dershowitz language posted on Wikipedia, followed by a real legal threat to Jimbo via email " this could not conceivably be coincidence.

<p>Following the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, Dershowitz has advocated the issuance of warrants allowing <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> suspects to be tortured if there is an "absolute need to obtain immediate information in order to save lives coupled with probable cause that the suspect had such information and is unwilling to reveal it". Under Dershowitz's proposal, the government would be forbidden to prosecute the torture subject based upon information revealed under this interrogation method www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/01/22/ED5329.DTL. Dershowitz has suggested that the torture might take the form of a "sterilized needle underneath the nail", and that the torture would have to be non-lethal. He contends that torture would be used in a "<a href="../../../t/i/c/Ticking_bomb.html" title="Ticking bomb">ticking bomb</a>" case whether or not the law permitted it, and that it would be less destructive to the rule of law to regulate the process than to leave it up to the discretion of individual law-enforcement agents. "If torture is going to be administered as a last resort in the ticking-bomb case, to save enormous numbers of lives, it ought to be done openly, with accountability, with approval by the president of the United States or by a Supreme Court justice" edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/03/03/cnna.Dershowitz/.</p>
<p>These views have been severely criticized by many other civil libertarians. Harvey Silverglate argues that the necessity defense would already protect police officers in the hypothetical ticking-bomb case, and that "our legal system is perfectly capable of dealing with the exceptional hard case without enshrining the notion that it is okay to torture a fellow human being" www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/other_stories/multipage/documents/02042267.htm. <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> argues that Dershowitz's ticking-bomb hypothetical is unrealistic because "the authorities know that a bomb has been planted somewhere; know it is about to go off; know that the suspect in their custody has the information they need to stop it; know that the suspect will yield that information accurately in a matter of minutes if subjected to torture; and know that there is no other way to obtain it." It also argues that employing authorized torture would erode <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a>'s ability to stand up for human rights abroad www.amnestyusa.org/about/dershowitzreview.html. The <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_for_Constitutional_Rights_46e1.html" title="Center for Constitutional Rights">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, debating Dershowitz on <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, argued that Dershowitz's proposal would create a "very slippery slope" and that torture would "happen under more than those exceptional circumstances. It's going to start becoming the regular, rather than the unusual" transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0511/08/acd.02.html.</p>

<p>I think the current language misrepresents Silvergate's point.</p>
<p>"Silverglate states that the necessity defense protects police officers in the hypothetical ticking-bomb case,"</p>
<p>Actually, Silvergate argues jury nullification and executive clemency would protect them. Dudley and Stephens stands for the proposition that the necessity defense doesn't protect things like murder. Silvergate points to the pardon of Dudley and Stephens or jury nullification as a way of protecting police officers whose actions community norms feel are justified.Cttck 22:08, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Dershowitz, Silverglate, Bush, "community norms" all seem to converge on okaying torture. So much for the law, the Constitution and the fact that only on TV does torture work. A couple of these guys are lawyers, Bush and "community norms" aren't - guess which ones have an excuse. Where is a section on the Chomsky debate - I happened to see it. I was embarrassed for Dershowitz. A Harvard professor should be able to do better than that, even when he has no argument. It was probably embarassing/difficult for Chomsky to have to listen to the ad hominem attacks without losing his composure.</p>

<p>I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea. I admit I'm a little skeptical, but let's try this protection for a few days, or maybe a week or two, and see how it works out. An "under construction" version of the article could be created for non-admins, or they could simply post suggestions here.</p>
<p>Clearly you've got an exceptional circumstance, in that you've got someone, probably Dershowitz or some associate of his, complaining and making legal noises. That's not good in itself, but we can make it a good thing by using it as an opportunity to try something a little different, feel out new approaches. This should not be regular business by any means, but if this works, we shouldn't be afraid to employ it, at least temporarily, for really high-profile articles and articles which get some sort of special complaint associated with them. Of course, what we should really be looking at is having a dual encyclopedia, where we can have non-editable articles up front as the "main" encyclopedia, the more "public" encyclopedia, and then a secondary encyclopedia where we'll all be working on the articles to make them better, and get quality changes approved for addition into the "public" encyclopedia. I think we're a ways away from that still, but we should be looking in that direction. I don't believe in sacrificing openness, in making it anything less than free, but there are ways to refine that approach so we take the best from it and limit the negative effects.</p>
<p>As for the actual contents, we don't need Dershowitz dictating the content of his article. That will spell doom for much of Wikipedia, if people think they can pressure us into giving them positive bios. What we need, of course, is the same as all articles, which is verifiability and neutrality. In this case, let's just be more strict about those things than usual. If Dershowitz is going to complain about verifiable and neutral content, then we will have to just tell him that we've done the best we can do. But we can certainly hope he'd be satisfied by verifiability and neutrality. Either way, we can get a better article out of it all. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:43, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you can clear up my misunderstandings, I would be delighted. Why was the history deleted from this page? The only reason that comes to mind is to prevent people from seeing it. If you can prevent people from obtaining information by "moving" it where it's unlikely to be found, as well as "deleting" it, I don't see any big difference.

<li>I gotta agree with Mirror here -- arguing whether they were "deleted" is a semantic point, but there was a move carried out that seems to me to have no other point but to hide the previous revisions away from general inspection. Looking at the history, one has no indication of the hundreds of other edits that took place. But the main problem is that I don't see the point of this -- if these edits place us at legal risk, they should be <i>really</i> deleted. If they don't, they should be in the history of the article. What was the motivation for moving the history out? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Dragon_c7bc.html" title="User:The Dragon">The Dragon</a> 20:29, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>For larger articles, such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, which has 25,000 edits, it is inconceivable to delete/undelete (plus, according to brion, such a thing would kill the database). Plus, people would riot in the streets if their collective edit counts suddenly dropped by 25,000. So, I suggested to <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">User:Danny</a> to instead make it a habit, for now, to just move out older histories to a /old page.

The fact that it wouldn't work on the GWB page is irrelevant here.

<li>Well, I'm pretty sure that they would be "deleted" (please note that deleted edits are not removed from the database—admins can still view them easily), and my main concern was with complaints about people's edit counts dropping, not necessarily just here, but when this practice of deletion becomes more frequent. I suggested this as a temporary alternative until the situation was sorted out, and Danny was fine with it. If he or Jimbo say otherwise, then of course the edits should be recombined into the history, but they (Jimbo and Danny) are in a much better position (information-wise) to make such a determination. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-9 21:44</small>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> requires that the names of major contributors to a document appear with that document. The actions taken here are clearly meant to obscure the edit history and so might be construed as a violation of the GFDL. The actual risk of being sued over the GFDL in this case is probably exceedingly small, but I would suggest that this type of action should explicitly <i>not</i> be something we adopt as general practice. The Mediawiki software is designed to allow the authorship of deleted edits to be visible (though not their content), so as to satisfy the GFDL reporting requirements. I agree with above comments that it makes more sense to selectively delete libelous comments than to simply move them off to the side somewhere. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:43, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>One point about the article that I'd like to make is one I tend to make about biographical articles generally: it contains a section of selective quotes that are not tied together by any encyclopedic writing. Of its nature, any section of such quotes is difficult or impossible to check for neutrality. People come along and add a quote, but the selection of the quote and its placement say as much about the selector as about the subject. Think George W Bush: "Our enemies never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we"; Bill Clinton: "It depends what the meaning of "is" is." Both of those quotes could be used, appropriately, in an article about the two most recent Presidents. Neither would really be much use if just placed unadorned in the text.</p>
<p>As an encyclopedia we don't just pick and choose words from those that a person has said and plonk them down into an article, instead we write about those words that are considered significant--not by us but by named commentators, pundits, biographers, and whatnot, and cited in a particular context. And in doing so we should write <i>why</i> those particular words are considered important, and by whom. We should, in a sense, quote the quoters.--<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>One more specific suggestion. The following sentence: "Adhering to the Orthodox Jewish faith, Dershowitz attended Yeshiva University High School" could stand re-phrasing.

He could also be described as <i>prominent</i>, <i>high profile</i> or <i>controversial</i>.

<dd>The expression is neither positive nor negative. Stop whining about it.

If you read the www-tech.mit.edu/V122/N25/col25dersh.25c.html article in question, you'll see that it is a long and hysterical <i>ad hominem</i> attack on Chomsky. "Bitterly attacked" is a description that Dershowitz might well agree with, and I have not seen it described as inaccurate either in any published source or on this talk page. It is therefore fairly uncontroversial. You can edit it to something better (this is a wiki), but you can't whine on about it as you are. The project is not improved by sterilising our prose to "...stated... stated... stated...".

<p>I can't vouch for Penthouse, but...</p>
<p>" From The Best Defense, p. 392-93</p>
<p>Bailey retained me to help prepare the legal briefs in the Hearst case. As he told Shana Alexander, "In a heavy case, I'm apt to send it over to Alan." And this was certainly a heavy case -- both for Patricia Hearst and for F Lee Bailey. It was Bailey's opportunity to put the Turner debacle behind him and to reassert himself as America's top criminal trial lawyer. The trial was among the most widely covered legal events in history. As one journalist put it, the Hearst case promised to become "another Trial of the Century -- the fourth or fifth in [Bailey's] sixteen-year legal career."</p>
<p>The basic issue at the trial was whether Hearst had voluntarily participated in the Hibernia robbery, or whether she was still under the control and domination of her abductors at the time she entered the bank carrying a gun. The press referred to this as the "brainwashing" defense.</p>
<p>Bailery asked me to coordinate the legal research on that defense. I hired half a dozen law students to dig up every case in Anglo-American legal history in which a defendant had been abducted and had then joined the abductors in the commission of criminal acts. We drafted several detailed legal memoranda on various aspects of the psychological defenses, and sent them off to San Francisco, where Bailey and his staff were in the last stages of pretrial preparation.</p>
<p>I submitted another memoranda analyzing whether the government could cross-examine Patricia Hearst about what she had done during the year and a half between the bank robbery and her capture. The government would argue that if she had willingly participated in "revolutionary" acts during the months after the Hibernia robbery, then that willingness would constitute some proof that she also voluntarily participated in the previous Hibernia holdup. The defense would argue that subsequent events would not prove anything about her state of mind on the day of the robbery, since there had been an important intervening development between the Hibernia robbery and the others: the Attorney General of the United States, William Saxbe, had told the press that as a result of the bank robbery, Patricia Hearts was considered "nothing but a common criminal." Her SLA captors kept telling her, "You have been defined as a criminal by your country, and now you have no choice but to join us!"</p>

<dd>Yes, I've seen that now, and I'm still dubious. The site is an agency that handles speaking appearances, and Penthouse might have been included based on their usual meaning of "clients", which could include his regular writing engagements rather than legal representation, which is the meaning we want here. Given that Dershowitz has written for Penthouse, under some circumstances it might even be a conflict of interest for him to represent the magazine as a lawyer. I'm not saying that it <i>is</i>, but I would want information about what case he represented Penthouse in before including it in a list of clients here. On Patricia Hearst, I'll take the evidence provided as good. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 05:11, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no previous experience with the Dershowitz/Chomsky controversy, but I followed the linked essays from this page and they seem to be quite different from the Wikipedia description of the controversy. In particular, the Wikpedia page states that Dershowitz criticized Chomsky for the essay "Some elementary comments <i>etc.</i>" In fact, if you read the Dershowitz article (which I just did, for the first time), it appears that (with regard to the Faurisson affair) he is mainly criticizing other statements by Chomsky:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>My next encounter with Chomsky revolved around his writing an introduction to a book by an anti-Semite named Robert Faurisson who denied that the Holocaust took place, that Hitler’s gas chambers existed, that the diary of Anne Frank was authentic, and that there were death camps in Nazi occupied Europe. He claimed that the “massive lie” about genocide was a deliberate concoction initiated by “American Zionists” “and that “the Jews” were responsible for World War II. Chomsky described these and other conclusions as “findings” and said that they were based on “extensive historical research.” He also wrote that “I see no anti-Semitic implication in the denial of the existence in gas chambers or even in the denial of the Holocaust.” He said he saw “no hint of anti-Semitic implications in Faurisson’s work,” including his claim that “the Jews” were responsible for World War II. He wrote an introduction to one of Faurisson’s book which was used to market his anti-Semitic lies.</i> www-tech.mit.edu/V122/N25/col25dersh.25c.html</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of these quotations (that Chomsky said the findings were based on "extensive historical research", that there was "no anti-Semitic implication" and "no hint of anti-Semitic implications") do not seem to appear in the Chomsky essay which is linked. (In fact, as is plain from the title, Dershowitz' article is mainly about Chomsky's divestiture petition.)</p>
<p>Indeed, the Wikipedia article's statement that <i>Dershowitz stated that such a defense was akin to "flirtations with neo-Nazi revisionism and Holocaust denial"</i> seems plainly false: that quotation in the Dershowitz article is clearly not in response to "such a defense" of free speech, but rather is in reference to numerous other alleged statements by Chomsky.</p>

If you want to understand it, you have to go to <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faurisson_affair.html" title="Faurisson affair">Faurisson affair</a>. It is inaccurate to say that defending freedom of speech for objectionable people is "flirtations with neo-Nazi revisionism and Holocaust denial" in Dershowitz's opinion. Such a defence is fine by Dershowitz if done by himself or people he agrees with. But when done by his arch-enemy Chomsky, it is indeed an opportunity to make allegations of "flirtations with neo-Nazi revisionism and Holocaust denial".</dd>

<dd>Since Dershowitz himself declared that his problem with the Faurisson affair "revolved around his writing an introduction to a book by an anti-Semite named Robert Faurisson", I took him at his word and linked to the text of that "introduction" (in reality, an article that Chomsky wrote which ended up being used as a preface).</dd>

<dd>It is true however, that the following quotations are not from that text: "extensive historical research", "no anti-Semitic implication" and "no hint of anti-Semitic implications". The first is misattributed to Chomsky; it is a neutral phrase that occurs in the text of a petition signed by Chomsky and 500 others. He agreed enough with the gist of the petition to sign it, but did not write a word of it. The other two quotations are by Chomsky, appearing in a private letter. In an open letter, he expanded on this, pointing out that "[d]enial of monstrous atrocities, whatever their scale, does not in itself suffice to prove that those who deny them are racists vis-à-vis the victims." He proved this with various examples, such as "if a person ignorant of modern history were told of the Holocaust and refused to believe that humans are capable of such monstrous acts, we would not conclude that he is an anti-Semite."</dd>

<dd>Neither Dershowitz nor anyone has ever even attempted to refute this cast-iron argument. Instead, this lawyer has used the tried and tested technique of <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">equivocation</a>. That is to say, he reduces Chomsky's crystal-clear argument down to a sound-bite containing the word "implication", which has various definitions:
<ol>
<li>It can refer to the "action of implicating or the state of being implicated"www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/implication?view=uk; to implicate is to prove a connection to some wrongdoing. This is in line with Chomsky's talk of denial not sufficing to prove racism.</li>
<li>It can refer to the "logical relation between propositions <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> of the form ‘if <i>p</i> then <i>q</i>’; if <i>p</i> is true then <i>q</i> cannot be false"dictionary.reference.com/search?q=implication. Again, this is in line with Chomsky's unrefuted argument that there is no such relation between <i>p</i> (Holocaust denial) and <i>q</i> (racism).</li>
<li>It can refer to something that is implied, i.e. the "implicit conclusion that can be drawn from something"www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/implication?view=uk. We can divide this into two submeanings:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a) If we take "can be drawn" to mean "can and should be drawn", then this is in line with Chomsky's refusal to conclude that Faurisson's guilt was proven.</dd>
<dd>b) If we take "can be drawn" to mean "might conceivably be suggested", then this makes it look like Chomsky is denying that lots of Holocaust deniers are pro-Nazi. Since lots of Holocaust deniers <i>are</i> pro-Nazi, Chomsky must therefore be lying, or mistaken.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By asserting that Chomsky flirts with neo-Nazism, and juxtaposing this with the "no anti-Semitic implication" soundbite, Dershowitz leads the reader to skip the first three possible meanings of the phrase, and assume that the last one was intended. Since the last one leads to the conclusion that Chomsky is lying or mistaken, Dershowitz makes it look like he has scored some point. (Winning an argument by swapping the definitions on your opponent's words is a combination of the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">equivocation</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> logical fallacies.)</dd>

<dd>If anyone has any difficulty following this, it suffices to apply the logic to another situation. Let's say that instead of being accused of being a Nazi for being a revisionist, someone was accused of being a Nazi for having a shaven head and wearing big boots. Would the person's appearence implicate them (prove a connection)? Of course not. Is there a ‘if <i>p</i> then <i>q</i>’ logical relation such that if the person has that appearence, they cannot be a non-Nazi? Of course not. Can we and should we draw the conclusion that the person is a Nazi? Of course not. Might the person's appearence conceivably suggest they are a Nazi? Yes, of course, the statistical correlation between skinheads and far-right politics might lead us to jump to that conclusion, but we could easily be mistaken.

<dd>Noam Chomsky argued (a) that Robert Faurisson was innocent until proven guilty, (b) if it transpired that Faurisson was a "fanatical pro-Nazi", it would be even more important to defend his right to express his crazy views. Alan Dershowitz leapt upon this two-pronged argument and did his best to try to make it sound as though Chomsky agreed with Faurisson. Dershowitz well knows that "Faurisson's conclusions are diametrically opposed to views [Chomsky] hold[s] and ha[s] frequently expressed in print"www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/8102-right-to-say.html.</dd>

<dd>Dershowitz demonstrates that he has no problem allowing Nazis freedom of speech <i>when it suits him</i>. He not only argued that the Nazi Party should be able to march in Illinois, but went further and said that the Nazis had more right to march than Machteret in Israel because the Nazis went through the courts. He also demonstrates that <i>when it suits him</i>, he does not hesitate to vilify defenders of the same freedom. Over the Faurisson affair he attacked one person, Chomsky, for defending Faurisson. He did not say a word against <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Lipstadt_3be0.html" title="Deborah Lipstadt">Deborah Lipstadt</a> when she argued that Faurisson and other Holocaust deniers should be denied freedom of speech www.adl.org/braun/dim_14_1_deniers.asp.</dd>

<dd>Want another example of Dershowitz's selective application of these high principles? On 11 July 2005, the L.A. Times published an article blasting Dershowitz for attempting to get his buddy, the <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Governor of California</a>, to halt publication of <i>Beyond Chutzpah</i>, a book critical of Dershowitz www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=34.</dd>

People who have a mixed record don't generally have this mentioned in their Wikipedia article, as it is only notable when they are consistent in some way. I therefore support the status quo: no "freedom of speech" section. Should, however, such a section be reinserted, I insist that there be mention not just of the Nazi Party affair, but also the Faurisson affair and the Beyond Chutzpah affair, so that the reader may see the full picture and come to their own conclusions. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 14:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure this is accurate. The www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dershowitz/biography.html linked site says "Italian newspaper", but <i>Oggi</i> is:</p>

<li><i>www.americaoggi.info America Oggi</i>, an Italian-American newspaper</li>

<dd>-&gt; Xed, regarding the IP's, my guess is that it's the same person, not Dershowitz, at different locations. Matching the IP's doesn't prove it's him because that assumes it's a machine he and only he ever uses (i.e., both he and various assistants may use the machine). Now, I wouldn't stake my life on it not not being him. But I think you'd need some strong evidence to rule out a much more likely candidate of a research assistant. By the way, I don't think the person is reading this page. Again, what's wrong with just emailing Mitch Webber and asking? (I don't want to do it myself, since I've been very critical of Dershowitz's torture-related arguments, so I'd rather not get involved in anything which even sounds accusatory, even if it's in fact the exact opposite - too much potential for misunderstanding).

<dd>For similar reasons, I won't email Webber myself. There are several other people forensically investigating the issue who have greater technical knowledge than I. And I'm happy to leave them to it. Personally, I have enough definitive proof to know that several occasions of vandalism have come directly from the computer that Dershowitz uses to send his emails. To me, that suggests that it's Dershowitz. I think Harvard, or Dershowitz, can afford to give people their own computers. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 18:47, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just removed a number of names that had been added to the client list, including John Lennon, 2 Live Crew, Benjamin Spock, and William Shockley. I can't easily figure out in what way these have ever been Dershowitz's clients. They're not even on the fairly lengthy list from his lecture agency, the precision of which I've already cast doubt on above. Under these circumstances, I'm going to insist that people be able to provide information to support claims that X has been a client of Dershowitz, preferably by indicating the specific case involved.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that when speaking of an attorney, the word <i>client</i> refers to a relationship in which the attorney represents that party in some matter. Speaking and writing engagements from an organization do not make it a client in this sense. Nor does debating an issue publicly convert the side Dershowitz might take into his client. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:47, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

On the show, Dershowitz made numerous false claims that put him under fire, such as claiming the the research paper lifted material directly from "neo-nazi websites" and "radical islamic websites", claims he has not backed up. Critics also cited numerous unprofessional behavior in the directing of the show, such as the talk show talking over guest speaker <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> while pausing to give Dershowitz extra time to speak. There were also criticisms that the show seem staged and the lines rehearsed beforehand. www.vidilife.com/index.cfm?f=media.play&amp;vchrMediaProgramIDCryp=A842CC7D-F9D1-4B1B-AE76-5&amp;action=10</i></p>

<dl>
<dd>For the above to be put in, I think three things need to be identified:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Are the "false claims" actually false? Given that this cannot have happened more than a few weeks ago, has it been firmly established that Dershowitz's claims are false? Has Dershowitz had a right of reply?</li>
<li>Who are these "critics" of the show? Where does it verifiably say that the show was badly directed? Do the claims about Duke matter to the story - if there is one - about Dershowitz? Is there any evidence for the "staged" claim? Has it been published by any verifiable source?</li>
<li>(Perhaps most importantly) Is the incident <i>itself</i> important enough to warrant a paragraph in the Dershowitz article? Dershowitz is a prominent public academic, and appears in the media dozens if not hundreds of times a year. His views, as are stated in the article, are controversial, and he is regularly attacked by his (many) critics. Without this page becoming either a flame war, or too long, I think we need to differentiate between his major, long-running disputes (particularly with Chomsky and, lately, Finkelstein; although the two are very closely related) and small, minor, will-be-forgotten-within-a-few-months disputes over supposed, unverifiable claims made by unnamed "critics", which should not be included <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 19:52, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>That kind of behavior though from Dershowitz appears to be a consistent pattern. Therefore, I think that an article about him that doesn't mention that pattern smacks of being P.O.V. Barkmoss 18:11, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

This was in Janurary of 1986.

<dd>This seems to be fairly conclusive (although it really <i>doesn't</i> seem like Dershowitz; oh well. Rich tapestries and all that).

<dd>Are you trying to get some free porn from me? Well, here's a link to an article he wrote in 2004 for Penthouse.www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dershowitz/Articles/videotapes.html The source shouldn't be questionable to anyone since it comes from his Harvard webpage. I wish I could narrow down the time period for Dershowitz's contribution to the magazine, but I've been unable to establish when he started writing for Penthouse or if he's even still writing (does anyone have a current issue?). I'm guessing that he began writing for Penthouse shortly after he represented the people responisble for Deep Throat in the 1970s, but can't confirm that.Lokifer 22:29, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I re-wrote this section, making a number of changes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Dropped D's accusation that F's mother was a concentration camp Kapo. This is trivial: it is mentioned neither in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Finkelstein_13d4.html" title="Norman Finkelstein">Norman Finkelstein</a> nor <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dershowitz-Finkelstein_Affair_1783.html" title="Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair">Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair</a>.</dd>
<dd>2. Added F's charge that D did not write The Case for Israel.</dd>
<dd>3. Added F's charge that D ignored human rights group findings.</dd>
<dd>4. Added D's defense that Harvard exonerated him. I'm shocked this wasn't included.</dd>
<dd>5. Added D's defense that citing Peters' references is good scholarly practice.</dd>
<dd>6. Sentence about D's legal threats and their impact.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Overall, I tried to use language from <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Finkelstein_13d4.html" title="Norman Finkelstein">Norman Finkelstein</a>, and to give D &amp; F the same amount of text.<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagout_6a26.html" title="User:Ragout">Ragout</a> 03:33, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've deleted them because these were some of the edits that I believe were deleted after a formal complaint, and I'm not familiar with what was decided, except that they're not currently on the page.

He was also a member of the legal defense team ("Dream Team") for O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted in 1995 of double homicide <b>despite overwhelming evidence pointing towards guilt</b>."

<p>User Bibigon has twice reverted another contributor's citations and I believe wrongly so. bibigon claims <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> together with an online petition listing the names of the petition signers is insufficient evidence to support the point. I disagree. Bibigon appears to be pressing personal viewpoint, and fails to cite any Wikipedia policy to buttress his edit warring. Nowhere on Wikipedia is it stated that student newspapers are not to be cited. Like any respectable newspaper, the <i>Crimson</i> corrects its errors and has a solid reputation. To allow POV-pushing to disqualify reputable reporting is wrong. To also disqualify the evidence presented in an online petition that supports what the newspaper article says is non-neutral POV-pushing, pure and simple.</p>

<dd>I have issues with the passage being included on two counts. First, I am not convinced on the reliability of any student newspaper, not even Harvard's. Award winning though it may be, I've personally written for this paper in the past, and I know the fact checking that goes into it. Writers are often a bit loose with their attention to detail when taking down quotes, and the paper doesn't have any process for checking those quotes which a reporter submits. Second, I do not believe that the Harvard Crimson citation even supports the text that I removed. "The exchange brought to at least seventy-six the number of fellow Harvard professors Dershowitz has publicly described as “bigots”" implies that he's done so over the course of many years, and this is some running total. If the quote from the Harvard Crimson can be verified somehow, then this information could reasonably remain in the article, just rewritten. Perhaps along the lines of "Dershowitz said that anyone who signed the petition was a bigot." The current wording is extremely misleading. <a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibigon_e00e.html" title="User:Bibigon">Bibigon</a> 05:33, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would err on the side of caution when it comes to student papers, and as such I think I agree with Bibgon on this one. The relevant Wikipedia policy is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The <i>Crimson</i> is partly a self-publication under their definition, and as such should not be discounted but should certainly not be taken as gospel. I think we need at least a second source for the "bigots" comment to make it includable. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 08:44, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Harvard Crimson is not "partly a self-publication." The wiki-rules read: "A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses." The Crimson is owned by Harvard University, and articles are vetted by an editorial board. This argument is a feeble attempt at discrediting a newspaper that has been in existence since 1879, is routinely cited by national media organizations, and has included, over the years, a number of essays written by Dershowitz himself. Why is this a less reliable source than the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" which the article also cites. Why didn't Bibigon delete that? The bottom line is that Dershowitz has once again embarrassed himself with wild accusations and intemperate remarks, and his partisans want to whitewash the record. --Hiramhamilton 20:07, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd request that you try and refrain from making this personal. With that out of the way, while The Crimson is indeed quite old, it remains in some cases a self-publication, in that the editorial board doesn't check the veracity of quotes with other sources, and in this specific case, these quotes are key. I'm going to remove this section until a better source, or a corroborating source can be added. <a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibigon_e00e.html" title="User:Bibigon">Bibigon</a> 20:22, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am the King of England and in my days at Harvard, I edited <i>The Crimson</i> and was strict about fact-checking every single article, even the ads.</p>
<p>Okay, I see your raised eyebrow and itching fingers. You want to begin typing, "You are a liar. We can verify that you are not the King of England."</p>
<p>Yes. Anyone can verify that. What you can not verify is "in my days at Harvard" or "I edited <i>The Crimson</i> and was strict about fact-checking..." You would be correct in deducing that there is no credibility in my claim to having contributed to <i>The Crimson</i> because my claim is not subject to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a>.</p>
<p>www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html On the Internet, you can claim to have written for <i>The 'New Yorker</i> (or <i>The Crimson</i>, but an anonymous claim is not verifiable.</p>
<p>Whether bibigon's statements (or mine) about having written for <i>The Crimson</i> are true or not is beside the point. On Wikipedia, the standard is not truth but <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> That such a claim is anecdotal, and not subject to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> makes it worthless for the purpose of Wikipedia or in defense of summarily deleting another editor's contribution.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I were to claim to have written for <i>The Crimson</i>, that means www.thecrimson.com/info/about.aspx I am or have been a Harvard student. Only Harvard students or faculty write for and edit <i>The Crimson.</i></p>
<p>Bibigon wrote that he has "personally written" for <i>The Crimson</i> suggesting that he is or has been a Harvard student (or faculty). He further states: "I know the fact checking that goes into it. Writers are often a bit loose with their attention to detail when taking down quotes, and the paper doesn't have any process for checking those quotes which a reporter submits."</p>
<p>Bibigon, we will safely ignore your claim that you have "personally written" for <i>The Crimson</i> because it is not subject to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a>. We can, however, examine your claim about fact-checking by looking at <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact_checker.html" title="Fact checker">Fact checker</a> which states, 'The resources and time necessary for fact-checking are considerable. As a consequence, this work cannot be applied to copy filed on a daily basis. For this reason, fact-checking is not commonly done at most newspapers, where reporters' ability to correct and verify their own information in a timely manner is chief among their qualifications.</p>
<p>Therefore, the standard you apply to <i>The Crimson</i> is a false standard. No daily newspaper engages in fact-checking unless the accuracy of an article is challenged or a writer's honesty or attention to detail is questioned. Economics preclude it. However, when an article or writer's veracity is questioned, newspapers often go all out to determine the veracity of not only the article in question but other stories by the same author. <i>The Crimson</i> has recently been in the news for fact-checking and exposing, in April 2006, the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> of <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaavya_Viswanathan_b25c.html" title="Kaavya Viswanathan">Kaavya Viswanathan</a>, an event that resulted in widespread acknowledgement of worthy journalism by <i>The Crimson</i> and the cancellation of a $500,000 book publishing contract. <i>The Crimson's</i> story is/was the talk of the publishing world, and there would not have been a story--in any media-- without savvy fact checking by journalists at <i>The Crimson.</i> www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512948 www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512999 www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/books/29book.html www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/books/27cnd-author.html www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/books/26book.html</p>
<p>In the "see also" section of the Wiki article on Viswanathan, Wikipedia notes how <i>The Crimson</i> addressed problematic journalism when it was brought to their attention. Notice it is the same way daily newspapers deal with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Irina Serbanescu -- Harvard student ('03) who, in April 2001, was forced off the staffs of both <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Harvard_Crimson_092d.html" title="The Harvard Crimson">The Harvard Crimson</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Independent_6da1.html" title="Harvard Independent">Harvard Independent</a></i> after she plagiarized a 147-word passage from <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes_magazine.html" title="Forbes magazine">Forbes</a></i> magazine in a piece for the <i>Independent</i>. The <i>Crimson</i> retracted four articles written by Serbanescu in 2000-01; Serbanescu also resigned from positions at the <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_International_Review_8e17.html" title="Harvard International Review">Harvard International Review</a></i> and the <i>Harvard Book Review''</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You also stated, "Second, I do not believe that the Harvard Crimson citation even supports the text that I removed. "The exchange brought to at least seventy-six the number of fellow Harvard professors Dershowitz has publicly described as “bigots”" <i>implies that he's done so over the course of many years, and this is some running total.</i> The wording did not imply what you claim. The editor who added that link correctly linked to the article <b>AND</b> to the online petition listing the signers, which included 76 Harvard professors.</p>
<p>bibigon, your claims about the <i>The Crimson</i> are not <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a>. I believe I have carefully made the case to revert your changes.</p>
<p>It is wrong that you deleted this entry. If you had modified the language slightly, that would have been acceptable. To delete valid references smacks of POV-pushing.

<p>Batmanand-- you claim <i>The Crimson</i> is a self-publishing enterprise and therefore not suitable for use on Wikipedia. You say "The relevant Wikipedia policy is WP:RS."</p>

I fear you misunderstand Wikipedia policy on citing self-published books. <i>The Crimson</i> is not a book. It is an independent multi-million dollar publisher. 3. Your interpretation of "self-publishing" would disqualify every publication on earth in that they are all, by your definition, "self-published." <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkywriter_749b.html" title="User:Skywriter">Skywriter</a> 16:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK I do not have time right now to answer every single point that you have just made, but here goes for a brief rebuttal.</dd>
<dd>1. The Crimson <i>is</i> self-publishing in this case in that its editorial policies, whilst being pseudo-professional, are simply (by virtue of the fact that it is a student paper, for example, with a limited budget) not ever going to be at the level of a reputable national or international newspaper. This is backed up, anecdotally, by what Bibigon has said; he says that he has worked there, and they that they do not always adhere to strict journalistic standards. You state that Wikipedia values verifiablility above truth, which is true <i>in articles</i>, but is silly on talk pages. He was not saying "this is the truth", he was merely providing supporting evidence for his point of view in a talk page discussion. Also, remember to <a href="../../../a/f/g/WP%7EAFG_0e2c.html" title="WP:AFG">assume good faith</a>, especially when we are in a dispute such as this.</dd>
<dd>2. The <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaavya_Viswanathan_b25c.html" title="Kaavya Viswanathan">Kaavya Viswanathan</a> article should not be deleted, but note why not. If it was simply something that The Crimson had reported then it would be not be suitable for Wikipedia. However, it turned out that the allegations were picked up by <i>other, more reputable</i> sources. The story is of a plagarist and the student newspaper that caught her; the facts are backed up by research of other media outlets. The Crimson is not the only source cited in the article. If it was, perhaps it should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>3. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and the issue of self-publication are of course revelant to The Crimson. It is a multi-million dollar publisher, yes, but it is also a newspaper. As such, the guidelines still apply</dd>
<dd>I hope this clears a few things up. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 16:32, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Batmanand-- I appreciate your what you say but facts would add to your ability to persuade.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Crimson</i> does not have a "limited budget" as you claim. "The Harvard Crimson is a multi-million-dollar corporation. Funded by subscriptions and advertising revenue, The Crimson is independent of the University. The Crimson operates out of its own building located at 14 Plympton Street, which houses its own printing presses, making it one of the few college newspapers in the country that publishes on its premises."[www.thecrimson.com/info/comp.aspx]</li>
<li>bibigon did not claim "journalistic standards" as you claim he said. He claims the newspaper does no fact-checking. I pointed out that no newspaper does fact-checking. Fact-checking is an expensive and time-consuming process that select magazines and book publishers do on select books and articles. Please read the Wiki article on this, cited above, and re-read what bibigon said. You are overstating what bibigon said to the point of exaggeration.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> in argument builds trust. bibigon has claimed that he has written for <i>The Crimson</i>. The only way for bibigon to have written for <i>The Crimson</i> is for him to have either been a student or faculty member at Harvard, and to have gone through that newspaper's comp process.www.thecrimson.com/info/comp.aspx Whether bibigon is telling the truth about that does not matter. What does matter is that neither he nor you have come up with an independent resource showing that <i>The Crimson</i> is not a reliable source. It is not on the list of Wikipedia sources that have been excluded from use. Therefore, it is okay to source to it, and it is not okay to use one user's claim of personal experience, without independent corroboration, to exclude a resource. That is not the Wikipedia way.</li>
<li>I don't know what your #3 means. What guidelines? The ones you site WP:RS apply to self-publishing books and web sites, not wholly owned newspapers. WP:RS is irrelevant to this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope bibigon comes up with a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> case for excluding this citation based on Wikipedia policy. I have no opinion on the content of the quote but note that the comment is backed up by the online petition, a point that both you and bibigon ignore. It is the exclusion of a valuable resource that I find troubling, and that is the point of dispute. bibigon is making a decision that the Wikipedia community has not decided, and that is to exclude a resource. If bibigon insists on excluding this newspaper as a resource, then I would like to see independent corroboration to back up the claim that <i>The Crimson</i> is not a valid resource. Failing that, I would like to re-include this statement in this article because it was wrongly excluded. If either of you disagree, perhaps we can take this to arbitration for other members to weigh in. Thanks for taking the time to comment. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkywriter_749b.html" title="User:Skywriter">Skywriter</a> 20:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Err according to my reading of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, it says: "A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It <b>includes</b> personal websites, and books published by vanity presses." (emphasis added). "Includes" does not mean that personal websites and books are the only things that are self-published, but are some common examples of them. WP:RS is very relevant to this discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, please do not threaten things like Arbitration quite yet. This dispute is hardly at that level quite yet; if you think the current talk page discussion is not helping, perhaps you might want to read <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> in order to see some other, less severe ways to resolve our differences. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 09:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your response. I do not see arbitration as a threat. It is a useful way to bring in other editors when a dispute can not be resolved, particularly as to the meaning of Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>The first dispute is "what is the meaning of a self-published source? does it include independent publishers like <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> or <i>The New York Times</i>, both of which can be said to self-publish, according to your interpretation.</p>
<p>The second point of dispute is whether The Crimson is different from any other newspaper in that it does not employ a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact_checker.html" title="Fact checker">fact checker</a>. bibigon insists that The Crimson should be excluded as a resource because it does not employ a fact checker. I contend that the Wikipedia article is correct, that daily newspapers do not employ fact checkers, although the process of editing, rigorous at most newspapers, including The Crimson, as its guidelines state, catch many errors, and when not caught, newspapers run corrections. The Crimson is no different from any other newspaper in that respect. So the question is this: should The Crimson be excluded as a resource because bibigon alleges that, in his personal experience, The Crimson is "loose" with regard to fact checking. bibigon has offered no citation to back up his personal anecdote, and has not participated in this challenge to his edit. The underlying question for arbitration is: should the Harvard Crimson be excluded as a source in Wikipedia articles?</p>
<p>Do you see the dispute as different from what I have described? If so, please say precisely how, and also how best you see to resolve whether or not The Harvard Crimson should be rejected as a Wikipedia resource (due to an unsupported claim by one user that the corporation's fact-checking practices are "loose"? Thank you for the courtesy of your reply.

<dd>Skywriter, you are mistaken in your belief that the NY Times does not employ a fact checker. The Wikipedia entry on reliable sources even mentions this: "Publications with teams of fact-checkers, reporters, editors, lawyers, and managers — like the New York Times or The Times of London — are likely to be reliable." I don't believe you have made the case that the Harvard Crimson is a reliable source. The burden of proof is on you in this regard, given that you're making the positive assertion. You are absolutely correct however that my comment about having written for the Crimson is to be given little weight. I didn't intend for it to be definitive; it was largely a throw away remark. My argument in no way relies on my personal experience with the Crimson.</dd>
<dd>Now moving to a more substantive issue, namely, this article. Please find for me where in the article in the Crimson, it makes the assertion that Dershowitz has described all those people publically as bigots? It appears to be original research to be. My compromise proposal was an attempt to do away with both these issues, by quoting Dershowitz specifically, and citing the source in the text itself, so readers know it's a college newspaper. Please explain the origins of the "The exchange brought to at least seventy-six the number of fellow Harvard professors Dershowitz has publicly described as "bigots"" claim before reverting. <a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibigon_e00e.html" title="User:Bibigon">Bibigon</a> 00:53, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have restored the references to civilian casualties and refugees in Lebanon. I gather that they were removed in a good-faith effort to avoid POV, but they are crucial context without which this section makes no sense. The series of articles by Dershowitz discussed in this section do <i>not</i> constitute a general defense of the Israeli campaign but a specific response to the controversies surrounding the civilian toll in Lebanon.</p>
<p>I have also highlighted the shift in Dershowitz's argument from the LA Times piece to the one in the Boston Globe. In the former, Israel is responsible for some civilian casualties; in the latter, none at all.<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">User:G-Dett</a> 30 July 2006</p>
<p>JKelly has twice deleted material in the section about Dershowitz's essays regarding the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict, citing the <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a> policy. The deleted material is of two kinds: 1) figures regarding civilian casualties in Lebanon, and 2) a description of the shift in Dershowitz's thinking between two articles, the first which proposes discarding the term "civilians" as "increasingly obsolete," the second which resuscitates the term and employs it as a central concept.</p>
<p>Will JKelly provide separate explanations for how these (very different) categories of material constitute original research? The figures in category (1) above, for example, have been reported by every major news organ in the world, are a matter of universal consensus, and are indeed the very subject and occasion of those articles by Dershowitz discussed in this section.

Please see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>; we don't get to come up with our own brand-new analysis such as "several days later, however, Dershowitz shifted course and argued". We're not qualified to make judgement calls about what constitutes a shift in course, and it is fundamentally not our job to do so. Further, this article is not the place to describe the current crisis in the following way; "which had killed hundreds of civilians and created 500,000 refugees as part of an effort to weaken or destroy <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, a militant/political entity whose partial raison d'être is to destroy the State of Israel." This may or may not be a perfectly good description of the crisis and the actors, but we shouldn't come out and imply that it is important for an understanding of Dershowitz. Dershowitz is an important legal thinker. Our biography of him should not resemble a blog post about his views on Israel, and even the current version now has more on his two op-eds on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict than on his career. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks Jkelly. I won't get into an edit war, of course, but several things bear remarking. First of all, the op-eds in question (there are three, not two) are explicitly a response to the controversy about civilian suffering in Lebanon. They are not a general defense of "Israel's campaign," as the article now erroneously states. Here is the first sentence of Dershowitz's piece in the LA Times: "The news is filled these days with reports of civilian casualties, comparative civilian body counts and criticism of Israel, along with Hezbollah, for causing the deaths, injuries and 'collective punishment' of civilians." It is genuinely bizarre to withhold this context from Wikipedia readers, on grounds which seem to shift from <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/s/NOS_8ffe.html" title="NOS">NOS</a> to, most recently, the desirability of concision.</p>
<p>Apropos of this last, the section is indeed too long now, but this is precisely because concise summaries of positions have been replaced by unselective extended quotations. Is it a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/s/NOS_8ffe.html" title="NOS">NOS</a> to summarize a position? On twenty-four separate occasions within a short piece, Dershowitz uses a term which two days earlier he had advocated retiring as "meaningless." To observe this shift is to produce a "brand-new analysis" based on original research? I can see that this shift, once observed, might lead some to regard Dershowitz's ethical reasoning as more opportunistic than serious. Nevertheless, a shift is a shift, no? G-Dett</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do feel free to edit the article to reflect the distinction between "Israel's campaign" and "media response to civilian deaths from Israel's campaign". It is an important distinction, and we would best serve our readers by making it concisely and clearly. By a strict reading of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> describing that shift in thinking is a problem. We don't usually read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> so strictly, but we have higher standards for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living people</a> in a number of ways.

<p>Thanks for the explanation Jayjig. Obviously defamation is out of bounds. That said, I don't understand the thrust of your first sentence above. Of course Dershowitz doesn't "support" the killing of civilians, and the word "support" doesn't appear in any of the edits in question. He defends Israel's actions, as you say. These actions include the killing of civilians, however; indeed the killing of civilians is precisely what Dershowitz takes up as his central subject in the series of articles discussed in this section. Do have a look at those articles, if you haven't already (as well as comments by JKelly and G-Dett above). They do not "defend the Israeli campaign" against Hezbollah in general terms, as the wikipedia entry now erroneously suggests. They set out explicitly to "critique the media response to and international outcry against civilian deaths," as the phrase you keep deleting aptly put it. It is both accurate and neutral to say that he critiques the response and the outcry: the piece in the Toronto paper critiqued the international outcry to civilian casualties, specifically the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights' allegations of Israeli war crimes. The subsequent pieces parsing the meaning of the word "civilian" and so on focused on the media response. The sentence you keep deleting was in other words accurate, and therefore by definition not defamatory. If you think there's a POV problem in the phrasing, that's quite a different matter from defamation. I would still disagree with you, but the ball's in your court to rephrase it in such a way that the result is still accurate.</p>
<p>Of course it's important to be vigilant about defamation of living persons, and the POV rule is important as well. But one doesn't pursue these worthy goals by simply softening the factual focus, blurring and smudging any contextual detail that might be seen in a negative light. G-Dett</p>
<p>Jayjig, I've gone ahead and corrected the sentence in question. I trust that we now agree defamation is not at issue; as regards POV I hope the current wording is alright with you. As it stood before, the sentence was misleading to the point of being inaccurate. As has been shown exhaustively, the subject of the articles is not Israel's campaign generally; it is, specifically, the international outcry and media response regarding civilian deaths resulting from that campaign.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to say those "Dershowitz wrote a series of articles defending Israel's campaign in Lebanon as part of an effort to weaken or destroy Hezbollah" literally means that he defends the legitimacy of the Israeli campaign by situating it within the overall effort to cripple Hezbollah. (This is the thrust of the idiomatic phrase "defends as.") This may be merely an awkwardly phrased sentence, a syntactic Frankenstein, but the effect here is totally obfuscatory, off-point and misleading. G-Dett</p>
<p><br />
Does the last paragraph:</p>
<p>"Later that month, Norman Finkelstein described Dershowitz in Counterpunch as "bravely fir[ing] away op-eds from his foxhole at Martha's Vineyard" in an effort to "lay waste the fragile infrastructure of international law." According to Finkelstein, Dershowitz's arguments regarding the killing of non-combatants - if pursued to their logical extent - would make Dershowitz himself a legitimate target for extra-judicial assassination. "Of course, the preponderance of humanity, this writer included, does not think this way...As Dershowitz descends into barbarism, it remains a hopeful sign that few seem inclined to join him."[20]"</p>
<p>seem in any way appropriate for an encyclopedia article about Alan Dershowitz? Or does it seem more like a ctrl-C ctrl-V from someone's personal webpage? Jonshea 19:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do help to keep a check on the apparantly endless fascination some editors have with Dershowitz's views on Israel and the criticism thereof. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 20:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>With regards to "endless fascination," note that virtually all of Dershowitz's writings in the last five years, polemical and scholarly, have focused on defending Israeli policies. This is true even of works with ostensibly more general topics, such as Why Terrorism Works and Preemption: a Knife that Cuts Both Ways. For my part, my edits have focuesed on his dynamically evolving views regarding the legitimacy of targeting non-combatants. And take note that generally speaking, Dershowitz is controversial not for his "views on Israel," which after all are very mainstream (support for Israel and its right to defend itself, support for the two-state solution, blame for the failure of the peace process on the Palestinians, etc.). Dershowitz is controversial, rather, for the various positions on human rights, torture, preemptive war, collective punishment, and now the legitimacy of targeting non-combatants, that he finds himself advocating in the process of justifying Israeli policy.</p>
<p>Though I agree with Jon Shea's edit, in general I think these controversies absolutely deserve to be underscored in an encyclopedia entry on Dershowitz. Dershowitz has made his mark chiefly as a controversial public intellectual, more than as a legal thinker of any depth or consistency.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> (<a href="../../../g/-/d/User_talk%7EG-Dett_c67e.html" title="User talk:G-Dett">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_G-Dett_c53c.html" title="Special:Contributions/G-Dett">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>How about making mention of the fact that, in his rantings against the "Israel Lobby" paper, Dershowitz seemingly denies that such a lobby exists, while in his own book (Chutzpah) he brags about being part of "what is perhaps the most effective lobbying and fund-raising effort in the history of democracy". This was mentioned in a NY Observer article (<a href="http://mondoweiss.observer.com/2006/07/dershowitz-contradicts-himself-on-the-power-of-the-israel-lo.html" class="external free" title="http://mondoweiss.observer.com/2006/07/dershowitz-contradicts-himself-on-the-power-of-the-israel-lo.html" rel="nofollow">http://mondoweiss.observer.com/2006/07/dershowitz-contradicts-himself-on-the-power-of-the-israel-lo.html</a>) and seems like it would be relevant to the section about his response to the paper. 69.237.76.98 17:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By using the phrase "Some civil libertarians," one implies that Alan Dershowitz is not a "civil libertarian"; yet he is considered by himself and many others to be a "civil libertarian," and his work often does comment on <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_liberties.html" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a>; by eliding the phrase <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_liberties.html" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a> to "liberties," one attempts (again in a veiled manner) to reduce the value of the phrase. There is no other reason to elide it, and eliding it does not "improve" the article; the additional conciseness simply masks the value of the whole phrase in the sentence. There are apparently other subtle attempts to present opinion in this article on Dershowitz as opposed to actual neutral pov. I corrected that problem earlier, and I have corrected that problem again (in that sentence). I haven't time now to find all the other minor corrections that I made; I'll do it later perhaps if I do have time. If I did introduce any <i>actual</i> errors in the copy-editing that I did earlier, I apologize, but I don't currently know what they are. I'll try to come back to check the article and this talk page later, to see if there is anything that I can do to rectify any possible errors that I introduced in it and/or to correct any remaining problems that I have time to consider.</dd>

<p>That is the information that I provided earlier, which SV reverted, to an earlier version. This is correct information.

I provided the exact title of the source. External links are usually placed last in Wikipedia articles.

<p>This is what I suggest (incorporating previous changes that I made to the paragraphs, later reverted by SV, with a few later alterations that I suggest as well); the material in the note could be in the text, but I've currently put it in a note for people's information.

<p>With the box at the bottom, and the reference to "a number of high-profile legal cases" in the opening paragraph of this article, it seems very odd to me (to say the least) for the second paragraph to mention <i>only</i> the von Bulow case (one case) and to make no mention of the more-recent and far-more "high profile" O.J. Simpson case (another of this "number" of cases), which made Dershowitz far more a household name (due to constant daily and nightly media coverage over a much more-prolonged period of time).

<p>Dershowitz is hardly a major or particularly well-known (or indeed vocal) supporter of animal rights; indeed, only two sources seem to have been found (and, if I remember rightly, the <i>Rights from Wrongs</i> reference is a passing comment; but I read the book a year ago so that might be wrong). The point is that Dershowitz is a major media pundit and public figure, writing literally hundreds of articles a year, expressing views on pretty much everything. I am just not sure that his views on this subject deserve a section in this article. What do others think? <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 22:33, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He devotes a chapter to animal rights in that book, not a passing reference. Harvard Law School is a leading institution in the United States in the development of animal rights law, and Dershowitz is involved in that. I think lots of people would be surprised to hear that he'd expressed these views, and therefore the section is worth keeping. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:49, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Some may begin earlier but they are also ongoing (into 2006), so I've placed those later in the article. The organization itself may appear to be rather controversial and subject to debate as well.

<p>In the section about D's controversial viewpoints, no mention is made of his proposal that a small Arab village should be demolished each time a Palestinian terrorist blows himself up.

<dd>In context, it appears that Dershowitz is engaging in his rather typical rhetorical hyperbole to illustrate his point. He is not advocating such an action <i>literally</i>; hyperbole is a figure of speech; he is being metaphorical for effect (it seems to me). He is not advocating (literally) engaging in a Geneva convention-defined war crime.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that the statement merits "a paragraph," unless the paragraph deals in some significant way with examples of how Dershowitz employs (or deploys) "words as weapons" or rhetoric.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>He is not using literal weapons, or throwing stones or dropping bombs--at least not literally; he often seems to engage in extremely exaggerated speech modes that readers and listeners may (mis)take as "extremism," but, in my view, it is metaphorical extremes that he goes to, not actual ones.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe the distinctions are worth discussing, because people do fear that readers and listeners who do not grasp the metaphorical aspects of speech acts (language) may be misled to do criminal acts of violence (similar arguments to what people argue about violence in film inciting violence in real life, and so on) and the sometimes fine lines drawn (or not drawn) between political or highly-rhetorical speech and "<a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>". All of that is highly controversial and not an easy subject to discuss without violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>; all one can do is try to remain within Wikipedia guidelines in how one approaches and discusses and defines such distinctions. --NYScholar 08:18, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize for not giving a source. I sincerely thought that participants in this talkpage would be fully aware of Dershowitz's village-demolition proposal, which caused an uproar at the time of its publication. The full text of the Jerusalem Post (11 Mar 2002) article where he put it forward can be read at:</p>
<p><a href="http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0203&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;O=D&amp;P=53619" class="external free" title="http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0203&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;O=D&amp;P=53619" rel="nofollow">http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0203&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;O=D&amp;P=53619</a></p>
<p>A few comments:</p>
<p>1) Claiming, as NYScholar does, that Dershowitz's proposal is "rhetorical" is like claiming that Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denial is also rhetorical. The proposal for razing Arab villages to the ground in response to terrorist attacks was spelled out in full detail in a mainstream newspaper. There's nothing in the article to suggest it is a mere hyperbole or an excercise in intellectual provocation. Please read it and be convinced.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just a brief comment: (1) It's not precisely the same, if Ahmadinejad really intends to argue that the Holocaust did not occur (if he actually believes that--which, having heard him over and over again talking at the UN and interviewed about talking at the UN--I doubt). He <i>was</i> getting more and more "rhetorical" (and digging himself into and out of various holes) as he tried to rationalize his previous remarks as being taken out of context, providing this week a context by saying that the Holocaust did not take place in Palestine, so why punish the Palestinians, etc. and etc. His logical reasoning is very peculiar and not (in my view) at all convincing, but that is how he is weaseling out of his reported "denial" of the Holocaust; now he <i>denies</i> that he was "denying" the events by focusing attention on <i>where</i> the Holocaust occurred (not in the Middle East). He is not a very clear speaker/thinker it appears.</dd>
<dd>Dershowitz, on the other hand, is far more in command of his rhetoric and often does not seem to mind going out on limbs for rhetorical effect (as if he assumes that people couldn't possibly take him literally)--maybe not: but they are NOT similar in the way that the above user suggests. --NYScholar 08:22, 23 September 2006 (UTC) [corrected typo error 29 Oct. 2006]</dd>

<p><br />
2) The article was taken seriously and responded to by various intellectuals, obviously from the Left, although not the loony one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand your point above. --NYScholar 08:22, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The most notable response has been that of Norman Finkelstein, who, in Beyond Chutzpah, commented "It is hard to make out any difference between the policy Dershowitz advocates and the Nazi destruction of Lidice, for which he expresses abhorrence-except that Jews, not Germans, would be implementing it." (p. 176). (It must be noted that the Nazis killed the people of Lidice, apart from erasing the village; Dershowitz does not recommend that the Arab villagers be killed, but does not rule out the possibility of their perishing under their collapsing homes, in case they should chose to stay put.)</p>
<p>Also, columnist James Bamford wrote in the Washington Post (Sunday, September 8, 2002; Page BW03), in connection with Dershowitz's proposal, that demolishing houses of innocent people (which, he notes, Israel already does, although not on the wholesale scale promulgated by Dershowitz) constitutes "collective punishment" and "a practice outlawed under international law". See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A43691-2002Sep5&amp;notFound=true" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A43691-2002Sep5&amp;notFound=true" rel="nofollow">article (NYS added brackets so link would work)</a></p>
<p>3) I think that just because an idea is not very intelligent it shouldn't follow that the people advocating it are joking.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never said "joking": often Dershowitz's heated rhetoric and rhetorical examples (tit for tat) illustrate his deep anger at what he perceives as injustices and breaches of Jewish people's human rights; he is <i>not</i> joking; he is <i>serious</i> in the effect that he strives for: he often seems to try to show how terrible something is by coming up with analogous example (shoe on the other foot) of the other side (other people--e.g., Palestinians) to make it clearer how dreadful (he thinks) the offense to the Jewish people/Israelis, etc. (His stance on animal rights might be worth considering in relation to his stances on human rights, civil rights, and so on. His mind is rather odd it seems to me, but I don't think that he proposes that crimes be committed to "right" other crimes; I think he's trying to show how awful the crimes are (a kind of "Golden Rule" in reverse): e.g., "How would you like it if that happened to you--if your houses were demolished, your villages ruined, etc.?" Who really knows? but I don't think that he advocates war crimes (what he sees as war crimes)--then again, he may think that if "they" are doing it, then they should get it done back to them--which is kind of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" Biblical revenge, as opposed to modern justice. ???</dd>
</dl>
<p>In general, I think no attempt should be made at whitewashing astonishing proposals by otherwise respected thinkers, or at claiming that they didn't want to say what they clearly said.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was not engaged in any "attempt . . . at whitewashing astonishing proposals" etc.--and I do resent the implication that I was. I was encouraging people to look at the uses of language and rhetoric, not to take everything that people say literally. Literal interpretations often lead to strife. Try to re-read quotations within their larger contexts; if you take them OUT of context, you wrench them to mean what they may not mean IN context. The context is the entire geo-political situation involving Middle Eastern peoples' rights (which are highly contested by all sides)--take a look, e.g., at the clean water issue in the Middle East for starters--Pres. Clinton mentioned it over the past couple of days repeatedly in some interviews re: his global conference; Václav Havel has been working on that one in Forum2000 conferences since 2000 (every year). It's not just these people's houses but whether they even have a safe water supply to drink where they might have houses. So one needs to keep matters more in perspective (I think) and not blow out of proportion one quotation taken out of context of the strife going on throughout the entire region of the Middle East.</dd>
</dl>
<p>4) I think mention of this proposal should be made, because it did stir controversy,</p>

<p>The introductory paragraph to Dershowitz's position regarding the Lebanon war has two problems:</p>
<p>1) The first sentence is too long and cumbersome to read. Maybe it should be split into two shorter sentences.</p>
<p>2) The synopse of the run-up to the war is unbalanced, since it mentions the Hezbollah provocations only, and fails to cite the repeated Israeli airspace violations.</p>

<p>I have been altering "aggressive" and phrases containing it to neutral point of view like "rhetorical" (deleted by another user) and "outspoken" (current, but previously also deleted by same user). See tag above re: BLP: avoid one's own independent, non-sourced value judgments and other indications of POV in a biography of a living person. To use such adjectives as "aggressive" or even stronger "highly-aggressive" is not neutral point of view and violates BLP policy. "Outspoken" gets the point across--he "speaks out" on behalf of and in defense of Israel. One needs also to keep in mind that speaking out for Israel has many sides; those "for" Israel may be for different positions than those that D. takes and vice verse. There is no one representative "for" Israel; Israel is a locus of issues that he and others discuss and disagree about, often vehemently; but "aggressive" is a value-laden term that needs to be avoided in a header of a biography of a living person. --NYScholar 02:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NYScholar, you've done a terrific job improving the editorial quality of this article. I was the one who initially contributed the subsection on Dershowit'z proposal to demolish villages in response to terrorism. After your deft editing the subsection has improved enormously. However, I still believe my original title should be kept: "The village-demolition proposal." I don't see any NPOV problem with it. The issue is not Dershowitz' article but the proposal therein. All NPOV sources agree that the essence of the article lies not in the fact that he wanted to respond to terrorism, but in the proposal that the response could include destroying villages. The Harvard <i>Crimson</i>, for instance, said so in its single-line summary of the article: "In his article, Dershowitz called for the organized destruction of a single Palestinian village in retaliation for every terrorist attack against Israel." --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 17:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your response, Abenyosef. The problem is that what you want as a heading is not NPOV. It is biased. [Its bias is that it distorts the hypothetical nature of Dershowitz's proposal by wrenching it out of its context (the article). The article is the source of the controversy. The heading that you keep trying to insert is also not parallel to other headings in this article. If one reads the paragraph, one gets the point. Headings should not slant in the direction of an interpretation to maintain NPOV. See <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> and especially in the context of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. See tags above. People who contribute changes to this article must be especially vigilant about adhering to these guidelines. Your preferred heading does not. There is no problem with the more neutral heading; there <i>is</i> a problem with the non-neutral heading. The Harvard Crimson is a college newspaper and its writers are students not professional journalists; moreover, the article in the Crimson presents interpretations. People can read the article by Dershowitz in the context of this brief presentation in this section about the article and interpret it however they want to interpret it, but the presentation of what is at issue must be clear and neutral in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a newspaper; it is an encyclopedia. --NYScholar 05:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thank your for your clear explanation. My preferred heading hadn't anything to do with any bias on my part, but with my perception that the world has associated D's article with the demolition proposal, and that anyone consulting this article looking for information about it would be directly drawn to it if the word "demolition" were in the heading. But as you point out, this is the thinking of a journalist, which I am, and Wikipedia has other standards; I've gotten that point. Also, please note that I only changed the heading after asking for your feedback, waiting for 1 day and believing, erroneously, that you tacitally agreed with my proposal.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Your heading is fully satisfactory and beats, neutrality-wise, all other headings proposed. I wish all Wikipedia articles had editors as professional as you. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 16:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NYScholar, I applaud the tireless, detailed, and judicious work you've done on this and other articles. So take the following quibble in that spirit. I'm not sure I understand or agree with the logic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Dershowitz&amp;diff=108402420&amp;oldid=108400867" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Dershowitz&amp;diff=108402420&amp;oldid=108400867" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. Does it make sense to quote Lewin describing Dershowitz's proposal as "extremely modest" without giving the context of this judgment (Lewin's counter-proposal of executing the family members of suicide bombers, a plan in turn described by Dershowitz as "legitimate if flawed")? I appreciate that you've retained that information in a footnote. My opinion is that Lewin's critique and counterproposal should go together (either both in the body of the article or both in the notes); it doesn't contribute to our understanding to know that so-and-so finds Dershowitz's proposal "modest," if we don't know where so-and-so is coming from. --<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 21:56, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the courteous approach. Re: the edit you link to: at one point, I think that I had placed the same sentence within parentheses in the text, and (to me) it seemed that it was focusing too much attention of the paragraph on Lewin and losing the focus on Dershowitz, so I placed the material in the note, where (I believe) it serves as a context for understanding Lewin's quotation. Moreover, very importantly, there is a note on the web documents with the Lewin essay, saying that one cannot provide a link to his essay without providing a link to the essay that he is responding to and vice versa. So all that is part of the multiple contexts of his quotation, and readers need to read the full contexts of his comment. I have no POV on either Dershowitz's or Lewin's proposals; I am just trying to supply the information in as neutral and non-POV manner as possible while still giving readers of Wikipedia access to the information (that is, not hiding it). If anyone takes the time to click on the Wikipedia internal links and external citations links to read these materials relating to this section, one will see the contexts of these writers' (Dershowitz, Lewin, et al.'s) comments. All Wikipedia is supposed to do is to present reliably and verifiably-sourced material in relation to <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_point_of_view" class="extiw" title="w:Neutral_point_of_view">W:Neutral point of view</a> way; Wikipedia editors are not supposed to present it in a manner that tilts in favor or against the sources' own POVs (or the editors' own POVs); that would create bias in the article. Readers come to articles with their own biases and POVs, and they will make of these sources what they will. Editors are not to present or even to suggest their own evaluations of the source material. The repeated problems with the way many other editors have tried to present this section is that they seem unable to do so without injecting POV into it. I have been struggling against that kind of POV editing (in this section and elsewhere in this article and in other articles in Wikipedia). I've explained my position a number of times in the editing history and talk page discussions to make it as clear as I can. I hope that this further explanation suffices. Having considered the matter again, I still favor putting the material in a note rather than in an even parenthetical sentence in the text. Thanks again for asking. [Please note: Beginning this coming week, I will be away for approx. two weeks due to family illness; so I will not be able to respond to messages in my talk page directed to me or comments directed to me in talk pages of articles.]--NYScholar 20:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I know about NPOV, etc. Indeed my concern was precisely about that. I appreciate the transparency of the edit (and of your editing in general), and I agree that the point of Wikipedia is to provide links, bibliographies, access to materials, and so on. But NPOV is also relevant with regards to rhetorical presentation. Having Lewin's relative assessment ("moderate") in-line and his counter-proposal (kill family members of suicide bombers) tucked away in a footnote may leave the casual reader with the impression that Dershowitz's plan was criticized equally from both sides, that Lewin's take on it was somehow representative, etc. But Lewin represents an extraordinary, perhaps sui generis, case of a prominent figure finding Dershowitz's plan too moderate and proposing something more extreme as an alternative. If we're including Lewin as representative of the reception of Dershowitz's plan, we're way, way off. If we're including it because it represents an interesting exchange that adumbrates the discussion out of which that proposal emerged, then that's different; but then in that case I think we should let the reader know (in-line) how and where Lewin figures in that discussion. In any case, I don't see the logic of decoupling the rhetoric of Lewin's relative assessment from the substance of his counter-proposal. They go together.</dd>

<dd>Please see the most recent editing changes: after considering two of the sections further, I've tried to integrate material from quotations and sentences previously in the notes into the text in a more coherent way, eliminating redundancies, while still attempting a neutral factual presentation of this material. There was also an allusion in this section to a note in another section (on Dershowitz's "idea" of "torture warrants") that this revision attempts to eliminate by putting the relevant portion of the quotation (from Bamford) in that section, enabling me to refer back to him coherently in the text rather than in a note. [In that way, I've eliminated a couple of parenthetical sentences from notes and put them in the text in what I think is a way that improves the coherence of both sections. Please review the changes and let me know whether they do seem both more effective and still NPOV (as I intend them to be). --NYScholar 23:17, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Someone else, without discussion on this talk page despite ongoing discussion of these content issues, has removed the work that I did on the part that G-Dett asked me to consider here. (This is not material that I myself originally brought to this article; however, I did spend a lot of my time providing proper full citations for it, and I do object to that user's just preemptorily removing the material without prior discussion; it violates Wikipedia's editing policies in "controversial" articles. (See tagged notice at top.) Speaking for myself, I think that such material, while perhaps not <i>crucial</i>, was indeed properly sourced and the subject of considerable prior discussion in the talk page(s) of this article. Engaging in such deletions of references and sourced material (which is indeed notable and reliably- and verifably-sourced) violates the guidelines of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>; it is not up to such editors to decide that such material is not important because it mentions a subject "in passing"; doing so is contrary to <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> as well.

<p>The following removed by user (twice in various forms) is hardly "irrelevant"; earlier consensus discussion deemed it relevant; notable and reliably and verifiably sourced: see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuidelines_for_controversial_articles_89b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Guidelines for controversial articles">Wikipedia:Guidelines for controversial articles</a> policies: Text of the note: preceded and followed by "ref" codes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contradistinction to this point of view, see Nathan Lewin, <a href="http://www.shma.com/may02/nathan.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.shma.com/may02/nathan.htm" rel="nofollow">"Detering (sic) Suicide Killers" (Reply to Arthur Green)</a>, <i>Sh'ma</i> May 2002, accessed <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. Cf. "Note: The debate between Nathan Lewin and Arthur Green on how to deter suicide killers, which appears below, are two parts of a whole. Please do not circulate one article without the other." The other part of this two-part presentation is <a href="http://www.shma.com/may02/arthur.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.shma.com/may02/arthur.htm" rel="nofollow">"A Stronger Moral Force,"</a> by Arthur Green, accessed <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. (The journal title <i>Sh'ma</i> is explicated in <i><a href="../../../s/h/e/Shema_Yisrael_2a94.html" title="Shema Yisrael">Shema Yisrael</a></i>.) In the context of this debate between himself and Arthur Green, Nathan Lewin, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, writes: "The extremely modest proposals that some people are now willing to accept – national identity cards and roving eavesdrops (and even the "automatic" destruction of Palestinian villages that Alan Dershowitz proposed in The Jerusalem Post of March 11, 2002) – are the proverbial use of aspirin to treat brain cancer. They may occasionally disrupt terrorist plans but will have no major impact on the terrorist threat." In this reply to Green, Lewin proposes executions of family members of terrorists as "individual deterrence" to terrorism," which also, in the views of Bamford and other critics of Dershowitz's (in Lewin's phrase) "modest proposal" already cited, violates "international law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source discusses the same topic that Dershowitz is discussing in the article in the section and Lewin cites the article directly in his essay as cited. (previous user did not sign comment: please add user name.)</p>
<p><b>I do not want to interact further with this other user. I hope that earlier editors who wanted this material cited will consider these issues.

<dd>Moreover, the user apparently does not perceive that this section is not supposed to present only "criticism" (negative views) of Dershowitz's article; it is supposed to present various POVs on the article as documented in notable, reliable, verifiable sources; in this case, an earlier editor added this source as representing a secondary source POV which appears to believe that Dershowitz's "proposal" is actually too "modest" and that he does not go far enough. This source is not being added as "criticism" of Dershowitz's article; it is being added to illustrate that there are some sources (in this case, another lawyer), who find Dershowitz's "proposal" less radical than others already cited before and after this point in this section (e.g., Bamford and Finkelstein). To be rendering this topic (the article) in neutral point of view, one has to present various POVs on it if they exist, and they do. The note to Lewin's comment illustrates that. I object to its continual removal by the reversions of the other user. I will not, however, directly address him as I have had extremely unpleasant encounters with that user in the past and am unwilling to engage directly with that user any further. The objections raised appear to me to misunderstand the source and to be wholly unreasonable in view of Wikipedia guidelines that I have already cited.

<p>I hesitate to edit this article without discussion, but saying "in which he proposes "an immediate unilateral cessation in retaliation against terrorist attacks" and, "following the end of the moratorium," the institution of a "new policy if Palestinian terrorism were to resume"" looks like an over-sympathetic view of Dershowitz's proposal.

<dd>I think that you are misrepresenting those quotations: they are quotations from the article of Dershowitz's own words; they should be presented in the comment above as quotations within quotations. Those are not the words of the editors of the Wikipedia article; the section is reporting what Dershowitz says in quotations from the article documenting that he said that.

In the context of this debate between himself and Arthur Green, Nathan Lewin, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, writes: "The extremely modest proposals that some people are now willing to accept – national identity cards and roving eavesdrops (and even the "automatic" destruction of Palestinian villages that Alan Dershowitz proposed in The Jerusalem Post of March 11, 2002) – are the proverbial use of aspirin to treat brain cancer. They may occasionally disrupt terrorist plans but will have no major impact on the terrorist threat." In this reply to Green, Lewin proposes executions of family members of terrorists as "individual deterrence" to terrorism, which also, in the views of Bamford and other critics of Dershowitz's "modest proposal" already cited, violates "international law." ["Note: The debate between Nathan Lewin and Arthur Green on how to deter suicide killers, which appears below, are two parts of a whole. Please do not circulate one article without the other."
