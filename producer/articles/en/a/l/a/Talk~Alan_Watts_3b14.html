<p>Judging by the references to his love for fine art, architecture, and food, not to mention female companionship, Watts seems to have had <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicurean.html" title="Epicurean">Epicurean</a> tendencies. How does this comport with Zen philosopy, and should such a comparison be noted in the article? --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 00:11, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's perfectly fine, and even makes sense. Zen has no doctrine, no scriptures and no formal teaching. It does not mandate any type of personal behavior. In fact, it's not even a philosophy. Zen is all about experiencing reality for yourself, first-hand, which is exactly what Watts did. Lazerf4rt 03:08, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> article, not a shrine. Watts was influential, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> lets us say that, but we can't blatantly say that he was exceptional, we have to let the readers make up their own minds. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 04:13, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since when does a word like exceptional conotate a sharine?? h0riz0n</p>
<p>The mere fact that he has a Wikipedia article already proves that he was exceptional. It's redundant to actually come out and say it. You might as well say the same thing about every other person listed in Wikipedia. Lazerf4rt 02:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Could be condensed. Has a lot of detail that, while factual, does little (his wife's mother's husband???).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't cover many of the topics that I've heard Watts speak on: the ego, the relationship between technology and civilization, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>my 2c.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is true, but it is virtually impossible to write everything he had said in lectures and books. The main reason is to give an impression - in short notes - who he was and what is his basic philosophy was. I know that he deserves more attention and in depth analysis but that is where people can buy his books and audiotapes to get to know more about him. Based on my knowledge of Watts, i think that the wiki of alan watts is correct and a good example of who he was.</li>
</ul>
<p>I share the feeling that most of the factual/biographical detail could be condensed here. There doesn't seem to be much point mentioning that, for example, Alan Watts' neighbors were good carpenters. After this article, the reader is left wondering why the article exists in the first place. Sure, that's his life: Why is it noteworthy? The article needs expand on his personal philosophy, then we'll have justification for the (more relevant) biographical points. Lazerf4rt 04:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am a little concerned about 1 things in the article:</p>
<p>His addiction to alcohol, i never read or heard that before so i cannot fully know if this is true. 213.93.32.246 17:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC) Jungsonn</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Talk%7EAlan_Watts_3b14.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Most thinkers in wikipedia have a section detailing some of the problems evident in their thought. This is not true in Watts' case. Is there any particular reason for that? Is it that everyone agrees with Watts? Sounds doubtful at best.--83.252.70.232 20:12, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's because the current article says almost nothing about his work. What is there to disagree with? I'd like to contribute a summary of his core philosophy, then people can add their counterarguments. Although, keep in mind the article already says he was an outsider in academics.

<p>I'm certainly no expert on the subject, but I think he had a history of alcoholism. If that's true, could we get it in the article? ...I think it used to be, and maybe some Alan-friendly person edited it out.</p>

<p>Good article, but its missing some things: First off, it kind of leaves the reader hanging as to the nature of his "mystical experience while on a walk with his wife." (at the end of "Influences and Publication")Maybe a sentence or two more about this would help - or just removing the reference all together. I mean, what happened and ho did it affect him?</p>
<p>Secondly, the section entitled "Priesthood and After" starts off with a reference to his displeasure with the New York Zen scene. None of this is mentioned beforehand. Perhaps if it were rewritten as "Finding disappointment with the New York Zen scene..." instead of "Because of his disappointment..." the reader wouldn't feel as if he should already know something that he probably doesn't.</p>
<p>Lastly, referring to Watts as a libertarian will probably need to be backed up by a citation. I hate to see those ugly "citation need" tags, especially on an article as good as this one, but I may have to put one up in the near future if this is left unaddressed.--Wellesradio</p>
