<p>The accident investigation centered on mechanical failure of the plane's horizontal stabilizer jackscrew (a spiral threaded mechanical device) which controls the nose up or nose down attitude of the airplane. According to the Flight Data Recorder which the NTSB recovered from the accident site, the horizontal stabilizer functioned normally during the initial climb out of Puerto Vallarta. After takeoff and initial climb, the airplane was set on autopilot for the first two hours of the flight and the aircrew did not detect any discrepancy with the stabilizer. After disconnecting the autopilot, they determined that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stabilizer_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Stabilizer (aircraft)">horizontal stabilizer</a> had jammed. Thus, the aircrew could not <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trim_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Trim (disambiguation)">trim</a> the aircraft, which involves making fine adjustments to the positions of the flight control surfaces to keep the plane stable in flight. This left the aircraft flyable, but difficult to keep level. In an effort to correct the problem, the pilots attempted to overcome the jam with the primary and alternate trim systems. At first, their efforts had no effect. After discussions with airline mechanics and dispatchers on the ground, the crew decided to divert the flight to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_International_Airport_1053.html" title="Los Angeles International Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a> (LAX).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the crew continued to troubleshoot the problem. Seven minutes after the decision to divert, the crew was successful in moving the stabilizer. However, the stabilizer moved all the way to a full leading edge up position. This was caused by the shearing of threads in the stabilizer's gimbal nut. This unexpected movement had the effect of causing the aircraft to <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_%28flight%29.html" title="Pitch (flight)">pitch</a> down suddenly, entering a dive. Only by exerting large forces on the control columns were the pilots able to regain some control of the airplane and continue flying toward LAX. After consulting with a mechanic on the ground, the pilots debated attempting to adjust the stabilizer trim again. The crew finally decided to leave the stabilizer as it was.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Airlines_Flight_261_5681.html" title="Edit section: The second and final dive">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The second and final dive</span></h3>
<p>Less than a minute after that decision, about ten minutes after the first dive, an "extremely loud bumping sound" was recorded on the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockpit_voice_recorder.html" title="Cockpit voice recorder">cockpit voice recorder</a> and the aircraft entered a second and final dive. The sound recorded was the impact loading of the stabilizer with the tip fairing brackets. This impact was caused by the low cycle fatigue fracture of the stabilizer jackscrew's torque tube and lower mechanical stop. The threads on the gimbal nut (known as an acme nut) wore smooth to the point of being unable to hold the stabilizer in a set position and thus the stabilizer could move on its own under the aerodynamic loads. The stabilizer on the MD-80 has a 36 foot wing span which supports large aerodynamic loads up to 5,000 pounds. Upon deflection of the stabilizer past its full nose down position, the plane inverted and impacted the Pacific Ocean at high speed. All 83 passengers and five crew members died on impact. The flight crashed about twenty miles (thirty-two kilometers) northwest of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_International_Airport_1053.html" title="Los Angeles International Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a> into the water off <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_Mugu_2d1a.html" title="Point Mugu">Point Mugu</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. The last radio contact with the aircraft occurred while the plane was passing 17,000 feet at a low speed of 119 <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_%28nautical%29.html" title="Knot (nautical)">knots</a>.</p>

<p>The nose up or nose down position of the MD-80 aircraft is affected by the horizontal stabilizer being moved up or down by a spiral threaded jackscrew. The jackscrew attaches to the horizontal stabilizer through a gearbox that bolts to the forward stabilizer spar. Two motors through a differential gearbox rotate the jackscrew while it is held fixed within a gimbal nut (or acme nut). One motor (the primary motor) is controlled by switches on the pilots control wheel and handles on the center pedestal (respectively known by MD-80 pilots as the pickle switches and suitcase handles) while the other motor (the alternate motor) is controlled by two levers on the center console. The alternate motor can be commanded by the MD-80's DFGC (Digital Flight Guidance Computer) as part of the autopilot system for pitch control (nose up or nose down). The gimbal nut portion (fixed to the vertical tail) of the jackscrew mechanism translates rotary motion from the motor gearbox into linear up and down motion. The gimbal nut is made of a relatively soft aluminum bronze alloy. As such it wears at a faster rate than the jackscrew which is made of case hardened 440 stainless steel. This is the reason for the metal shavings that were found wrapped around the accident jackscrew. The 5000 pound aerodynamic load on the stabilizer is taken up on the threads between the gimbal nut and jackscrew. As the gimbal nut wears, less contact area is available to distribute the load and excessive <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shear_stress.html" title="Shear stress">shear stress</a> in created in the spiral threads. This ultimately caused the failure of the jackscrew and gimbal nut to hold the aerodynamic load. Without threaded contact between the gimbal nut and jackscrew, there was essentially no mechanical attachment between the vertical tail and the horizontal stabilizer. This type of part is refered to in the aircraft industry as a Principal Structural Element or PSE. Failure of a PSE essentially can prevent the continued safe flight and landing of an aircraft and as such has more stringent maintenance requirements. The standard maintenance requirements for the jackscrew are a lubrication of the gimbal nut and a measurement of the end play to verify wear. Typically the nut wears at a rate 0.001 inches per 1000 flight hours and must be replaced when it reaches the 0.040 inch end play limit. The jackscrew and gimbal nut are a single line replaceable assembly.</p>

<p>The NTSB commented that that the designers of the aircraft (Douglas) did not provide for a backup system in the event that the jackscrew threads completely failed. Instead, the designers relied on inspections to determine when the jackscrew had worn enough to warrant replacement. Safety assessments are done by <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety_engineering.html" title="Safety engineering">safety engineering</a> during the aircraft design process based on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Failure_Mode_and_Effects_Analysis_521a.html" title="Failure Mode and Effects Analysis">Failure Mode and Effects Analysis</a> (<a href="../../../f/m/e/FMEA_313b.html" title="FMEA">FMEA</a>) and Fault Tree Analysis. These types of analyses are commonly used to certify aircraft systems on all transport category airplanes today in both the US and Europe. Single point failures in an aircraft system that cause a loss of ability to continue safe flight and landing are not allowed per Federal Aviation Regulations and they must be shown to occur with a probability of less than 1 X 10-9 or 0.000000001. As the <a href="../../../m/d/-/MD-80_36fa.html" title="MD-80">MD-80</a> (DC-9-80)is a derivative design of the DC-9 series aircraft, the original 1967 DC-9 fault tree analysis analyzed certain structural failures of the jackscrew assembly including the dual thread design of the jackscrew. The analysis did not however account for complete wear out of the threads. The NTSB noted that it is not appropriate to rely solely on maintenance and inspection to identify impending failure of a single-point critical component as with the wear of the spiral threads.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Airlines_Flight_261_5681.html" title="Edit section: Alaska Airlines MD-80 maintenance program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alaska Airlines MD-80 maintenance program</span></h3>
<p>A major contributing factor to the accident was the extension of the stabilizer jackscrew lubrication from 1600 flight hours to 2550 flight hours as part of the routine check and the extension of the end play check from 26 months to 30 months as part of the aircraft C-check. A C-check is a detailed inspection of an aircraft with substantial access to systems and components. All airlines have approved procedures to extend inspection intervals based on the continuous reliability data that they collect and monitor. Often interval extensions are performed as cost saving measures. A major contributing cause to the accident was a lack of grease on the gimbal nut. This is directly related to the 950 flight hour lubrication interval extension. With regard to wear monitoring through the end play check, Alaska Airlines' MD-80 utilization interval was equivalent to 9500 flight hours over 30 months. The accident airplane had accumulated 9000 flight hours since its last major C-check that included the gimbal nut end play measurement. This was 1800 flight hours beyond Boeing's recommended interval of 7200 flight hours. A critical error made by Alaska Airlines engineering was using calendar time for an inspection of a wear out part rather than using flight hours.</p>
<p>Additionally, Alaska Airlines had performed a lubrication change from Mobilgrease 28 to Aeroshell 33 at the time of the interval extension. The NTSB commented on inadequate procedures in accomplishing the grease change as no testing had taken place to verify that end play measurements with Aeroshell 33 would be better or equivalent to Mobilgrease 28. In 1997, Aeroshell 33 was more expensive than the Mobilgrease and the reason for the change was due to Aeroshell 33 being purported to have superior performance. The NTSB later found the grease change not to have a significant affect on gimbal nut wear.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor to the accident was error in end play measurements on the gimbal nut. The procedure given by the aircraft manufacturer required a special bracket to be installed on the aircraft to facilitate making the measurement. In addition to the manufacturer's bracket, Alaska Airlines fabricated brackets in its own maintenance shops. However, the brackets that they made did not match the specifications required of the bracket.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Airlines_Flight_261_5681.html" title="Edit section: Heavy maintenance on the accident aircraft">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Heavy maintenance on the accident aircraft</span></h3>
<p>A major maintenance event (a C-check) had occurred two years prior to the accident on N963AS at <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Airlines_ba09.html" title="Alaska Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland.html" title="Oakland">Oakland</a> Maintenance Facility. An Alaska Airlines mechanic had recommended that the jackscrew be replaced due to end play measurement of 0.040 inches, but the end play was re-checked and measured even further within limits. The MD-80 stabilizer jackscrew safety has been improved after this accident due to more stringent FAA oversight and reduced lubrication and end play measurement intervals. In light of the accident, the FAA issued during 2000 an Airworthiness Directive effective to all MD-80s today calls for the gimbal nut lubrication to be done at 650 flight hours and the end play check to be done at 2000 flight hours to provide adequate margin for detection of thread wear. Additional safeguards were taken by communicating the importance to aircrews of not trying to operate the stabilizer if a jam is detected. As can be seen this accident was not caused by one single event but the complex interaction of many events. The industry has learned a great deal from this accident to prevent this from occurring again.</p>
<p>After the crash, the use of flight number 261 was retired and the route is now known as Alaska Airlines Flight 295.</p>
