<p>Hey thanks for the advice. Check out what the page looks like now...I found a perfect picture to make up for that blank space to the right. I also noticed you fixed all the high schools' pages. I was going to do that but you apparently beat me to it!</p>

<p>Hey Alansohn I'm not all that great with Wikipedia yet and was wondering (since youre so proficient) if you could go to the new page I made (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Conference_46cb.html" title="Colonial Conference">Colonial Conference</a>) and clean up the chart of the schools so that it looks more evenly spread out across the page instead of so bunched together. I couldn't figure out how to space everything.</p>

<p>I go to DBP and am an ambassador(conduct open houses etc). Durign theses they give us a school fact sheet with the scores on it to hand out to prospective students. You can find it on the Don Bosco Prep HS website under Guidance Center it is the School Profile sheet (its a file download).

<p>They're not identical. The "New Jersey" SVGs use a narrower font, and the wider shield is an elongated circle rather than an ellipse. The "New Jersey" SVGs match most newer signage.</p>
<p>This in addition to the fact that the edits were done by the same IP as Nextbarker, the user behind adding minor junctions to the infobox. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 07:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>just to give some reasoning for my removal of 'skatallica' on the notable alumni page (which you had reverted, citing the existence of a wiki page for them as reason for notability)</p>
<p>Their wikipage was created by a band member and a friend of theirs. They self released a CD and probably played live less than five times. As someone who is very familiar with the musical culture in and around Hunterdon County, I wouldn't put them in the 50 most notable musical acts to have members that attended HCRHS in the 1990s.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are far more knowledgeable than I am regarding the area's music scene and I will defer to your judgment in this matter. If your understanding is accurate, the <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skatallica.html" title="Skatallica">Skatallica</a> article should be the subject of a <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> process. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, i'd forgotten to log in before. Though information in the Skatallica article is technically accurate, the artist most assuredly does not meet the notability requirements as outlined in the "Notability (music)" entry on Wikipedia. I don't use wikipedia often or thoroughly enough, however, to feel comfortable initiating such requests. Thanks for your time!</dd>

<p>I agree with the basis for your decision; a cat <i>should</i> describe all members of subcats. There should, however, be some flexibility; <a href="../../../j/2E/_/Category%7EJ._R._R._Tolkien_fddf.html" title="Category:J. R. R. Tolkien">Cat:J. R. R. Tolkien</a> was in the cats describing him as a writer before <a href="../../../t/o/l/Category%7ETolkien_c55c.html" title="Category:Tolkien">Cat:Tolkien</a> and Cat:Middlearth were split off; but <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_Army_officers_b6cf.html" title="Category:British Army officers">Cat:British Army officers</a> contained the article. The writer cats would stretch to include <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valinor.html" title="Valinor">Valinor</a> in a subcat; the Army wouldn't.</p>

<dd>I apologise for not signing my comment above. I have no issue that you take exception to the user's pattern to vote delete, but to make SPA accusations without any substantive basis is inappropriate. My contributions are majority AfD - at at the beginning probably about 90%, and at a 90%+ delete rate. That is what we "deletionists" do - we look for articles that we feel should be eliminated, and usually ignore others. That may strike you as problematic, in which case feel free to express dismay at the opinion expressed, but to go so far as shout SPA is silly. As for your other point, I feel my contribution record stands clearly for itself in terms of my support for the project. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 20:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Alan,</p>
<p>I didn't care for your comments about me in the deletion debates on Ridgewood High School and Kennesaw Mountain High School. I'd like to assure you that I am not a sock-puppet, I'm simply a person who is currently choosing to make my principal contributions to Wikipedia in the AfD area. I've added a note about this on my user-page, which I hope makes things clearer for you. I'm particularly perturbed that you didn't feel any need to contact me before making these accusations: given that you've not spoken to me about this, I'm surprised that you were not able to "assume good faith". It would be very easy for an independent observer to suspect that your comments were made in a spirit of seeking to intimidate me because I have expressed the opposite opinions to you in some AfD debates: it might be useful for you to explicitly dissociate yourself from such sentiments, to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I suspect that one of the reasons you're annoyed with me is because I tend to feel that most articles on schools should be deleted. We're very often on opposite sides of this debate, but I don't see an easy solution to this. Part of the problem is, I think, that there are some people ( in which group I suspect you feel most comfortable ) who feel that schools ( or, certainly, secondary schools ) are automatically notable. I tend not to agree. It's going to be difficult for us to reach concord on this one, because we start from very different places, but if you'd like to discuss this privately I'm very happy to do so. I've deliberately refrained from participating in the "schools" debate so far, because it seems to me that positions are so entrenched that adding yet one more partisan to the hubbub is unlikely to have a positive effect. I'm pretty sure that we both want to make Wikipedia the best it possibly can be, so if you want to see if two people from opposite sides of the debate can reach some sort of agreement, I'd certainly be keen to try.</p>
<p>Now, as for the particular debates where you cast aspersions about my motives, let me say this: (1) The article on <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood_High_School_%28Florida%29_cb0a.html" title="Ridgewood High School (Florida)">Ridgewood High School (Florida)</a> does not appear to say clearly enough why the school is notable. What would make a school notable, it seems to me, is if it does something more than simply exist and teach students. Is there anything unique about it&#160;? Sadly, I can't see anything, which is why I felt the article should have been deleted. (2) The article on <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennesaw_Mountain_High_School_b64e.html" title="Kennesaw Mountain High School">Kennesaw Mountain High School</a> is, I think, a bit stronger, but similarly does not make an adequate assertion of notability. I have explained why on the main AfD page, but here's what I said: "The problem for me is that I feel that for a school to be notable it has to do something more than just exist and teach students. The two places where notability might most plausibly be asserted for this school are: (a) the fact that it's a magnet school, and (b) the supposedly unusual steelwork in the architecture. On (a) I feel that although the policy of magnet schools is notable, the individual schools so designated are not per se notable unless their teaching styles develop unique characteristics that are not general to all magnet schools. On (b) I feel that the reference from the "Steel Joist Institute" simply uses the school as an example of an architectural and construction technique, and does not assert any particular notability for the school building per se. On balance, therefore, I do not feel that notability is sufficiently clearly established."</p>
<p>I hope this helps to clear things up. To repeat explicitly, though: I'm not a sock-puppet, I'm simply someone who is doing his best for Wikipedia as a whole. We may not always agree on individual matters, but I hope we can agree that we are both doing the best we can.

<dd>One other thing: in your comments on <a href="../../../e/u/s/User_talk%7EEusebeus_0474.html" title="User talk:Eusebeus">Eusebeus' talk page</a> you say "As WMMartin has shown no concern about the characterization, and doesn't seem to bother communicating with any other Wikipedian,..." Please note that until today I was unaware that you were characterizing me in this way - indeed, so far as I can tell you only started saying this in the last couple of days. Further, to note that I have not communicated with you is disingenuous: at no time have you initiated communication with me, so there was no way for me to respond to your accusation that I was acting inappropriately. I certainly communicate with other Wikipedians from time to time, though not at great length or in great number, but if you'd wanted to talk to me it would have been easy for you to do this before casting baseless assertions about.

<p>Hello -- you may recall that in mid-December 2006 you and many others voted to undeleted "Category:Jewish-American businesspeople" which had been unjustly and swiftly deleted by a rogue administrator in early December 2006; proper debate/voting was not done and huge amounts of data was lost when this category was deleted, many of the people in that category losing their Jewish identity entirely because of this. This particular unjust category deletion happened in early December 2006, see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_6#American_businesspeople_by_ethnicity" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_6#American_businesspeople_by_ethnicity" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>This unjust category deletion was later rectified when you along with others overwhelmingly voted to overturn the deletion and relist the category, see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_December_14" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_December_14" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. However, at this time neither admins. nor others bothered to begin re-adding the names that had been lost/merged when the category was originally deleted.</p>
<p>However, the category was not immediately recreated -- it wasn't relisted until many-many days after it had been voted back in to existence, and I had to bug User:RobertG in order to get it relisted, see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RobertG#Please_Undelete_and_Relist_.22Category:Jewish_American_businesspeople.22_ASAP_per_Vote" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RobertG#Please_Undelete_and_Relist_.22Category:Jewish_American_businesspeople.22_ASAP_per_Vote" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Also, since that category's former data had already been entirely merged in to "Category:American businesspeople" it effectively meant that in order to rebuild the unjustly deleted category the people that had built it up over many months had to start from scratch since a list of the former names in the category were never provided so that users could re-add them. The category nor a list of the names that were formerly in it is no longer available, or this info is only accessible by admins.</p>
<p><b>Finally, even though the category deletion was properly overturned by you and others, it was renominated for deletion AGAIN on the 10 of January 2007 (only days after it had been recreated) -- it was then deleted 17 January 2007, with NONE of the people that had formerly voted to relist the category voting this time around; see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_10#Category:Jewish-American_businesspeople" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_10#Category:Jewish-American_businesspeople" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</b></p>
<p>I am wondering if there is anything that can be done about this? Are you able to obtain a list of the names that were formerly in the category, or are only admins. able to do that? Can you or someone else try to have the category relisted? Is there a way to undelete the category again, given that it was deleted BOTH TIMES under rather dubious circumstances, with those that voted to undelete it the first time not even knowing to vote the second time or even that it had been renominated for deletion?</p>
<p>Thanks for any info/help that you can provide. --172.165.193.62 15:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the guy that originally trimmed the Shunpiking sections, I'll add that it was at least notable that NJ state police officially promoted I-295 as an alternate route to the NJ Turnpike one time, which is why I kept that intact. However, suggesting toll-free routes to bypass the Turnpike that aren't officially sanctioned or verified by a suitable outside source is original research. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 21:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your forthcoming book on Sussex and Warren place names does seem most intriguing, and I would be interested in seeing a copy. But given your status as a stickler for Wikipedia policy, I am sure that you might see why the source would be inappropriate, as indicated in an earlier removal, which cited the restriction on unpublished works.

"This policy does not prohibit editors with specialist knowledge from adding their knowledge to Wikipedia, but it does prohibit them from drawing on their personal knowledge without citing their sources. If an editor has published the results of his or her research in a <i>reliable publication</i>, then s/he may cite that source while writing in the third person and complying with our NPOV policy. See also Wikipedia's guidelines on conflict of interest." (my emph.)

<p>Stop removing the reference until you get a third opinion.

<p>Hi, I wanted to get your opinion, since I see that you've worked on many of the Manhattan street articles. I think you saw my preference, to combine numbered street articles into sort of list/article hybrids like <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_streets%2C_1-14.html" title="Manhattan streets, 1-14">Manhattan streets, 1-14</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_streets%2C_23-42.html" title="Manhattan streets, 23-42">Manhattan streets, 23-42</a>.</p>
<p>We disagree on notability of each article; I think, with very few exceptions, one-way streets aren't notable, and notability of institutions don't necessarily transfer to the streets they're on), and you seem to prefer individual articles.</p>
<p>But I think with the combined articles, you can have all of the information for individual streets, while consolidating the redundant information. You can still link street names to sections within articles, and once there's too much information to fit in a section, you can expand them out like West 4th St. Streets by themselves may not be notable, but together, they're part of the grid and more article-worthy. I think this would be the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>And thanks for fixing the typos in the 1-14 article - I don't know how I didn't catch them. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User_talk%7EYtny_624b.html" title="User talk:Ytny">talk to</a> <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 04:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually you should link to the street name, which will redirect to the combined article, so if a street is split the links can remain. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 06:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't have a preference for whether the images go in a gallery or along the side, although I think it looks slightly odd to have them extending down the side past the article text. Your current version is fine.</p>
<p>I don't really think having the gallery where it was interrupts the flow of the article, though. That's the reason the link sections go at the end, they're not really part of the article, certainly not part of the main article text. It would be a problem if we were to put it between (for a weird example) the Route description and History sections, though. I think that's the main reason there was recently a discussion to move the exit list below the text sections on <a href="../../../i/h/_/WT%7EIH_b5bc.html" title="WT:IH">WT:IH</a>.</p>
<p>That's the logic behind the current layout. There are three "supersections": text, tables and galleries, and links. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 17:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You make some good points, and some that I don't agree with. As I said before, I don't see the gallery's original placement as cutting off the flow. The order on <a href="../../../n/j/s/WP%7ENJSCR_394f.html" title="WP:NJSCR">WP:NJSCR</a> puts it right before the "links". By the time you get there, the flow of the article <i>is</i> over, a series of bulleted lists with links don't add to the "flow". Also, the exceptions you list like succession boxes and navboxes -- while it's a stretch, I don't really think they are exceptions, they're part of the "links" section to aid in navigation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That being said, you did allude to something important. Do the galleries really add to the content of the article? IMHO, no. So why include them at all? To some extent, it probably violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>... -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 23:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: your mail. You feel unjustly treated; perhaps fairly enough. The short answer is: don't break 3RR if you don't want to be blocked. A longer answer is: admins don't have time to wade through all the details of particular cases. Who is "vandalising" or not is often unclear. In any event, simply reverting your changes back in because you are right is just a recipe for endless edit war. You need to go into <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> in cases like this <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<li>It would have taken about 30 seconds to look at the initial edits to see what the situation was and to make an informed judgment. The case was laid out for you and described in detail as to where the issues were. I stepped backed, stopped editing, followed every element of the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> process you advocate as the solution, asking for information regarding the user's issues, inviting the individual to accept a <a href="../../../t/h/i/WP%7EThird_opinion_ed43.html" title="WP:Third opinion">WP:Third opinion</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERfM_d120.html" title="WP:RfM">WP:RfM</a>, to have him refuse every time. I encourage you to read the email and review the article history to justify that stopping editing and following the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> process to the letter gets the same arbitrary punishment as doing nothing. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 12:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alan,</p>
<p>I think that we agree on the larger issues of inclusion of more school information. I'm sorry that we have crossed swords at notability. I'd like to explain myself a bit, aside from being overly blunt.</p>
<p>I have become involved with the permutations of notability because I have seen them used to often to defeat good articles at AfD. When we develop an overly complex infrastructure, we run the risk of misinterpretations and conflicts among the various branches. Sometimes it is just as simple as people not reading long blocks of text.</p>
<p>Do you participate at AfD? It amazes me how many people come there to "vote" based on their unsupportable interpretations of guidelines.</p>
<p>I look forward to healing this rift between us.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I'm fully willing to accept whatever the closing admin at the AfD decides. If it's deleted, great (IMHO). If not, I'll move it to something like Interchange at Newark Airport (since <i>if</i> NAI is a proper noun, it's not clear whether it's Turnpike Exit 14 or I-78 Exit 57-58), and gladly help in the cleanup.</p>
<p>Regarding your recent edit to the page, good idea to provide a secondary source given the most recent delete vote on the AFD. The problem with that is the sentence immediately after it, which I've now tagged as OR. If the interchange opened in 1952, then I-78 can't be the main route through it, since it didn't open through the area until the 70s. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 00:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree with you that there are more important things to worry about. That's why I stopped the same time you did. I get that you don't understand my vehemence; for whatever reason, we often disagree, but still manage to work well together most of the time.</dd>
<dd>Like I said, I'm not going to bother putting too much work on the article until after the AfD closes. If it's kept, I'll gladly help in the rewrite, which must clarify that the interchange (as we're referring to it) includes both the interchange it was originally referring to <i>and</i> NJTP Exit 14.</dd>
<dd>While I couldn't say for sure without looking at a historical map or the like, I know that US 1/9 <i>was</i> on its current alignment near the airport in 1952, so that portion of Exit 14 was probably what opened on that date. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 06:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But do you see now (not <i>agree with</i>, but <i>understand</i>) what I was saying when I said that the material can be adequately covered on the individual route articles? All that's left is some measley sentences that I could count on my fingers.

<dd>But not all the information needs to be in each of the articles. In the NJTP article, there's no need to mention that US 22 and NJ 21 end two miles away. The opening of NJTP Exit 14 in 1952 isn't important to any of the articles except the Turnpike, and maybe US 1/9. Nothing would need to be "synchronized". Like I said, I don't expect you to agree with me, I'm just thinking that maybe now it's a little easier to understand where I'm coming from. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:00, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if "unsourced" is accurate, but the question is legitimate. Is Wyckoff a separate municipality from Franklin Township, or is it a new name for a township that has existed previously. The source I have uses "replaced" to describe Wyckoff succeeding Franklin Township, but on the same page states that Woodcliff Lake "replaced" Woodcliff in 1910. Any thoughts. At a minimum, I would say retain the 1920 data for Wyckoff and note that it was as Franklin Township. I've made it through all of Atlantic and Bergen counties so far with USCensuspop. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Part of the problem is that in 1920, Franklin Township also included the current territory of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Lakes_bade.html" title="Franklin Lakes">Franklin Lakes</a>, which is not small. If there was no territory change, I would say keep it. Since there was a territory change, and there is no specification as to how the number was reached, I say it should not be listed. Also, unless I am mistaken, the source that is being used lists 1930-1990 population levels. I'm not sure where this 1920 number comes from, and it conflicts with the data from here <a href="http://www.co.bergen.nj.us/planning/data/census/HistoricalPop.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.co.bergen.nj.us/planning/data/census/HistoricalPop.pdf" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> (article showed 1071, chart shows 1288).

<dd>There are issues with a number of municipalities that came into existence in the 20th century, especially <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramus%2C_New_Jersey_1dd2.html" title="Paramus, New Jersey">Paramus, New Jersey</a> (from Midland Township, now <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochelle_Park%2C_New_Jersey_2c5b.html" title="Rochelle Park, New Jersey">Rochelle Park, New Jersey</a>) and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahwah%2C_New_Jersey_d9f9.html" title="Mahwah, New Jersey">Mahwah, New Jersey</a>) where these quirks exist. The USCensuspop has a footnote function which has already been used in county data, when chunks were broken off to new counties. The underlying question is where did both sources get their data from at the Census Bureau?

<dd>For the county data, it was clear that it was based upon the county borders at the time of the census. Likewise for the 1930-1990 municipal data. We should use the footnote feature in those cases. For the Bergen County 1900-1920 data, that is not clear. IMO that data should only be included if there was no significant teritory change between that census year and 1930. Agreed, it would be good to go back to the Census bureau as the primary source, but I don't know where to get that historical data. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 21:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I've explained before, I don't see what those sources show. I think the term "Newark Airport Interchange" came from the antequated system (still prevalent in Pennsylvania, and to a lesser extent on the New York Thruway) of naming turnpike interchanges in the northeast. That's among the reasons I think they're talking about solely Exit 14.</dd>
<dd>If we turn it into a common noun rather than a proper noun, it magically loses its neologisminess. <small>Only I could create a neologism when talking about neologisms.</small> It shouldn't make a difference whether we call it Newark Airport interchange, interchange at Newark Airport, confluence near Newark Airport, place where a whole bunch of roads come together that's reasonably close to Newark Airport, etc. IMHO, "interchange at Newark Airport" is grammatically cleanest. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 03:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps an option we haven't thought of is I-78/US 1/9 confluence – although we obviously need to tweak the punctuation. Reason being, (1) it distinguishes it from those other interchanges I mentioned, (2) more accurately describes it as a complex of several interchanges, and (3) despite the name, it does include NJTP Exit 14, since traffic coming from I-78 on the Newark Bay Extension exits at Exit 14 to get onto US 1/9... -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 03:09, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately the 2 editors who want it deleted are continuing to edit it to make it worse. I'd revert them but they are threatening me with a 3RR block. I have also suggested an addition to the etiqutte part of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> on the talk page on which you might want to comment. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 22:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, Alansohn. Thanks for the question about my "sudden interest" in the 747. It is not in fact sudden at all, as I have taken the same position consistently since the first AfD debate last November. My position is stated clearly on the article's talk page. In a rather scattered manner, perhaps, so I will try and summarise here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article is named for the "ultimate 747 gambit", and that is therefore the topic of the article. As such, there are a few brief mentions in Dawkins' book <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>, plus a handful of comments from others in reviews etc.</li>
<li>I believe that the phrase/metaphor/analogy/whatever-it-is has not yet achieved sufficient notability or life of its own (like, e.g. "survival of the fittest" or "the selfish gene"), and is best handled in passing in the article on the book. I am quite open to be proved wrong on this, and if the phrase itself (or the specific notion of the 747) is in fact notable enough, fine, let's have an article about it.</li>
<li>But it is not acceptable, within this article, to use Dawkins' phrase as a jumping-off point for a lot of philosophising on the wider topic (improbability of god, or however it is best expressed) that the phrase leads people to think about. To do this is to move so far from the actual topic that the article is no longer about what it claims to be about.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it is unacceptable to use the words of critics who seem to despise Dawkins' idea as a means of presenting what purports to be a summary of Dawkins' argument. That argument (such as it is, and it is indeed fairly meagre in philosophical terms) must be presented in Dawkins' own words. Then the article can move on to the responses of critics and others.</li>
<li>One editor seems determined to push his own view, and not to engage in discussion on what is best for wikipedia in handling the 747 concept. As he is developing the article, it is moving further and further from (a) the actual 747 idea and (b) a fair and unbiased discussion of Dawkins' proposition. In fact (OK, this is my opinion, but it seems inescapable) the phrase is being used as a hook (a straw man?) on which to hang a lot of one-sided philosophy.</li>
<li>The addition of all this material is being used as a means of dressing up the article amd padding it out to the point where that editor can say "Look at all this material - there is far too much here to delete". In doing this he is glossing over the fact that most of the material used to justify keeping the article is not relevant.</li>
<li>In summary, either there is enough notability and material to justify a standalone article or there isn't. If there is, then let the article stand but confine it to the actual topic in question. If there isn't, then it is better (for the moment) as a redirect.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all! No hidden agenda, no vendetta. In contrast to another editor, who is refusing to engage in meaningful debate, trying to bully/bulldoze his way through the opinions of others, and scattering personal attacks about his fellow-editors, based on unwarranted assumptions about their motives, in numerous inappropriate plaeces (the AfD debate, others people's talk pages, etc). <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 08:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I appreciate your good faith and am honestly not trying to protect my "guru" as NBeale puts it. The problem I have with the article is that under its current title it can only discuss the phrase that Dawkins used. To avoid misrepresenting Dawkins we must present the argument in his own words. We can then ONLY use sources that discuss the phrase directly, ie an analysis of that phrase by particular philosopher. In doing this we must not string together lots of bits of arguments as this becomes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. We also have to be careful to balance criticism from various sources and views. Currently the vast majority of reviews are either from highly critical writers or mention the phrase only obliquely and belong in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> article. Because of the restrictive nature of the title balance is very difficult.</p>
<p>It is clear from the sources that NBeale uses that he would like to see an article that describes and discusses the general philosophy of the idea <i>of which the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit is one example</i>. For this a new article title would be needed (or maybe inclusion in one of the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_God_57c6.html" title="Existence of God">Existence of God</a> type articles that already exist). He could then use the examples of the debate phrased by particular philosophers (although it is still OR to string together bits of arguments) and use the "gambit" as an example of how it has been applied.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the article as it now stand looks like a classic hatchet job. It's a phrase (a minor part of the book) that has been highlighted out of context as something that apologists find easy to argue against. It's not even presented in Dawkins own words and NBeale is using all the negative reviews he can find (at great length) that because of undue weight concerns he is not allowed to place in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> article. That is the classic definition of a POV fork - an article created purely to allow critical material to be hung off it.</p>
<p>I have no problem with expanding this strand of philiosphical debate but what matters is how and where it is done. I found this article by accident, didn't like what I saw and said why on the talk page. Discussions would have stayed there if it had not been for the bullying and character asasination I have been subjected to by NBeale. No doubt he's used this technique on others and found that it is effective in scaring them off but unfortunately I now cannot trust him to do a balanced and reasonable job so will hang around and call in outside help where necessary (and by that I mean an article RfC) to ensure that we don't hit <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problems by attributing to Dawkins things that he didn't actually say. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 08:22, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, the fact is. The article was not of much value in its prior form, I was not trying to do anything sneaky. (I really wasn't. Even if it seems that I was.) I am sorry for any annoyance I have casued you. As I pointed out before and AFD can be a great way to jump-start an article. I have nothing against that school as a whole. I am not from Lubbock and I am a Christian. Anyway, I am sorry again and I hope that I have not left you with a bad taste in your mouth.</p>

Once I finish some other tasks (God knows when that will be), I'll put up a to-do/checklist for a final runthrough to see what tweaks still need to be done. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 17:08, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Alan, sorry for giving you extra things to clean up. I was unaware of the whole fair use issue regarding using the GSP/ACE/NJTP icons in my infoboxes (I figured it would be more eye-catching with the icons on there).

<p>While caught up in the argument about whether we should use the term "census designated place" as the primary term to refer to unincorporated towns and villages I did a bit of research. I think what I found was interesting and useful. However I found it awkward to incorporate the information into the census designated place article, partly because the material also belongs in the incorporated place article. Also, a lot of the CDP article explains how a CDP resembles, but is not, an incorporated place where the incorporated place article is practically empty. I don't think there is enough unique material for three separate articles so I'm proposing a merger into one article named "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Place_%28United_States_Census_Bureau%29_b9a0.html" title="Place (United States Census Bureau)">place (United States Census Bureau)</a>". I have already written the article that explains the terms in a logical order. I am asking for opinions, edits, etc. from other people who have written on the issue. See <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlace_%28United_States_Census_Bureau%29_b7a5.html" title="Talk:Place (United States Census Bureau)">Talk:Place (United States Census Bureau)</a> for more information. <a href="../../../r/s/d/User%7ERsduhamel_fe61.html" title="User:Rsduhamel">Rsduhamel</a> 01:12, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been meaning to start articles for various Vanderbilt coaches, but I think it looks tacky if I'm one of a couple of fans doing so. Thanks for starting this! Cheers, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipR_8272.html" title="User:PhilipR">PhilipR</a> 02:13, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand why the article was deleted, but could I ask you to create a user version of the article for me so that I can address the wikifying and reference issues that seem sto have been the reason for deletion. While I have refeernced the article, I apparently hadn't added it to my watchlist. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:53, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was a one-liner, "Tiquan Underwood is the star wide receiver on the Rutgers University Football Team." That's all. It was tagged as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}}, but it could have been under A1 or A3 as well (lack of context/content). He might be notable, but it needs a little more info on why.
