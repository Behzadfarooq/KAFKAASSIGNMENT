<dd>Thanks. The fair-use claim for the image is a little questionable (but I won't say anything if you won't). The image should be fine. The CMT.com source, on the other hand, is identical to the <i>All Music Guide</i> source that I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cal_Smith&amp;diff=50945144&amp;oldid=50896726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cal_Smith&amp;diff=50945144&amp;oldid=50896726" rel="nofollow">cited</a>. Presumably CMT.com has permission to use the text on its site, but they don't do a very good job of acknowleging the original publication or passing on its copyright information. Anyway, Wikipedia won't be able to legally keep the exact text from CMT.com, since it is in fact copyrighted by the book's publisher. The source does provide some good information, though. And, of course, information yearns to be free. So, we can indeed use information from CMT.com if we present it in an original context and properly cite its source. For now, I'll keep the changes you made to the discography and the image, but I'm going to have to remove the copyrighted text. I don't want to give the impression that I'm trying to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the article. (I'm actually thrilled that someone else has found an interest in it.) However, we don't want to violate an copyright laws. Thanks.

<dd>Thanks for all the song info, but I'm afraid that the formatting problems are beyond me. It would be just as much work to put in all the || and so forth, and move things around, as it will be to just type in the songs little by little. It's a little like trying to put into correct, and colloquial English, something that has been written in English by someone who speaks it well but doesn't write it perfectly. It's almost more work to make the corrections and rewrite his well-meaning but sometimes mysterious sentences than it would be to simply write the whole damn thing yourself. I just did this with the article on <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarte_flamb%C3%A9e.html" title="Tarte flambée">tarte flambée</a> and it's very tedious.... <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 23:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, and thanks for the kind words about the George Jones page. I'll be through with putting the songs in one of these days. Then I'll take another look at the Country Project. As far as Hank Williams is concerned, I'm not much of an expert on him. I did put in some material a year or so ago, when the article was much shorter, and also did a little rewriting of it. I'll take another look at it, however, and see if there's anything I can add, although I doubt it. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 01:17, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I think I did pretty well on my tests. I like how you've been linking years (such as [[1974|1974 in music]]). There are some more copyright problems with the changes you made to the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_PayCheck_10f0.html" title="Johnny PayCheck">Johnny PayCheck</a> article, though. As soon as I get a chance, I'll clean it up a little. I'll try to keep as many of your changes as I can.

<p>When you upload images, you just need to put the web address of the source on the image summary page. And if you know the copyright status, you can add the appropriate tag. If you're not sure about the copyright status, just list the source so that others can determine the copyright status. Most of the images that you have uploaded so far appear to be promotional photos and album covers, which qualify as fair use and can be kept on Wikipedia if you just supply the source information. It would be a shame to lose all of these images you've uploaded because they don't have sources. Let me know if you need help.

<p>I've removed the copyrighted text from the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_PayCheck_10f0.html" title="Johnny PayCheck">Johnny PayCheck</a> article. Unfortunately, there isn't much information left in the article concerning the later part of his career. For example, there probably needs to be a little more information about his criminal record. It would be great if you could add some more to the article, but be sure that it's not copyrighted text. It's usually best to use your own words, because most websites are copyrighted and present information in an unencyclopedic tone. Don't worry about it if you don't have time to deal with it.

<p>We're getting nowhere on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_List_of_proposed_projects_4bea.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject/List of proposed projects">list of proposed wikiprojects</a>. In fact, it looks like projects are usually more successful when they skip that stage in the process.

I've noticed that one of the most successful WikiProjects is the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">military history project</a>, so I'm going to use it and some of the projects I've been working on as "role models" as I build up the country music project.

<p>I don't know anything about the video scene but I do know that back in the years (mid-90s) when I occasionly watched what I think was the Nashville Network (when it played nothing but country videos) I saw a George Jones video of him singing "Walls Can Fall" and then a year or so later another video of "Honky Tonk Song". Should these be included in the list, or are these another kind of video? By the way, are these videos available for purchase to play at home? <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 18:27, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've just asked an administrator who, as far as I know, has never had anything to do with the George Jones page to take a look at the header of the list of hits and to give us his opinion as to whether you or I are right about this matter. It's too trivial to fight about, but I'd like to see it done right. I will abide by any decision he makes about the matter.

<dd>The Admin. has fixed the problem, as you've probably seen. Here's what he wrote to me on my Discussion page: "I took the problematic wording and placed it on its own line.

<p>Just noticed you working on the George Jones article. I started doing some minor work on it myself yesterday. I mostly do cleanup (grammar, wikifying, punctuation, adding references, etc). I was planning on submitting this for a Good Aritcle nomination, or maybe going straight to FAC, after getting it into shape. It looks like you've done, and are doing, a great job on this article. By the way, I have a CD of Jones' live <i>Louisanna Hayrid</i> recordings, but I don't see it in the discography section. Do you know anything about it? I can't find my CD right now or I would add it myself.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 03:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
