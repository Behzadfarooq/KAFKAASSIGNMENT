<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Watts was born to <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> parents in the village of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chislehurst.html" title="Chislehurst">Chislehurst</a> (now in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Bromley_badb.html" title="London Borough of Bromley">London Borough of Bromley</a>), <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in the year 1915. His father was a representative for the London office of the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelin.html" title="Michelin">Michelin Tyre Company</a>, his mother a housewife whose father had been a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionary</a>. With modest financial means, they chose to live in bucolic surroundings and Alan, an only child, grew up learning the names of wild flowers and butterflies, playing beside streams, and performing funeral ceremonies for birds.</p>
<p>Probably because of the influence of his mother’s religious family, the Buchans, an interest in "ultimate things" seeped in. But it mixed with Alan’s own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East. Watts also later wrote of a mystical sort of vision he experienced while ill with a fever as a child. During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. With regard to the examples of Chinese paintings he was able to see in England, Watts wrote "I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float..." [as presented in his autobiography]. These works of art emphasized the participative relationship of man in nature, a theme that would be important to him throughout his life.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Buddhism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Buddhism</span></h4>
<p>By his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_school.html" title="Boarding school">boarding schools</a> (which included both academic and religious training) from early years. During holidays in his teen years, Francis Croshaw, a wealthy <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicureanism.html" title="Epicureanism">epicurean</a> with strong interests in both <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and the exotic, little-known aspects of European culture, took Watts on a trip through <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> Christianity he had been exposed to and the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw’s. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge which had been established by <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theosophism.html" title="Theosophism">Theosophists</a>, and was now run by the barrister <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Humphreys_b6a6.html" title="Christmas Humphreys">Christmas Humphreys</a>. Watts became the organization’s secretary at 16. The young Watts experimented with several styles of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">meditation</a> during these years.</p>
<p><a name="Education" id="Education"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h4>
<p>Watts attended King's School next door to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury_Cathedral_f215.html" title="Canterbury Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically, and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> to <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as presumptuous and capricious.</p>
<p>Hence, when he graduated from secondary school, Watts was thrust into the world of employment, working in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the Buddhist Lodge and also under the tutelage of a "rascal guru" named <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimitrije_Mitrinovi%C4%87_39e1.html" title="Dimitrije Mitrinović">Dimitrije Mitrinović</a>. (Mitrinović was himself influenced by <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._D._Ouspensky_c434.html" title="P. D. Ouspensky">Peter Demianovich Ouspensky</a>, <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._I._Gurdjieff_1025.html" title="G. I. Gurdjieff">G. I.

Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry, and Eastern wisdom.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Influences and publication">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influences and publication</span></h4>
<p>Through Humphreys he was able to come into contact with eminent spiritual authors (e.g., <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Roerich_916e.html" title="Nicholas Roerich">Nicholas Roerich</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarvapalli_Radhakrishnan_01e7.html" title="Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan">Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan</a>) and prominent theosophists like <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Bailey_5c5f.html" title="Alice Bailey">Alice Bailey</a>. London afforded him considerable other opportunities, as well. He attended the World Congress of Faiths at the University of London in 1936, heard <a href="../../../d/2E/t/D.T._Suzuki_82f5.html" title="D.T. Suzuki">D.T. Suzuki</a> read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen_Buddhism_af30.html" title="Zen Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a>. Besides these discussions and personal encounters, by studying the available scholarly literature, he absorbed the fundamental <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concepts.html" title="Concepts">concepts</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminology.html" title="Terminology">terminology</a> of the main philosophies of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>. In 1936, at 21 years old, Watts got his first book published, <i>The Spirit of Zen</i>, which he acknowledged later to be mainly digested from the translated writings of Suzuki.</p>
<p>In 1938 he and his bride left England to live in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">America</a>. He had married Eleanor Everett, whose mother Ruth Fuller Everett was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. A few years later, Ruth Fuller married the Zen master (or "roshi"), Sokei-an Sasaki, and this Japanese gentleman served as a sort of model and mentor to Alan, though Watts chose not to remain within a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife.</p>
<p><a name="Priesthood_and_after" id="Priesthood_and_after"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Priesthood and after">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Priesthood and after</span></h4>
<p>Watts had left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher didn't suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a professional outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered an Anglican (Episcopalian) school (Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, in Evanston), where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and Church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to the thesis which he published as a popular edition under the title <i>Behold the Spirit</i>. The pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing, whether found within <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, or <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.</p>
<p>All seemed to go reasonably well in his next role, as Episcopalian priest (beginning in 1945), until an extramarital affair resulted in his young wife having their marriage annulled. It also resulted in Watts leaving the ministry by 1950. He spent the New Year getting to know <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Campbell_2650.html" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>, his wife, Jean Eardman, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cage_f879.html" title="John Cage">John Cage</a>. In the spring of 1951 he moved westward to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies, in San Francisco. Here he taught alongside Saburo Hasegawa, Frederick Spiegelberg, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haridas_Chaudhuri_a14a.html" title="Haridas Chaudhuri">Haridas Chaudhuri</a>, lama Tokwan Tada, and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature.</p>
<p>Watts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the Academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen_Buddhism_af30.html" title="Zen Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a>, with its origins in China, his reading and discussions delved into <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedanta.html" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a>, "<a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_physics.html" title="Quantum physics">the new physics</a>," <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybernetics.html" title="Cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process_philosophy.html" title="Process philosophy">process philosophy</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">natural history</a>, and the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> of sexuality.</p>

<p>After heading up the Academy for a few years, Watts left the faculty for a freelance career in the mid 1950s. He began what became a long-running weekly radio program at <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifica_Radio_b1e1.html" title="Pacifica Radio">Pacifica radio</a> station <a href="../../../k/p/f/KPFA_b5dd.html" title="KPFA">KPFA</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a>. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts; they did, however, gain him a large following in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Bay_Area_b47d.html" title="San Francisco Bay Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. These programs were later carried by additional Pacifica stations, and were re-broadcast many times over in the decades following his death. The original tapes are currently held by the Pacifica Radio Archive, based at <a href="../../../k/p/f/KPFK_bd66.html" title="KPFK">KPFK</a> in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In 1957 Watts published one of his best known books, <i>The Way of Zen</i>, which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen, in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_semantics.html" title="General semantics">general semantics</a> (directly from the writings of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Korzybski_f76a.html" title="Alfred Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a>) and <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybernetics.html" title="Cybernetics">cybernetics</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Norbert_Wiener_d0a4.html" title="Norbert Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>'s early work on cybernetics had been recently published). Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.</p>
<p>Around this time, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the renowned psychiatrist <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Jung_ba49.html" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a>. In relation to modern psychology, Watts' instincts were closer to Jung's or <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Maslow_1cec.html" title="Abraham Maslow">Abraham Maslow</a>'s than to those of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Experimentation" id="Experimentation"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Experimentation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Experimentation</span></h4>
<p>When he returned to the U.S., he began to dabble in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelics.html" title="Psychedelics">psychedelic</a> drug experiences, initially with <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mescaline.html" title="Mescaline">mescaline</a> given to him by Dr. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Janiger_83a0.html" title="Oscar Janiger">Oscar Janiger</a>. He soon tried <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a> several times with various research teams led by Drs. Keith Ditman, Sterling Bunnell, and Michael Agron. He also tried <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimethyltryptamine.html" title="Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a>, later stating that it was 'like loading the Universe into a gun and firing it into your brain'. Watts’ books of the sixties reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook. He would later comment about drug use, "When you've got the message, hang up the phone." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>For a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (<i>Psychotherapy East and West</i> is a good example), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by twentieth-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.</p>
<p><a name="Philosophical_development" id="Philosophical_development"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Philosophical development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophical development</span></h4>
<p>Watts' explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_potential_movement.html" title="Human potential movement">human potential movement</a>. His friendship with poet <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a> nurtured his sympathies with the budding <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_movement.html" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a>, to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Anton_Wilson_96e8.html" title="Robert Anton Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a>, who credited Watts with being one of his 'Light[s] along the Way' in the opening appreciation of <i>Cosmic Trigger</i>.</p>
<p>In certain ways, Watts' philosophy was similar to that of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel_6ad4.html" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Hegel</a>, except that Watts emphasized <i>feelings</i> instead of abstract understanding alone, and as time went on Watts more and more sought practical and everyday applications for his outlook.</p>
<p>Though never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he did have a fellowship for a couple of years at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> University. He also lectured to many college and university students. His lectures and books gave Watts far-reaching influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s-1970s, but Watts was often seen as an outsider in academia. While some college and university professors found his writing and lectures interesting, others said things like: "He's not really a scholar of Eastern philosophy. He's not that disciplined. Alan Watts doesn't teach Eastern philosophy, he teaches 'Alan Watts.'" To which he replied in numerous lectures that "the scholar who is interested in medals and prizes and not interested in the fun of it, has amazing put downs." He pointed this out with an example: "The original scholars in history were men that owned land, and being rich they had enough free time to study in their library, not for the progress of science, but for fun." Another Japanese Zen master, Maezumi Roshi, however, once remarked, "Alan Watts? He is not Zen!"--a perfectly Zen-like response that may well have delighted Watts.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Edit section: Applied aesthetics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Applied aesthetics</span></h4>
<p>Watts often alluded to or wrote about a group of neighbors in Druid Heights<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> (near <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mill_Valley_733b.html" title="Mill Valley">Mill Valley</a>, California), who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding his intentions, it can be argued that Watts attempted to lessen the alienation that accompanies the experience of being human that he felt plagued the modern Westerner, and (like his fellow <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> expat and friend, <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldous_Huxley_db2b.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>) to lessen the ill will that was an unintentional by-product of alienation from the natural world. He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of aesthetics (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, "… cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix" (Watts, <i>In My Own Way</i>).</p>

<p>In his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chan.html" title="Chan">Chan</a> or Zen in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages.</p>
<p>In his mature work, he presents himself as "Zennist" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, Tao, the Watercourse Way. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.</p>
<p>On the personal level, Watts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in classic his comments on love relationships in "Divine Madness" and on perception of the organism-environment in "The Philosophy of Nature".</p>
<p>In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance or even understanding among disparate cultures. He also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament; as one instance, in the early 1960s he wrote: “Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin – especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?" [<i>The Joyous Cosmology</i>] These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for NET filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.</p>

<p>In his writings, Watts alluded to his own political shift from <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a> to a more liberal legal and political outlook. However, his opinions did not lean to the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">political left</a>. He was more <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a>,<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> distrusting both the left and right, and finding an early libertarian outlook in the Chinese sage <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuang-Tzu_761d.html" title="Chuang-Tzu">Chuang-Tzu</a>. He disliked much in the conventional idea of "progress". He hoped for change, but personally he preferred amiable, semi-isolated rural social enclaves, and also believed in tolerance for urban tenderloins, social misfits, and eccentric artists. Watts decried the suburbanization of the countryside and the way of life that went with it.</p>
<p>In one campus lecture tour, which Watts titled "The End to the Put-Down of Man", Watts presented positive images for both nature and humanity, spoke in favor of the various stages of human growth (including the teenage years), reproached excessive cynicism and rivalry, and extolled intelligent creativity, good architecture and food.</p>

<p>Watts felt that <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> (at least of the judgmental Judeo-Christian kind) had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one’s deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape. At the same time, he favored representative government rather than direct democracy (which he felt could readily degenerate into <a href="../../../o/c/h/Ochlocracy.html" title="Ochlocracy">mob rule</a>).</p>
<p>He often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.</p>
<p>Watts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_martial_arts.html" title="Chinese martial arts">Chinese martial</a> art <a href="../../../t/27/a/T%27ai_Chi_Ch%27uan_a26f.html" title="T'ai Chi Ch'uan">T'ai Chi Ch'uan</a>, with an Asian colleague, Al Chung-liang Huang. Watts lived his later years at times on a houseboat in <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausalito.html" title="Sausalito">Sausalito</a> on <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Bay_3080.html" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and at times in a secluded cabin on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Tamalpais_2fe1.html" title="Mount Tamalpais">Mount Tamalpais</a>. Laden with social and financial responsibilities, he lectured increasingly in his later years, which probably shortened his life. Watts died while at home in November 1973 at the age of 58 three days after his return from an exhausting international lecture tour. Towards the end of his life he struggled with <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol_addiction.html" title="Alcohol addiction">alcohol addiction</a> and, according to a minister who met him late in life, "No doubt alcoholism was a major contributor to his death"<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
