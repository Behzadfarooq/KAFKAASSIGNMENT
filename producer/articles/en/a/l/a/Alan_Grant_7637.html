<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Grant_7637.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h3>
<p>Alan Grant first entered the comics industry in 1967 when he became an editor for <a href="../../../d/2E/_/D._C._Thomson_%26_Co._Ltd_263b.html" title="D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd">D.C. Thompson</a> before moving to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> from <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> in 1970 to work for <a href="../../../i/p/c/IPC_Media_817d.html" title="IPC Media">IPC</a> on various romance magazines.</p>
<p>After going back to college and having a series of jobs which he failed to hold down, Grant found himself back in Dundee and living on social security. It was here that Grant met <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wagner_4228.html" title="John Wagner">John Wagner</a>, another former D.C. Thompson editor. Wagner was helping put together a new <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> comic for IPC (this was <i>2000AD</i>) and was unable to complete his other work because of this. Wagner asked Grant if he could help him write the <i><a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a></i> comic he was working on and this was the start of the Wagner/Grant writing partnership.</p>
<p><a name="2000AD"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Grant_7637.html" title="Edit section: 2000AD">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>2000AD</i></span></h3>
<p>Grant was asked by Wagner to try to write a strip for <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starlord.html" title="Starlord">Starlord</a></i>, a <i>2000AD</i> spin off title. This got Grant noticed within IPC and on a trip to London, Grant was introduced to <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin_Gosnell_3e98.html" title="Kelvin Gosnell">Kelvin Gosnell</a>, the then editor of <i>2000AD</i>, who offered Grant an editorial position on the comic. One of Grant's first jobs was to oversee the merger of <i>2000AD</i> and <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornado_%28comic%29.html" title="Tornado (comic)">Tornado</a></i>, an unsuccessful boys adventure comic. Grant also featured as a character in the comic in the form of ALN-1, Tharg's Scottish Robot assistant. However Grant found himself in conflict with IPC and resigned to become a freelance writer and moved on to write the occasional <i><a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_Shocks_749e.html" title="Future Shocks">Future Shock</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackhawk_%28UK_comic%29_91b7.html" title="Blackhawk (UK comic)">Blackhawk</a></i>, the tale of a Roman soldier kidnapped by aliens.</p>
<p>Grant then formed his partnership with Wagner after the pair lived and worked together, with Grant contributing ideas at first before eventually co-writing <i>Judge Dredd</i> together. The pair would work on other popular strips for the comic including <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robo-Hunter_cac9.html" title="Robo-Hunter">Robo-Hunter</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strontium_Dog_2b6e.html" title="Strontium Dog">Strontium Dog</a></i> using the pseudonym T.B.Grover. Grant also worked on other people's stories changing and adding dialogue, most notably <i>Harry Twenty on the High Rock</i> which was written by <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Finley-Day_9271.html" title="Gerry Finley-Day">Gerry Finley-Day</a>. It was <i>Judge Dredd</i> which would be Grant's main concern for much of the 1980s. Grant and Wagner had developed the strip into the most popular in <i>2000AD</i> as well as creating lengthy epic storylines such as <i>The Apocalypse War</i> which would bring major change for the world of Judge Dredd.</p>
<p>Grant was hugely prolific at this time in the 1980s. He was not only writing for <i>2000AD</i>, but other IPC comics such as the revamped <i><a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_%28comic%29.html" title="Eagle (comic)">Eagle</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="American_work_in_the_1980s" id="American_work_in_the_1980s"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Grant_7637.html" title="Edit section: American work in the 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">American work in the 1980s</span></h3>
<p>By the late 1980s Grant and Wagner were about to move into the American comic market, their first title was a 12 issue mini series called <i><a href="../../../o/u/t/Outcasts_%28comics%29.html" title="Outcasts (comics)">Outcasts</a></i> for <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>. Although it wasn't a success, it paved the way for the pair to write <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> in <i><a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_Comics_f034.html" title="Detective Comics">Detective Comics</a></i> from issue 583. After a dozen issues Wagner left (due to Judge Dredd being optioned for a film) to leave Grant as sole writer and this left Grant to become one of the main Batman writers until the late 1990s. Notable Batman adversaries creared by Grant include <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky.html" title="Anarky">Anarky</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Ventriloquist_%28comics%29.html" title="Ventriloquist (comics)">the Ventriloquist</a> and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Zsasz_8eb3.html" title="Mr. Zsasz">Mr. Zsasz</a>.</p>
<p>The pair also created a four issue series for <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Comics_14eb.html" title="Epic Comics">Epic Comics</a> called <i>The Last American</i>. It is this series, as well as the <i>Chopper</i> storyline in <i>Judge Dredd</i>, which is blamed for the breakup of the Wagner/Grant partnership. The pair split strips, with Wagner keeping Judge Dredd and Grant keeping Strontium Dog and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Anderson_1069.html" title="Judge Anderson">Judge Anderson</a>. However the split didn't mean the pair never worked again, they continue to work together on special projects such as the Batman/Judge Dredd crossover <i><a href="../../../j/u/d/Judgement_on_Gotham_1dc6.html" title="Judgement on Gotham">Judgement on Gotham</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="1990s"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Grant_7637.html" title="Edit section: 1990s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1990s</span></h3>
<p>Grant remained highly prolific, his projects at the start of this decade included writing <i>Detective Comics</i> and <i>Strontium Dog</i>, but two projects in particular are especially notable. The first is <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bogie_Man_df77.html" title="The Bogie Man">The Bogie Man</a></i>, a series co-written by John Wagner which was the pair's first venture into independent publishing. The second is <i><a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobo_%28DC_Comics%29_afa5.html" title="Lobo (DC Comics)">Lobo</a></i>, a character created by <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Giffen_1f78.html" title="Keith Giffen">Keith Giffen</a> as a supporting character in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Omega_Men_8f4e.html" title="The Omega Men">The Omega Men</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>Lobo</i> gained his own four issue mini series in 1990 which was drawn by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Bisley_6d88.html" title="Simon Bisley">Simon Bisley</a>. This was a parody of the 'dark, gritty' comics of the time and proved hugely popular. After several other mini series (all written by Grant, sometimes with Giffen as co-writer), Lobo received his own ongoing series. Grant was also writing <i><a href="../../../l/2E/e/L.E.G.I.O.N._278d.html" title="L.E.G.I.O.N.">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a></i> (a <i><a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super-Heroes_043c.html" title="Legion of Super-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></i> spin-off) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Demon_6128.html" title="The Demon">The Demon</a></i> (a revival of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kirby_cae4.html" title="Jack Kirby">Jack Kirby</a>'s character) for DC Comics. Grant also wrote the new Batman title, <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Batman%7E_Shadow_of_the_Bat_f5cf.html" title="Batman: Shadow of the Bat">Shadow of the Bat</a></i>, as well as being one of the main writers during the <i><a href="../../../k/n/i/Knightfall.html" title="Knightfall">Knightfall</a></i> crossover.</p>
<p>Grant was also part of the creative team for the short lived weekly title <i><a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxic%21.html" title="Toxic!">Toxic!</a></i> and was a consultant on the <i><a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Dredd_Megazine_253e.html" title="Judge Dredd Megazine">Judge Dredd Megazine</a></i>. Due to the sheer volume of work he was doing, Grant let a new generation of writers try their hand on strips like Judge Dredd and Robo-Hunter. However this often proved to be unsuccessful and Grant found himself getting more involved again with writing for <i>2000AD</i>.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade Grant had written for virtually every American publisher of comic books, including DC, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Horse_Comics_d50b.html" title="Dark Horse Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a>.</p>

<p>Grant had become involved with writing scripts for animation as well as his comic work, notably working on <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Man_6c16.html" title="Action Man">Action Man</a></i> cartoons as well as original <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>. He remains the main writer for Judge Anderson and Robo-hunter and has teamed up with John Wagner for a new <i>Bogie Man</i> story for the <i>Judge Dredd Megazine</i>. He has also formed his own publishing company called Bad Press Ltd, who have so far only released the humour title <i>Shit the Dog</i> which was written by Grant and drawn by Simon Bisley.</p>
<p>He is one of the few professional comics writers to contribute to fanzines such as <i><a href="../../../f/u/t/FutureQuake_f321.html" title="FutureQuake">FutureQuake</a></i>. He also partly owns and provides scripts for <i>Northern Lightz</i>, a Scottish underground comic. Along with his wife Sue, they organise the annual <a href="../../../m/o/n/Moniaive.html" title="Moniaive">Moniaive</a> Comics Festival which attracts many British creators.</p>
