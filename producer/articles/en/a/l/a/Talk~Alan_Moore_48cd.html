<p>Can we have some discussion about the second paragraph of the introduction? It's my opinion that the whole thing should be removed, influences should be listed under influences in the photo box. The actual content of this paragraph other than the list of influences almost non-existent, I believe it pushes the actual valuable content further down the page. Look up almost any author on Wikipedia; you won't normally find a list of influences in the second paragraph. I think that it's symptomatic of a comics "community" craving acceptance by readers of non illustrated literature and I for one think it's time to admit that that acceptance is already there when someone arrives at this page; what's important is to and present some good encycopedic content.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree very strongly. Any artist's influences are important and should not be neglected. Specifically in Moore's case, a large part of the impact he made was down to him having a wider range of influences than the average comics writer in the early 80s. Along with the likes of Bryan Talbot and Grant Morrison, he is part of a movement that stems from the New Wave science fiction writers of the 60s and 70s. To include his influences is to place his work in context and tell the reader something about his work. To ignore them and treat him in isolation is uninformative and risks becoming a cult of personality. Such an approach is sadly not uncommon - the article on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Sienkiewicz_63b6.html" title="Bill Sienkiewicz">Bill Sienkiewicz</a> mentions his influence on other artists, but not that he was influenced by artists like <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Adams_0cb7.html" title="Neal Adams">Neal Adams</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barron_Storey_5ab6.html" title="Barron Storey">Barron Storey</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Steadman_1b5b.html" title="Ralph Steadman">Ralph Steadman</a>, and <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Fabry_1683.html" title="Glenn Fabry">Glenn Fabry</a>'s article doesn't mention the influence of <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Giraud_56ed.html" title="Jean Giraud">Moebius</a> or <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustave_Courbet_35d7.html" title="Gustave Courbet">Gustave Courbet</a>, but they should, and if I can find appropriate references they will. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 22:23, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well what you have written makes more sense and reads better than what is there. I think that phrases like "a large part of the impact he made was down to him having a wider range of influences than the average comics writer in the early 80s. Along with the likes of Bryan Talbot and Grant Morrison, he is part of a movement that stems from the New Wave science fiction writers of the 60s and 70s." Should be in the article but the list itself should be moved to the list of influences in the data box or whatever it's called under his photo on the right. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.20.47.30_3956.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.20.47.30">82.20.47.30</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.20.47.30.html" title="User talk:82.20.47.30">talk</a>) 16:30, 17 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>A user called "L." has removed a passage I wrote in the section on <i>From Hell</i> which connected Gull's statement that he had "delivered" the twentieth century with the conception of Hitler depected earlier in the book, because the use of the phrase "simple arithmetic", unconsciously lifted from a source cited in the references, apparently constitutes "plagiarism". The connection between the two was an important part of my interpretation of the book, so I have reinstated it, rewritten to avoid the offending phrase. However I consider "plagiarism", for a matter of two words, to be an outrageous accusation and would appreciate a retraction. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 8 July 2005 17:37 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid I myself have been successfully accused of plagiarism for unconciously printing two words together that were also from another source (the words were "flabby weight" and, ironically, also concern Hitler). I'm afraid I had to agree with them - Wiki contributors must hold themselves to an extremely high standard. Moreover, there is no place here for hurt feelings and egos. --<a href="../../../l/2E/_/User%7EL._6c28.html" title="User:L.">L.</a> 9 July 2005 14:50 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reworked the article a little to remove some redundancy. I don't think that Supreme or 1963 can be considered major works, and the sections on the "interim" and ABC duplicate earlier sections, so I've merged these parts into Career History. I've also added subheadings for From Hell and Promethea under major works, to be filled in when I (or anyone else) has the time. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 19:43, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I disagree about Supreme not being a major work. It (along with the precurser, 1963, which I'll concede is not one of his major projects) introduced a completly new era in his writing style, and a brand new way to look at superhero books. It's one of his most innovative projects, and just as clever in its way as the grim and gritty books. I put it back in.</p>
<p>--Scott Dubin</p>
<p>Fair enough. I think its more notable in the context of the evolution of his work rather than a great piece of work per se, but maybe I'm a bit biased against superheroes. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 17:32, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the Sinister Ducks are worth a brief mention, though I may be biased because it was my comment. It's not like it's mentioning an unimportant comic he wrote - musical work is a complete deviation from the rest of his body of work and hence worth a mention.</p>
<p>Yeah, but is his Sinister Ducks stuff professional quality, or just a hobby level thing? I'm not sure that a hobby project would rank. How many people have listened to it, have you? Scott Dubin</p>
<p>The Sinister Ducks are definately of professional quality. I have MP3s of both March of the Sinister Ducks and Old Gansters Never Die, and they're both songs which I would love even if they weren't related to Alan Moore.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't decided upon how/where to add a mention to this article for The Sinister Ducks, but I think it definitely warrants inclusion. The band members were Alan Moore, Alex Green and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_J_56bd.html" title="David J">David J</a>, and it appears to have had an actual release as a 45rpm record.

<p>In response to the denial of featured article status, I've added some references and put more detail into the bibliography. There's not, as far as I know, a great body of critical writing about comics, so most of the information about his work comes from reading the comics themselves.

<p>I note no mention in the "early work" section of the 1970s "St Pancras Panda" series, written and illustrated by Moore for Oxfords's Back Street Bugle magazine. In its thirteen episodes, our cuddly hero was, in his own words, "shanghied by furriers, kidnapped by cultists, browbeaten by bears, got at by gangsters, abducted by aliens" before getting a dose of relgion and being sent to meet his maker. Alas the series was never completed - Moore was offered work that paid actual money - and the eponymous panda was thus abandonned over 25 years ago in "Northampton - an accident black spot - where there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth". The "Penultimate Panda, Panky's Inferno" never appeared. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Levine_af4b.html" title="User:Nick Levine">Nick Levine</a> 19:57, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I don't think it's the place of a source of information to ignore the period entirely, because people should be aware of it if they want to know it, but to create an entire mixed list actually seemed, to me, to make the information people would want more obscured. It seemed to me like DC could largely be described by "DC Universe", "V For Vendetta", "Watchmen", and the "Swamp Thing" books ... but if you kept the stories arranged by book, would you file all the stories collected in "DC Universe" together, or would you cite each one seperately and then put "reprinted in 'DC Universe' book (at which point, the question becomes, "What else is reprinted in there?"). And the early stuff is largely for completists only (actually, I think it might not even be fully complete; I'm pretty sure I didn't put in all the stuff, missing some short stories along the way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I'll abide by whatever you guys decide. Even though I generally do see the logic to the straight-alphabetical listing, in this specific case, it actually seemed (to me) to be more beneficial for accessing the information people would be most interested in. Sorry, didn't mean to cause trouble</dd>

<dd>See my thinking is that a straight alphabetically listing is probably not the best way to go and I'm suggesting sorting things chronologically (see also the comments on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Morrison_1462.html" title="Grant Morrison">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garth_Ennis_13b2.html" title="Garth Ennis">Garth Ennis</a> entries. If you did that the various periods would emerge but you'd also get extra pluses (seeing the transitions between those phases) without some of the minuses (the classifcation nightmare of somehow having Marvelman in early British work and V in DC - not that there is good solution within the current framework). At the moment I'm not that bothered as long as the bibliography keeps getting tidied up and dates and the like are added so if/when it gets sorted chronoligically it'll all be much easier.

<dd>I can dig you; I put "V" there because it seemed as if the entries were based on the trade paperbacks, not the original printings, and the trade was (of course) DC when it was finished ... which also points to one of the complications of a chronological listing, especially with somebody like Moore; 'V For Vendetta' took five years or so to actually finish ... 'Lost Girls' was first published almost 15 years ago, and has been worked on on and off since then, and is now coming out as a trade ... I don't even totally understand 'Glory', but it was apparently written more than a decade ago, published two issues, and stopped; maybe it'll be finished one day. Moore wrote 'The Killing Joke' as a favor to a friend at DC, but because the art took so long, it wound up being published more than a year after Moore had bitterly left the company.</dd>
<dd>I want to say, I do totally see your points about the limitation of the format I implemented (a possible [temporary?] solution to the specific V example would adding this to "Early British Work":</dd>

<dd>Just an idea ... anyway, I'll work on the dates some more next time I'm at work, because I do think that information is imporant, I just don't know that it should neccessarily be the primary sorting tool overall (even though, in this case, I did do some of that just because so much of his work can be easily categorized that way; I personally would vote for straight-alphabetical over straight-chronological, but I thought some sort of compromise made sense in the Moore listing for the reasons I mentioned above. With Moore, it's difficult to figure out the easiest way to arrange all the information for maximum clarity...</dd>

<dd>That is just making things worse&#160;;) . You can't list strips from anthologies under the actual anthology (just think of how that would work for the 2000 AD entries). Its fine as it is for now. The fact that it took a while to complete isn't an issue - a lot of series stretch over long periods of time and it doesn't cause a problem putting things in chronological order - it just goes under the first publication date (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 16:02, 5 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>No, I understand how they'd be arranged, I was saying those quirks of publication, which are quite numerous in Moore's case, make it difficult for the flow ... I mean, if people wind up wanting it chronological, that's fine, it just seems to me like people would be more likely to scan a Garth Ennis bibliography looking for a full list of all his Punisher works together, rather than wanting to find out whether 'Pride and Joy' was published just before 'Unknown Soldier' or just after.</dd>

As he is a fan of <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Talbot_6193.html" title="Bryan Talbot">Bryan Talbot</a>'s work I suspect he is contrasting his own output with things like Luther Arkwright.

<dd>I disagree. "sort of graphic work that could conceivably be described as a novel" refers to a work that is comparable to a novel in terms of length, scope and artistic unity, not simply something that was first published in book format rather than pamphlet format. The only comics I own that I would consider comparable to novels are <i>Watchmen</i>, <i>From Hell</i>, <i>Luther Arkwright</i> and <i>Cages</i>, all of which were serialised before being published in a single volume (as were all Dickens's novels, and we don't call them "limited series"), and possibly the entire series of <i>Sandman</i>, which is a single work published in several volumes, like many Victorian novels, and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. <i>A Small Killing</i> is probably too short to be a true novel, as is <i>The Forty-Niners</i> which is also an installment of a series rather than a unified work (this is not a judgement of quality, just a personal judgment of whether they're comparable to novels - I like 'em both, and admire a lot of comics, from <i>Tintin</i> to <i>the Desert Peach</i>, that aren't novelistic at all, and are no worse for that). "Trade paperback" is jargon and shouldn't be used in a work for the general reader - it's a wholesaling term and just means an oversized paperback book, regardless of content. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 08:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One easy way to cut is to make the summaries of his major works much shorter; these works all have lengthy articles of their own, and people who are interested can follow those links if they like.

<p>I just recently added the detail that Melinda Gebbie is Moore's fiancée, based on the article and interview in the August 23, 2006 <i><a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Voice_bbe7.html" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a></i>, but I then scrolled further down and saw that it asserts that she's his <i>wife</i>. Have they gotten married within the past two and a half months? Can anyone confirm what their marital status is with a source? Thanks. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 11:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reference 17 (northants echo) which is dated 08 November 2006 refers to Melinda Gebbie as his fiancee, this suggests to me that they are not married. Though they are now co-habiting, which is interesting after i read an interview some years back extolling the joys of both having their own houses —Foxydavid 15:26, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>... Is what the article could nearly be! This is roughly a <b>Biography</b> not a review of works. Extensive discussion is on the pages about those works. I don't think it should be the end result of chat room type discussions about tiny details. One needs to take a step back and read the <b>style manuals and guides</b> before including reams of information. Try thinking about what first hooked you and others on him. People will probably be wanting to know who he is or a bit more about his work or life. Most people are not going to plough through this article other than those who are <b>already fans</b>. And there is no end of newsgroups. I have nearly everthing he has done (confessed completist) but trying to be objective to make this a feature article. This helped me on another article i wrote, anyway. Great there are so many interested editors <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred.e_41e8.html" title="User:Fred.e">Fred.e</a> 22:35, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't believe for one second that Alan Moore is a polygamist. I guess the basis is that he and his ex-wife had a female lover, but that's not the same thing as polygamy.</p>
<p>One of the things that I love about Alan Moore is that he's such a feminist.

<p>I removed this. It is not appropiate to include in a bio of a living person. 'V for...' picture is in twice. Suppose sommeone will argue they need to stay as well as having its own article. Suggest that this be renamed to <b>Alan Moore data dump</b>. Can we have an article that people would want read, esp. if they know nothing about or little about him. Drop me a note if you want to form a editing co-op to improve this to a good article then feature. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred.e_41e8.html" title="User:Fred.e">Fred.e</a> 18:19, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All articles on remotely geeky subjects risk becoming data dumps. It's inherent in the wiki that there's no sense of selection, and many comics fans are information hoarders by nature. I haven't worked on this article for ages, and I'm dismayed that a helpful paragraph in the intro detailing his influences has been removed and replaced by meaningless hyperbole ("His works have helped to revolutionise the comic industry and are widely held to be some of the greatest comics ever written"). I believe the main reason Moore, and others like Morrison and Gaiman who followed him, were such a breath of fresh air in comics was that they were much more widely read than most comics writers and brought a wider variety of influences to their work. This is is a medium where Garth Ennis, influenced by John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies, is regarded as bringing something fresh to the mix. Ithink the bit about his influences should be restored (and refs found, which shouldn't be hard) and most of the material in the "Major works" sections should be hived off into their own articles. Then we can look at the article as it stands and see what's significant and what's not. With a bit of effort we could turn this into a really good article - but I guarantee you in a couple of months' time it'll be a data dump again. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 00:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've given the article a pretty throrough rewrite, removing redundancies and trimming the style a bit, and brought it down from 53K to 35K. I've also moved the adaptations list from here to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_published_material_by_Alan_Moore_1c32.html" title="List of published material by Alan Moore">List of published material by Alan Moore</a> article, as it seems a bit silly for the main article to contain a bibliography of adaptations but not of his own work. I'm going to be retrieving some of the material cut from the "major works" section from the history and incorporating it into those works' own articles. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 02:40, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
