<p>Hi Alan - not sure what the problem is with the maps, but you're the second person to mention it. Simon Lyall mentioned <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1583" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1583" rel="nofollow">this bug</a>, which would explain why I don't see the problem since it's a PC thing and I'm a mac user. But it's a Win XP bug and you're using 98.... I don't know - I'll take it to the Village Pump. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 8 July 2005 08:26 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you also get the problem with the ones I've done without the frame line, like <a href="../../../o/r/e/Orewa.html" title="Orewa">Orewa</a>? If not it might be simplest just to remove the frames. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 8 July 2005 08:37 (UTC)</i></small></font>

<dd>I don't think a scale's really necessary - it would clutter things up a bit, and people can always look up the main Geography of New zealand article if they want to know details like that.

<p>When you make an article into a disambig, could you please fix articles that link to it?

<p>Hi Alan - I've moved them back to the scientific names. There's three problems with the Maori names, one is that they give no indication whatsoever of alliance (unlike English names, which [usually] group species of a genus together: Pine = <i>Pinus</i>, etc) - this leaves the index pages <a href="../../../p/o/d/Category%7EPodocarpaceae_25e2.html" title="Category:Podocarpaceae">Category:Podocarpaceae</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Category%7EAraucariaceae_fc08.html" title="Category:Araucariaceae">Category:Araucariaceae</a> with no indication whatsoever of what is related to what (and if <i>all</i> the species were shifted to vernacular names, compounded by Mapuche names for the South American species in the same genera). Second, 80% of the species in these genera have no vernacular names at all in English, and are always going to be listed under their scientific names; then anyone looking for <i>Podocarpus totara</i> and failing to find it in the long list of <i>Podocarpus</i> species is going to be very baffled and think the page does not exist. Finally, outside of NZ, the Maori names are not well known; elsewhere, the species are overwhelmingly referred to by their scientific names - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 11:40, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan - I was just looking down some political party lists and I saw a name I recognised.

<p>Alan, Greetings. I'm interested in helping to clean up the environmentalism pages. I guess that means I'm offering to join "project environment." I'd like to work on merging the Ecology Movement page into the Environmental Movement page. Also, I'd like to move some material from the History of Ecology page onto the Environmental Movement page. Don't know how much time I can really spend on this, but I'll try to make some changes here and there. Best, -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_D._White_d511.html" title="User:Scott D.

<p>Good day Alan, I see I was too quick with my keyboard and have, in error, assumed you were unaware of the Deep Ecology movement, I agree that the envionmental movement and ecolgy movement are different names for the same thing. I have done a little editing to Envionmental Movement but had I known that there was a seperate article on the Envionmental Movement in The United States I would have spent my time there instead. I will focus there unless there is plan to merge or other major changes? Best regards. <a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKAM_fc6e.html" title="User:KAM">KAM</a> 13:57, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for supporting me on the eccentric category. I would really appreciate your comment or vote at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#Category:Jewish_American_actors" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion#Category:Jewish_American_actors</a>. There is a real problem with this category and similar ones as mixing ethnicity-nationality-profession in categories is in my opinion extremely bad for the category structure. The main reason for this is many people are being added to these xxx American categories for having one grandparent of that ethnicity, therefore they can be in four xxx American categories. If we allow the ethnicity-nationality-profession mix in categories, for example, for someone who has grandparents of four different ethnicities and two professions i.e. actor and director, they could end up in four xxx American actor categories and four xxx American director categories which in my opinion would make Wikipedia look ridiculous. In my opinion this category should be merged with <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_actors_3f14.html" title="Category:American actors">Category:American actors</a>.

<p>Hi! I have no way of knowing when someone is planning on expanding an article. Single sentences are usually "shot on sight" for lack of content. Might I suggest quickly adding at least two more sentences about your subject before another admin comes along and deletes it again? - Lucky 6.9 08:56, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No I do not think it was laying it on a bit thick. I was merely stating the reasons for the change. It is polite to give a reason for an edit I did not do it to prevent environmentalist from learning about environmental science. Environmentalists after all base the reasons for their principles on environmental science. I am trying to prevent redundancy in the category system. Can you imagine what <a href="../../../e/n/v/Category%7EEnvironment_8abd.html" title="Category:Environment">Category:Environment</a> would look like if every single article in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_environment_topics.html" title="List of environment topics">List of environment topics</a> was in it? It would be a huge category list. Having articles placed in categories that are narrowly defined plevents the clutter and redundancy. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure.html" title="Standard conditions for temperature and pressure">Standard conditions for temperature and pressure</a> article I feel has too many categories. It should perhaps have <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_11a2.html" title="Category:Science">Category:Science</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEngineering_a9b4.html" title="Category:Engineering">Category:Engineering</a> whch would make some of the sub-disciplines redundant. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 09:29, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your comment. Alan, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPollutants_427b.html" title="Category:Pollutants">Category:Pollutants</a> only has about a dozen articles. Seven of them (namely Nitrogen Oxide, Nitrogen Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Peroxyacyl Nitrates (PANs), Ozone, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and SO<sub>2</sub>) are air pollutants. If we transferred all of them to the "more specific" <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAir_pollution_3e47.html" title="Category:Air pollution">Category:Air pollution</a>, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPollutants_427b.html" title="Category:Pollutants">Category:Pollutants</a> would be sadly depleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But that isn't my main point. My main point is that readers coming to Wikipedia to search for information about a pollutant will probably look for the specific pollutant's name (like Nitrogen dioxide) ... or they might look for "pollutants" ... or they might look for "air pollutants" ... or they might look for "smog" or "haze" or "greenhouse gas" ... or for many other keywords. I don't think we should limit them to the point that if they don't happen to search for the "more specific" keywords of "air pollutants", they will leave empty-handed. Quite the contrary, we should try to think of <b>all</b> the possible relevant category keywords they might use and make sure that we list in those categories. In other words, make it easier for them to find what they are looking for ... not harder.<a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbeychok_616b.html" title="User:Mbeychok">mbeychok</a> 23:27, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You make a valid point. Most of the aticle in the category are air pollutants.

<p>Hi again! I ran into an edit of yours at this category, and I'm not sure why there's a category hierarchy here, as I've never seen one in a category before. Is there a policy or other reasoning behind this? Regards, <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 21:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In hindsight I guess it is simply a repeat of the category heirarchy system but it does serve as a good navigation aid for those not familiar with the topics. There is no policy on it as far as I know. It would be difficult to implement on some of the articles that have multiple categories. I might redo the edit. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 21:07, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, cheers. I guess a manual hierarchy would be overkill given that automatically generating multiple hierarchy paths is what the category system is designed to do. Plus I wouldn't relish trying to add this to all x-thousand categories! <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 21:11, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah I did realise it would be a big ask (and task!). I was really only going to use it on a number of selected environmental topics since some editors are confuced about the approp category for articles. The table I created here at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Environment_9532.html#Categories" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment">Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment#Categories</a> is hopefully an aid as to where articles should be placed. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 00:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, again. Could you explain why you removed environmental timelines from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_timelines.html" title="List of timelines">List of timelines</a>? If the science section isn't appropriate, could you find a place on that list that fits? Thanks. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 04:21, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of the three timelines that where listed two were about <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_issues.html" title="Environmental issues">environmental issues</a> and the other was about <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrology.html" title="Metrology">metrology</a>. Meterology is a science and a small part of it is <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_science.html" title="Environmental science">environmental science</a> but this does not make it an environmental science. The two environmental timelines, on the whole, documented <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropogenic.html" title="Anthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> <b>effects</b> on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_environment.html" title="Natural environment">natural environment</a>. Environmental science generally studies <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropogenic.html" title="Anthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> effects as a science but very few of the entries on the timelines were about the science itself. The timelines had political and social dates as well as some of the actual science. See also <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_April_25_d9cd.html#Category:Environmental_science_timelines" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 April 25">Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_25#Category:Environmental_science_timelines</a>. Environmental science and environmental issues are difficult to categorise since they cross so many different fields of knowledge. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 04:38, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Great, so you have no general objection to including the articles on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_timelines.html" title="List of timelines">List of timelines</a>, just to their specific placement on the page? Would a more appropriate heading satsify you? If so, what would you recommend? —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 04:44, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no objections to having them on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_timelines.html" title="List of timelines">List of timelines</a>. I guess I was a little hasty in deleting them outright rather than reassigning them to the right section. I guess a seperate <i>Environmental issues</i> heading could be created for the <b>environmental</b> timelines. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Liefting_5801.html" title="User:Alan Liefting">Alan Liefting</a> 05:56, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>It seems I have misunderstood what the category consists of. My apologies. Give me a day or so &amp; I will reverse the inappropriate entries. In the meantime could you please give me the definition of what should be in this category.

<dd>I have removed "Wood" from all NZ trees, except a very small number of trees notable for their timber (Kauri, Rimu, etc). More than that I cannot do. I'm still not 100% sure of where you draw the line... but thanks for pointing this out <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamBould_7835.html" title="User:GrahamBould">GrahamBould</a> 12:25, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Alan, you might like to add Template:User flag NZ to your userpage, instead of the raw html. That way you'll be added to our category! Thanks, Lewis --<a href="../../../l/h/o/User%7ELholden_c4bd.html" title="User:Lholden">Lholden</a> 03:33, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
