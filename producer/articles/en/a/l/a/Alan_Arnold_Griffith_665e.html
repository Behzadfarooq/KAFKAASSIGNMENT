	    <p><b>Alan Arnold Griffith</b> (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">13 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a> – <a href="../../../o/c/t/Oct_13.html" title="Oct 13">13 Oct</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>) was an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a> engineer, who, among many other contributions, is best known for his work on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress_%28physics%29.html" title="Stress (physics)">stress</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fracture.html" title="Fracture">fracture</a> in metals that is now known as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_fatigue.html" title="Metal fatigue">metal fatigue</a>, as well as being one of the first to develop a strong theoretical basis for the <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a>.</p>
<p>Griffith took a first in mechanical engineering, followed by a Master’s Degree and a Doctorate from <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_University_a3c6.html" title="Liverpool University">Liverpool University</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> he was accepted by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Aircraft_Factory_303c.html" title="Royal Aircraft Factory">Royal Aircraft Factory</a> as a trainee, before joining the Physics and Instrument Department the following year in what was now been renamed as the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Aircraft_Establishment_edec.html" title="Royal Aircraft Establishment">Royal Aircraft Establishment</a> (RAE).</p>
<p>Some of Griffith's earlier works remain in widespread use today. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> he and <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._I._Taylor_7a8b.html" title="G. I. Taylor">G. I. Taylor</a> suggested the use of soap films as a way of studying stress problems. Using this method a soap bubble is stretched out between several strings representing the edges of the object under study, and the coloration of the film shows the patterns of stress. This method, and similar ones, were used well into the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> when computer power became generally available that could do the same experiment numerically.</p>
<p>Griffith is more famous for a theoretical study on the nature of stress and failure in metals. At the time it was generally taken that the strength of a material was E/10, where E was the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young%27s_modulus.html" title="Young's modulus">Young's modulus</a> for that material. However it was well known that those materials would often fail at 1000 times less than this predicted value. Griffith discovered that there were many microscopic cracks in every material, and hypothesized that these cracks lowered the overall strength of the material. This was because any void in a solid concentrates stress, a fact already well known to machinists at the time. This concentration would allow the stress to reach E/10 at the head of the crack long before it would seem to for the material as a whole.</p>
<p>From this work Griffith formulated his own theory of brittle fracture, using elastic <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_principles_in_structural_mechanics.html" title="Energy principles in structural mechanics">strain energy</a> concepts. His theory described the behavior of crack propagation of an elliptical nature by considering the energy involved. The equation basically states that when a crack is able to propagate enough to fracture a material, that the gain in the surface energy is equal to the loss of strain energy, and is considered to be the primary equation to describe brittle fracture. Because the strain energy released is directly proportional to the square of the crack length, it is only when the crack is relatively short that its energy requirement for propagation exceeds the strain energy available to it. Beyond the critical Griffith crack length, the crack becomes dangerous.</p>
<p>The work, published in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, resulted in sweeping changes in many industries. Suddenly the "hardening" of materials due to processes such as cold-rolling were no longer mysterious. Aircraft designers immediately understood why their designs had failed even though they were built much stronger than was thought necessary at the time, and soon turned to polishing their metals in order to remove cracks. The result was a series of particularly beautiful designs in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, such as the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_247.html" title="Boeing 247">Boeing 247</a>. This work was later generalized by <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._R._Irwin_9074.html" title="G. R. Irwin">G. R. Irwin</a>, in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, applying it to almost all materials, not just rigid ones.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> he published a seminal paper, <i>An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design</i>. He demonstrated that the woeful performance of existing turbines was due to a flaw in their design which meant the blades were "flying stalled", and proposed a modern <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfoil.html" title="Airfoil">airfoil</a> shape for the blades that would dramatically improve their performance. The paper went on to describe an engine using an <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axial_compressor.html" title="Axial compressor">axial compressor</a> and two-stage turbine, the first stage driving the compressor, the second a power-take-off shaft that would be used to power a propeller. This early design was a forerunner of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turboprop.html" title="Turboprop">turboprop</a> engine. As a result of the paper, the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautical_Research_Committee_694f.html" title="Aeronautical Research Committee">Aeronautical Research Committee</a> supported a small-scale experiment with a single-stage axial compressor and single-stage axial turbine. Work was completed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> with a working testbed design, but for some reason at that point work stopped.</p>
<p>At about this time <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Whittle_b725.html" title="Frank Whittle">Frank Whittle</a> wrote his thesis on turbine engines, using a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centrifugal_compressor.html" title="Centrifugal compressor">centrifugal compressor</a> and single-stage turbine, the leftover power in the exhaust being used to power the aircraft directly. Whittle sent his paper to the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Ministry_f2ea.html" title="Air Ministry">Air Ministry</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, who passed it on to Griffith for comment. After pointing out an error in Whittle's calculations, he stated that the large frontal size of the compressor would make it impractical for aircraft use, and that the exhaust itself would provide little thrust. The Air Ministry replied to Whittle saying they were not interested in the design. Whittle was crestfallen, but was convinced by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Johnson_b656.html" title="Johnny Johnson">Johnny Johnson</a> to pursue the idea anyway. Luckily for all involved, Whittle patented his design in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a> and was able to start Power Jets in 1935 to develop it.</p>
<p>Griffith went on to became the principal scientific officer in charge of the new Air Ministry Laboratory in South Kensington. There he invented the <i>contraflow</i> gas turbine, which used two sets of compressor disks rotating in opposite directions, one "inside" the other. This is as opposed to the more normal design in which the compressors blow the air against a <i>stator</i>, essentially a non-moving compressor disk. The effect on compression efficiency was noticeable, but so was the effect on complexity of the engine. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> he returned to the RAE to take charge of engine research, but it was not until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, when he became head of the Engine Department, that work on developing an axial-flow engine actually started. Joined by Hayne Constant, they started work on Griffith's original non-contraflow design, working with steam turbine manufacturer <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan-Vickers_e2a9.html" title="Metropolitan-Vickers">Metropolitan-Vickers</a> (Metrovick).</p>
<p>After a short period Whittle's work at Power Jets started to make major progress and Griffith was forced to re-evaluate his stance on using the jet directly for propulsion. A quick redesign in early <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> resulted in the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrovick_F.2_6635.html" title="Metrovick F.2">Metrovick F.2</a>, which ran for the first time later that year. The F.2 was ready for flight tests in 1943 with a thrust of 2,150 lbf, and flew as replacement engines on a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloster_Meteor_007f.html" title="Gloster Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>, the F.2/40 in November. The smaller engine resulted in a design that looked considerably more like the <a href="../../../m/e/_/Me_262.html" title="Me 262">Me 262</a>, and had improved performance. Nevertheless the engine was considered too complex, and not put into production.</p>
<p>Griffith's original rejection of Whittle's concepts has long been commented on. It certainly set back development of the jet engine in England by several years. His motivations have long been the topic of curiosity, with many people suggesting that his endless quest for perfectionism was the main reason he didn't like Whittle's "ugly" little engine, or perhaps the belief that "his" design was innately superior.</p>
<p>Griffith joined <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Limited_27ee.html" title="Rolls-Royce Limited">Rolls-Royce</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, working there until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. He designed the AJ.65 axial <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbojet.html" title="Turbojet">turbojet</a> which led to the development of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Avon_fc6a.html" title="Rolls-Royce Avon">Avon engine</a>, the company's first production axial turbojet. Griffith carried out pioneering research into <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_take-off_and_landing.html" title="Vertical take-off and landing">vertical take-off and landing</a> (VTOL) technology, culminating in the development of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Thrust_Measuring_Rig_ab6c.html" title="Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig">Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig</a>.</p>
