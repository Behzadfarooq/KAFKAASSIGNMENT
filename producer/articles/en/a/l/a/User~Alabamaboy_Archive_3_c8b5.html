<h2><span class="mw-headline">Society for Scientific Exploration</span></h2>
<p>On January 20, 2006 Alabamaboy deleted an article titled "Society for Scientific Exploration" with the comment "copyright violation of www.skepticalinvestigations.org/openorgs and other places". I contributed that deleted article. I chose to use the "Message from our Founding President" (at the official homepage of the Society for Scientific Exploration <a href="http://www.scientificExploration.org" class="external free" title="http://www.scientificExploration.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientificExploration.org</a> ) as an authoritative source for the history and purpose of this Society. Other web sites, including the one cited in Alabamaboy's deletion comment, have also used that "message from the founding president" as a basis for a brief description of the Society. I also added a list of names from the Founding Committee ( found at <a href="http://www.scientificExploration.org/council.php" class="external free" title="http://www.scientificExploration.org/council.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientificExploration.org/council.php</a> ). I believe that the article should be restored, perhaps with citations to indicate the source. My goal was to present a balanced description of this Society and rely on descriptions and quotations from the founders, especially the primary founder. I will appreciate your consideration of this matter and suggestions that you might have. - (ChipChat) Marty Cawthon, mrc@chipchat.com (Information Officer, Society for Scientific Exploration).</p>

<p>I'm sorry your so exasperated with the procedure that you feel you must withdraw from it, though I certainly understand why you would. However I think that the comment is inappropriate, lynching was a brutal crime against humanity that killed thousands of people and I wish you wouldn't envoke its evil specter at people who would do everything in there power to stop a lynching if they ever came across it. Justforasecond is being far to obsessive but its not fair to call him or the Arbcom racist when he became obsessive after Deeceevoice directed comments like- <i>Let's have a lynch party! Martha, you bring the picnic basket, Tommy 'll get the kerosene, and Dickie 'll bring the camera,"</i> at him. If Jfs and the Arbcom are racist for that then by the same criteria Deeceevoice would be as well- and we both know that she most definetly is not. May you and yours have a blessed Christmas day. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 05:42, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Left my response on your talk page. In short, I politely disagree and think the use of the word "lynch" is totally appropriate in this case. I will state, though, that I don't think the Arbcom are racist but are merely continuing what other racists started.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Semi Protection&#160;?</span></h2>
<p>I'm a newish admin and I wanted to ask you about the {{sprotect}} tag I've been seeing on a number of articles in recent days (Such as the article <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a>). I always thought protecting a page was supposed to be done only occasionally but this type of protecting now seems to be almost trendy. Has the threshhold for doing this limited protection been lowered? Is the consensus that we can semiprotect a page if it merely is a target for frequent vandalism? Thanks for passing on any info on this. Best,--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:55, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Opinion is very split over this, just see <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ESemi-protection_policy_bc61.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Semi-protection policy">here</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Should_semi-protection_of_George_W._Bush_be_permament.3F" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">here</a>! Some articles - GWB is a well known one, Nigger less so - just get constant IP vandalism all the time, so I'd prefer to see Semi-protection being near permanent for those pages. <i>Personally</i>, I put it on articles when I think they need it, and then leave it. There are admins who regularly check protected pages so I leave it to them to judge when to unprotect. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk</a>) 09:42, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any interest in collaborating on any health articles? What we are talking about is nothing short of eugenics. I'm out to save Americans with disabilities from the de facto eugenics policy of the US government, which is increasingly cutting budgets, withdrawing support and watching people die. I already got some policies changed in Alabama, but that is not even a flake of the iceberg. While Wikipedia is unquestionably NOT the place for activism, it is the place for knowledge. And if we had more knowledge out there about disability history: institutionalization of people with disabilities, court-ordered forced sterilization of black people and people with disabilities until the 1970s, Tuskeegee experiments, etc. <i>that knowledge could change the world</i>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickDupree_2b65.html" title="User:NickDupree">NickDupree</a> 16:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Did you know that in 1860, the <i>Clotilde</i>, the last known ship to arrive in the Americas with a cargo of slaves, was abandoned by its captain near Mobile and the slaves escaped and formed their own community on the banks of the Mobile River, which became known as Africatown? To this day the people from there retain aspects of West African phonology, like saying "gwuan" for "going" etc. This is an awesome bit of history, similar to the Gullahs in South Carolina. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickDupree_2b65.html" title="User:NickDupree">NickDupree</a> 17:05, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">re: Ed Poor RfA</span></h2>
<p>Well, we can't stop people from editing the RfA and thus from voting in it. However, there was a comparatively recent change to RfA procedure such that a nomination should not be added to the main page until it is accepted (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_nominate_0df3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate</a>). This is to avoid the stacks of oppose-until/neutral-until votes that always, rather pointlessly, turned up. It also gives a reluctant candidate a chance to decline before being thrown to the wolves. Then, and most importantly in this case, there is the fact that someone won't be made an admin unless they accept the nomination, so there is no point adding it to the RfA page until acceptance. Since Ed Poor is not editing at present, would be unlikely to call by to defend himself (as he will surely need to), and procedure recommends against it, it's probably best to avoid adding it to RfA unless/until he accepts. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 14:18, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw your project on Francis's page and did a little digging of my own. I hadn't noticed this before, but it appears that DCV's history with JFAS goes back much farther than we had thought. Check out this edit (JFAS's first): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Amenemhet_III.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26918407" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Amenemhet_III.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26918407" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It's a clear continuation of the argument he had just been having with her as an <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.112.11.220.html" title="User:71.112.11.220">anonymous editor</a> (an edit war over <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Allen_6fd3.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> also continued from one account to the next, in case this isn't conclusive enough). As it happens the argument was on whether to include the openly racist website <a href="http://www.white-history.com" class="external text" title="http://www.white-history.com" rel="nofollow">www.white-history.com</a> as a link from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians_0af2.html" title="Controversy over race of Ancient Egyptians">Controversy over race of Ancient Egyptians</a>. Disappointingly, JFAS was in favor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=26821438&amp;oldid=26765900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=26821438&amp;oldid=26765900" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=26840992&amp;oldid=26828671" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=26840992&amp;oldid=26828671" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, to the point where it threatened to become an edit war <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=26917271&amp;oldid=26904870" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=26917271&amp;oldid=26904870" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Anyway, I'm not sure how helpful or not helpful this is--it does seem to me time for DCV to stand or fall on her own merits.

<dd>I'm not sure if you saw JFAS's comment on Rob's RFA (El_C added a link to it higher up on the same page).

The article that is being proposed for deletion is a very common type of article in the socio-cultural field, and the article is very well-referenced at that.

<p><i>Per our discussion on the admin discussion board, you said, "Note that deleting the edits removes the IP edit history (meaning we can't find the underlying IP from which a logged in editor made the edit). I don't know if the IPs are restored when the edits are undeleted; perhaps a developer can answer that. (As an aside: it would be really nice if CheckUser searched deleted edits, too.)"</i></p>
<p><i>Since I'm still a new admin, I was wondering if I did the right thing in deleting the page? The user was frantic about removing his personal info (actually, his parent's address) before people starting sending threaten stuff and the only other way I knew to remove the info was to bring a developer into the game (which seemed unlikely). Just for future reference, what's the best way to handle stuff like this?

<dd>Yeah, it's not a big deal. Deleting the inappropriate content is more important than preserving the IP address history.

<p>I notice you are interested in preventing bias at wiki.That is why I have come to ask for your help.I was wondering how you feel about anti-Christian bias.I originally came to wiki by contributing to a list of Christian Entertainers.It has been deleted.But the list of atheists remains.The list of born again Christians is now controlled by LULU of the lotus eaters.LULU erases conversations, has his or her own evidence/vanity page and refuses to allow new additions, that don't meet LULU's personal standards.Now we have people taking Richard Kiel's name from the Christian actors page.When evidence is presented proving he identifies as a Christian another person removes the link from RK'S page saying the category is idiotic.Well if wiki has the category why can't Kiel's name be added to it? It doesn't make any sense that if a category exist you can't add names. Isn't this prejudice&#160;? As a Christian I have no interest in twiddling with or removing the list of atheists, so I don't understand this.Can you help&#160;? Could the Christian link on RK'S page be protected? I offered proof when I reverted it that he identifies as a Christian.Thanks --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalifornia_12_fc17.html" title="User:California 12">California 12</a> 23:44, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am interested in this. Personally, I don't understand why a list of christian entertainers would be deleted b/c this is probably a valid list, provided the entertainer makes their Christianity a public part of who they are (like Mel Gibson).

<p>Quick update: Some wikipedians have brought to my attention the possibility that this list would be better as a category, and I'm looking into this.Apparently a Christian actors category exists, but there is no place for entertainers other than actors and there are far fewer names than on the original list.What a shame the names were not merged before it was removed.It will take a lot of work to rebuild and given what was going on with the RK link may be an uphill battle even when evidence is presented.The people that were removing the link from Richard Kiel's page seem to have backed off (I hope).I am going to try to reach a peaceful compromise (truce&#160;?)on the born again Christian page with LULU and company later tonight.However there is so much anger on that page, it may require outside help.I was at wits end last night when I asked for help and I thank you for your interest.I will provide an update as soon as I see how things go.It still just astounds me that they (whoever they are) would not see the hypocrisy in keeping the atheists list and deleting the Christian entertainers.If this category thing works out for the Christian list, then I think that the atheists list should be changed to a category as well.It would appear to be terribly biased otherwise. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalifornia_12_fc17.html" title="User:California 12">California 12</a> 13:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well user BBlackmoor has reverted Richard Kiel again.I don't understand.The category exist.Proof has been offered from RK's own website that he belongs in the Christian Actors category, yet this gentleman is reverting because he dislikes the category.Isn't that a violation of something?

<p>In recent weeks I have been consumed with issues surrounding <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">User:Deeceevoice</a>, specifically her <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Deeceevoice_158a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Deeceevoice">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Deeceevoice</a> and her <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Deeceevoice_Workshop_6852.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deeceevoice/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Deeceevoice/Workshop</a>. From the start I saw this as an example of the continual problem with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a> and racism here at Wikipedia. That said, I have now realized that while racism and systemic bias exist here (and is probably the root issue with why one editor is pushing the case against Deeceevoice), Deeceevoice's actions can no longer be tolerated at Wikipedia. She continually ignores Wikipedia guidelines and attacks anyone who dares to not agree with her. DCV's extreme comments in recent days are what made me realize that I can no longer support her or her actions.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User:Justforasecond</a> has also behaved very poorly throughout this entire affair (if not to DCv's extreme degree). In recent days JFAS has placed comments on DCV's talk page merely to stir up trouble. As such, I am proposing that both DCV and JFAS be placed on personal attack parole for a year at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Deeceevoice/Workshop#Deeceevoice_and_Justforasecond_to_be_placed_on_Personal_attack_parole" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Deeceevoice/Workshop#Deeceevoice_and_Justforasecond_to_be_placed_on_Personal_attack_parole" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Perhaps this is a compromise that a majority of the parties involved can agree to.</p>
<p>However, what concerns me most is a statement I made during the course of this debate. While I have gone out of my way not to personally insult anyone, I did refer to the actions against DCV as a lynching. The use of this word was wrong, painted everyone opposed to DCV's actions with a broad and incorrect paintbrush, and needlessly stirred up trouble. I hope everyone involved in this case and everyone at Wikipedia will accept my apology. While I will continue to try and help editors here who appear to be victims of systemic bias and racism, DCV is no such victim and has created her own problems. I apologize for not living up to my own standards of behavior in using the word lynching and will strive to do better in the future. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 20:56, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">moving on</span></h2>
<p>I'm as tired of this as you are. It seems like you don't support DCV anymore, so I don't see any reason for this to continue. Whatever has been said along the way has all come from the DCV dispute. One of the original reasons I asked Matt about filing the RfC is DCV's penchant for bringing other Af-Am editors into disputes that they would otherwise not be involved in. As far as I know you are a fine editor on other articles.</p>
<p>I'll reissue the offer I presented some time ago. If there is a statement about you that you want me to withdraw point it out and I'll pull it. I'd appreciate it if you pulled your request that I be placed on probation, but that is not a pre-requisite.</p>
<p>I would also appreciate if you withdrew anything about racism being a motive for editors working through the dispute resolution process. DCV has been ruder than just about any long-term editor and engages regularly in original research, POV-pushing, placing of copyrighted images, and now disruption. Most of this has not been covered in the RfAr. Gathering evidence is tedious and I could not see whether enough was there already or whether more needed to be summarized. As far as I can tell, these are not independant violations -- they are for the most part tools to furthering an agenda. I am fairly certain that a good number of editors know who DCV is in real life but did not come forward to state that her additions are unquestionably original research. Stopping her behavior, which runs counter to the letter and spirit of nearly every wikipedia policy, has been my only motivation. Unfortunately, even with the volumes of evidence against her, the arbitration committee seems to think that she should be given extra leeway in future personal attacks. However, withdrawing the phrases about racist motivations is also not a pre-requisite for pulling any statement about you.</p>
<p>I would also appreciate if you de-endorsed the investigation into my history. I do not know if you have read about it in any detail yet, but I can assure you my motivations were not racist. I will gladly discuss it with you if need be, though to avoid any later misinterpreation it will need to be through email. Any or all of striking through your signature, making a statement about it, or contacting Dvyost on on his talk page would all be appreciated. This also is not a pre-requisite for withdrawing my comments.</p>
<p>Usually an apology is issued not to the people on the sidelines but to the person who is wronged. It looked suspicious to me that you would contact folks that may not have even noticed your statements, but I had responded to it specifically and was not contacted. There are several statements on the healing wikipedia page that seem to try to blame me. I would appreciate and would accept an explanation for this and a retraction of the wording mentioning me or blaming any unnamed editors, but again, not a pre-requisite.</p>
<p>I will strike-through and leave a short note about how the comments you select were not helping things. It may go without saying that I will not move to close the RfAr. I assume you would not want it to end at this point anyway, and I don't know if I have the authority to end it. I apologize ahead of time if any of the actions I have requested above are offensive to you. That is not my intention.

<p>"00:25, 19 January 2006 Alabamaboy deleted "Crystal Chasm Artistry" (No meaningful content)" "no meaningful content"? Are you the site owner or something? Your.. what you're god or something right? I mean, you must have some kind of higher power or devine authority to tell me that my own words have no meaningful content. Just what exactly does that mean? Who are you to say what's meaningful you are not every person on this god forsaken earth are you? Have I missed something and suddenly you can speak for 6.5 billion people and know that none of them will ever want to look at that article? THE WORD "YUP" has a WikiPedia Article but Crystal Chasm Artistry cannot? That really makes sense. It's a non-profit company, what do we have to do to impress you? And how dare there even be such an excuse, out of kindness you could have at least made something up like "advertising" or "Unpublished Author", but "no meaningful content"??? I think it's really low life of all of you wiki people to just delete stuff that has some legitimacy. You at least could inform people that you think they're meaningless and allow them to rewrite an article that's more impressive. No matter, I'll just rewrite it and post it up until I spark something in your sadistic brain that says it has meaning.</p>

<dd>Actually, this was not about degrading you at all. The article was essentially an advertising link to a website. According to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>, the article could be speedily deleted b/c 1)Very short articles providing little or no context&#160;; 2) The article was essentially a hyperlink to a site. The article you created had no business being on Wikipedia. And, for the record, "no meaningful content" is a term used frequently to denote articles that lack meaningful, encyclopedic content.

<p>Well my friend, I had a little talk with Mr. Encyclopedia's best friend, Dictionary.com. And he has something else to say:<br /></p>
<p><b>en·cy·clo·pe·dic</b> Pronunciation Key (n-skl-pdk) adj.</p>
<pre>
   1. Of, relating to, or characteristic of an encyclopedia.
   2. Embracing many subjects; comprehensive 
“an ignorance almost as encyclopedic as his erudition”
 (William James).
</pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>en·cy·clo·pe·di·a</b> Audio pronunciation of "encyclopedia" ( P ) Pronunciation Key (n-skl-pd-) n.</p>
<pre>
 
A comprehensive&lt; reference work containing articles 
on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects 
of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically.
</pre>
<p>According to that, disagree if you want, an Encyclopedia is a device which covers a wide range of things regardless of popularity but moreso based on their mere existance in nature and what defines/explains them. If google is a good way to check the validity of an article then why don't you guys just shut down and let us use google? I don't go to an encyclopedia to look at stuff I already know about, I generaly use it just to find something new. Then again <i>I</i> am a different person than you. The point in case, tell me what you will about my articles but realise that you and many other people here are constantly misusing the word "encyclopedic".</p>

<dd>Appreciate the definition. That said, I am following the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia. Since you are a new user, I suggest you acquaint yourself with how Wikipedia works (the links to this are at the top of your talk page).

<p>Any chance I might persuade you to reconsider your opposition? Since I was nominated, I'd like it to pass. I will continue to strive to bring a number of controversial topics toward NPOV (whether or not promoted to adminship), and the chance of encountering another spurious RfC against me at some point is almost guaranteed. I've found, over time, that most of those threatening to write one get themselves blocked from WP (either long-term or indefinitely, prior to writing it: I can list about ten examples, literally, of editors who threatened an RfC against me, and have been blocked... not by me, obviously, and for reasons little related to anything I ever did).</p>
<p>The chance that I will continue to win "enemies" who wish to push particular POVs on artilce is almost a certainty, since people who want articles to promote their viewpoint are inherently unhappy with NPOV. If you look at my edit history, talk comments, etc. I am certain that you will find that I have maintained better composure and professionalism in the face of insults and extremist argumentation than have or would 95% or existing admins. Frankly, it's a lot easier to avoid conflict by just avoiding articles that might encounter conflict (which are perfectly important to have as well); but it happens that I am interested in a lot of political and "hot button" topics, and want to bring those subjects to NPOV.</p>
<p>I really encourage you to look at my answer to one of the questions about how NPOV editors in conflict-prone topics seem to be <i>de facto</i> prevented from adminship, even though such are very much needed. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your vote on the RFR poll</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Alabamaboy, you voted oppose on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_rollback_privileges_Poll_5584.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for rollback privileges/Poll">requests for rollback privileges consensus poll</a>, suggesting that people who would like rollback should just become admins instead - that being an admin is "no big deal". While I think that in an "ideal" Wikipedia, this would indeed be the case, I believe that over time standards for becoming an administrator have clearly risen. This is apparent by looking at the RFA system throughout Wikipedia's existence - intially, all one had to do to become an admin was just ask nicely, now we have a complicated procedure. A recent proposal on the RFA talk page for requiring at least 30 minimum support votes and a significant number of existing contributions was given some serious consideration. There is frequent talk of "bad admins slipping through the RFA net", and while you may not agree with that philosophy of adminship it is undeniable that the standards have risen.</p>
<p>Because of this, candidates who pass are already very experienced with Wikipedia. While this in itself is no bad thing, it means that for the month or so before they become admins they are not being given the tools an admin has which would help them to improve Wikipedia, by removing vandalism and performing administrative tasks such as moving pages. The qualities which make a good administrator are not determined by length of stay on Wikipedia or number of friends you have, but by personality and character. Time at Wikipedia only gives familiarity with the way things are done here. However, being at Wikipedia for an extra month doesn't grant any special insight into the ability to determine which edits are vandalism and which are not. This is why I believe that we should hand out rollback to contributors who are clearly here to improve Wikipedia but won't pass the RFA procedure because of their percieved lack of familiarity with policy by some Wikipedians. I think that adminship should be no big deal, like you, however I see just two ways to make sure Wikipedians can quickly and efficiently remove vandalism - either by all those who believe adminship should be no big deal involving themselves much more in RFA, or by supporting this proposal and giving out rollback to good contributors who have not yet been here long enough to become admins. We have to remember that our ultimate aim here is to produce an encyclopedia, and we should balance the idealism of "adminship should be no big deal" with the pragmatism of granting rollback to our best non-admin contributors. I would be very grateful if you would reconsider your viewpoint on this issue.

<p>I think you are taking an extremely closed view of what makes something NPOV. It is not POV to state (preferably with references) what is generally agreed to by critics, historians, scientists, and so on. I suggest you read <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html#Undue_weight" title="NPOV">NPOV#Undue_weight</a>, which states "NPOV says that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints, in proportion to the prominence of each." Since the vast majority of critical critics place Shakespeare as one of the greatest writers ever, it is not POV to state this. Read the rest of that section.

<p>I honestly appreciate your enthusiastic protection of copyrights. I've been a Small Press Editor since the mid 1970's. Very small, mostly poetry, though sometimes Art and Fiction as well. As you most certainly know (judging by your areas of expertise), there's little or no money for support of these kinds of efforts, so copyright protection becomes a matter of survival for the Small Press. However, in this case, there is no violation of copyright because I own the site from which I lifted the copy verbatim. I would be happy to rewrite the information. I just have never been a fan of re-inventing the wheel. Probably because I'm getting old and tired and the effort of re-creating something I've already done seems herculean at times. But, whatever, keep up the fight for literature and the neglected poets everywhere.</p>
