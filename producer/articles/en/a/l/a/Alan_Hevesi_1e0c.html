<p>He first unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Nomination for City Comptroller in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>; he was defeated by Brooklyn District Attorney and former Congresswoman <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Holtzman_214e.html" title="Elizabeth Holtzman">Elizabeth Holtzman</a>. In 1993, he came back to challenge Holtzman in the primary, following ethics accusations against Holtzman. Holtzman had taken a questionable loan from Fleet Bank, which Hevesi assailed her on during an <a href="../../../n/y/1/NY1_5932.html" title="NY1">NY1</a> debate. Hevesi was also supported by <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraldine_Ferraro_c954.html" title="Geraldine Ferraro">Geraldine Ferraro</a>, a former Congresswoman and Vice Presidential running mate of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mondale_6729.html" title="Walter Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>. Ferraro, upset over Holtzman's 1992 Senate race attack, even went as far to encourage his candidacy to oppose Holtzman. (Ironically, Hevesi and Ferraro would later become estranged.) The politically powerful health care union Local 1199, led by Jennifer Cunningham, gave Hevesi its endorsement. Hevesi claimed to be a fiscal expert, although he had no educational background in finance or economics. Thanks for the Fleet Bank scandal, Ferraro's endorsement, and the backing of Local 1199, Hevesi defeated Holtzman to secure the Democratic nomination. Hevesi then defeated former Congressman <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Badillo_3494.html" title="Herman Badillo">Herman Badillo</a>, the Republican candidate in the general election.</p>

<p>Hevesi's budget and economic projections were at times wrong, predicting doom and gloom when the city's economy had actually rebounded. Where he saw deficits, surpluses emerged. During his tenure as city comptroller, his analysis of the city's economy and budget would often be off the mark, particularly when he was actively opposed to then Mayor <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_W._Giuliani_b16b.html" title="Rudolph W. Giuliani">Rudolph W. Giuliani</a>. Predicting dire economic news was part of his staple and he often sounded the fiscal alarm bells only to be proven wrong. (<i>A Hevesi Moment. Fiscal Woes Approaching</i>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Newsday_9115.html" title="New York Newsday">New York Newsday</a>, Murray, C. E. April 28, 1996). Hevesi attended a discussion sponsored by the Long Island City Business Development Corp. He told the group, "[w]e are in trouble financially, I am not talking twenty five years down the road ... a pattern that robs our ability to provide services past 1997. As C. E. Murray explained, He predicted that without drastic alterations to the fiscal game plan, the city's budget for fiscal 1998" is going to be a disaster, and we are going to have to fire people."</p>
<p>Beginning in 1995, Hevesi's audits started generating many headlines, with the effect of both embarrassing the Giuliani administration and promoting his own candidacy for the upcoming 1997 mayoral race. His audits would often directly attack the Giuliani administration. One of the most notable auditing incidents that created an uproar was when Hevesi's auditors were reportedly denied access to foster group homes by the Human Resources Administration (<i>Hevesi Stews After HRA bars food probers</i>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a>, Siegel, J. August 22, 1995), (<i>Hevesi Threatens To Sue City Hall in foster food</i>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Post_3183.html" title="New York Post">New York Post</a>, Seifman, D. August 22, 1995), (<i>Hevesi Says HRA Barred Spot Audit Of Foster Home</i> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, Firestone, D., August 22, 1995).</p>
<p>On an <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">October 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> Channel 4 NewsForum political discussion group, his then Republican opponent for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comptroller.html" title="Comptroller">comptroller</a>, Anna Marie McAvoy, discussed with program moderator Gabe Pressman how she wanted to make the comptroller's office apolitical. She also questioned Hevesi's auditing. She remarked that "before he came into office to do as many audits as were done under Harrison Goldin (a former New York City comptroller). In fact Harrison Goldin did over 200 audits a year. As Mr. Hevesi says, they've only done 122 and that was in the past year. I think the year before that, he had even less. And I think the first year, he had, I think he had 57 the first year and 70 the second year on top of which Mr. Hevesi promises. I think, should be done when he campaigned the last time, that there should be follow-up audits, and he hasn't done that either -certainly not to the extent it should be done." The discussion continues about an FBI sting operation, etc.</p>
<p>Hevesi responded to McAvoy's charge as follows:</p>
<p>"Number one we we have do. I never promised that we'd do more audits than Mr. Goldin because Mr. Goldin had 1,200 employees, we have 810. We're down from the 900 Ms. Holtzman (another former city comptroller), so Ms. McAvoy's statement about us having more employees is absolutely untrue. Number two, we, we've done any number of follow up audits. We have impro - the 57 audits that she talked about was not my first year, it was <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Holtzman_214e.html" title="Elizabeth Holtzman">Liz Holtzman</a>'s last year. We have more than doubled the number of audits we have provided. We have brought $229 million in savings, $50 million in cash already. And I'd really love to talk about a huge number of successes that we've had in the office."</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, Hevesi sought the Democratic nomination for <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_New_York_5ab3.html" title="Mayor of New York">Mayor of New York</a>, running on the platform of "Most Experienced, Best Qualified". He finished fourth, behind Public Advocate <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_J._Green_8250.html" title="Mark J. Green">Mark J. Green</a>, Bronx Borough President <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_Ferrer_6632.html" title="Fernando Ferrer">Fernando Ferrer</a>, and New York City Council Speaker <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Vallone_76a3.html" title="Peter Vallone">Peter Vallone</a>. Hevesi was the Liberal Party nominee for Mayor in the general election, but did not campaign in the race, rather he endorsed Green for mayor in the general election. Following his defeat in the mayor's race, Hevesi started his campaign for state comptroller, which he won, narrowly defeating Republican <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Faso_5283.html" title="John Faso">John Faso</a>.</p>
<p>As State Comptroller, Hevesi served as the state's chief fiscal officer and as head of the state Department of Audit and Control. In New York, the comptroller signs state checks, handles state bookkeeping, conducts audits of state and local finances, and issues economic forecasts. The comptroller also serves as the sole trustee of the state pension system, an important role in the investment community based on the value of New York State's investment portfolio.</p>
<p>Hevesi's son Andrew was elected as an assemblyman from Queens in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. His other son, Daniel, served as a state senator from Queens from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Hevesi signed a plea bargain with Albany County whereby Hevesi pled guilty to a defrauding the government, would resign effective immediately, and not take the office of the Comptroller starting on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> when his second term would begin.

Hevesi pleaded guilty to Superior Court Filing of defrauding the government, a Class E felony, and will pay a $5,000 fine. Hevesi admitted the wrongdoing when allegations surfaced in November, and has repaid the state more than $200,000."</p>
<p>Hevesi, who was recently re-elected as New York State comptroller, would have begun his second term of office on January 1, 2007.</p>

<p>Many political officeholders solicit campaign funds from large contributors or reward groups and individuals for political reasons. Hevesi was no different. The New York Post in an editorial questioned his use of financial advisers as campaign contributors (<i>Alan Hevesi's advisers</i>, November 11, 1996). As City Comptroller he got to choose the city bond underwriters. According to a New York Post editorial, Hevesi hired a female minority owned firm. Philadelphia based P.G. Corbin &amp; Co. Hevesi used discretionary funds in the amount of $1.58 million. Back in 1995, Hevesi's office suspended Corbin for failing to pay $5,900 in city corporate taxes.</p>
<p>Another Hevesi favored firm, San Francisco-based Grigsby Brandford &amp; Co, was involved in a bribery scandal. Hevesi had other dealings involving bond underwriters in 1995. New York City used Barnes, McGhee, Segue &amp; Harper as bond underwriters. A problem emerged, when it was disclosed that Joseph N. Barnes, a managing partner failed to file his federal income tax returns in 1987, 1988 and 1991. What made it more troubling was that it was a minority owned firm. Since 1991, the firm was co-counsel that provided legal advice and tax opinions on city debt. Hevesi seen as a champion of minority causes now found himself in a difficult position. He had no comment.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayside%2C_New_York_322a.html" title="Bayside, New York">Bayside, New York</a> activist Joyce Shepard of the <b>Citizens Action Committee for Change</b> tried to highlight the issue of abused women. She contacted Hevesi's office to investigate. Hevesi issued a critical report on the Giuliani administration. On April 17, 1997 she was at New York City Hall with both Giuliani and Hevesi side by side. They promised more space for victims of domestic abuse. Despite all the promises nothing happened. She went undercover to expose the shortcomings of the shelter system. She criticized both Hevesi and Giuliani. After she was quoted by the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Voice_bbe7.html" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a> Hevesi reportedly phoned her and told her: "Don't you ever call my office about anything again!". The comptroller's office didn't deny the call took place. But a spokesman stated the office is open to anyone who thinks something is going on we should know about (<i>Mission Unfullfilled</i>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Newsday_9115.html" title="New York Newsday">New York Newsday</a>, Janison, D. July 20, 1997).</p>
<p>As state comptroller Hevesi continued the practice of rewarding political contributors. According to the New York Sun (<i>Hevesi's Advice Stirs Questions On the Coast</i>, Gerstein, J., May 11, 2006). The opening paragraph stated, <i>The New York State comptroller, Alan Hevesi, encouraged California pension managers to invest in a private capital fund founded by a man whose wife has been a generous donor to his political campaigns</i>. The story originally appeared in the Los Angeles Times. Hevesi met with his California counterpart, comptroller Steve Westly and Elliot Broidy. Elliot Broidy of Markstone Capital Group. They met on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">May 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> in order to "pitch" (CalPers), the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Public_Employees_Retirement_System_ece9.html" title="California Public Employees Retirement System">California Public Employees Retirement System</a>, to invest in Markstone. Markstone was a fund that invested in Israeli companies. The Sun reported that in June 2003, Mr. Hevesi invested $200 million in Markstone. Mr. Broidy is a major Republican political contributor. Mr. Broidy did not directly contribute to Hevesi's political campaigns, but his wife did. His wife, Robin Rosenzweig, gave $80,000 since 2002. Before the May 2003 meeting she gave $30,000 and $50,000 afterwards. She also contributed to Andrew Hevesi's state assembly race.</p>
