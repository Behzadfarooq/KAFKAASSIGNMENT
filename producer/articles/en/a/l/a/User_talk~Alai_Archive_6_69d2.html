<p>Hi Alai, thank you for your message. I'm sorry about that. This is the first time I've ever created a stub and I didn't notice the guideline indicated it should be proposed before implementation.

<dd>Well yes, if that were a pint of Tennants 80, Greenmantle, or even of Smithwick's, I'd send it back (or in extreme instances, maybe over the barkeep). OTOH, as it's German, that's a Feature, not a Bug.

<dd>Oh, OK... I guess that's acceptable then. I'm not that knowledgable about German beers. They have a brand here in Rwanda called Mützig, which is presumably supposed to be based on something German, but I still don't let them give me too much head, it's just a waste! — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveRwanda_d22f.html" title="User:SteveRwanda">SteveRwanda</a> 16:44, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'll note the "Please do not modify it." clause in the AFD closure notice: for that reason I don't think removing (or striking) that comment would be appropriate. Also, please don't make one comment on a talk page, and <i>another</i> comment in the edit summary: that just gets too confusing.

<dd>That was your own comment in <i>your</i> AfD. I'm sure the other admins won't mind. That remark still disturbs me to this day because when I someday attempt to publish my sci-fi novel (now in its earliest stages), the publishing company may do a background check and find your remark there, and not consider publishing my novel after that point. After it gets published somehow, net-savvy fans will try to find early references to my work &amp; concept, and may dig up your remark. It'll be like digging up a criminal record or an otherwise embarrassing event in the past. I don't wish for this to happen, so removing the remark would make me feel much better. Again, it's your AfD. If you'd like to run this by my mentor, leave <a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">ESkog</a> a message. The removal will also raise my self-esteem. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShultz_IV_2c52.html" title="User:Shultz IV">Shultz IV</a> 20:40, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I happened to see {{<a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-crime-bio-stub_2535.html" title="Template:US-crime-bio-stub">US-crime-bio-stub</a>}} placed a short article (three sentences stub, maybe) with a large image aligned to the right hand side (a mugshot if I recall correctly). I noticed that previous version caused the second (wrapped) line of the stub text to start below the bottom-left of the icon, rather than below the beginning of the first line (which struck me as ugly, if not nonstandard). I suppose now that the image has been removed, the table/div layout no longer makes a difference. Sorry for using the word "verbose", in which context I meant it as "so long that it spills to two lines if there's an image next to it". — <small>Apr. 4, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[20:12] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<dd><i>Ah, I see... Wouldn't the solution be to ensure the stub template is in a separate "paragraph" from the preceding text/images/other markup? The trouble with the table version is that it introduces a lot of extra vertical space -- this really lept out at me when I used it as the second of a double-stub pair. It's also departing from (what we laughingly call) the "standard" coding of stub templates, so it'd have a certain "say what?" factor. It did seem to be rather lengthy, though, so I tried to hack it down a bit.</i> <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 12:33, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I disagree. I do not think that the stub template should be forced all the way to the bottom. I thought that (at least) one (key) purpose of the stub templates is for a new user who encounters an incredibly short article in their area of interest will be more readily aware of how easy they can "help Wikipedia by expanding it", instead of instead of saying "man, this article sucks" and closing the tab. If an infobox occupies the whole right of the screen, and the text occupies only half of the left, the stub template should be right below the text, not at the very bottom where one must scroll down to see it, and certainly not hidden below a navigational box template. — <small>Apr. 10, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[04:52] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></dd>

<p>It seemed to me that you were implying that a <tt>&lt;br clear=all&gt;</tt> should be applied to avoid the situation above, which I would disagree with. Apologies if I misinterpreted the "separate paragraph" part. Overall it's not a big deal, but since we obviously have a choice of which way to do it, I'd say putting the template at the end of the actual text would be best, even when that location is not necessarily the bottom of the page. — <small>Apr. 10, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[05:24] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<p>Hi Alai, I'm trying to get more involved in stubsorting, so I'm trying to create the template that was approved for South Asian history and I'm not sure I'm doing it right (I'm already using the creation guide).

<p>Sorry, I was interpreting the sudden wave of subcats sorted with a leading space as a sign that consensus had been reached somewhere on the subject. I'm sad to see I was wrong... FWIW, I don't care which of star or space is settled on, just so long as it's consistent, which is what I was doing (going through the subcats of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Category%7ERail_stubs_0507.html" title="Category:Rail stubs">Category:Rail stubs</a> and changing them all to leading space, as none of them had leading stars and most had no sortkey at all.)

<p>Well, they were not strictly speaking "your" actions, they were "our" actions, and I personally take a heck of a lot of the blame for allowing us taking such an awkward stumble <s>forward</s> sideways. I clearly failed at the time to make it clear just what a mess we would get ourselves into by using "lieutenancy areas", which no-one, absolutely no-one, would know unless they took the time to look the damn things up every time - and there is not even a good place to do that (plus they have no parent cats, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus....... you get the gist). Do not take it personally. I do value your very hard work, but if you look at my edit history today you will see that after trying to expose and block a sockpuppet all day, I obviously did not approach stub sorting in my best of humours. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 16:08, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry. I had totally forgotten who proposed what. Oh well, your dose of "insanity" was clearly only momentary and (hopefully) temporary. As for "incomprehensibly obscure", well, if you can study, memorise the boundaries of, and consistently apply the lieutenancy areas of Scotland to stub sorting, then you are a far, far better man than I. I know for a fact that I could not do it, and I am a total Scottish geography and local government geek. Stub sorting requires clarity, and above all, simplicity of application.</dd>

<dd>Have a think about this topic, because we are going to have to tackle this one soon: 1010 stubs and counting. (Glasgow, Argyll and Bute and Western Isles are fine - they would fit into the new scheme seemlessly. Inverness, with 13 stubs, would be part of a 60+ Highland geo stub.)</dd>

<p>Hi Alai, thanks for you comments on stub sorting proposals. I've counted up (manually) and I think there's at least 61 (count was on tuesday). Actually I could do with a bit of advice. I've been ordering these articles which now form a skeleton, of the current UK planning law under a category called <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_Kingdom_planning_law_78a0.html" title="Category:United Kingdom planning law">Category:United Kingdom planning law</a>. It's occured to me that the Category might be better off dealing simply with UK planning; because allthough the planning system is a statutory framework, there's quite a lot of other stuff that influences policy and it's implementation (government reports, planning theory etc.etc.) that would probably be better to include rather than a strict 'down the line' law or not-law categorisation. Would it be a real pain to change the Category to something like Category:United Kingdom planning and then re-request a {{<a href="../../../u/k/-/Template%7EUK-planning-stub_77be.html" title="Template:UK-planning-stub">UK-planning-stub</a>}}?

I have started up Edinburgh (pretty much as big as it is gonna get for now) and Highland (that is gonna be much bigger than current 71), but was about to start up templates - but NOT categories - for the others, when I suddenly started worrying: <i>what if we have to manually null edit all the bl...y things again just to get them into some future category properly?</i> So, basically, how do we do this in practice? --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 13:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You were gracious enough to comment on 1WW; as you may know there are now <i>seven</i> competing proposals. On April 6 I suggested that I be permitted to refactor the proposal page into a single, unified proposal. It's my belief that most of us are tending toward the same or a similar restriction on wheel warring. I think it's unwieldy, though, as it stands. A fair number of editors have commented on these distinct versions but (precisely because they <i>are</i> so similar) no single one has gained undisputed consensus. I suggest that a single, improved version may fare better on its way to policy.</p>
<p>Just as I proposed the refactor, an editor brought to our attention yet another competing proposal, which I merged into the others, using the same format. Still another proposal has since been added, bringing the total to 7. The two new proposals are encountering an indifferent reception but they, too, have some merit.</p>
<p>At the time I suggested refactor, I also put myself forward as the editor to write the initial draft, based on the plurality of support for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_wheel_warring_policy_5e61.html#John_Reid.27s_proposal_.284.29" title="Wikipedia:Proposed wheel warring policy">"my" version</a>. Since the two new proposals have been added, this plurality has held.</p>
<p>I don't for a moment feel that this gives me any special right to dictate terms; rather I hope to draft a proposal uniting the best features of existing proposals. Unlike any of the seven currently competing versions, this refactor will be open to editing immediately by any editor. I will ask editors to <i>refrain</i> from supporting or opposing the new draft for the time being; instead, to <i>edit</i> the proposal to reflect their specific concerns. I believe the true consensus policy will then emerge, in true wiki fashion. After all, we're not so far apart.</p>
<p>I come to your talk page today to ask for your <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EProposed_wheel_warring_policy_bfcf.html#Let.27s_refactor" title="Wikipedia talk:Proposed wheel warring policy">comment</a> on this refactor. Clearly this will be a major change to the proposal page and I don't feel comfortable being <b>quite that bold</b> without some expression of interest in the idea. Once the new draft is in place, I hope also for your participation to polish it into a true expression of our values.

<p>In response to your question on my (Rfc1394) user page about why I'm doing a template and having two articles use the template, is if you look at the text of either article, they have a category include of their actual area code in the master category on the subject of area codes. If I don't do it this way I can't get each page to be put on the category list by its number, it ends up with a rather ugly reference to both area codes. There is also the possibility that at some point some of these overlay area codes may become different.</p>
<p>It's basically for convenience so that the text of the articles can be the same (as both area codes cover the same place) but the articles themselves show up separately in the category list. I do this for all overlay area codes in order to make this functionality work and to simplify maintenance. <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson</a> 07:09, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm a bit puzzled what's going on with this template, and the two articles that include it. This should really just be one merged article, with redirects as appropriate, no? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There's one of these templates per overlay? I see what you mean about the listing, but given they're also listed on that basis at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_North_American_area_codes_1b66.html" title="List of North American area codes">List of North American area codes</a>, an actual category of distinct articles seems to me preferable. Even if the separate category listings are key, use of the template space to hold a whole article (albeit a small one) seems to me odd and unnecessary. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:37, 23 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No articles should be in Template space. Note that it is easy to use an article as a "template" by simply putting the article name in the same kind of brackets, but with an added colon on the front of the article's name. So I would suggest that Template:Area codes 215 &amp; 267 should be moved to <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_codes_215_%26_267.html" title="Area codes 215 &amp; 267">Area codes 215 &amp; 267</a>, and then it can be transcluded as if it were a template with <tt>{{:Area codes 215 &amp; 267}}</tt>. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:05, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is a great solution. I will use it, then after I have converted all the improper templates to user space, I'll include <i>{{db-author}}</i> to mark them for deletion. <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson</a> 21:34, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Alai</p>
<p>I just realized that the proposal on creating a stub for Chinese politicians is listed twice on <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a> (no.s 2.22 and 3.76 on the list) (a quote from Homer Simpson seems in order here)&#160;:) It appears some of us had moved on to 2.22 and Instantnood is working on the other one (including a proposal involving 6 templates or so). Do you have any bright ideas about how to crack this one? For what it's worth, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Category%7EChinese_people_stubs_a4ae.html" title="Category:Chinese people stubs">Cat:Chinese people stubs</a> apparently doesn't cover Hong Kong and Macau, but it does cover both Imperial China, PRC, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>My personal hunch is simply to create a single stub template, with no flag, and double stub with Taiwan if that's relvant (so the -politician cat. will correspond to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Category%7EChinese_people_5de8.html" title="Category:Chinese people">Cat:Chinese people</a> category.) Hong Kong and Macau still seem to operate in their own little worlds, apart from everything else. Either they too should be merged with the main category (double-stubbed when relevant) or we should keep them in their own categories.</p>
<p>I'm no big fan of splitting the PRC from Imperial China and the pre-1949 republic. So my favourite solution would be a generic category double stubbed with Taiwan when relevant (but if need be, excluding HK and Macau = 4 templates), but I'd like to hear you thoughts on the mattter.

<dd>It looks like we pretty much agree: a generic category based on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Category%7EChinese_people_stubs_a4ae.html" title="Category:Chinese people stubs">Cat:Chinese people stubs</a> (we can always look at HK and MO later). Since I'm probably going to be the one doing the actual re-stubbing, I don't really fancy creating extra work for myself. I don't think we should merge the two discussions, but the situation is a little odd. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 00:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're probably right, it can hardly be a surprise now. If the category grows so he can split out the subdivisions, well, that'd only be a sign of a healthy category.

<dd>And yes, you're absolutely right about the double stubbing. That's how my figure for Czech politicians went from 9 to 63 the other day. And the same thing with the Bulgarians. I've begun making a small list of countries without a national template (not counting -geo-stubs). StubSense and other tools are fine, but if the material has never been double stubbed in the first place, it won't help a thing. StubSense and CatScan combined should make it pretty easy to look for new potential country-level stubs (provided that the material has actually been *categorized*) <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 01:10, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Great idea. I'd be glad to help. If people can coorporate on a hundred other projects, why not one like this? Or we might simply make a list of countries and ask people to pick 1 and go through its categories and -bio stubs (but that might be a little optimistic, I know). That's what I do whenever I really wish to create a new politician template: I sweep the entire category tree of the country, as well as the -bio stub for untagged or mistagged stubs. A lot of stubs have never been tagged in the first place, and many more are only tagged with the bio tag. Most of the time I simply tag everything while I'm at it (I didn't do the Czechs the other day, but they really need fixing.) Before you ask; no, I never made any complete list of these countries. I only realized it might be an idea two days ago, so I've started adding this information to my politician-counting page. I think I'll start in South America. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 01:32, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
