	    <p><b>Alasdair MacColla</b> (circa <a href="../../../1/6/1/1610.html" title="1610">1610</a> to <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>) was a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a>-<a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> soldier. His full name in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_b039.html" title="Scottish Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> was <i>Alasdair MacColla Ciotach MacDomhnaill</i> (in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>: Alasdair the son of Colla the Left-handed, of the clan MacDonald). He is sometimes mistakenly referred to in English as "Collkitto", a nickname that properly belongs to his father. He fought in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_52ce.html" title="Wars of the Three Kingdoms">Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a>, most notably <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_in_the_Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_177a.html" title="Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms">in Scotland</a>. He died in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Knocknanauss_6ee4.html" title="Battle of Knocknanauss">battle of Knocknanauss</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>.</p>
<p>MacColla was born in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Isles_f2fa.html" title="Western Isles">Western Isles</a> of Scotland in the early seventeenth century into <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Donald_d933.html" title="Clan Donald">Clan Donald</a>. His early life encompassed both Gaelic Ireland and the Gaelic western <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Highlands_5738.html" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a> of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> - as the MacDonalds had a presence in both countries. Like his father, Colla, Alasdair made his name as a soldier, being particularly noted for his use of a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scots</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadsword.html" title="Broadsword">broadsword</a> called the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claymore.html" title="Claymore">claymore</a>. In his young days, he saw fighting against the Campbell clan, with whom the MacDonalds had a long running feud over territory and power. This enmity was deepened by religious factors. The Campbells were <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterians</a>, whereas the MacDonalds, among whom a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> mission had settled, were <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholics_3f82.html" title="Roman Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>.</p>

<p>However, MacColla really came to prominence with the onset of the conflict knowns as the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_52ce.html" title="Wars of the Three Kingdoms">Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a>. The MacDonald clan, which was spread over north-western Scotland and north-eastern <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, sided with the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers.html" title="Cavaliers">Royalists</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_Ireland_a37b.html" title="Confederate Ireland">Irish Confederates</a>. Their deadly enemies, the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Campbell_0da3.html" title="Clan Campbell">Clan Campbell</a>, sided with the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanters.html" title="Covenanters">Covenanters</a>. Early in the war, MacColla was forced to flee the Western Isles, which were attacked by a Covenanter/Campbell force. Colla, his father was taken prisoner by the Campbells. On the outbreak of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Rebellion_of_1641_8451.html" title="Irish Rebellion of 1641">Irish Rebellion of 1641</a>, MacColla found himself in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antrim%2C_County_Antrim_7b36.html" title="Antrim, County Antrim">Antrim</a>, under the command of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randal_MacDonnell%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Antrim_7375.html" title="Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim">Randal MacDonald</a>, the chief of the Irish MacDonalds. MacColla, who was a Catholic, quickly became involved in fighting the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> settlers there. He was implicated in some massacres of Protestant civilians, but also scored some notable military victories. However, he was defeated and wounded in an attempt to take <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisburn.html" title="Lisburn">Lisburn</a>. He was rescued by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manus_O%27Cahan%27s_Regiment_%28English_Civil_War%29_703a.html" title="Manus O'Cahan's Regiment (English Civil War)">Manus O'Cahan</a>, who served with him in most of his later Scottish campaigns. In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>, the Scottish <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanters.html" title="Covenanters">Covenanters</a> landed an army in <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a> and drove the Irish Catholic forces out of the province.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a>, he was selected by the Supreme Council of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_Ireland_a37b.html" title="Confederate Ireland">Confederate Ireland</a> to lead an expedition to Scotland to aid the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers.html" title="Cavaliers">Royalists</a> there against the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanters.html" title="Covenanters">Covenanters</a>. He was given a command of 1500-2000 men, mostly from Ulster. When in Scotland, MacColla linked up with the Royalist <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Graham%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose_052b.html" title="James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose">James Graham</a>, 1st Marquis of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montrose%2C_Angus_faba.html" title="Montrose, Angus">Montrose</a>. He was also able to raise men among his MacDonald clansmen and other anti-Campbell <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_clans.html" title="Scottish clans">Scottish clans</a>. In the subsequent <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Civil_War_2a8f.html" title="Scottish Civil War">Scottish Civil War</a>, MacColla and Montrose won a series of victories at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tippermuir_c98e.html" title="Battle of Tippermuir">Tippermuir</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Aberdeen_8224.html" title="Battle of Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Inverlochy_%281645%29_f5b6.html" title="Battle of Inverlochy (1645)">Inverlochy</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Auldearn_8e65.html" title="Battle of Auldearn">Auldearn</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Alford_0ccf.html" title="Battle of Alford">Alford</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kilsyth_8c08.html" title="Battle of Kilsyth">Kilsyth</a>. MacColla also took the opportunity to pillage the Campbell lands, killing all the men he could find there. However, he and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Graham%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose_052b.html" title="James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose">Montrose</a> parted company because MacColla's priorities lay in the western <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Highlands_5738.html" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a>, whereas Montrose wanted to secure the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Lowlands_458d.html" title="Scottish Lowlands">Lowlands</a> and ultimately <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> for the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers.html" title="Cavaliers">Royalist</a> cause. As a result, both of them were defeated separately by the Covenanters in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a>.</p>
<p>MacColla has been credited with inventing the tactic of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_charge.html" title="Highland charge">Highland charge</a> in the Civil Wars - where his men ran at enemy infantry, fired a volley at close range and then closed hand to hand. This proved remarkably effective in both Ireland and Scotland, due to the musket's slow reloading time and the poor discipline and training of many of the troops MacColla's men faced.</p>
<p>MacColla's men committed a series of atrocities against the civilians of clan Campbell. During his two periods in occupation of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll.html" title="Argyll">Argyle</a>, the Campbell territory (1645 and 1647), MacColla had all men of military age killed, whether they were in arms or not. On one infamous occasion, MacColla had a whole barn full of Campbells (including women and children) burned, in an incident known as the "Barn of Bones".</p>

<p>MacColla's father, who was a prisoner of the Campbells, was killed in retaliation for his son's atrocities in the Campbell country. MacColla himself retreated to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kintyre.html" title="Kintyre">Kintyre</a> and then to Ireland, where he re-joined the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_Ireland_a37b.html" title="Confederate Ireland">Irish Confederates</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>. His troops, (both Irish survivors of the <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a> expedition and Scottish Highlanders) were split up and assigned to the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> armies, with MacColla attached to the latter. MacColla's men were mostly killed in the Confederate defeats at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dungans_Hill_1cc6.html" title="Battle of Dungans Hill">battle of Dungans Hill</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meath.html" title="Meath">Meath</a> and then at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Knocknanauss_6ee4.html" title="Battle of Knocknanauss">battle of Knocknanauss</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">Cork</a>. Alasdair MacColla himself was killed by English Parliamentarian soldiers at Knocknanauss after he had been taken prisoner.</p>
<p>After his death, MacColla became a figure of minor folklore in Gaelic Ireland and Scotland. He is commemorated in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_b039.html" title="Scottish Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> poetry of <a href="../../../i/a/i/Iain_Lom_87cc.html" title="Iain Lom">Iain Lom</a> MacDonald and in Ireland by a piece of traditional music named <i>MacColla's March</i> or <i>Alasdair MacColla</i> that dates from the mid seventeenth century and is still performed, notably by the band <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clannad.html" title="Clannad">Clannad</a>.</p>
