<p>It happens quite often, so don't worry about it. In fact most people don't even check the featured article page first, so you're ahead of them! By the way, another place to look is the top of the talk page of an article, some (most/all?) have a message saying they're featured if that's the case. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabiform_a7bf.html" title="User:Fabiform">fabiform</a> | <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabiform_a651.html" title="User talk:Fabiform">talk</a> 16:19, 12 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! You asked why I don't do page title changes for the ATR articles. The reason is that I work only on pictures (about seven hundred articles illustrated so far) but sometimes, along the way, I spot a text error and correct it. I have no idea how to do a redirects or page title changes or anything like that, picture work takes up all my time on WP. Best Wishes, Adrian,<br />

<p>Hey there. Welcome to the welcoming comittee&#160;;-) I have two suggestions for your welcome message. First, while a lot of people like using msg:opentask, some (including me) think it's not that useful, and might suggest that we're assigning work. It's up to you whether you want to use it, of course. Also, I'd suggest a link to the <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Wikipedia:Tutorial</a>.

<p>Hi ALargeElk, and thanks for the welcome. Sorry for not doing the DSDM properly, I'd look for a move link but must have missed it. What can I do now? I can't do the move because my new page already exists. I'm guessing I need to get the new page deleted and then do the move properly. What do you think? Thanks, Simonbooth</p>

<p>ALargeElk, I like your attitude and approach here -- I've seen you comment several places, and I'd say you have exactly the outlook needed to remain sane at Wikipedia (....well, "remain at Wikipedia"....one has to doubt any of us are truly sane).&#160;:-) At any rate, I thought I'd say so since we're not good enough around here at actually telling each other when we see good things happening. I wonder if you'd mind me asking you three questions, and will type them in under the assumption you won't. 1) Forgive me, I took a brief vacation - have you been made an administrator yet? 2) Assuming the answer to 1 is "No", do you have any interest in becoming an administrator? 3) Assuming the answer to 2 is "Yes", would you object to my nominating you in two weeks, when you will have spent roughly 3 months here (by my count) and presumably have approx. 1000 edits, which are good round numbers people usually like to see when supporting a nomination? I don't want to force anyone into the role of admin, but I think you have the right perspective for it. If you're already an admin, I can simply apologize that I was not paying attention at the right time to support the nomination.

<dd>As someone who was made an admin with roughly 350 edits to my name and 8 weeks' experience (ah, the good old days), I think I'm less sensitive than I should be to the current climate.&#160;:-) I will respect your wishes and leave a nomination until at least the 1st of July -- good luck focusing on article production.&#160;:-) I find an easy way of doing so is to adopt a little list somewhere and flesh it out -- for example, the list of authors and titles at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_literature.html" title="Medieval literature">medieval literature</a> was quite red a while ago, and I've semi-consistently worked at writing articles for the red links when I have nothing else to do. I offer it as my only advice for how to keep aimed at writing articles -- without a list focusing me, I too often find myself back at RC, jumping on vandalism and getting irritated by edit wars.&#160;:-) Good luck, and expect a note from me that first week of July telling you I've nominated you -- <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 16:00, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Texture. I'm no fan of nonsense, but I wonder from the deletion log whether you've been a bit quick in one of your deletions. 29a seems to be a real group - see <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/symbian_virus/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/symbian_virus/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It's no big deal - I'm not going to bother listing it on votes for undeletion. I just wondered what your reason was for getting rid of it.

<p>Regards Ramsgate Flat Earth Soc. page: No problem with your vote for deletion, except that you should offer proof it is a fantasy construct. Although I have very many other possible subjects to offer wikipedia, I do not hold that it should exclude fantasy, given some content like Star trek articles I have noted.

<p>Thanks for that. Actually I am a long-term wikipedian using this sock puppet in a context where I don't want to get into a heated debate under my "real" name. I know this seems perhaps cowardly but it works for me and I hate it where disputes can boil up in to users following each other round in revert wars etc. Hence this - an attempt to help calmly with the article in question but with the option of it not connecting with my other work here.</p>

<p>Hi Elk.</p>

<p>Yes, "assemblymember(s)" is one word.

<dd>Someone has now separated the phrase into two words in the article, and on second inspection of its usage in the article, I actually agree with that.

<p>The full name of the Millenium Stadium is Millenium Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park. Since they're on the same site, sharing the common history and usage, both stadia might as well be covered in the same article. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 14:57, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello there! Believe me, I sympathize with you. I know the intoxicating, addictive, almost maddening power of wikiholism. You've got more sense that I have - there have been times when I should have asked for a block myself. Anyway, it's done now. I've blocked you till the 11th. If withdrawal symptoms start to drive you mad in the meantime, don't hesitate to e-mail me, and I'll unblock you:-) Cheers! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 11:16, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I respect your desire to stay away, I've unblocked you. Currently, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> does not allow users to be blocked in order to enforce wikiholidays. Nevertheless, if I can be of any assistance in your efforts at self-discipline, please let me know. One thing I might suggest is to ask someone if they would automatically revert any edits you make until the end of your wikiholiday. Perhaps knowing that your work will be undone might make the urge to edit easier to control. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:01, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I read your bit about the misquotation of Nelson's signal. I'm interested to know your reference for this. (I only ask because I read somewhere that Nelson's Column says "England expects every man will do his duty" - i.e. missing out "that", but otherwise correct.) --<a href="../../../a/u/x/User%7EAuximines_3f2b.html" title="User:Auximines">Auximines</a> 09:05, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>We applaud your war on spam, however, we spent time and resources developing the data recovery article and would appreciate the external link that you removed. The last thing we would like to see is Wikipedia being turned into a link building free-for-all. Unfortunately, many self-proclaimed spam fighters lose sight of the fact that many commercial websites ARE in fact relevant, especially those who offer further technical information, software etc. Would it be too much to ask for you to put the link back?

<p>I read your comment to me on my article on <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy_of_genres.html" title="Hierarchy of genres">hierarchy of genres</a>, thank you for the compliment. I hope you look at the other articles I've written and are planning to write at my <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianshapiro_f1dc.html" title="User:Brianshapiro">user page</a>; all of the ones that I list and have completed were either completely or almost completely done by me. I did all of the ones I finished around the same time, and planned to work hard to add more on my list but I got sidetracked; I think I'll return to writing articles soon though. I'm having problems writing right now, so if you find any of the writing style too clumsy feel free to edit. I'm also planning work on a site of my own, which intended to cover all of cultural history and have pictures of artwork, mp3s of music, texts of literature and philosophy; I also plan to present the eras in history very completely so that people can see the atmosphere of the times. I want to do this, because even though I like Wikipedia, I think its too unstructured: a lot of articles are written by people who have different agendas, and there is no focus or presentation of the different topics, or clarity to their importance in history or in the subject. I also get annoyed by the number of articles where people are promoting their pet ideology, or those that become confused battlegrounds between people with different views, without any perspective to which one has a better understanding. I haven't planned anything besides making the site all myself, but I think it might be neat if I could create something like a wiki but which had editorial direction so wasn't as freeform as Wikipedia is. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianshapiro_f1dc.html" title="User:Brianshapiro">brianshapiro</a> 21:53, 2004 Aug 11</p>
