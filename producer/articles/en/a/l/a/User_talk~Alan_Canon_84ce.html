<p>Very nice. I think you've about covered it as neutrally as can be done. As I said on the talk page, even Mohler publicly admits he's controversial. The addition of the supporting view to counter the "Taliban" comment was very good. I don't think it's going to get better unless someone who's more familiar with him than the two of us comes along and starts working on it. =) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 20:49, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alan, It's been great working with you on these articles. It refreshes me and reminds me I'm not alone when I see other people like yourself out there who are devoted to making wikipedia better. Don't let the Pope Lick Monster get you when you're down there poking around, we need you on wikipedia!</p>

<p>Keep up the excellent editing. One thing you might want to consider is including <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">footnotes</a> which are becoming more and more of an important part of really high-quality articles on Wikipedia. There isn't consensus right now on how to footnote (there are a number of examples listed on Wikipedia policy page), but a good set of footnotes is vital if you want to take the article to <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article status</a>. Consider filing a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_Review_9c12.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer Review">peer review request</a> too to get more ideas for how to improve the article. After you do that, apply for featured article status and, if successful, you'll see your work featured on the front page of Wikipedia! Best of luck, --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 18:57, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The footnotes styles on Wikipedia do suffer from a lack of consistency, but I'm sure an editor as good as yourself will find a style that works for the article.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">size restrictions</a> on Wikipedia are more of guidelines rather than policy. I could see, though, a number of decent <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">spinout articles</a> that could be made with respect to your article. If you decide to do something like Geology of Mammoth Cave or History of Mammoth Cave you can use the {{main|spinout article name}} template under the appropriate section and "offload" some of the content to new articles while keeping a brief summary of the content in the major article. Doing this for articles that may be interesting in their own right (for example, there may be people interested in the geology but not the history or park management or other subjects included in the main article) is often the best way to go to avoid people nominating your articles for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, it dawns on me that you could even have two different articles one for the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammoth_Cave_0418.html" title="Mammoth Cave">Mammoth Cave</a> system itself and another one for the National Park. They are two different subjects after all. To create a new article from the redirect above, just click on the small link at the top of the page and you'll go to the redirect page which you can edit with new content. Let me know if that sounds appealing to you and you have problems doing it.</dd>

<p>A tag has been placed on the article <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patty_Jo_Watson_e528.html" title="Patty Jo Watson">Patty Jo Watson</a>, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be a biographical account about a person, group of people, or band, but it does not indicate how or why he/she/they is/are notable. If you can indicate why Patty Jo Watson is really notable, I advise you to edit the article promptly, and also put a note on <a href="../../../p/a/t/Talk%7EPatty_Jo_Watson_b751.html" title="Talk:Patty Jo Watson">Talk:Patty Jo Watson</a>.

<p>Taking this to your Talk page to reduce clutter on AID page. You mentioned attention to the Church of Christ in the media...I wonder if it's the murder in <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selmer%2C_Tennessee_8625.html" title="Selmer, Tennessee">Selmer, Tennessee</a>, and then <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusty_Yates_3e36.html" title="Rusty Yates">Rusty Yates</a> (a mass-media celebrity because of the murders of his children by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Yates_45e3.html" title="Andrea Yates">Andrea Yates</a>) has remarried within the Church of Christ. Creepy, but perhaps those were impetus to several to edit. I did a lot of editing today and yesterday, but it was all mostly cleanup of what people had put before: there were so few, gigantic, sections that there was no way to get a handle on things. I like the idea that the article is sitting in "neutral" territory (i.e. in a secular encyclopedia) so that here maybe of all places, the different factions can come together and each contribute something of what they know of the Churches of Christ, subject to the WikiPedia editorial policies to resolve disputes and so forth (hey the big problem with the Churches of Christ is they can't agree on the ground rules of debate, so why not the wiki policy?) I also think that makes the article a good candidate for the Article Improvement Drive. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Canon_985a.html" title="User:Alan Canon">Alan Canon</a> 22:23, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I did mean the murder, but I know next to nothing about the details of that event, so I didn't want to be too specific. I am aware that it is in the media now, and thought maybe that's why the article was getting so much attention. It's come a long way in the last week though and I just thought maybe we could get it up to featured article status :D - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font style="color:#137300;"><b>cohesion</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font style="color:#f98c0d;"><b>t</b></font></a></sup> 22:27, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>to the B. C. Goodpasture and Marshall Keeble articles. I only heard Keeble once, as a child, but have been aware of his influences in the C of C and beyond for a long time. In fact, my parents were quite close to Willie and Maxine Cato. Willie, as you may know, was for several years one of Keeble's "handlers", as I called them with no intended disrespect, who served as his liasons to white congregations. I have long felt that Keeble deserved an article and am glad that you started one and hope that I have helped it slightly. As for Goodpasture, I was once admitted to the school bearing his name, but wound up not attending because of the distance from my then-home to Madison. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 15:26, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your gracious comments. You might be interested that I was a fairly "big time" caver myself many years ago in my pre-married days, and am still a life member of NSS, but don't do much with it. (Never enjoyed vertical/"technical"-type work, which was the rage in the 70s.

<p>Greetings. I've been dropping a line to all Louisville residents I can find to ask them to consider joining the new <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Louisville_8be2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Louisville">WikiProject Louisville</a>. It has been determined there is a *lot* of work to do yet remaining for Louisville-related subjects, and therefore we would definitely appreciate your presence. If by chance you are unable to join us, that's all right, but if you can, please tell other Louisvillians about this worthy project.

<p>Most of my caving was in the 1970's (when I was young &amp; single!). I was the first one into one passage at Cumberland Caverns on a mapping trip with John Smyre and the Sullivan brothers (one of whom, Mike is now a Knoxville policeman and National Guard officer fairly recently back from Iraq; what became of Pat I don't know, last I heard he was in Ireland). I used to go to NSS events back then &amp; am a lifetime member but haven't done anything in years other than VERY occassionally read the magazine. I'm still interested; my wife will tell you that my "ideal" vacation still involves seeing a commerical cave at some point during the trip, but I've never really succeeded in getting her interested in taking it beyond that. When I was at TVA for a little while in the late 1970's I was involved in searching for "cavities" in the rims of Tellico and the Raccoon Mtn. Pumped Storage; it was like getting paid to go caving and cave hunting (respectively). If you want more specifics (i.e., pre-development England Cove) I can share more.

<dd>To make the dialog easier, I have posted a reply to your last immediately below your latest reply on my own discussion page, which makes it a little easier to go back-and-forth and also, I suppose, for others to follow the conversation, if there are any which really care to do so.

<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
