<p>"The seven basic plots in story-telling" is a hypothesis by Christopher Booker, but I don't think it can be used as fact in this article.

<dd>I saw the same thing (this is all in the "Meaning" section) and just edited out the "7 basic plots" reference, leaving in the basic "rags to riches" observation although I'm not sure I buy it. I then came here to point out that the entire subsequent paragraph is all based on Booker's evaluation. Really that whole section needs to be redone: "Meaning" is too vague for a section--scholarly interpretations might be better. The material currently there is just a Jungian interpretation based, it appears, largely on Booker's Jungian literary criticism. -- <a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">LQ</a> 15:17, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it does. The reason that it sounds so much like the movie is that it's lacking in detail, so it doesn't mention some of the key parts of the story that weren't in the movie; like Aladdin's mother, and the second genie.

<dd>The story in multiple sources says that Alladin had a Genie of the Ring, it was the one to free him from the Cave, not the Genie of the Lamp. Alladin discovered the Genie of the Lamp when he stole it home and shined it up by rubbing it.

<p>Umm, "genii"? that's the plural of genius, not Genie.. which is anglicized form of djinn...</p>
<p>A Djinn/Genie (pronounced 'Jinn') is a creature that was (and still is) believed to exist (both on earth and in this universe) by people (in the past and also now) mainly in asia. Their powers are greater than humans but their interaction with this planet and humans is very limited. The woman (who created the 1001nights Tales) needed a creature with greater powers than normal humans and that was propably why she chose the Djinn (known and rumoured to exist when she told the tale - so very convenient for the story).(Anonymous)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Question, then. Why does the second section of the article refer to them as "genies." Since the previous section referred to them as the ring djinn and the lamp djinn, the subsequent sections, should use the original plural, "djinni", not "genies." 72.91.42.26 10:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, It is set in China. There is an error here "...Aladdin keeps the lamp for himself, and discovers that it contains two evil genii that are bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp." only one Djinni is evil &amp; "of the lamp", the other is "a servent of Solomon" &amp; is "of the Ring".

<p>If Aladdin is from the 'Far East' and (china did not exist then), it does not mean that you should give him the nationality of a 'Far East' country that currently exists. The fact that the main characters have arabic names (except for the jew) and the lifestyle described in the story is arabian in style, shows that this story was set in an arabic country (and so could not have been set in china). An arab living in china, does not solve this error in your argument. Stating 'Far East' does not create a argument for china. China did not exist then, and so the word (itself) would not have existed. The essence of your argument is: alladin lived in the far east, and the far east now is china. If we use your argument, then if china changes it's name, Aladdin's nationality changes too. this is wrong when transtating stories (and is the cause of many stories being lost/changed in time), the actor's should be given the nationality of the country that once existed (and should not be updated with new country names that now exist). If china changed it's name to another word now, Alladin's nationality would not change, because he does not exist now. If you are insisting on 'Far east', find out the name of the country that existed in the far east (and this will not be the word 'China') and give him, that nationality (at least then, your argument will be consistent).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;Read the article. The Arabs knew about China and called it the far east. Even the Romans and Greeks knew about China, calling it "Seres." There are many famous Muslims in China, such as Zheng He. The original story had Aladdain taking place in China, but of course, we can always count on the Disney to deviate from the original plot. -intranetusa</p>

<p>The Article is incorrect by saying Alladin lives in china.</p>
<p>Aladdin is arabic (and from baghdad) but modern society have decided to change him to chinese (because of all the stigma against Asia (and more specifically the middle east). If you dont believe me, find a 1001 Nights book and read it (make sure it is not a 'Modernised' book with changes made to all the stories. In it you will find (in different stories) characters from different regions of the world (that were known then) and you will see that Alladin is Arabic. (Anonymous)</p>

<dd>This is ignorant of the documented history of the story, as it appears in the Western collewction, called <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>. Many simple readers cannot tell the difference between the <i>setting</i> of a tale and its cultural origin. I shall revert the anonymous deletions. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 16:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Wetman's argument, the story's setting is the 'Far east'. If Wetman is correct about 'Far east' then aladdin's nationality is not updated to the nationality of a far eastern country that now exists. I will clarify my point with this example, If aladdin is Babylonian, it is incorrect of a modern transtator to change this to the current name of Babylon (e.g. Iraq) because Babylon no longer exists and Iraq does. In the same way, it is incorrect of Wetman (and may other writers) to change aladdin's nationality to chineese (because china now exists and the far eastern country did not and its name was unknown)!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, wasn't china referred to as "cathay" or something back then?</dd>
</dl>
<p>As written by someone in the main document: "For a narrator unaware of the existence of America, Aladdin's land would represent "the Utter East" while the sorcerer's homeland of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> represented "the Utter West" (the name "Morocco" is itself a corruption of the Arabic for "West", and the story introduces the sorcerer as "a westerner"). " States he is a westener. With Al-Maghrib (morocco) being the utter/far west. When translating a story, you do not change a character's nationality to a more western country that now exists (e.g. America). You keep the nationalities as they were written. If you change the story's location to suit the current world (as you have done by setting the story in China) then Aladdin should be an arab living in Russia (since russia is the 'far-east' and further to the east than China) and the sorcerer should be a Jew living in America (since America is more to the west than Morocco). The story should be kept as it was written (which is an Arab living in the East) and not by adding modern country names as suits the translator.</p>

Also, I used this as a trivia question at the coffee shop where I work and not one person got it right and numerous people argued with me about it.</p>

<p>The article's current version ( as of 25 Dec 15:30 GMT)contains an etymological error, asserting Morocco, the English rendering of the North African country's name, is a deformation of "al Maghrib (al Aqsaa)." It is not. It is a deformation of Marrakech, via Spanish or perhaps Italian, Marrakech the city name being applied to the counfsdfasftry for a period when two of the ruling dynasties were largely based there.

<p>Morrocco is the english word for the country and not the word used in the arabic tale (which is Al-Maghreb). Though the english word may orriginate from spanish/italian, the tale is arabic and it is the arabic word (Al-Maghreb) that is used in the original tale. The above stated error (and request for a change) is invalid.</p>
