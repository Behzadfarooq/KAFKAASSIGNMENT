<p>Alah is not english either. Those accents you're using aren't accepted by anyone for Syriac. English doesn't use accent marks. Especially American English.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a></p>

<dd>I didn't say <i>Allah</i> is English, I said <i>Alāhā</i> is not current in the English language, whereas <i>Allah</i> is. And the accents used for differentiating between short and long <i>a</i> are common. Check Nöldeke Syriac grammar or Robinson's Syriac textbook, for example. (Payne Smith uses â for long a.) And the macron (ā) is the standard for indicating long vowels. ----<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 17:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If I write French or German, I use the appropriate diacritics, so the fact that English uses virtually no diacritics makes no difference: the orthography of the language itself is what's important. Of course, ܐܠܗܐ is written in the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_alphabet.html" title="Syriac alphabet">Syriac alphabet</a> rather than the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_alphabet.html" title="Roman alphabet">Roman alphabet</a>. However, it is useful to readers to be able to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterate</a> Syriac words into the Roman alphabet. There is no standard of transliteration for Syriac, but we should use a system that makes sense. Unfortunately, there are two different pronunciation of Classical Syriac — East and West. In West Syriac, the word ܐܠܗܐ is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/alɔhɔ/</span>. In the West Syriac vowel system, the first vowel is called <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">pṯoḥo</span> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/pθɔħɔ/</span>; modern pronunciation <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ftoḥo</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ftɔħɔ/</span>), and it is considered to be an a-vowel (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/a/</span>). The second and third vowels are each <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">zqofo</span> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/zqɔfɔ/</span>), which is considered to be an o-vowel (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɔ/</span>). In the East Syriac vowel system, ܐܠܗܐ is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/alɑhɑ/</span>, and the vowels have similar names pronounced differently. The first vowel of ܐܠܗܐ is <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">pṯaḥa</span> or <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ptaḥa</span> (variously pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/pθɑxɑ/ or /ptɑxɑ/</span>), and second is <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">zqapa</span> (variously pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/zqɑpɑ/ or /zqɑwɑ/</span>). Although classical East Syriac pronunciation and a number of dialects distinguish these two a-vowels (as shown here), many dialects do not distinguish between them. Therefore, the same word, ܐܠܗܐ, is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/alɔhɔ/</span> in the West Syriac variety and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/alɑhɑ/</span> in the East Syriac variety. We need to consider ways to transliterate ܐܠܗܐ. A transliteration based on the West Syriac system would simply be <i>Aloho</i>. Most people who use the East Syriac system would probably write <i>Alaha</i> for simplicity's sake, but many would appreciate that this does not do justice to the difference between <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ptaḥa</span> and <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">zqapa</span>. In scholarly publications, it is important to use a transliteration scheme that distinguishes between these two vowels, and so the letter <i>a</i> is used for the letter <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">pṯoḥo/pṯaḥa</span>, and, variously, <i>ā</i>, <i>â</i> or <i>å</i> are used for <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">zqofo/zqapa</span>. Therefore, spelling ܐܠܗܐ as <i>Alaha</i> makes no sense to those who use the West Syriac system, and it oversimplifies the East Syriac system. Marking the vowel <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">zqāpā</span> with a diacritic is the usual way to avoid these problems. Is this clear. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 22:00, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Benne, you might be working off some dictionary, however I am not. I am working off my native <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araden.html" title="Araden">Araden</a> dialect which is a cross between Assyrian and Chaldean Neo-Aramaic. We say Ah-la'-ha' for that and not Aloho, Plus Garzo, there are many more speakers of Eastern Neo-Aramaic than Western so I don't understand why you and others use Western as the benchmark. That sounds closer to Hebrew than our Aramaic.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a></p>
<p>Another thing Garzo, in most Assyrian-Aramaic dialects ħeθ becomes xeθ or xet and sometimes just heθ or het. In "Soureth de Tel Keppeh" they prounounce the short e and short i as one letter as in the French "e" and their dialect is HEAVILY influenced by Arabic, sometimes they just convert Arabic words into Aramaic as in Bisl becoming Bisla or Riz becoming Riza, etc. And almost all instances of oh as in the vowel form of waw becomes oo or ou. Dialects vary greatly in pronunciation of vowel sounds. In Iran specifically waw becomes vav and there is no ħeθ just xet.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sargonious, if you only know one dialect, then you cannot comprehend that different dialects pronounce this differently. Classical Syriac, not Araden dialect, is the important stage of the language for this topic. You seem to be trying to teach me something I've known for years: the e/i merger in Eastern Aramaic varieties has a very long history, and all East Syriac varieties merge the sounds of kheth and soft kap. You obviously do not understand Classical Syriac, which, as the standard language of religion, is the important one. I've tried to tell you about the vowels in Classical Syriac, and how most scholarly publications use a varient of the eastern scheme. I am not using the western scheme as a benchmark — that would be the spelling <i>Aloho</i> — the more scholarly transliteration uses three a-vowels, the final two marked with diacritics. Why? Because <b>everyone</b> agrees that they are different vowels. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know multiple dialects from the Alqosh, Araden, Zakho, Tel Keppeh, Bebit, Atur, and several other ones. None of them speak classical Syriac. Even in the Litrugy which is almost incomprehensible to speakers of modern Aramaic it doesn't sound like Western Syriac. I understand what you're saying and the points you're making it's just that no one in Iraq, where the largest population of Aramaic speakers exists in the world speak like that.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a></dd>

<dd>Ask someone who can read and write Classical Syriac or literary Neo-Aramaic how many vowels there are in the language. The answer is Pthakha (short a), Zqapa (long a), Zlami zogi/pshuqi (i/e mixture), <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">Khwaṣa</span> (i), <span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">Rwaṣa</span> (u) and Rwakha (o). I've given you this list with the East Syriac names so that you can understand it. You see that there are two a-vowels. The Pthakha is written as two dots, one above and one below the letter. The Zqapa is written as two dots above the letter. In <i>Alaha</i>, although in many dialects the three vowels are pronounced the same, the first vowel is Pthakha and the other two are Zqapa. This might not mean much to you if your dialect does not differentiate between them (I known that Alqoshi and Zakho do differentiate). Many dialects especially Urmežnaya and Iraqi Koine change Pthakha to Zqapa regularly. Remember that in written Syriac, the two vowels are written differently. Therefore, is it such a strange thing to transliterate them into English differently. Now, why I have mentioned West Syriac before is not because I am telling you to follow the West Syriac way (my points above are from East Syriac), but because West Syriacs make a big distinction between these two vowels. That's why they say <i>Aloho</i>. As Wikipedia uses redirects, we could have redirects on both <i>Alaha</i> and <i>Aloho</i> leading to the article at <i>Alāhā</i>, <i>Alāhâ</i> or <i>Alåhå</i> (I would favour the first or second of these). People speaking any dialect can understand what these transliterations mean, and they are reflective of the Syriac, which marks two different types of vowel in this word, not one vowel repeated three times. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:05, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find that to be incredible that you know all those. I do remember those names in Syriac class when I was taught the alphabet. I don't remember the rules by name but I can go by what they look like. Two dots diagonally above are long a. One above and one below are short a. Two diagonally down are long e. Two dots down parallel are short i. A dot under yod makes it a long i. Waw with a dot above is oh and a dot below is ou. Two dots above paralel mark plurals. Then come the dots for changing letters like peh to pheh, kap to khap, or chap, etc. I know the equivelent Hebrew letters and how to write them but don't know the vowel markers at all. I'm learning the Arabic alphabet off some program I downloaded and it seems to be simple so far. I don't know the connecting rules that well but I'm getting there. Maybe in the future after I finish with my business admin degree I can start on History and Linguistics, that would be nice.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a></dd>

<p>It seems to me that this article suggests several ideas not warranted by a neutral discussion of the entomology of the word. It is true enough, if I am to take your word, that scholars have suggested a relationship between Iah the Egyptian moon god and Yah.
