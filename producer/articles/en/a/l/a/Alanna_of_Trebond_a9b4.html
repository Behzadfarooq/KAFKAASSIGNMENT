<p>In <i>Alanna: The First Adventure</i>, Alanna wants to become the first female <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a> in the realm of Tortall in over 100 years. Alanna disguises herself as a boy and trades places with her twin brother Thom - she was originally meant to be sent to a northern convent and Thom to become a knight, but she takes his place at the palace and he journeys north to become a sorcerer. Alanna is able to undertake the training required to be a page in the palace under the disguise of "Alan" and befriends several other knights-in-training at the palace, including the Crown Prince Jonathan and his friends, while trying to keep her gender secret, with only her manservant Coram, The King of Thieves <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cooper_%28Tortallan_character%29_0be8.html" title="George Cooper (Tortallan character)">George Cooper</a> and his mother Elenie aware of her true identity. She travels with her squire friends to the Bazhir city of Persopolis, where she and Jonathan go to the Black City to fight the Yandsir, also known as the Namless Ones. It is during their fight with the Yandsir that Jonathan learns that squire "Alan" is really a girl.</p>
<p>In the second book, <i>In the Hand of the Goddess</i> Alanna becomes romantically and sexually involved with Prince Jonathan, her knight-master during her time as squire; she is also romantically pursued by George. She distinguishes herself in battle, and passes the tests for knighthood, finally winning her shield. Alanna then discovers a plot by King's nephew Roger against the Royal Family. When she exposes, Roger, they fight a duel in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial_by_combat.html" title="Trial by combat">trial by combat</a>, during which Alanna's gender is finally revealed. Alanna defeats Roger in combat and kills him.</p>
<p>After defeating and killing Roger in a duel, Alanna decides to leave the Court, and her further adventures appear in <i>The Woman Who Rides Like a Man</i>. Alanna returns to the Bazhir desert. She becames a member of a tribe who dwells there and unknowingly becomes the tribe <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaman.html" title="Shaman">shaman</a> (though she is later replaced by two of her students). She also ends her romantic relationship with Jonathan after he proposes, though they stay friends, and instead she turns to George Cooper.</p>
<p>In <i>Lioness Rampant</i>, Alanna sets out on a quest to retrieve the Dominion Jewel in the far-off land of Sarain. In her absence she has an affair with a Shang warrior, Liam Ironarm, and picks up many friends, among them the princess Thayet (who eventually weds Prince Jonathan). Upon arriving back home, she finds that her proud brother Thom had resurrected her enemy Roger; she also discovers that the King and Queen have both died, leaving Jonathan as King of Tortall. Soon after, Roger regains his magic and she is once again forced to kill him amidst a bloody coup, in which Liam, Thom, and Alanna's supernatural cat Faithful are killed. At the end of the final installment in the quartet, she is betrothed to George Cooper.</p>
<p>Alanna appears in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Immortals_series_0c39.html" title="The Immortals series">The Immortals</a></i> , in the <i><a href="../../../p/r/o/Protector_of_the_Small_27c5.html" title="Protector of the Small">Protector of the Small</a></i> and again briefly in the <i><a href="../../../d/a/u/Daughter_of_the_Lioness_0d72.html" title="Daughter of the Lioness">Daughter of the Lioness</a></i> books, which feature her daughter Alianne. During <i>The Immortals</i>, she befriends <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veralidaine_Sarrasri_a3d2.html" title="Veralidaine Sarrasri">Veralidaine Sarrasri</a> (Daine) upon the latter's arrival in Tortall and supports her through her various adventures. In the <i>Protector of the Small</i> quartet, which features a young woman trying for her knighthood, Alanna wishes to take this young Keladry of Mindelan under her wing, but is expressly forbidden by the king and the training master as this would result in the rumours that Alanna had bewitched the girl to succeed. Instead, she acts as an unknown benefactor, sending anonymous gifts that help Keladry as a knight-in-training. It is also thought that she asks Sir Raoul of Goldenlake, a longtime friend, to take her on as his squire, but in truth Raoul accepted Keladry of his own accord; Alanna takes on Kel's best friend Nealan of Queenscove as squire instead.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Knight_6cf9.html" title="Lady Knight">Lady Knight</a></i> Alanna, as King's Champion and the Lioness, becomes a commander of the army during the Scanran War with King Maggur. She is stationed at Frasrlund, on the Vassa River, a prominent port in Northern Tortall. She later moves to Fort Mastiff, where she learns that her daughter, Alianne, has been found by her husband as part of the plot in <i><a href="../../../t/r/i/Trickster%27s_Choice_eb8b.html" title="Trickster's Choice">Trickster's Choice</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanna_of_Trebond_a9b4.html" title="Edit section: Children">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Children</span></h2>
<p>Alanna has three children: The eldest Thom is named after her brother; he later studies magic at the Royal University and is considered a serious student. He is also said to have a 'knack' with children, and is sought after for babysitting by his fellow students at the university.</p>
<p>She also has a pair of twins, Alan &amp; Alianne, aka Aly. The former is named after Alanna's biological father, Alan of Trebond. This is also the name she assumed while training as a page in the palace. Alan is currently training to be a knight at the Royal Palace in Corus, although he is considerably older than his peers. Alanna's daughter Alianne has her own series, the <i><a href="../../../d/a/u/Daughter_of_the_Lioness_0d72.html" title="Daughter of the Lioness">Daughter of the Lioness</a></i> duology, AKA "The Trickster Series". These two books chronicle Aly's travels in the Copper Isles.</p>
